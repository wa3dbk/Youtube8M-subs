00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.710
 I greet you on the smart geek channel 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.580
 today we are with you a little bit 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 experiment, I came here such 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 package from online store tinydeal and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 it cost again dollars 23 cents as 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.539
 indicated on the package let's open it up and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 let's see what there is interesting and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.410
 there are 2 fingers of the battery 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.920
 aa format 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.350
 but the batteries are saline and non-alkaline 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 absolutely unusual these batteries 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.260
 work on the water they are made by the firm 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.660
 aqua cell and their marketing slogan 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.270
 It sounds like a well-known 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.640
 never invite just add water 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.969
 they are packed in such a cellophane 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 a bag on it immediately applied visual 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.870
 instructions for use first need 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.129
 unscrew cap lower container 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:12.720
 water for 5-10 minutes you can wipe it 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:20.939
 enjoy inside apparently more 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:27.530
 detailed instruction here 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.090
 English French German Japanese 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.400
 Portuguese 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.829
 Chinese Spanish Swedish unfortunately 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.110
 there is no Russian well, okay, and so everything 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.479
 understandable by the way aqua cell will 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.970
 officially export your product 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.090
 most western european countries 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.439
 batteries are completely traditional 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 kind of aa format except the back 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.040
 elements have such recesses 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.920
 for loosening 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.719
 let's unpack unscrew the caps and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.719
 try to activate 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:31.950
 take the glass and put the glass with the usual 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:35.549
 tap water but for now batteries 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.069
 Our swim want say that they have 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.530
 standard voltage and a half volts 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.480
 they can be used just like 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.030
 ordinary batteries 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.879
 they differ from the target and alkaline 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.859
 elements of their environmentally friendly 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.780
 well at least as assures 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.510
 the manufacturer is not used here 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.849
 harmful substances can be disposed of 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.579
 with ordinary household waste 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.419
 as it is known 1 salt battery can 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:06.030
 poison up to 400 liters of water but in this 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.989
 batteries as an anode carbon 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.719
 rod as a negative pole 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.719
 zinc casing well and the place is very 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.209
 poisonous electrolyte plain water 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:21.229
 by the way any liquid will suit 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.540
 even saliva without fluid shelf life 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:27.329
 absolutely unlimited want to say that 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
 aqua cell is far from pioneering production 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.180
 similar batteries 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.340
 the Japanese eight years ago tried 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.299
 promote similar products but they 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.000
 were worth 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.150
 quite expensive I don't know send them 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.439
 business or not but something has not been long 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.750
 I heard about them in the meantime 10 minutes 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.919
 have passed you can already extract our 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.680
 batteries 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.489
 only left to wipe it up 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.489
 caps 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:38.490
 and apparently the batteries work because 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:40.530
 that the voltmeter showed voltage exactly 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.560
 same as ordinary elements 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.229
 I decided to make a real hard 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.810
 test for batteries to test how much they 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.750
 hold on for the test I 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.090
 borrowed from the daughter of this beast but to 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.000
 Unfortunately the test failed ours to 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.990
 the battery was not pulled at all pink 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.210
 the beast here is the clock coming so that such 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.960
 the batteries are only intended 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.879
 for instruments with very low loads 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.889
 as an alternative to salt 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:14.610
 batteries for some remote or 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.789
 hours they will be just right and maybe they 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.669
 will work and no less than those 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.969
 salt batteries but of course the purchase 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.370
 such items for five dollars 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:29.159
 not economically feasible unless 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.039
 you do not care about the topic of environmental friendliness all 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:34.529
 affairs and in the end I will ask you to express your 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.810
 opinion about this video if it 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:39.479
 did you like please put 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.139
 Like and of course subscribe to 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.139
