just<00:05:13.050> saying<00:05:13.410> and<00:05:13.530> then<00:05:13.620> researching<00:05:14.280> let<00:05:14.430> me

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
just saying and then researching let me

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.250

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
know y'all want me to research next i'm

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.409 
know y'all want me to research next i'm
thinking<00:05:16.830> maybe<00:05:17.010> giants<00:05:17.760> because<00:05:18.090> they<00:05:18.240> get<00:05:18.360> a

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
thinking maybe giants because they get a

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.930 
thinking maybe giants because they get a
big<00:05:18.750> boost<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.410> 12<00:05:19.830> damage<00:05:20.280> per<00:05:20.460> second<00:05:20.850> and

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
big boost of 12 damage per second and

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.600 
big boost of 12 damage per second and
270<00:05:21.810> more<00:05:21.990> health<00:05:22.200> so<00:05:22.470> that's<00:05:23.039> big<00:05:23.370> it's

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
270 more health so that's big it's

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.550 
270 more health so that's big it's
almost<00:05:23.820> doubling<00:05:24.419> or<00:05:24.630> song<00:05:24.840> as<00:05:24.960> adding<00:05:25.289> fifty

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
almost doubling or song as adding fifty

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.550 
almost doubling or song as adding fifty
percent<00:05:25.949> of<00:05:26.190> their<00:05:26.760> current<00:05:27.570> damage<00:05:27.990> on<00:05:28.229> to<00:05:28.470> it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
percent of their current damage on to it

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.529 
percent of their current damage on to it
