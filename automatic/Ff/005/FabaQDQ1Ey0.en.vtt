ago I didn't know what to think about it
I'm<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.440> little<00:00:14.190> worried<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.790> wish<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.299> seen

I'm a little worried I wish I have seen
a<00:00:15.540> review<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.890> turns<00:00:17.100> out<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.430> not

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
a review on it but it turns out is not

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.970 
a review on it but it turns out is not
that<00:00:17.850> heavy<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:19.369> about<00:00:20.369> 24<00:00:21.240> ounces<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.199> it's

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
that heavy it's about 24 ounces so it's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.650 
that heavy it's about 24 ounces so it's
just<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.310> little<00:00:23.430> bit<00:00:23.580> heavier<00:00:23.880> than<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> 18<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
just a little bit heavier than the 18 to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.650 
just a little bit heavier than the 18 to
55<00:00:25.160> one<00:00:26.160> thing<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.519> wanted<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.390> it

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
55 one thing I wanted to know about it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.830 
55 one thing I wanted to know about it
was<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:28.050> fast<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.519> slower

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
was how fast this is a little bit slower

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.170 
was how fast this is a little bit slower
it<00:00:30.840> does<00:00:31.050> take<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> little<00:00:31.500> while<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.219> focus<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
it does take a little while to focus and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
it does take a little while to focus and
compare<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> 18<00:00:35.070> 55<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:36.500> another<00:00:37.500> lens<00:00:38.430> i

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
compare them to 18 55 or another lens i

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.100 
compare them to 18 55 or another lens i
have<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.360> i'll<00:00:39.540> go<00:00:39.719> ahead<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.870> show<00:00:39.960> that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
have which i'll go ahead and show that

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.700 
have which i'll go ahead and show that
students<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.120> contrary<00:00:42.899> it's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
students are here it's a contrary it's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.209 
students are here it's a contrary it's
them<00:00:43.980> also<00:00:44.280> an<00:00:44.550> operon<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.620> well<00:00:46.620> Tamra<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> I

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
them also an operon and well Tamra and I

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.830 
them also an operon and well Tamra and I
guess<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.879> considered<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.420> operon

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
guess that's not considered an operon

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.650 
guess that's not considered an operon
this<00:00:49.800> one<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> 72<00:00:51.120> 300<00:00:51.690> millimeter<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:53.660> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this one is 72 300 millimeter and this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
this one is 72 300 millimeter and this
one<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.989> pretty<00:00:55.199> amazing<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.860> me<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
one is pretty amazing for me because I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.170 
one is pretty amazing for me because I
do<00:00:56.370> portraiture<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> nature

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849 
do portraiture and I like to nature
shots<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.590> slower

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
shots that's just a little bit slower

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
shots that's just a little bit slower
the<00:01:02.190> birdshot<00:01:02.609> might<00:01:03.180> work<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.719> might

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the birdshot might work out and it might

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.080 
the birdshot might work out and it might
not<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.350> kind<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.010> sex<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.580> that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.820 
that's sort of thing that you do I
wouldn't<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> purpose<00:01:10.260> but

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
wouldn't get it for that purpose but

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.800 
wouldn't get it for that purpose but
that<00:01:11.790> doesn't<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> camera<00:01:12.659> much

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that doesn't make the camera much

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.010 
that doesn't make the camera much
heavier<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:14.180> especially<00:01:15.180> compared<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> some

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
heavier and especially compared to some

heavier and especially compared to some
of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> white<00:01:16.380> ones<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.340> are<00:01:17.490> care<00:01:17.700> glass

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
of the white ones that are care glass

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.260 
of the white ones that are care glass
this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.390> obviously<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.530> glass<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.280> for

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
this is obviously not glass this is for

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.469 
this is obviously not glass this is for

um I want to say this is for novice I
would<00:01:24.600> say<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.470> an<00:01:25.770> amateur<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
would say this is more for an amateur to

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.670 
would say this is more for an amateur to
professional<00:01:27.990> overall<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.230> great<00:01:29.260> lens

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
professional overall it's a great lens

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.080 
professional overall it's a great lens
not<00:01:30.130> very<00:01:30.340> fast<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:30.880> automatic<00:01:31.570> focus<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:33.090> as

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
not very fast is automatic focus it's as

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.480 
not very fast is automatic focus it's as
a<00:01:34.150> 5.3<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:35.020> 6.3<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.850> says<00:01:37.530> macro<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:38.860> it

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
a 5.3 to 6.3 it says macro but it

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.030 
a 5.3 to 6.3 it says macro but it
doesn't<00:01:39.910> have<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.480> macro<00:01:40.900> setting<00:01:41.320> on<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.680> so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
doesn't have a macro setting on it so

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.490 
doesn't have a macro setting on it so
that's<00:01:42.490> interesting<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.540> if<00:01:44.230> you're

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
that's interesting and if you're

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.050 
that's interesting and if you're
interested<00:01:45.370> in<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:47.290> kind<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.850> glass<00:01:48.850> you

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
interested in what kind of glass you

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.940 
interested in what kind of glass you
need<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.330> put<00:01:49.510> on<00:01:49.660> it<00:01:49.690> or<00:01:50.020> protection<00:01:50.380> UV

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
need to put on it or protection UV

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.330 
need to put on it or protection UV
filter<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.550> is<00:01:52.120> a<00:01:52.480> 62<00:01:53.170> millimeter<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.860> overall

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
filter it is a 62 millimeter so overall

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.690 
filter it is a 62 millimeter so overall
I<00:01:54.810> wouldn't<00:01:55.810> switch<00:01:56.020> us<00:01:56.260> for<00:01:56.590> me<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.950> wouldn't
