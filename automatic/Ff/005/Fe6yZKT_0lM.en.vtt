thought it was a good height in size to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.460 
thought it was a good height in size to
be<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> brush<00:01:05.549> holder<00:01:05.939> possibly<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.170> we'll<00:01:07.320> see

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
be a brush holder possibly so we'll see

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
be a brush holder possibly so we'll see
what<00:01:07.590> happens<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.490> about<00:01:09.000> six<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.420> less

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
what happens that was about six or less

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.630 
what happens that was about six or less
and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.380> Bob<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.830> square<00:01:11.189> display

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and then Bob through square display

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.990 
and then Bob through square display
plates<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.990> were<00:01:13.409> four<00:01:13.979> dollars<00:01:14.250> each<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
plates they were four dollars each and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060 
plates they were four dollars each and
so<00:01:15.810> they've<00:01:15.930> got<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.200> glitter<00:01:16.560> running<00:01:16.860> through

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so they've got a glitter running through

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.350 
so they've got a glitter running through
them<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.340> thought<00:01:17.490> they<00:01:17.549> were<00:01:17.729> quite<00:01:17.970> pretty

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.429 
them I thought they were quite pretty
I'm<00:01:19.130> might<00:01:20.130> use<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.240> decorative<00:01:21.960> plate

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
I'm might use them as a decorative plate

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.420 
I'm might use them as a decorative plate
to<00:01:22.590> whole<00:01:22.619> jewelry<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:24.920> candles<00:01:25.920> something

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to whole jewelry or candles something

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.969 
to whole jewelry or candles something
like<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.880> I'll<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:28.740> these

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
like that I'll see what I do with these

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
of this size smaller almost two dollars

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
of this size smaller almost two dollars
the<00:01:38.070> big<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.670> four<00:01:38.970> dollars<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.540> was

the big one was four dollars I was

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
the big one was four dollars I was
thinking<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.530> could<00:01:40.560> sit<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:41.009> Perkins<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
thinking I could sit my Perkins on this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600 
thinking I could sit my Perkins on this
as<00:01:42.240> well<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.380> make<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.430> little

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
as well just to make it look a little

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.420 
as well just to make it look a little
bit<00:01:44.990> nicer<00:01:45.990> instead<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.040> having<00:01:47.189> them

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
bit nicer instead of just having them

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.670 
bit nicer instead of just having them
sitting<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.909> top<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> my<00:01:48.509> chest<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.439> drawers

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
sitting on top of my chest of drawers

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.160 
sitting on top of my chest of drawers
and<00:01:50.159> I've<00:01:50.549> got<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> clear<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.299> well<00:01:51.540> because

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and I've got a clear on as well because

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.410 
and I've got a clear on as well because
I<00:01:52.590> thought<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> would<00:01:53.759> look<00:01:53.880> nice<00:01:54.060> sitting

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
I thought that would look nice sitting

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450 
I thought that would look nice sitting
candles<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.530> might<00:01:55.799> use<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.219> here

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
candles on it or I might use it in here

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.819 
candles on it or I might use it in here
not<00:01:57.329> sure<00:01:57.540> yet<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.170> always<00:01:58.409> use<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
not sure yet but you can always use it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.289 
not sure yet but you can always use it
that<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.250> only<00:01:59.340> two<00:01:59.579> dollars<00:01:59.820> fifty<00:02:00.149> as

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
that one was only two dollars fifty as

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.170 
that one was only two dollars fifty as
well<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:02.009> last<00:02:02.159> thing<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.880> from

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
well and the last thing I but just from

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.100 
well and the last thing I but just from
that<00:02:03.659> store<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:05.250> dish<00:02:05.700> drainer<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that store was this dish drainer and I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.800 
that store was this dish drainer and I
need<00:02:07.560> somewhere<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> store<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:08.399> Mac<00:02:08.759> pellets

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
need somewhere to store my Mac pellets

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.390 
need somewhere to store my Mac pellets
so<00:02:09.899> what<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.229> thinking<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:11.280> making

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
so what I was thinking is kind of making

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.430 
so what I was thinking is kind of making
this<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.090> prettier<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> can

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this little bit prettier so I can

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.420 
this little bit prettier so I can
actually<00:02:13.560> sort<00:02:14.160> my<00:02:14.520> palates<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.020> slots<00:02:16.590> so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
actually sort my palates in the slots so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.160 
actually sort my palates in the slots so
I<00:02:17.459> could<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:18.360> them<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.069> use<00:02:20.069> them<00:02:20.810> but<00:02:21.810> at<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
I could see them and use them but at the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.110 
I could see them and use them but at the
moment<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.739> plastic<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.670> kind<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.940> ugly

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
moment is plastic and it's kind of ugly

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.210 
moment is plastic and it's kind of ugly
it<00:02:24.420> was<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.410> i<00:02:25.440> thought<00:02:25.709> i<00:02:25.950> could

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
it was for all this so i thought i could

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.250 
it was for all this so i thought i could
buy<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.760> play<00:02:27.569> around<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.200> see

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
buy it and play around with it and see

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.479 
buy it and play around with it and see
if<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.500> could<00:02:28.560> make<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.800> look<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.160> little<00:02:29.310> bit

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
if I could make it look a little bit

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.790 
if I could make it look a little bit
more<00:02:29.610> pretty<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.959> that's<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.260> that's<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.590> whole

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
more pretty so that's it that's my whole

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.070 
more pretty so that's it that's my whole

how I end up using them but there is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.740
