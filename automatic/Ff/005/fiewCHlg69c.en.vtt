years of practicing you'd come back into
law<00:00:33.540> teaching<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.200> would<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
law teaching and that would be the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.420 
law teaching and that would be the
conventional<00:00:35.579> path<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:37.040> there<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.160> still<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
conventional path and there are still a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130 
conventional path and there are still a
few<00:00:38.640> people<00:00:38.969> every<00:00:39.210> year<00:00:39.239> who<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.660> following

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
few people every year who are following

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
few people every year who are following
that<00:00:40.260> path<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.649> who<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.920> into<00:00:41.070> law<00:00:41.280> teaching

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that path and who get into law teaching

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.850 
that path and who get into law teaching
in<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> way<00:00:42.120> but<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.469> things<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.829> changing

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
in that way but but things are changing

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830 
in that way but but things are changing
and<00:00:44.340> they're<00:00:44.430> changing<00:00:44.640> considerably<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and they're changing considerably I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.720 
and they're changing considerably I
think<00:00:46.350> today<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.829> fair<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> say<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> most

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
think today it's fair to say that most

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
think today it's fair to say that most
people<00:00:47.879> coming<00:00:48.360> into<00:00:48.480> law<00:00:48.690> teaching<00:00:49.170> have

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
people coming into law teaching have

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.939 
people coming into law teaching have
many<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.910> those<00:00:51.059> credentials<00:00:51.930> although<00:00:52.770> not

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
many of those credentials although not

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.680 
many of those credentials although not
all<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.120> many<00:00:54.420> other

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
all of them but they have many other

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
all of them but they have many other
things<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.199> well<00:00:55.670> one<00:00:56.670> thing<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:56.910> tend<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
things as well one thing they tend to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.979 
things as well one thing they tend to
have<00:00:57.800> is<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.160> publication<00:00:59.609> record<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.690> people

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
have is a publication record so people

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.389 
have is a publication record so people
are<00:01:01.109> doing<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> writing<00:01:01.859> before<00:01:02.309> they

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
are doing a lot of writing before they

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
are doing a lot of writing before they
come<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> law<00:01:03.059> teaching<00:01:03.420> market<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
come into the law teaching market in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.620 
come into the law teaching market in
order<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.100> time<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> write<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.119> probably

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
order to get time to write it's probably

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.960 
order to get time to write it's probably
the<00:01:06.750> case<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.710> need<00:01:08.450> some<00:01:09.450> type<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
the case that you need some type of

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.219 
the case that you need some type of
either<00:01:12.380> academic<00:01:13.820> fellowship<00:01:14.820> or<00:01:15.229> practice

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
either academic fellowship or practice

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.200 
either academic fellowship or practice
experience<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.040> enables<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.729> do<00:01:18.030> some

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
experience that enables you to do some

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.050 
experience that enables you to do some
writing<00:01:18.420> after<00:01:18.900> law<00:01:19.080> school<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.759> I'd<00:01:20.759> say

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
writing after law school and so I'd say

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.580 
writing after law school and so I'd say
at<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.330> point<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> majority<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.320> not<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
at this point the majority if not the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
at this point the majority if not the
vast<00:01:22.860> majority<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.369> people<00:01:23.490> coming<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
law school and part of the reason for

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.920 
law school and part of the reason for
that<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.909> they're<00:01:30.060> taking<00:01:30.450> fellowships

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that is that they're taking fellowships

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.890 
that is that they're taking fellowships
or<00:01:31.110> they're<00:01:31.380> doing<00:01:31.680> graduate<00:01:31.890> degrees<00:01:32.490> in

their legal interests and that's giving

the market to become law teachers they

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.360 
the market to become law teachers they
send<00:02:49.239> data<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.019> Suliman<00:02:50.620> he<00:02:50.769> reports<00:02:51.280> that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
send data to Suliman he reports that

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.860 
send data to Suliman he reports that
data<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.360> know<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:53.230> his<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:55.120> his<00:02:55.180> blog<00:02:55.630> which

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
data you know in his in his blog which

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.840 
data you know in his in his blog which
is<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.290> think<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.769> best<00:02:56.980> source<00:02:57.370> for<00:02:57.640> finding

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
is I think the best source for finding

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.550 
is I think the best source for finding
out<00:02:58.120> about<00:02:58.360> what<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.660> law<00:02:58.780> teaching<00:02:59.200> market

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
out about what the law teaching market

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.160 
out about what the law teaching market
looks<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.489> from<00:03:00.670> year<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.030> year<00:03:01.080> here<00:03:02.080> are

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
looks like from year to year here are

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.470 
looks like from year to year here are
some<00:03:02.380> highlights<00:03:02.709> from<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.700> last<00:03:03.730> few<00:03:04.209> years

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
some highlights from the last few years

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.570 
some highlights from the last few years

I<00:04:18.370> think<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.670> next<00:04:19.000> question<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.720> what<00:04:19.870> should

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
I think the next question is what should

I think the next question is what should
you<00:04:20.140> be<00:04:20.260> looking<00:04:20.410> for<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.860> a<00:04:21.010> law<00:04:21.190> school<00:04:21.520> when

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
you're choosing a law school what are

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.160 
you're choosing a law school what are
the<00:04:24.070> kinds<00:04:24.430> of<00:04:24.520> attributes<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.020> ought

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
the kinds of attributes that you ought

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.930 
the kinds of attributes that you ought
to<00:04:26.290> focus<00:04:26.410> on<00:04:26.800> if<00:04:27.070> what<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.460> really<00:04:27.610> want<00:04:27.850> to

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
to focus on if what you really want to

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.480

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
few things about that and I think the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.950 
few things about that and I think the
first<00:04:33.820> thing<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.150> want<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.360> have<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.540> look<00:04:34.780> at

first thing you want to have a look at

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.470

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
curriculum at a law school provide you

in order to have time to do some writing

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.880 
in order to have time to do some writing
possibly<00:04:48.070> some<00:04:48.280> publication<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:50.620> does<00:04:50.770> it

I'll<00:05:44.950> tell<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.370> Leiter's<00:05:45.820> numbers<00:05:46.150> are<00:05:46.270> based

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
I'll tell you Leiter's numbers are based

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.440 
I'll tell you Leiter's numbers are based
on<00:05:46.600> Solem<00:05:47.050> x'<00:05:47.080> numbers<00:05:47.880> so<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:48.940> might<00:05:49.240> as<00:05:49.360> well

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
on Solem x' numbers so you might as well

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.960 
on Solem x' numbers so you might as well
just<00:05:49.690> go<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.110> source<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:51.460> rankings<00:05:51.850> are

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
just go to the source the rankings are

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.410 
just go to the source the rankings are
directly<00:05:52.420> drawn<00:05:52.720> from<00:05:52.930> Solon's<00:05:53.290> data<00:05:54.420> I've

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
directly drawn from Solon's data I've

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.330 
directly drawn from Solon's data I've
looked<00:05:55.780> at<00:05:55.930> columns<00:05:56.350> data<00:05:56.560> I<00:05:56.680> actually<00:05:56.950> think

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
looked at columns data I actually think

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.140 
looked at columns data I actually think
some<00:05:57.880> of<00:05:57.910> it<00:05:58.090> is<00:05:58.210> is<00:05:58.960> not<00:05:59.950> correctly<00:06:00.400> tabulated

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
some of it is is not correctly tabulated

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.550 
some of it is is not correctly tabulated
and<00:06:01.240> so<00:06:01.330> I<00:06:01.360> think<00:06:01.450> Leiter's<00:06:01.870> rankings<00:06:02.230> are<00:06:02.380> off

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
and so I think Leiter's rankings are off

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.500 
and so I think Leiter's rankings are off
I'd<00:06:02.860> be<00:06:02.920> happy<00:06:03.190> to<00:06:03.220> explain<00:06:03.940> that<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:04.390> go

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
I'd be happy to explain that and to go

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.440 
I'd be happy to explain that and to go
into<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:04.900> with<00:06:04.930> you<00:06:05.200> if<00:06:05.440> you're<00:06:05.620> interested

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
into it with you if you're interested

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.790 
into it with you if you're interested
but<00:06:07.450> in<00:06:07.600> any<00:06:07.720> event<00:06:07.810> it'll<00:06:08.200> give<00:06:08.350> you<00:06:08.470> a<00:06:08.500> rough

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
but in any event it'll give you a rough

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.230 
but in any event it'll give you a rough
sense<00:06:09.040> of<00:06:09.280> what<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.730> what<00:06:09.850> you<00:06:09.970> ought<00:06:10.090> to<00:06:10.120> be

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
sense of what of what you ought to be

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.090 
sense of what of what you ought to be
looking<00:06:10.510> for<00:06:10.750> in<00:06:10.870> terms<00:06:11.080> of<00:06:11.260> in<00:06:11.710> terms<00:06:11.950> of

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
looking for in terms of in terms of

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.300 
looking for in terms of in terms of
placement

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
placement

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.080 
placement
there<00:06:15.310> are<00:06:15.370> a<00:06:15.400> couple<00:06:15.460> other<00:06:15.759> things<00:06:15.819> I<00:06:16.060> think

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
there are a couple other things I think

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.640 
there are a couple other things I think
you<00:06:16.330> should<00:06:16.509> look<00:06:16.629> for<00:06:16.900> because<00:06:17.319> there<00:06:17.530> are

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
you should look for because there are

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.200 
you should look for because there are
still<00:06:17.949> some<00:06:18.159> conventional<00:06:18.610> stepping<00:06:19.000> stones

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
still some conventional stepping stones

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.939 
still some conventional stepping stones
as<00:06:19.360> I<00:06:19.449> said<00:06:19.659> to<00:06:19.780> getting<00:06:20.050> into<00:06:20.169> legal<00:06:20.470> academia

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
as I said to getting into legal academia

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.399 
as I said to getting into legal academia
so<00:06:21.129> do<00:06:21.639> law<00:06:21.789> schools<00:06:22.060> have<00:06:22.240> specific<00:06:23.050> programs

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
so do law schools have specific programs

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.800 
so do law schools have specific programs
to<00:06:23.590> help<00:06:23.680> you<00:06:23.800> with<00:06:24.280> law<00:06:24.849> teaching<00:06:25.270> but<00:06:25.389> second

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
to help you with law teaching but second

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.510 
to help you with law teaching but second
you<00:06:26.139> probably<00:06:26.469> ought<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.680> be<00:06:26.860> interested<00:06:27.370> in

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
you probably ought to be interested in

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.240 
you probably ought to be interested in
