00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
something it says warm corals so I don't

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.069 
something it says warm corals so I don't
really<00:02:47.610> know<00:02:47.790> if<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.599> see<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.930> because

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
really know if you can see that because

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.319 
really know if you can see that because
it's<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.379> gold<00:02:49.680> metallic<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.579> being<00:02:51.209> like

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
it's a gold metallic is being like

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.420 
it's a gold metallic is being like
really<00:02:51.510> wash<00:02:51.780> out<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.319> then<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.769> says<00:02:52.980> quarrel

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
really wash out and then it says quarrel

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.069 
really wash out and then it says quarrel
so<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.730> think<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.000> colors<00:02:54.269> core<00:02:54.510> ox<00:02:54.660> or<00:02:54.900> maybe

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
so I think the colors core ox or maybe

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.199 
so I think the colors core ox or maybe
that's<00:02:55.379> like<00:02:55.590> French<00:02:55.980> for<00:02:56.250> warm<00:02:56.670> corals<00:02:57.060> I
