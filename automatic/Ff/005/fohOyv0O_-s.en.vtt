on the left quaranta Simms hi malena and
our<00:00:34.449> man<00:00:34.660> today<00:00:35.020> Andy<00:00:35.649> najar<00:00:36.989> early<00:00:37.989> in<00:00:38.110> the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
our man today Andy najar early in the

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.750 
our man today Andy najar early in the
second<00:00:38.530> half<00:00:38.559> against<00:00:39.010> New<00:00:39.100> York<00:00:39.309> Hyman<00:00:39.730> I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
second half against New York Hyman I

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.280 
second half against New York Hyman I
don't<00:00:39.940> have<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.180> ball<00:00:40.360> near<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.960> top<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.140> the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
don't have the ball near the top of the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.049 
don't have the ball near the top of the
box<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.620> Andy<00:00:42.100> najar<00:00:42.219> started<00:00:42.640> making<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:42.910> run

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
box and Andy najar started making a run

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.970 
box and Andy najar started making a run
now<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:43.510> think<00:00:43.660> Andy<00:00:44.200> was<00:00:44.320> anticipating<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
now I think Andy was anticipating the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.889 
now I think Andy was anticipating the
ball<00:00:45.190> like<00:00:45.579> it<00:00:45.730> often<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.090> being<00:00:46.360> played<00:00:46.570> into

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
ball like it often is being played into

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.750 
ball like it often is being played into
the<00:00:46.989> space<00:00:47.230> so<00:00:47.680> that<00:00:47.710> he<00:00:47.950> could<00:00:48.160> run<00:00:48.309> onto<00:00:48.520> it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
the space so that he could run onto it

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.340 
the space so that he could run onto it
the<00:00:49.059> problem<00:00:49.420> is<00:00:49.510> that's<00:00:49.690> not<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.989> way<00:00:50.110> Jaime

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
the problem is that's not the way Jaime

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.319 
the problem is that's not the way Jaime
likes<00:00:50.590> to<00:00:50.710> play<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:51.070> ball<00:00:51.219> because<00:00:51.850> when<00:00:52.239> the

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
likes to play that ball because when the

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.250 
likes to play that ball because when the
player<00:00:52.510> receives<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:52.960> ball<00:00:53.079> in<00:00:53.200> that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
player receives the ball in that

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.900 
player receives the ball in that
situation<00:00:53.649> he's<00:00:54.219> all<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:54.460> way<00:00:54.520> over<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.760> the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
situation he's all the way over to the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.250 
situation he's all the way over to the
corner<00:00:55.090> flag<00:00:55.210> so<00:00:55.420> what<00:00:55.539> hyman<00:00:55.719> does<00:00:55.989> is<00:00:56.140> he

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
corner flag so what hyman does is he

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
corner flag so what hyman does is he
sort<00:00:56.469> of<00:00:56.500> plays<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.890> into<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.190> space

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
sort of plays it into the space

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.970 
sort of plays it into the space
encouraging<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.570> run<00:00:58.750> from<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.960> har<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.710> come

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
encouraging the run from the har to come

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.610 
encouraging the run from the har to come
towards<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.850> penalty<00:01:01.180> area<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.899> way<00:01:02.170> when

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
towards the penalty area that way when

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.619 
towards the penalty area that way when
Andy<00:01:02.920> actually<00:01:03.250> received<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.820> ball<00:01:03.969> he's<00:01:04.509> in

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
Andy actually received the ball he's in

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.500 
Andy actually received the ball he's in
a<00:01:04.690> much<00:01:04.839> more<00:01:04.899> dangerous<00:01:05.350> position<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.330> here's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
a much more dangerous position so here's

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.640 
a much more dangerous position so here's
that<00:01:07.689> play<00:01:07.840> I<00:01:07.869> was<00:01:08.049> talking<00:01:08.320> about<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.560> new

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
down the flank time it plays a little

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.640

bit<00:01:13.540> more<00:01:13.659> central<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.200> goes<00:01:14.350> out<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.560> play

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650
