relationship between Borden and Penguin

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
relationship between Borden and Penguin
in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> sense<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.070> know

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
in the in the sense that like you know

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.110 
in the in the sense that like you know
I'm<00:00:56.730> sure<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> much<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.699> he<00:00:59.940> would

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
I'm sure it's not so much like he would

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.369 
I'm sure it's not so much like he would
probably<00:01:00.300> prefer<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.170> wasn't

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
probably prefer that this wasn't

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
probably prefer that this wasn't
happening<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.059> Gordon

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
happening but but you know Gordon

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
happening but but you know Gordon
wouldn't<00:01:03.960> die<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.040> their<00:01:05.369> relationship<00:01:05.519> just

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
wouldn't die but their relationship just

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.670 
wouldn't die but their relationship just
gets<00:01:06.390> deeper<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.900> deeper<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.380> weird<00:01:07.590> way

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
gets deeper and deeper in a weird way

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.520 
gets deeper and deeper in a weird way
they<00:01:08.010> both<00:01:08.220> sort<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> them<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.820> each<00:01:08.939> other<00:01:09.530> you
