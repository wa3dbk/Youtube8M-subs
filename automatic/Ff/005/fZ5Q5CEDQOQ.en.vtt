00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.660
 Hi, everyone on social networks, that's okay. 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.340
 I'm the max paul is to have an introduction 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 of the vast majority I will not 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.340
 to make everyone else a great majority of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.820
 sertanejo 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 This song is like that in a passionate 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 I'm going to teach you the introduction 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 this song is a song that much 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.449
 People think it's a hard song. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.989
 simple simple introduction 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.540
 she simply uses larger scale 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.230
 ascending then the request for 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.960
 appeal of the sentence is just that nothing more 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.379
 is a song played at a speed 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.239
 cool and was created with taste so 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 people confuse difficult arrangement with 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.370
 an elaborate arrangement the person who 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 created this arrangement had good taste and a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.100
 very beautiful thing I think it's very beautiful 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.230
 This one I teach to you is like playing 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.230
 this arrangement or play after teaching 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.259
 the beginning begins with a violin a form 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.810
 to approach the violin is to do 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.159
 repetition of note that the student even 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.159
 the same finger will not stay like this 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:02:02.869
 again you get the result for 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:02:04.989
 the carrying rest was faster 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.989
 little 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.709
 here comes the phrase is great or teaching 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.700
 right after you're going to have to lose 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.620
 slowly 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.720
 I can not count on other times 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.290
 I will do so slowly accompanies ii 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.150
 You can copy this fingering and I'll use 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.470
 Fingering of the larger scale will not 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.470
 getting like this starts 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.159
 i and ii 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:58.400
 i and ii 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:25.140
 the thing you have to watch the 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.810
 same as typing three-fingered oxen will 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.010
 make it difficult to do this 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.180
 need to have a typing knowledge 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.900
 of scale 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.780

 fix a dvd one already to pass these 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.260
 scales 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:54.180
