traveler<00:00:07.109> long<00:00:08.719> I<00:00:09.719> stood<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.349> looked<00:00:10.559> down

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
traveler long I stood and looked down

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.830 
traveler long I stood and looked down
one<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.219> far<00:00:11.370> as<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.820> could<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.540> where<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.750> bent

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
one as far as I could to where it bent

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.259 
one as far as I could to where it bent
in<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.139> undergrowth

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.290 

then<00:00:15.990> took<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> other<00:00:16.410> as<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.160> as<00:00:17.580> fair<00:00:17.640> and

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
then took the other as just as fair and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.929 
then took the other as just as fair and
having<00:00:18.869> perhaps<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.500> better<00:00:19.619> claim<00:00:19.980> because

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
having perhaps the better claim because

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.630 
having perhaps the better claim because
it<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.180> grassy<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.869> wanted<00:00:22.020> wear<00:00:22.410> though<00:00:22.640> as

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it was grassy and wanted wear though as

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.760 
it was grassy and wanted wear though as
for<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> passing<00:00:24.270> there<00:00:24.720> had<00:00:24.930> worn<00:00:25.470> them

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
for that the passing there had worn them

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.750 
for that the passing there had worn them
really<00:00:25.890> about<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.369> same

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.029 

and<00:00:29.330> both<00:00:29.600> that<00:00:29.810> morning<00:00:30.050> equally<00:00:30.740> lay<00:00:30.890> in

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
and both that morning equally lay in

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.940 
and both that morning equally lay in
leaves<00:00:31.220> no<00:00:31.699> step<00:00:31.910> had<00:00:32.210> trodden<00:00:32.390> black<00:00:32.780> oh<00:00:33.380> I

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
leaves no step had trodden black oh I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.490 
leaves no step had trodden black oh I
kept<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.489> first<00:00:34.579> for<00:00:34.910> another<00:00:35.030> day<00:00:35.500> yet

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
kept the first for another day yet

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.229 
kept the first for another day yet
knowing<00:00:36.710> how<00:00:36.920> way<00:00:37.070> leads<00:00:37.309> on<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:37.820> way<00:00:38.059> I

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
knowing how way leads on to way I

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.549 
knowing how way leads on to way I
doubted<00:00:39.079> if<00:00:39.590> I<00:00:39.710> should<00:00:39.739> ever<00:00:40.040> come<00:00:40.370> back<00:00:40.550> I

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
doubted if I should ever come back I

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.450 
doubted if I should ever come back I
shall<00:00:42.559> be<00:00:42.710> telling<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.070> with<00:00:43.280> a<00:00:43.340> sigh

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
shall be telling this with a sigh

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.220 
shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere<00:00:44.059> ages<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.440> ages<00:00:45.710> hence<00:00:47.199> two<00:00:48.199> roads

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
somewhere ages and ages hence two roads

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.939 
somewhere ages and ages hence two roads
diverged<00:00:49.100> in<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.339> wood<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.269> I<00:00:50.540> I<00:00:50.870> took<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.830> one

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
diverged in a wood and I I took the one

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.970 
diverged in a wood and I I took the one
less<00:00:52.010> traveled<00:00:52.220> by<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:54.170> has<00:00:54.379> made<00:00:54.559> all

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
less traveled by and that has made all

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:50.750 
less traveled by and that has made all
the<00:00:55.010> difference

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.170
