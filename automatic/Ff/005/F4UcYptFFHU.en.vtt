 I'm going to talk today and I'll talk a little bit about 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.030
 cops they are using with game creation 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.260

 scenery composition 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.840
 kim shows forces here 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.700

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.220
 composition of earth walls 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.330
 of floor then we get two textures to create different material 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.610
 from maya 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.070
