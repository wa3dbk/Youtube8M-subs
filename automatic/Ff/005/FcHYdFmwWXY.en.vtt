with your line in the water which

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.070 
with your line in the water which
equates<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.369> more<00:00:17.580> fish<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.270> let's<00:00:18.779> face<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
equates to more fish and let's face it
