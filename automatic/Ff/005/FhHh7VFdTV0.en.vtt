00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010
 I'm going to make a video here for 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.240
 Who does not know how to take the 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.259
 car radio 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 It is not difficult to follow the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.570
 first of all you have to boot 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.300
 this finish that has here below the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.380
 radio a good find like shoving the hand 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.650
 under 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.180
 lift up and pull back 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:35.780
 get out there and you vote the exchange on n 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.780
 fountains of zero 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:48.110
 squeeze there it will come out and now it starts to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:52.649
 boring part to take that and radio that 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.800
 You have to leave this whole frame here and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.320
 this trunk does not try to get the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.660
 radio that has one of the beams here that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.879
 It's going to break and this one also 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.159
 here then it will break 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.610
 You have to take everything away as we 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.409
 take this frame that has inside it 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.850
 four screws I do not know whether to give 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.020
 to watch the video 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.020
 I'll try to eliminate it. 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.430
 mine I even leave without the screws 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.280
 jet 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:34.960
 I'm tired of messing with this thing 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.960
 or the dollar to 1 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.890
 It's this screw here, the corner right here. 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.000
 where I'm touching 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.700
 then there would be one in that side hole 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.220
 where to always be here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:02:01.289
 It is the same on the other side that is 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:03.690
 The door has a screw in the corner and 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.140
 I put water in the middle of the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.789
 corner bolts do not need to take 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.410
 you take only those two screws 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.640
 half that is holding the frame 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.350
 revolutionized there carefully you pull 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.110
 she was something to fingernail underneath and she 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.110
 It's going to come out you pull on one side sometimes 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.799
 there must be frames on the other 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.049
 whole in the hand 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.840
 taking this frame you can 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.780
 stick your hand in here and get 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.160
 behind the trunk door will pro push the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.040
 trunk 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.370
 after the exchange is well chatinha will resist the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.030
 Sometimes it's easier, it's half moon, but 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.630
 be careful not to break anything you go 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.890
 taking sometimes have to get here 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:03.900
 our paper fee here sometimes he 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:06.329
 get out now it's kind of hard, you have to 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.400
 Take care to break the crap 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.600
 that door because he too 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.230
 break is mine, it's all glued together and separated 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.840
 this part here that in you will be 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.329
 gray that my sticker see with the part 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.250
 from within them are two pieces 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.079
 so you have to pull part of the ground 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.920
 The best thing is to stick your hand there 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:31.799
 you get it, you see it gives a 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.109
 game or if you were seeing that I'm 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.230
 Finding a video behind you and you 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.760
 Can he take it as patiently? 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.139
 Patience patience you end up taking 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.390
 I'm going to use the video to take it. 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:52.450
 need both hands 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:57.400
 O strip and touch puts freaked and then you take 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:05.819
 the radio as you got radio year 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:10.360
 radio has these two holes here and here 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:13.630
 and then two more here and here 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.440
 the real lock stays up here 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.570
 you can if anything drop me 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:24.520
 only from the top was how I did several 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:28.240
 times at the beginning the key and now has the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.540
 specific key she took a nail 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.130
 Enter 21 key 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:38.800
 you put it and it comes in two 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:42.940
 the lock at the beginning then you that the key 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.510
 It's a one centimeter thing and strength is easy. 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.070
 so out there on both sides 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.210
 is selected there 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:55.240
 This side here and pulls it out. 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.650
 There you pull it will go without much 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.950
 difficulty 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.760
 Let me try fixing the device here. 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.760
 Are you going to see them? 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:16.520
 I do not know, I think I'll give the credit down. 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.520
 force out side 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.920
 the other side 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:31.050
 ready the device left 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.540
 The button that we're going to have to move to. 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.250
 forcing the firmware reading is a 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.850
 button is under the 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.800
 I will not turn off the device, and neither will you. 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.840
 You'll have to move yours to force 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.340
 this reading 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.710
 but I'll show you I'll take the device 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:53.860
 will show the listen button learn from 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:59.080
 new cell that the steering wheel can be 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.920
 show this button by pulling 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.030
 appliance 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.030
 looking him down 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.330
 the button 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.380
 in here I do not know if it will to see 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.710

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:23.139
 but there's a little button here so good 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.970

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.099
 Video can not really see well but is a 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.449
 gray plastic button inside 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:33.009
 of this income 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:35.590
 some old radios have this button has 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.880
 two left and right buttons on the 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.060
 even here 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.479
 newer radios have only one 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:47.259
