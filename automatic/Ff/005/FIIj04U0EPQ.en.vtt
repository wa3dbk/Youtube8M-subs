00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.980 
sevens
they're<00:00:10.559> called<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> Bordeaux's<00:00:11.490> i<00:00:11.990> think

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
they're called the Bordeaux's i think

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.180 
they're called the Bordeaux's i think
those<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.290> color<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:13.889> like<00:00:14.040> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
those are the color that have like a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.019 
those are the color that have like a
like<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> burgundy<00:00:15.809> white<00:00:16.320> color<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.430> that's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
like a burgundy white color and that's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.660 
like a burgundy white color and that's
why<00:00:18.180> they<00:00:18.300> call<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> Bordeaux's<00:00:19.369> but<00:00:20.369> they

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
why they call it the Bordeaux's but they

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.029 
why they call it the Bordeaux's but they
have<00:00:20.820> been<00:00:21.029> released<00:00:21.270> since<00:00:21.779> 1992<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
have been released since 1992 so the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.400 
have been released since 1992 so the
demand<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.670> pretty<00:00:23.970> high<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.330> these<00:00:24.420> so

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
demand is pretty high for these so

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.189 
demand is pretty high for these so
that's<00:00:25.859> why<00:00:26.010> i'm<00:00:26.070> up<00:00:26.220> at<00:00:26.340> 7:30<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.300> gotta<00:00:27.930> try<00:00:28.109> to

look like all right let's check them out
regular<00:01:17.980> tissue<00:01:18.520> paper<00:01:18.880> nothing<00:01:19.720> special

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.850 

this<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.070> something<00:01:24.610> new<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:26.680> doing

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
this is something new that you're doing

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.850 
this is something new that you're doing
with<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.160> 7<00:01:27.490> since<00:01:27.790> this<00:01:28.150> is<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.510> thin<00:01:28.860> it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
with the 7 since this is so thin it

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.030 
with the 7 since this is so thin it
tends<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.250> like<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.670> all<00:01:30.820> squished<00:01:31.180> up<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.630> here

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
tends to like it all squished up in here

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.950 
tends to like it all squished up in here
so<00:01:34.110> they're<00:01:35.110> putting<00:01:35.410> these<00:01:35.650> inserts<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.900> a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
so they're putting these inserts it's a

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.580 
so they're putting these inserts it's a
good<00:01:38.110> idea

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.140 
but in pictures it looked a much shinier
it's<00:02:42.909> the<00:02:43.120> bottom<00:02:44.549> one<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
it's the bottom one of the the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.390 
it's the bottom one of the the
differences<00:02:46.659> between<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.379> OG<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:47.950> DS<00:02:48.129> is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
differences between the OG and DS is

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.569 
differences between the OG and DS is
this<00:02:48.700> little<00:02:49.090> olive<00:02:49.420> color<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:51.159> old<00:02:51.370> ones

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
this little olive color the old ones

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.190 
this little olive color the old ones
used<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.909> have<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.239> on<00:02:52.299> on<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.689> tongue<00:02:52.930> as<00:02:53.170> well

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
used to have it on on the tongue as well

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.550 
used to have it on on the tongue as well
and<00:02:54.189> it<00:02:54.730> seems<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.269> they<00:02:55.450> replaced<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and it seems that they replaced the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.059 
and it seems that they replaced the
olive<00:02:56.920> color<00:02:57.129> with<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.430> black<00:02:57.939> right<00:02:58.299> there

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
olive color with that black right there

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.210 
olive color with that black right there
so<00:03:00.069> that's<00:03:00.310> one<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:00.700> differences<00:03:02.220> this

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220
