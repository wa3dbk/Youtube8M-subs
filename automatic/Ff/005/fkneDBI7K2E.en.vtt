00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
like they've got a pretty good defense

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.109 
like they've got a pretty good defense
but<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> dig<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.000> they

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
but when you dig up a little bit they

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
but when you dig up a little bit they
played<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.630> weak<00:01:15.780> often<00:01:16.170> that's<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710

with<00:01:23.970> some<00:01:24.119> backup<00:01:24.420> players<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.229> best

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
with some backup players the best

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.289

with that game plan the only way I could

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.880 
with that game plan the only way I could
look<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.600> towards<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.080> over<00:03:12.470> you'd<00:03:12.650> have<00:03:12.770> to

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
look is towards the over you'd have to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.250 
look is towards the over you'd have to
force<00:03:13.220> me<00:03:13.460> to<00:03:13.610> go<00:03:13.730> under<00:03:14.180> with<00:03:14.660> teams<00:03:14.960> that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
force me to go under with teams that

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.860
