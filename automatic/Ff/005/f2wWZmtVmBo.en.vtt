naturally parts to this side but

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730 
naturally parts to this side but
recently<00:00:17.880> I've<00:00:18.060> been<00:00:18.180> wearing<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.779> middle<00:00:19.470> part

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
recently I've been wearing a middle part

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.939 
recently I've been wearing a middle part
which<00:00:20.510> typically<00:00:21.510> people<00:00:21.750> try<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.080> avoid<00:00:22.320> but

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
which typically people try to avoid but

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.859 
which typically people try to avoid but
it's<00:00:23.189> kind<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.580> making<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.939> comeback<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.660> I've

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it's kind of making a comeback and I've

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.420 
it's kind of making a comeback and I've
really<00:00:25.199> been<00:00:25.380> liking<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> past<00:00:26.099> couple<00:00:26.340> of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
really been liking it the past couple of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
really been liking it the past couple of
times<00:00:26.609> I've<00:00:26.789> done<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.779> more

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
times I've done it it's a little more

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.710 
times I've done it it's a little more
edgy<00:00:28.349> less<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.400> girl-next-door<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
edgy less like girl-next-door and it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.600 
edgy less like girl-next-door and it
tends<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.080> elongate<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> face<00:00:31.800> make<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.460> look

have to think about styling when I wear
my<00:00:46.590> hair<00:00:46.739> straight<00:00:47.270> it<00:00:48.270> looks<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.809> better

with<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.649> side<00:00:49.950> part<00:00:50.219> than<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> would<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
with a side part than it would with a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.119 
with a side part than it would with a
middle<00:00:51.210> part<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.660> some<00:00:51.840> reason<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
middle part for some reason and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
middle part for some reason and
aesthetically<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:54.030> me<00:00:54.180> I'd<00:00:54.480> rather<00:00:54.690> wear<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
aesthetically for me I'd rather wear it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
aesthetically for me I'd rather wear it
curly<00:00:55.289> cuz<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.070> fits<00:00:56.969> me<00:00:57.210> better<00:00:57.449> for

curly cuz it just fits me better for

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.860 
curly cuz it just fits me better for
some<00:00:58.230> reason<00:00:58.530> um<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.329> comes<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
some reason um but when it comes to you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
some reason um but when it comes to you
doing<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.620> part<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:03.420> hair<00:01:03.600> naturally

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
doing your part if your hair naturally

parts to one side or the other you're
gonna<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> train<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.170> go<00:01:07.380> towards<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
Margo would say but it is making a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.640 

like<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.210> said<00:02:22.270> it's<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.690> lot<00:02:22.870> easier<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.530> it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
like I said it's a lot easier to do it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.230 
like I said it's a lot easier to do it
as<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.830> blowout<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:27.340> kind<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.640> train<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.090> to

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
as a blowout and to kind of train it to

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.500 
as a blowout and to kind of train it to
go<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.540> one<00:02:28.720> direction<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:30.790> also<00:02:30.970> flip

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
go in one direction you can also flip

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.000 
go in one direction you can also flip
your<00:02:31.690> hair<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.990> opposite<00:02:32.470> direction<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
your hair in the opposite direction that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.590 
your hair in the opposite direction that
you<00:02:33.130> part<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:33.700> if<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:33.880> wanted<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.180> part<00:02:34.480> it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
you part it so if I wanted to part it

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.460 
you part it so if I wanted to part it
towards<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.560> other<00:02:35.590> side<00:02:36.720> which<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.840> never<00:02:37.900> do

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
towards the other side which I never do

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470 
towards the other side which I never do
so<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.070> gonna<00:02:39.370> be<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.550> little<00:02:39.730> bit<00:02:39.970> tricky

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
so this is gonna be a little bit tricky

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:56.050 
so this is gonna be a little bit tricky
for<00:02:40.510> my<00:02:40.990> hair<00:02:41.230> right<00:02:41.380> now

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.630 

this<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.239> think<00:02:57.299> looks<00:02:57.689> a<00:02:57.840> little<00:02:58.079> bit<00:02:58.430> silly<00:02:59.430> on

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
this I think looks a little bit silly on

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.729 
this I think looks a little bit silly on
me<00:02:59.819> because<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> lot<00:03:00.870> more<00:03:00.900> hair<00:03:01.379> on

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
me because I have a lot more hair on

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.830 
me because I have a lot more hair on
this<00:03:02.129> side<00:03:02.189> of<00:03:02.459> my<00:03:02.579> head<00:03:02.760> than<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.150> on<00:03:03.599> this

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
this side of my head than I do on this

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.459 
this side of my head than I do on this
side<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.189> just<00:03:05.430> adds<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:10.200> hair

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
side so this just adds to that hair

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.309 
side so this just adds to that hair
count<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:14.819> either<00:03:14.969> way<00:03:15.239> it<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.989> adds<00:03:16.139> a

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
count but either way it is it adds a

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.440 
count but either way it is it adds a
different<00:03:16.349> look<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.189> I<00:03:17.459> definitely<00:03:17.909> recommend

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
different look so I definitely recommend

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.780 
different look so I definitely recommend
playing<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.469> your<00:03:19.590> part<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.040> seeing<00:03:20.340> what

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
playing with your part and seeing what

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.830 
playing with your part and seeing what
kind<00:03:20.969> of<00:03:21.030> different<00:03:21.329> looks<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.629> can<00:03:21.689> create

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
kind of different looks you can create

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.780 
kind of different looks you can create
with<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.469> now<00:03:22.709> my<00:03:22.739> hair<00:03:23.129> because<00:03:23.489> I've<00:03:23.639> been

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.330 
with it now my hair because I've been
blow-drying<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.139> go<00:03:25.319> towards<00:03:26.159> the<00:03:26.310> middle

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
blow-drying it to go towards the middle

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.780 
blow-drying it to go towards the middle
recently<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.239> does<00:03:27.420> start<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:27.780> learn<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:29.579> don't
