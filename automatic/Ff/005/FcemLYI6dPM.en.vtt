I recently got a new Mouse and as you
can<00:00:58.890> tell<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.129> sensitivity<00:00:59.699> right<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
can tell my sensitivity right now is I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.680 
can tell my sensitivity right now is I
think<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.930> sky<00:01:01.620> high<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:03.210> experimenting

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
think it's sky high I was experimenting

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.640 
think it's sky high I was experimenting
with<00:01:03.989> all<00:01:04.110> sorts<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.470> different

with all sorts of different

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.020 
with all sorts of different
sensitivities<00:01:05.489> than<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> was

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
sensitivities than the one I was

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
sensitivities than the one I was
familiar<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:07.020> while<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> tried<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
familiar with just while I tried to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.960 
familiar with just while I tried to
figure<00:01:07.740> out<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> mouse<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.520> needless<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> say

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
figure out the mouse but needless to say

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.750 
figure out the mouse but needless to say
you'll<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.420> tons<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:10.220> crashing<00:01:11.220> into<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.490> pole

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you'll see tons of crashing into a pole

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
you'll see tons of crashing into a pole
here<00:01:12.090> you'll<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> second<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.470> when<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
here you'll see in a second to when I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
here you'll see in a second to when I
actually<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.729> manage<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> cross<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> bridge

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
actually do manage to cross the bridge

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.690 
actually do manage to cross the bridge
and<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.470> toward<00:01:16.830> B<00:01:17.040> flag<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and make my way toward B flag like I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
and make my way toward B flag like I
said<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.299> that's<00:01:18.689> basically<00:01:19.080> where<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
said because that's basically where it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.160 
said because that's basically where it
is<00:01:19.830> you'll<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:20.939> buildings<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.960> first

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
is you'll see two buildings the first

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.350 
is you'll see two buildings the first
building<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.159> where<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
first that right in front of me that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.469 
first that right in front of me that
first<00:01:26.310> building<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.970> where<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
first building is not where it is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
first building is not where it is
originally<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.409> thought<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:28.950> you'll<00:01:29.159> see

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
originally I thought it was you'll see

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.649 
originally I thought it was you'll see
me<00:01:29.520> try<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.850> jump<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> water<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> get

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
me try and jump in the water to get

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
me try and jump in the water to get
around<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.290> got<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> leg<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> had<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
around then I got the leg so I had to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
around then I got the leg so I had to
skip<00:01:32.460> ahead<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.720> first

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
skip ahead but it's not this first

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
skip ahead but it's not this first
building<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> next<00:01:35.520> building

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
building here it's the next building

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.230 
building here it's the next building
behind<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.950> it's<00:01:37.950> right<00:01:38.250> well<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.119> as

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
behind it it's right well right here as

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
behind it it's right well right here as
you<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> mini-map<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.680> which

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you see it on the mini-map out which

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.340 
you see it on the mini-map out which
I'll<00:01:41.009> pull<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> second<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I'll pull up in a second it's right to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.899 
I'll pull up in a second it's right to
the<00:01:43.530> west<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.689> B<00:01:45.689> flag<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.890> side<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the west on B flag there on the side so

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.899 
the west on B flag there on the side so
it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.420> hard<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.049> either

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
it's not that hard to get to either

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.789 
it's not that hard to get to either
propaganda<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> next<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.590> by<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
propaganda is the next one and it's by a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980 
propaganda is the next one and it's by a
flag<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.399> probably<00:01:53.909> I'd<00:01:54.360> say<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> easiest

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
flag it's probably I'd say the easiest

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.539 
flag it's probably I'd say the easiest
one<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.369> is

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
one to get to all you have to do is

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.310 
one to get to all you have to do is
especially<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.360> spawn<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> US<00:01:58.110> side

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
especially if you spawn on the US side

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.740 
especially if you spawn on the US side
just<00:01:59.070> run<00:01:59.280> toward<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> giant<00:02:00.060> statue<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.479> what

just run toward the giant statue of what

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.959 
just run toward the giant statue of what
I<00:02:00.780> guess<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.409> Kim<00:02:01.740> jong-il<00:02:02.399> or<00:02:02.729> Kim

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
I guess it would be Kim jong-il or Kim

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.270 
I guess it would be Kim jong-il or Kim
Jong<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.450> whoever<00:02:04.290> they<00:02:04.500> decided<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> North

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
making this particular map I'm not sure

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.030 
making this particular map I'm not sure
was<00:02:12.180> so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
was so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.619 
was so

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
LEvolution actually did I put put up a

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.000 
LEvolution actually did I put put up a
recent<00:02:27.349> video<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:28.430> get<00:02:28.609> the<00:02:28.819> unica<00:02:29.359> 6<00:02:30.010> quick

example<00:02:31.459> as<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:32.209> see<00:02:32.659> that<00:02:32.780> leg<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.019> have<00:02:33.200> to

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
example as I see see that leg I have to

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.500 
example as I see see that leg I have to
deal<00:02:33.470> with<00:02:33.590> all<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.799> time<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.189> run<00:02:34.970> over<00:02:35.000> here

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and you just run towards sea flag I

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.300 
and you just run towards sea flag I
think<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.019> land<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:39.439> wrong<00:02:39.560> spot<00:02:39.889> at<00:02:40.069> first

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.270 
think I land on the wrong spot at first
yep<00:02:41.180> this<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.989> not<00:02:42.139> where<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.409> go<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.530> lay<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.099> the

yep this is not where to go I lay in the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.589 
yep this is not where to go I lay in the
wrong<00:02:43.400> spot<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:43.909> I<00:02:43.969> realized<00:02:44.269> oh<00:02:44.389> wait

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
wrong spot and then I realized oh wait

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.649 
wrong spot and then I realized oh wait
