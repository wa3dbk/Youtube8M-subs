just go back and forth you can turn it
up<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.430> point<00:04:05.670> where<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.540> engine<00:04:06.989> will

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
up to the point where this engine will

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.789 
up to the point where this engine will
never<00:04:07.830> have<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> chance<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:09.030> moving<00:04:09.180> on<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:12.799> and

never have a chance of moving on you and

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.830 
never have a chance of moving on you and
what<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.370> keep<00:04:14.760> tightening<00:04:15.060> up<00:04:15.330> each<00:04:15.510> side

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
what I do I keep tightening up each side

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.140 
what I do I keep tightening up each side
until<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.650> see<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> crease<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.880> frame

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
until the I see a crease in the frame

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.230 
until the I see a crease in the frame
and<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:19.350> plate<00:04:19.590> actually<00:04:20.150> bends<00:04:23.240> these

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
and the plate actually bends these

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.270 
and the plate actually bends these
aren't<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.600> highest<00:04:24.960> quality<00:04:25.110> plates<00:04:25.710> as<00:04:26.100> you

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
aren't the highest quality plates as you

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.460 
aren't the highest quality plates as you
can<00:04:26.460> see<00:04:26.729> but<00:04:26.970> they<00:04:27.900> work<00:04:28.110> well<00:04:28.380> if<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.710> if<00:04:29.220> you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
can see but they work well if you if you

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:39.380 
can see but they work well if you if you
follow<00:04:31.470> this<00:04:31.770> sequence<00:04:37.580> see<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> pre<00:04:38.970> starting

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
to form in the bicycle frame go check it

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.880 
to form in the bicycle frame go check it
again<00:04:45.060> as<00:04:45.270> far<00:04:45.540> as<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.750> line<00:04:45.960> mminton<00:04:46.320> again

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.160 

you<00:05:38.250> can<00:05:38.400> see<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.670> with<00:05:38.820> two<00:05:39.000> bolts<00:05:39.420> where

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
you can see it with two bolts where

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.940 
you can see it with two bolts where
we're<00:05:40.290> two<00:05:40.440> nuts<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:40.830> mean<00:05:41.040> you<00:05:41.220> can<00:05:41.400> get<00:05:42.950> it

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
we're two nuts I mean you can get it

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.250 
we're two nuts I mean you can get it
down<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.640> lot<00:05:44.880> tighter<00:05:45.150> than<00:05:45.330> just<00:05:45.570> with<00:05:45.750> with

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
down a lot tighter than just with with

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.490 
down a lot tighter than just with with
one<00:05:46.530> so<00:05:47.010> we<00:05:47.300> live<00:05:48.300> we've<00:05:48.930> been<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.260> played<00:05:49.470> a

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
one so we live we've been to played a

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.560 
one so we live we've been to played a
few<00:05:49.740> degrees<00:05:49.890> so<00:05:50.790> we'll<00:05:50.910> do<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.120> same<00:05:51.330> thing

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
few degrees so we'll do the same thing

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.410 
few degrees so we'll do the same thing
to<00:05:51.600> the<00:05:51.870> back<00:05:52.080> we'll<00:05:52.440> get<00:05:52.590> that<00:05:53.120> justice<00:05:54.120> not

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
to the back we'll get that justice not

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.420 
to the back we'll get that justice not
now<00:05:54.660> what<00:05:55.170> you<00:05:55.320> don't<00:05:55.560> want<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.890> do<00:05:56.010> is<00:05:56.160> tighten

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
now what you don't want to do is tighten

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.730 
now what you don't want to do is tighten
up<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:57.120> front<00:05:57.150> or<00:05:57.600> the<00:05:57.630> back<00:05:57.720> all<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.290> way<00:05:58.440> and

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
up the front or the back all the way and

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.450 
up the front or the back all the way and
force<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.820> other<00:06:00.390> mount<00:06:00.920> into<00:06:01.920> position

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
force the the other mount into position

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.770 
force the the other mount into position
because<00:06:02.730> then<00:06:02.880> you're<00:06:03.030> going<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.240> just<00:06:03.420> put

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
because then you're going to just put

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.050 
because then you're going to just put
too<00:06:03.930> much<00:06:04.050> stress<00:06:04.380> on<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.770> frame<00:06:05.070> you<00:06:05.850> want

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
too much stress on the frame you want

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.170 
too much stress on the frame you want
the<00:06:06.240> engine<00:06:07.080> to<00:06:07.320> mount<00:06:07.970> naturally<00:06:08.970> to<00:06:09.090> the

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
the engine to mount naturally to the

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.990 
the engine to mount naturally to the
frame<00:06:09.420> without<00:06:09.740> forcing<00:06:11.750> into<00:06:12.750> the<00:06:12.980> the

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
frame without forcing into the the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:26.920 
frame without forcing into the the
spring<00:06:15.000> type

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.600 

now<00:06:27.930> I've<00:06:28.080> got<00:06:28.259> this<00:06:28.409> one<00:06:28.649> tightened<00:06:29.249> up<00:06:29.339> so

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
now I've got this one tightened up so

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.239 
now I've got this one tightened up so
much<00:06:29.789> to<00:06:30.240> where<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.629> ego<00:06:31.309> the<00:06:32.309> studs<00:06:32.639> actually

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:34.249 
much to where the ego the studs actually

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.309 
much to where the ego the studs actually
been<00:06:35.249> and<00:06:35.430> out<00:06:35.550> just<00:06:35.789> a<00:06:35.849> couple<00:06:36.059> degrees<00:06:36.319> which

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
been and out just a couple degrees which

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.459 
been and out just a couple degrees which
is<00:06:37.529> fine<00:06:38.369> because<00:06:38.639> it<00:06:38.999> though<00:06:39.360> I<00:06:39.719> mean<00:06:40.439> just

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.469 
is fine because it though I mean just

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:42.529 
is fine because it though I mean just
number<00:06:40.949> one<00:06:41.009> it's<00:06:41.249> right<00:06:41.550> but<00:06:41.849> number<00:06:42.149> two<00:06:42.180> it

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
number one it's right but number two it

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:49.329 
number one it's right but number two it
has<00:06:43.499> less<00:06:43.770> of<00:06:43.949> a<00:06:44.009> chance<00:06:44.249> to<00:06:44.430> back<00:06:45.360> out<00:06:45.569> ever

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:49.339 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.070 

the<00:06:50.339> way<00:06:50.490> these<00:06:50.669> are<00:06:50.969> the<00:06:51.180> nuts<00:06:51.659> will<00:06:51.899> never

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
the way these are the nuts will never

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.070 
the way these are the nuts will never
vibrate<00:06:52.589> out<00:06:52.770> but<00:06:53.129> you<00:06:53.879> you<00:06:54.419> want<00:06:54.659> to<00:06:54.869> check

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
vibrate out but you you want to check

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.269 
vibrate out but you you want to check
them<00:06:55.199> every<00:06:55.349> now<00:06:55.589> and<00:06:55.710> then<00:06:55.830> to<00:06:55.949> make<00:06:56.069> sure

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:56.279 
them every now and then to make sure

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.969 
them every now and then to make sure
that<00:06:56.490> studs<00:06:56.999> never<00:06:57.330> back<00:06:57.839> out<00:06:58.050> is<00:06:58.259> they<00:06:58.830> ever

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
that studs never back out is they ever

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:00.649 
that studs never back out is they ever
do<00:06:59.249> make<00:06:59.490> sure<00:06:59.520> you<00:06:59.699> get<00:06:59.909> thread<00:07:00.209> lock<00:07:00.449> in

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659 
do make sure you get thread lock in

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.600 
do make sure you get thread lock in
there<00:07:00.839> don't<00:07:00.990> don't<00:07:01.680> keep<00:07:01.889> messing<00:07:02.550> around

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
there don't don't keep messing around

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.109 
there don't don't keep messing around
with<00:07:02.819> the<00:07:02.849> problem<00:07:03.270> like<00:07:03.419> that<00:07:04.939> but<00:07:06.800> that's<00:07:07.800> it

00:07:08.109 --> 00:07:08.119 
with the problem like that but that's it

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:11.149 
with the problem like that but that's it
engines<00:07:09.119> mounted<00:07:09.439> ready<00:07:10.439> to<00:07:10.619> go<00:07:10.770> now<00:07:11.009> we're
