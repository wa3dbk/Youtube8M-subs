good just as useful as it was a model if
I<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:33.260> I'm<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.620> running<00:00:34.800> around<00:00:35.010> trying

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
I do so I'm just running around trying

I do so I'm just running around trying
to<00:00:35.520> figure<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:35.850> what<00:00:36.090> spawns<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> all

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
to figure out what spawns on and all

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
to figure out what spawns on and all
that<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:39.120> course<00:00:40.460> people<00:00:41.460> play<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> game

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
that and of course people play the game

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.810 
that and of course people play the game
a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.450> more<00:00:42.660> see<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.010> padrinos<00:00:44.579> or

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
a lot more see what one padrinos or

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
a lot more see what one padrinos or
everything<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.539> map<00:00:45.719> already<00:00:46.100> so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
everything is that on the map already so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.900 
everything is that on the map already so
i<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.879> exploring<00:00:49.550> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.319 

this<00:00:54.480> map<00:00:54.690> seems<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.260> balanced<00:00:56.000> once<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
this map seems pretty balanced once you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.979 
this map seems pretty balanced once you
get<00:00:57.420> later<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> video<00:00:59.690> we're<00:01:00.690> taking

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
get later on in the video we're taking

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920 
get later on in the video we're taking
the<00:01:01.080> lead<00:01:01.520> see<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.700> person<00:01:02.850> non<00:01:03.540> right<00:01:03.720> behind

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the lead see one person non right behind

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
the lead see one person non right behind
me<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.140> there<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:10.560> kind<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.979> reminds

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
me of a little bit bigger version of

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.050 
me of a little bit bigger version of
rust<00:01:14.729> from<00:01:15.479> modern<00:01:15.750> warfare<00:01:15.900> 2<00:01:16.760> just<00:01:17.760> use<00:01:17.910> all

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
rust from modern warfare 2 just use all

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.749 
rust from modern warfare 2 just use all
the<00:01:18.150> cranes<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.680> third<00:01:19.920> taking<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> least

the cranes the third taking the least

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.700 
the cranes the third taking the least
things<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:23.360> try<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> find<00:01:24.690> a<00:01:24.869> little

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
things like that try to find a little

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.490 
things like that try to find a little
maid<00:01:25.890> pre-fire<00:01:26.399> kind<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.729> thing<00:01:26.820> right<00:01:26.970> there

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
maid pre-fire kind of thing right there

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.820 
maid pre-fire kind of thing right there
didn't<00:01:28.500> work<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:33.020> also<00:01:34.020> their<00:01:34.259> minds<00:01:34.470> mean

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
didn't work so also their minds mean

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.630 
didn't work so also their minds mean
other<00:01:36.500> forget<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.710> map<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.130> called<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.550> was

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
me

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.410 
me
just<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> whole<00:01:50.070> construction<00:01:50.670> site<00:01:51.030> feel<00:01:51.270> of

just the whole construction site feel of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.410 
just the whole construction site feel of
it<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.130> think<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.400> lot<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> mattress<00:01:54.060> names

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it I think a lot of the mattress names

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.230 
it I think a lot of the mattress names
are<00:01:54.630> phony<00:01:55.020> formats<00:01:55.549> care<00:01:56.549> package<00:01:56.909> rate<00:01:57.090> for

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
are phony formats care package rate for

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
are phony formats care package rate for
direction<00:01:57.630> or<00:01:57.810> drop<00:01:58.200> zone<00:01:58.440> that's<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.310> my

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
direction or drop zone that's just my

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.780 
direction or drop zone that's just my
opinion<00:02:01.190> I'm<00:02:02.190> just<00:02:02.310> trying<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.580> find

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
opinion I'm just trying to find

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.640 
opinion I'm just trying to find
different<00:02:02.880> Nate<00:02:03.299> spots<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.170> use<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
different Nate spots that I can use that

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.830 
different Nate spots that I can use that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
like a lot of open gun fights almost

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.750 
like a lot of open gun fights almost
stuff<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> hide<00:02:24.690> behind<00:02:25.340> I've<00:02:26.340> noticed<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
stuff to hide behind I've noticed that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.030 
stuff to hide behind I've noticed that
drop<00:02:27.209> shotting<00:02:27.510> isn't<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.170> useful<00:02:28.380> as<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.800> was

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
drop shotting isn't as useful as it was

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.320 
drop shotting isn't as useful as it was
