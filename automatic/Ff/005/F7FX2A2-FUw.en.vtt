00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
growth on the raspberry planet but here

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.970 
growth on the raspberry planet but here
it<00:03:57.360> looks<00:03:57.600> like<00:03:57.690> maybe<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.170> chickens<00:03:58.560> got<00:03:58.769> to

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
to life now it's a lot of raspberries

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.990 
to life now it's a lot of raspberries
goes<00:05:10.930> from<00:05:11.080> there<00:05:12.090> all<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.630> way<00:05:13.750> down<00:05:14.050> all<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
goes from there all the way down all the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.380 
goes from there all the way down all the
way<00:05:16.780> down<00:05:17.140> to<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.500> very<00:05:17.710> end<00:05:18.100> down<00:05:18.430> there<00:05:18.700> a

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:29.700 

lot<00:05:22.390> of<00:05:22.450> raspberries<00:05:26.850> critters

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
lot of raspberries critters

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.170 
lot of raspberries critters
so<00:05:30.460> r<00:05:30.490> in<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.390> orchard<00:05:32.170> I<00:05:32.380> guess<00:05:33.090> we're<00:05:34.090> all

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
so r in the orchard I guess we're all

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.870 
so r in the orchard I guess we're all
the<00:05:34.270> fruit<00:05:34.480> trees<00:05:34.750> are<00:05:35.220> and<00:05:36.220> i<00:05:36.340> thought<00:05:36.580> this

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
the fruit trees are and i thought this

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.020 
the fruit trees are and i thought this
here<00:05:37.180> would<00:05:37.330> be<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.510> good<00:05:37.810> spot<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.760> plant<00:05:39.760> a

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
here would be a good spot to plant a

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.730 
here would be a good spot to plant a
tree<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:42.150> i<00:05:43.150> got<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.540> whole<00:05:43.750> pretty<00:05:44.170> much<00:05:44.380> dug

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
tree and i got the whole pretty much dug

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.980 
tree and i got the whole pretty much dug
and<00:05:45.100> i<00:05:45.760> noticed<00:05:46.150> that<00:05:46.390> there<00:05:46.600> was<00:05:46.720> a<00:05:46.750> water

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
and i noticed that there was a water

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.310 
and i noticed that there was a water
pipe<00:05:47.910> PVC<00:05:48.910> pipe<00:05:49.120> for<00:05:49.360> the<00:05:49.420> sprinkler<00:05:49.930> system

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
pipe PVC pipe for the sprinkler system

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.250 
pipe PVC pipe for the sprinkler system
and<00:05:50.470> stuff<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:51.520> I<00:05:52.120> said<00:05:52.420> that<00:05:52.690> was<00:05:52.840> not<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.020> good

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
and stuff and I said that was not a good

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.610 
and stuff and I said that was not a good
spot<00:05:53.530> for<00:05:53.560> the<00:05:54.070> tree<00:05:54.480> so<00:05:55.480> he<00:05:55.930> put<00:05:56.350> it<00:05:56.440> right

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
spot for the tree so he put it right

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:05.670 
spot for the tree so he put it right
over<00:05:57.570> oh<00:05:59.430> this<00:06:00.570> is<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:03.600> you<00:06:04.600> see<00:06:04.660> that<00:06:04.900> Asian
