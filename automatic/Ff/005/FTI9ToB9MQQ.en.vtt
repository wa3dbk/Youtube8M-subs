00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.469
 it is more than it is for the big thanks to your fidelity and the site 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.969
 is with this idea or its second year of existence about that served a 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.900
 drop in the number of videos offered this year immediately 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.550
 specific reasons for this lack of productivity of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 my part 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.609
 you do not imagine normally 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.660
 as for the last ones it's time now to take stock of the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.830
 simple minds that gave me the most pleasure and it is healthy party favors 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.730
 unlike other energies 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.990
 Let's go 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.899
 if you are a fan of strategy games 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.370
 if the difficulties do not scare you and if you love to poke around 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.719
 second hand stores where are the flea markets you should see 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.570
 your account with for date 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 ok this is not what we can see a little shorter today but it takes 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.270
 remember that the game turns on the first that these chains and that under 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.300
 its finesse tunes actually hides an incredibly rich storyline 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.200
 tactical possibilities elaborated a nice gameplay and a whole 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.810
 swarm of very endearing characters the game forbids the webzine this 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.550
 which increases even harder challenge 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.670
 master once you've tasted it it's hard to get rid of it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.950
 and when we learn in addition that there are two different ends there is even 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.890
 what to do again 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 the second point 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.440
 where he did very hard this year 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.190
 while the launch of the console was only accompanied by a few 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.980
 good games for a whole lot of others completely naze things 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.880
 are balancing softly with developers who seems to be mastering 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.180
 better and better support 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.500
 10 to stop the coliseum is a game built like a big action movie 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.270
 critics have shunned him but in the volunteer blood series of buyers 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.500
 is really a gem that it would be a shame neighborhoods 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.170
 perhaps too easy the player nevertheless remains very varied well done and 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.820
 then three members at pressure 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.229
 it's not always that we've been in the middle of a tremor 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.849
 land as well made 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.150
 between volcanic eruptions tsunamis 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.250
 the rain storms the landslides all the time and the one that is going to 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.970
 running the big one will even have to stuff the three bands of responsible terrorists 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.229
 of kidnapping so one of his friends 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.260
 if we want to disregard the added driving 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.610
 the game adds the good points with a particular end that is worth its weight 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.209
 flags 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.670
 fans of novelties and action they will find without problem their 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.670
 costs 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.349
 then we go out and throw away their weapons 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.140
 the most popular group of all football lovers without suspecting 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.769
 that there will always be 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.859
 with a one-of-a-kind stick a flawless achievement the glory you 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.319
 place at the controls of one of the most lethal destructive machines seen 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.849
 to date in a video game thanks to intuitive controls and a 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.510
 intelligent use of motion sensors it will have never been so 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.129
 fun to drive the head of a pub in the toilet bowl or chooz granby 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.039
 against an interested tree since 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.779
 we could have feared a repetitive game but the many environments 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.229
 heap graphics of mini-games and weapons sales of wild and eric 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.680
 provost well done to allow you to always have something to do without ever 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:28.259
 weary 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.869
 and in addition to the historical places to get help 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:34.239
 ok the game is not for all players but all those who regret 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.519
 the time and everything will be fine 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.379

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.949

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:41.940
 and for once 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.600
 gesticulate like a momentum in front of his screen with his joystick 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 at the second really do

 again where he surprises us with sumptuous graphics a 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.129
 atmosphere that will recall some great classics of science fiction 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.060
 with a scenario that will take you to visit many planets of 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:21.199

 episode makes more taker to the series the whole is obviously crowned with a 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.900
 seamless playability but the opposite would have been surprising 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.780
 all the ingredients come together to make this game one of the most 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.059
 interesting from the console 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.150
