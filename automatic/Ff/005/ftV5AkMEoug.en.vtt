the combat and I'm not just talking

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.039 
the combat and I'm not just talking
about<00:03:11.640> stages<00:03:12.120> where<00:03:12.269> random<00:03:12.599> things<00:03:12.810> can

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
about stages where random things can

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:13.520 
about stages where random things can
happen

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
happen

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.500

those<00:03:13.799> are<00:03:13.980> cool<00:03:14.099> for<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.370> party<00:03:14.670> aspect<00:03:15.060> but

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
those are cool for the party aspect but

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.280 
those are cool for the party aspect but
look<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.700> platform<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:18.269> would<00:03:18.959> never

happen in Street Fighter or Tekken and

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.119 
happen in Street Fighter or Tekken and
think<00:03:21.569> about<00:03:21.750> how<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.900> affects<00:03:22.019> combat<00:03:22.860> if

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
think about how it affects combat if

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.979

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
outcomes and options are so much

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.949 
outcomes and options are so much

that's<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:49.379> freakin<00:03:50.220> unique

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359
