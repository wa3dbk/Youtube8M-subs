00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.070
 good if chulerÃ­as in the day today 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.380
 I bring this look is a look a little bit 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.630
 more dramatic for these holidays 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.100
 since the lovers 210 come around 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.930
 of friendship and all those things too 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.420
 cool that we love project in my 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.119
 proposal if you like how do you know 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.850
 I invite you to give him two little eyes 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.400
 I leave with the video 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.250
 Moya and I have a makeup we will 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.730
 get us to use as best is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.470
 use with each other to king 55 inc 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 pink and how they work best 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.990
 correct is never with your finger are we going to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.480
 power the crime 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.860
 we put a little bit not much I already have 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.800
 here a little but I'm going to finish 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.860
 put it for you to see 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.720
 as taken with the finger bit by bit 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.199
 I will use it as a basis for this 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.420
 look with a little and faded with this 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.870
 part of you see that he bent his finger 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.040
 so why blur a little 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.580
 because it will not be noticed either 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.610
 ok and now this look we are going to do 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.690
 basically complete with this palette of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.840
 it's so cool 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.460
 if he's dusting the paddles in 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.320
 I do not really love him very much and I wanted to 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.930
 give him love in this look this is the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.210
 736 hit the football which is what they are a 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.300
 marabout and for this look we are going to 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.400
 start using 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.400
 this color is here but here 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.970
 this army is like it's a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.590
 a purple with a gold in a mixture 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.670
 and this I 'm going to put on the eyelid 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.610
 full mobile 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.380
 above the extension arch with a 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.570
 blurring skewer we will use 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.580
 this color that is here below this that 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.780
 it's here it's a little darker the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.440
 purple 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.250
 Dark 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.230
 with glitters in rositas and we are going to 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.850
 use it very carefully so that you do not 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.800
 mess this up here because as they 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.140
 I say they are very dusty I have a 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.240
 Smudge to blur and I'll put here 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.120
 in the as external and we're going to 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.100
 blur until you take it as you see here 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.720
 in the basin 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.130
 to define the account a bit and recreate 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.020
 a little what 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.670
 but give him a little more nipples 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.620
 depth that's why I credit that 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.570
 almost we will make full with 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.460
 this palette I'm going to use this there 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.040
 donor also back again from 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.900
 turn water and I use this black 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.160
 mate that has a little bit more 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.560
 because then I pigment a lot 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.600
 and the line is very little here 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.940
 Give it a little bit of depth 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.070
 and now with a flat brush I'm going 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.460
 use in the same palette more than this 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.460
 nice that is a flesh color 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.880
 a little bit and we illuminate here below 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.480
 the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.540
 of the eyebrows and helps us to blur 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.240
 the color little purple this we have 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.550
 here 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.010
 on the black bass track 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.810
 in the entire water line now we are going to 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.630
 define my eyebrows you have to me 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.520
 they asked in the looked are and tattooed 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.480
 with marked but I always the before 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.370
 fine use this one of maybelline 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.720
 as I told them at the beginning everything 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.290
 use was in the box 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.290
 information 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.080
 the little dolphin or step the brush 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.570
 this Friday to the eyelashes already put of 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.660
 mask and I'll be right back 20 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.760
 vector mask layers 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.250
 I'm going to use the sunscreen with this 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.840
 REALTECH manchita or a little 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.840
 bronzer nothing else open 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.340
 I've already put on the sunscreen and now I'm going to 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.980
 put this one that is runaway for the of 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.630
 joy of make and with the same brochita and a 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.620
 little bit nothing more because this pigment 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.620
 much 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.860
 but they would improve basically I'm going 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.660
 saying goodbye with a pink one 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.900
 pale and this is d 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.430
 a clone is called cupcake and this is weak 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.079
 And control 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.400
 which is the one that is going to give you as the 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.090
 I touched 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.060
 to the lips and this is basically the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.400
 look 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.549
 my proposal if you liked the little finger 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.740
 up if obviously to hydrate well 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.419

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.310
