00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
hours a day which is way too much for

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.890 
hours a day which is way too much for
the<00:01:38.189> power<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.700> lights<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.210> got<00:01:39.479> flowing

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the power of lights that I got flowing

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.760 
the power of lights that I got flowing
in<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.110> tank<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.750> past<00:01:43.259> week<00:01:43.560> or<00:01:43.710> so

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
in this tank so you know past week or so

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.010 
in this tank so you know past week or so
I've<00:01:44.070> powered<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> down<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> consistent

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
I've powered that down to a consistent

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.200 
I've powered that down to a consistent
eight<00:01:46.200> hours<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> be

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
eight hours and then I'm going to be

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
eight hours and then I'm going to be
even<00:01:48.329> power<00:01:48.720> down<00:01:49.170> probably<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.950> bit

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
even power down probably a little bit

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.870 
even power down probably a little bit
more<00:01:50.430> than<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> seven<00:01:51.360> hours<00:01:52.640> but<00:01:53.640> now

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
more than that to seven hours but now

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
more than that to seven hours but now
let's<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.619> 1030<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.799> my<00:01:55.979> house<00:01:56.219> and
