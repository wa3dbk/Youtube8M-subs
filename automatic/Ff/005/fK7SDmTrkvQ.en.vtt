00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.969
 new video on my channel today 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.230
 I want to set up the first meeting 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.990
 you end no it's not really a 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.490
 go first but first 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.830
 video of the kind what in fact that one 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.790
 can see on my channel anyway 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.680
 it's videos a little bit of 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.029
 discussions I mentioned the thing 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.739
 lately on facebook where I had 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.300
 want to talk to you about 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.950
 some topics always around the book 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.419
 without necessarily making interact 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.700
 books directly as a meat and 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.640
 other readings of the top ten tags etc 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.840
 we have to answer questions just 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.460
 here is to ask in addition you have 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.350
 noticed lately low 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.690
 the cad has legs I would just have a 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.890
 a little bit lower in fact that's in 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.600
 my little reading chair that comes 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.740
 from ikea if ever here I know that 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.390
 you are several to ask the question 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.710
 in case I was going to spend quite small 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.630
 video that already exists certainly 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.350
 elsewhere and here I invent nothing at all 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.750
 it's not the goal 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.950
 I did not want to debate because 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.630
 I do not like the word debate I think enough 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.390
 negative in any case personally he 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.290
 evokes me rather negative than positive 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.180
 but suddenly I did not want to 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.119
 month discussion to settle down 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.350
 to talk about any subject the subject 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.579
 I wanted to address today it was 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.770
 compared to the reading failure that 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.479
 I had in June when I had my 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.380
 part of reading I had told myself that 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.729
 I make an article must I 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.200
 make a video about how I got them 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.540
 lived and that's because it was me 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.110
 never arrived before it's my all 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.820
 first fan of reading and here I am 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.900
 moved on to something else said not too well the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.740
 July match I have because hold on more 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.600
 I have plenty of books 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.180
 so I thought to myself let this 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.760
 negative episode of your life as a reader 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.290
 aside and it's talking to a 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.340
 salty blogger between whom I love 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.630
 a lot with whom I discuss 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.290
 regularly by comments 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.820
 interposed viano blog where she spoke l2 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.380
 it's not from his reading failure but from his 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.450
 reading break she instead called 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.940
 like that and I found that month 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.350
 was pretty well chosen described enough 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.150
 well finally what I had 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.530
 felt also but I had not 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.450
 perceived right away that I had it 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.010
 felt like that so in June 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.340
 I make a big play down or 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.100
 I read three books barely 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.710
 hardly even where many times I 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.170
 I almost do not have to force myself 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.490
 but I can still a little bit myself 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.200
 kick my ass for me 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.739
 say by asia margolies 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 what finally here is and it is during this 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.690
 reading failure I was telling myself 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.739
 negatively speaking if you do not say it 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.840
 go and offer them what 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.459
 and I still had the spirit of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.030
 chain in mind the spirit of the job in 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.129
 head 12 m and thin hand if you do not read 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.959
 will be outdated and August will have nothing left 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.819
 to say that finally it happened so 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.160
 all the better and it's today I'm 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.690
 say but you're stupid to have spent that 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.400
 in a negative way 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.680
 a breakdown of reading it can be very 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.970
 positive and that's ultimately the answer to 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.010
 my question was finally in 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.150
 the article of salvation in dhr or clearly 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.700
 she was exposing the fact 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.349
 Well, I did not have the head to that 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.599
 I wanted to let me live 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.849
 I wanted to spend time with 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.140
 the people I like to go to take a 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.480
 glass on a terrace to go to me 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.360
 walk to play with my cats 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.269
 what does it matter really anything else I can 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.859
 not spend a day without reading in 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.940
 general see there reading is 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.609
 become my daily 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.780
 well before I open a chain well 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.639
 before I would like a blog even well 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.600
 before I become booksellers 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.100
 books they have always been part of 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.630
 my life 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.459
 so for me to come one day 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.260
 to say you do not feel like forcing yourself 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.299
 you're not here to feel 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.459
 almost oblige you to read I want to paint 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.079
 is clearly or not that's it's it's 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.290
 even more a passion is my way of 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.540
 life 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.310
 that's it for some people it's from 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.450
 to make good restaurants a few times 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.489
 a week is to go often to 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.680
 cinema is to see their friends 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.090
 their way of life and not me it's the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.169
 reading but sometimes I think 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.400
 some passions can be a little 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.230
 little too present 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.599
 at times and can we 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.919
 destroy a little bit but without really 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.150
 want him to reims and not really it's 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.660
 really not negative what I mean 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.329
 it's m 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.160
 it is clear that we are so 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.590
 deep in our passion that after a 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.359
 month she eats us a little bit and 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.099
 unfortunately we avail ourselves 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.200
 can more then there are people to 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.180
 which will never happen and I am very 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.530
 happy for them people who do not 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.090
 perceive it may be absolutely not 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.410
 as I come 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.569
 describe and again I am very 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.560
 happy for her but that's me 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.099
 really that's my point of view in 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.470
 this video 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.790
 if you need one day to take two 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.879
 weeks to read a 400-page book 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.379
 and so what if a week does not 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.660
 at all want to dive turn into a 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.000
 book I painted too bad here's the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.549
 world will not stop turning the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.449
 customers are not going to leave the bookstore 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.680
 because you got nothing to them 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.650
 advise you can always their 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.820
 advisers of old favorites 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.669
 here and even on the channel I 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.700
 always topics to discuss with you 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.090
 without telling me marc gut has not had enough of 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.770
 books 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.540
 what are you going to say to them no 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.520
 finally it was actually I got 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.120
 damn the pressure all alone like a 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.130
 great 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.889
 while no one has put me 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.240
 no one has demanded of me that I read 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.710
 so many books a month 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.330
 that may be something that 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.830
 came with village tube it may be 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.560
 something that came with the fact 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.520
 to work in bookstore I do not know 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.830
 but suddenly the palm of reading 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.419
 take a step back from that and get me 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.310
 makes it clear that if at any given moment 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.669
 I did not say well, it was not 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.470
 serious 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.699
 this is just for me the 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.990
 Reading is above all a passion and 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.590
 even though I managed to make my 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.990
 craft etc 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.360
 it allows to live today to 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.130
 through the bookstore bah so much better 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.320
 it's really nice to be able to live 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.460
 of his passion but he must not 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.289
 that passion or destroy 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.430
 because afterwards it's like 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.550
 when we do a job we do not like 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.590
 it would have gone to the same thing in 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.910
 done and it was this price I pay them 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.979
 but actually in my reading paw 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.690
 I really thought it was that and 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.550
 finally when I'm out I'm 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.740
 realized that ben no it's not 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.720
 serious finally it happens to everyone there 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.860
 do not be ashamed of that it's all we 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.690
 not eat of machines 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.370
 books what are we to say what is 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.510
 we have a life next door we have a job 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.940
 general or studies 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.860
 we have friends we have other passions than 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.030
 reading in general and it's not 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.620
 as far as I do not like challenges 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.720
 for example, I love immersing myself in a 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.940
 weekend at 1000 because that's it 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.320
 my body and my mind tell me 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.570
 fridges go on you can go 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.180
 well here's an entire weekend to do that 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.130
 I psychologically I'm ready 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.320
 but at other weeks where I would say ben 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.150
 no it is not possible there are certain 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.280
 disappointment of the weekend aminu I say stop 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.840
 art is by the way the last I did 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.940
 not successful but it was consciously 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.920
 I have not succeeded in ten years so go 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.720
 go ahead lily you can do that I have 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.130
 says after seven hundred pages stops 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.680
 you do not feel like you have more in bed 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.850
 book is great but here I was 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.250
 want to do editing before 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.390
 to write articles for that 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.340
 stop there in fact eventually 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.990
 I hope that you enjoyed not hesitate 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.550
 not suddenly leave me review 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.260
 reading or poses failures 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.570
 reading if it's beneficial to you 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.090
 rather negative if you already have one with 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.980
 a lot if you have if it has you 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.720
 allowed to maybe take some 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.600
 distance from reading that 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.800
 you may not have necessarily 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.030
 finally that's all that leaves me in 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.310
 comment would really make me happy 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.540
 to read you to answer you and to 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.470
 chatting are you going around this 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.640
 little theme we can say here I 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.870
 kiss you very hard I wish 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.220
 still very beautiful readings in 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.230
 hoping you will not have a breakdown in 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.530
 any case full of big kisses to a 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.530
 any next
