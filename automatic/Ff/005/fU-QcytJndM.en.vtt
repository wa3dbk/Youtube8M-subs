been great experience definitely helped

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.020 
been great experience definitely helped
me<00:00:34.460> out<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.579> lot

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
me out a lot

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.000 
me out a lot
scaling<00:00:35.600> sized<00:00:35.809> things<00:00:36.079> with<00:00:36.379> fresh<00:00:36.739> shoes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
scaling sized things with fresh shoes

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.979 
scaling sized things with fresh shoes
and<00:00:37.280> keep<00:00:37.820> them<00:00:37.910> close<00:00:38.120> my<00:00:38.360> back<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:38.780> looking

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
and keep them close my back and looking

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.319 
and keep them close my back and looking
good<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.040> pushes<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.460> lot<00:00:40.670> harder<00:00:40.850> just

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
good so it pushes you a lot harder just

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.910 
good so it pushes you a lot harder just
to<00:00:41.449> probably<00:00:42.080> give<00:00:42.230> something<00:00:42.530> back<00:00:42.559> to<00:00:42.830> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
to probably give something back to the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.290 
to probably give something back to the
brand<00:00:45.070> when<00:00:46.070> I<00:00:46.100> first<00:00:46.400> found<00:00:46.610> out<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.820> trip<00:00:47.180> to

about it before I got told I sort of had
no<00:00:55.309> idea<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:55.910> I<00:00:56.120> just<00:00:56.360> didn't<00:00:56.660> think<00:00:56.690> it<00:00:56.870> was

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
no idea but I just didn't think it was

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.079 
no idea but I just didn't think it was
going<00:00:57.110> real<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:58.010> then<00:00:58.400> I<00:00:58.519> found<00:00:58.790> out<00:00:58.940> I<00:00:59.000> was

going real and then I found out I was

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.399 
going real and then I found out I was
just<00:00:59.239> over<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.690> moon<00:00:59.720> I<00:00:59.989> couldn't<00:01:00.320> believe

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
the team so I was pretty psyched that

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.080

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
it like everyone gets on really great I

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.160 
it like everyone gets on really great I
don't<00:01:10.640> think<00:01:10.850> anyone<00:01:11.180> had<00:01:11.360> one<00:01:11.600> argument<00:01:11.869> the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
don't think anyone had one argument the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.560 
don't think anyone had one argument the
whole<00:01:12.290> trip<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:12.920> mean<00:01:13.100> could<00:01:13.729> face<00:01:14.150> to<00:01:14.360> face

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
whole trip so I mean could face to face

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:31.110 
whole trip so I mean could face to face
for<00:01:14.750> five<00:01:14.990> days<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:15.260> think<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.619> did<00:01:15.770> pretty<00:01:15.799> well

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.450 

worst<00:01:32.120> part<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.510> trip<00:01:32.960> wasn't<00:01:33.470> bad<00:01:33.800> but<00:01:34.040> but<00:01:34.370> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
worst part a trip wasn't bad but but the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.250 
worst part a trip wasn't bad but but the
worst<00:01:34.670> part<00:01:34.940> for<00:01:35.000> me<00:01:35.150> myself<00:01:35.690> was<00:01:35.930> probably

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
worst part for me myself was probably

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.460 
worst part for me myself was probably
spotting<00:01:37.220> my<00:01:37.310> shin<00:01:37.580> on<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.000> first<00:01:38.300> day<00:01:38.540> or<00:01:38.960> the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
spotting my shin on the first day or the

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.680 
spotting my shin on the first day or the
first<00:01:39.620> skate<00:01:39.950> park<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.340> think<00:01:40.550> it<00:01:40.670> was<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:41.630> it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
first skate park I think it was so it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.570 
first skate park I think it was so it
was<00:01:41.720> pretty<00:01:41.900> gutting<00:01:42.350> but<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.800> didn't<00:01:43.340> care<00:01:43.550> I

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
was pretty gutting but I didn't care I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.370 
was pretty gutting but I didn't care I
just<00:01:43.760> had<00:01:43.970> bloody<00:01:44.270> socks<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.810> rest<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.140> trip

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
just had bloody socks the rest the trip

00:01:45.380 --> 00:02:03.710
