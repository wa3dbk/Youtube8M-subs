video<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.989> first<00:00:01.170> attempt<00:00:01.560> was<00:00:01.650> way<00:00:01.800> too<00:00:01.860> long

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
video the first attempt was way too long

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.039 
video the first attempt was way too long
so<00:00:02.280> I'll<00:00:02.370> try<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.610> go<00:00:02.879> through<00:00:03.449> very<00:00:03.840> quickly

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
so I'll try to go through very quickly

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.470 
so I'll try to go through very quickly
there<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> method<00:00:05.310> at<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.910> moment<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
there is a method at the moment the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.509 
there is a method at the moment the
golden<00:00:06.810> opportunity<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.620> get<00:00:07.859> rid<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.069> all<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
golden opportunity to get rid of all the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.820 
golden opportunity to get rid of all the
banks<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:08.910> all<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.570> exploitative<00:00:10.080> activity

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
banks in all the exploitative activity

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.419 
banks in all the exploitative activity
that<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.610> has<00:00:12.300> been<00:00:12.540> let's<00:00:13.380> say<00:00:13.559> bugging<00:00:14.309> us

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
that is has been let's say bugging us

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.910 
that is has been let's say bugging us
for<00:00:14.700> years<00:00:14.880> now<00:00:15.230> basically<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> core<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
for years now basically the core of the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.980 
for years now basically the core of the
of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> argument<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:17.910> usually<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.869> have

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
of the argument is that usually you have

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.840 
of the argument is that usually you have
a<00:00:19.050> central<00:00:19.529> bank<00:00:19.710> interest<00:00:20.039> rates<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.550> always

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
a central bank interest rates you always

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.820 
a central bank interest rates you always
have<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.810> paradoxical<00:00:22.439> thing

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
have that and it's paradoxical thing

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.410 
have that and it's paradoxical thing
because<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> central<00:00:23.760> bank<00:00:23.970> loans<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
because if the central bank loans you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
because if the central bank loans you
out<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> hundred<00:00:24.930> euro<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:26.010> five<00:00:26.250> percent

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
out a hundred euro with five percent

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.599 
out a hundred euro with five percent
interest<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.090> expects<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.720> pay<00:00:27.750> 105<00:00:28.650> yer

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609

interest it expects you to pay 105 yer
old<00:00:29.760> back<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> year<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.470> where<00:00:31.710> does<00:00:31.890> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
old back in the year but where does that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.430

5 euro from it come from it never was

5 euro from it come from it never was
there<00:00:34.860> nobody<00:00:35.309> ever<00:00:35.550> issued<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.020> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
there nobody ever issued it so so in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.799 
there nobody ever issued it so so in
those<00:00:37.680> five<00:00:38.010> euros<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.670> actually<00:00:39.030> some<00:00:39.420> asset

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
those five euros are actually some asset

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.119 
those five euros are actually some asset
that<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.260> something<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.890> own

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that you have something that you own

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.639 
that you have something that you own
something<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.879> built<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:42.540> created<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
something that you built or created and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.139 
something that you built or created and
you<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> give<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> bank<00:00:44.760> that's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you have to give that to the bank that's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.389 
you have to give that to the bank that's
how<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> bank<00:00:45.660> basically<00:00:46.200> pushes<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
how the bank basically pushes you to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.830 
how the bank basically pushes you to
create<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:49.050> grow<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.520> time<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.510> central

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
create and grow all the time the central

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.189 
create and grow all the time the central
bank<00:00:51.870> interest<00:00:52.289> rate<00:00:53.180> requires<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.989> grow

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bank interest rate requires you to grow

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.900 
bank interest rate requires you to grow
it<00:00:55.710> forces<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> economy<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.600> produce<00:00:58.020> new

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
it forces the economy to produce new

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.670 
it forces the economy to produce new
assets<00:00:59.910> new<00:01:00.000> good<00:01:00.300> products<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.780> services<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
assets new good products or services to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830 
assets new good products or services to
conquer<00:01:02.010> new<00:01:02.129> lands<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> exploit<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.480> people

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
conquer new lands to exploit more people

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.649 
conquer new lands to exploit more people
and<00:01:04.220> it's<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.369> unnecessary<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.299> central

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and it's all unnecessary the central

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
and it's all unnecessary the central
bank<00:01:06.869> interest<00:01:07.170> rates<00:01:07.439> usually<00:01:08.220> about<00:01:08.760> four

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
bank interest rates usually about four

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 
bank interest rates usually about four
percent<00:01:09.240> which<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.960> basically<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
percent which is basically the what is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.719 
percent which is basically the what is
assumed<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.150> carrying<00:01:12.630> capacity<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
assumed the carrying capacity of the

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
assumed the carrying capacity of the
population<00:01:14.729> by<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> banks<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.590> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
population by the banks and this is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
population by the banks and this is
really<00:01:16.830> how<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.549> reasoning<00:01:18.030> about<00:01:18.240> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
really how they are reasoning about it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.590 
really how they are reasoning about it
it's<00:01:18.630> four<00:01:18.900> percent<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.619> say<00:01:20.280> okay

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
it's four percent so you say okay

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.170 
it's four percent so you say okay
population<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.840> carry<00:01:22.500> about<00:01:22.770> four<00:01:23.009> percent

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
population can carry about four percent

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.499 
population can carry about four percent
interest<00:01:24.180> rate<00:01:24.360> burden<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.670> reap<00:01:27.270> all

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
interest rate burden and we can reap all

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.359 
interest rate burden and we can reap all
that<00:01:27.689> money<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> central<00:01:28.560> bank<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.920> course<00:01:29.189> we

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that money a central bank of course we

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
that money a central bank of course we
get<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> assets<00:01:30.390> from<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.659> defaulting

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
get all the assets from the defaulting

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.450 
get all the assets from the defaulting
companies<00:01:31.650> there's<00:01:31.829> always<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.310> the

companies there's always some the
default<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> nobody<00:01:33.360> cares<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:34.229> but

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
default and nobody cares about them but

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
default and nobody cares about them but
we<00:01:34.560> get<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> stuff<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> rest<00:01:36.750> will

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
we get all that stuff and the rest will

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
we get all that stuff and the rest will
work<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.320> hard<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> grow<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> grow<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
work really hard to grow and grow and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.590 
work really hard to grow and grow and
they<00:01:38.610> will<00:01:38.790> always<00:01:38.970> need<00:01:39.270> our<00:01:39.420> services

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
they will always need our services

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
strange why do they do that also why do

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.110 
strange why do they do that also why do
they<00:03:27.950> make<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.220> much<00:03:28.370> more<00:03:28.610> noise<00:03:28.850> about

restart<00:03:29.570> in<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.750> economy<00:03:30.170> that's<00:03:30.320> basically

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
restart in the economy that's basically

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.130 
restart in the economy that's basically
because<00:03:30.950> their<00:03:31.160> model<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.610> dying<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.810> model

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
because their model is dying the model

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.259 
because their model is dying the model
