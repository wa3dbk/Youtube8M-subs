 him are either ordinary cardio

 accelerated sprint 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.380

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.260
 the gym for example on a treadmill 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.730

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.940
 each time running acceleration of the main 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.550
 goal to improve the previous time select 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.310
 yourself one distance for example from 100 to 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.790
 400 meters and try every time 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.650
 run this distance a little faster than 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.870
 previous time lazar do not 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.880
 lengthy map because it can 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.820
 lead to desire for muscle mass 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.169
 much more effective short but very 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.169
 intense cardio session 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.319
 late I would like to add an answer to Lazar 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.969
 did some interesting questions 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.489
 correspondents in an interview with him 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:57.919
 asked what has changed now your 

00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:59.809
 life when you achieved what you wanted 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.149
 to which lazar replied 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:04.129
 for some reason people think that if you 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:06.939
 get the body you always dreamed 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:09.469
 then everything else will turn out by itself 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.179
 however, it is much harder to maintain 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:14.379
 its shape for a long time 

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:17.179
 time and it takes no less effort 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:19.729
 than what it was worth to achieve these 

00:05:17.179 --> 00:05:23.149
 the proportions of the forms of the program Lazar Angelov 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.309
 asked and in the next goal he answered I 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:27.139
 I want to continue to promote fitness 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.869
 around the world I would really like 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.959
 do so to body fitness models 

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:35.469
 became the standard of the male body and everything to 

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.469
 they rushed
