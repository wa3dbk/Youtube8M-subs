00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.649
 good morning by a strange tradition all 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:04.100
 soviet motorcycle products 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.359
 was produced in weapons factories not 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.749
 became an exception and tested but also 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.409
 give the signal now in Japanese fashion 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.360
 two-wheeled vehicles and what 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.759
 then a few decades ago 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.580
 most common in 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.220
 USSR rubles 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.310
 why 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.710
 they were called 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.480
 meet nice 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.860
 49 their production began in 1955 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.699
 you can't say no 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.259
 out of 49 there was a collection of czech 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.000
 rethinking the fascist German 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.550
 attack 350 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.580
 poor fellow who is not a secret that the USSR of 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.810
 defeated Germany deduced drawings 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.880
 stankin technology 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 finalized was mainly running 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.900
 part appeared telescopic 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.290
 front fork rear signboard glow 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.100
 shock absorbers 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.350
 for our after military off-road 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.140
 it was extremely important cap on the gas tank 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.460
 instrumental glove box rules 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.450
 traffic those ancient times 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.370
 were much softer than the current did not allow 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.040
 driving without a helmet because then the equipment was not 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.250
 so bright 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.360
 so the ignition keys are not so small 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.410
 from a blow to insert 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.610
 under the seat 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.980
 in junction box interesting 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.660
 coin carburetor feature 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.060
 mixers on the steering wheel if the motors 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.610
 cold enrichment to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 turn counterclockwise to 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.310
 beliefs warming back in place 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.870
 well and 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.680
 no need to learn despite your 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 old age happily begins 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460
 movement and get get up 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.670
 fights that put it mildly striking 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 never guess 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.390
 let's finish i didn't give 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.560
 children and a half horses issued 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.440
 one three hundred and fifty vat 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.570
 cylinder is quite normal for 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 quiet movement 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.570
 maximum speed 40 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.350
 for this only 90 kilometers per hour but 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.110
 gasoline consumption not more than four 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.390
 half liters per 100 kilometers do not know 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.720
 who as well as me 50 and above 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.820
 more than enough that's not 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.310
 I liked it because of the low wheel 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.940
 knees literally blocks it in 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.140
 cornering so you have to sit in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320
 to put it mildly still shot 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.379
 after a while but without him 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.370
 by the way will soon become an important milestone for 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.959
 world economy 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.370
 when such studies fatal 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.919
 for clarification 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.879
 and the forty ninth of mine doesnâ€™t care 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.719
 what transfer to get under way very 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.950
 high-torque engine 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.110
 and what will be kloppa sound very 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.010
 reminds four stroke and here 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.110
 this piece of happiness was worth in those years about 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.110
 three thousand old in overcrowded rubles 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.759
 know over the past decade old 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.339
 soviet motorcycle faded away and the new ones 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.309
 Russian in the same quantity and not 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:48.169
 appeared 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:48.789
 offensively
