 Kvass Kvass from oats 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.450
 hello friends with you about legs 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.929
 loaded and today we will merge 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.480
 the class 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 most recently we left we shot a video 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.529
 about how to make kvass from oats passed 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.500
 literally 3-4 days I didnâ€™t even notice it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.900
 time can kvass already infused and we 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.300
 Now we will merge it and put it again 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.510
 since this yeast can 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 used literally three months 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:42.960
 only need to add water sugar if 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.629
 you make sugar and everything else is all there 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.379
 it remains that is oats who was he there 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.350
 remain 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.690
 I'm going to do it and at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Asahara 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.350
 that is, I lay a tablespoon of honey and 50 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.449
 gram of raisins 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.300
 but let's first merge all the same 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 which us class really for this 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.019
 we take a jar 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.159
 control I took while can be enough with 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:14.000
 there are still a butterfly here a strainer and 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.250
 now we will slowly merge 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.090
 neatly so let's be so 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.090
 half what we did 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.410
 Well, as I expected 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.000
 us in the bath tube could not still 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.300
 here is a three-liter jar 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.470
 and let's have some leftovers too 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:59.490
 enough that's all you need to lay 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:02:05.040
 again here and so the version laid 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 back now laid here i'm in store already 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:16.250

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:47.450
