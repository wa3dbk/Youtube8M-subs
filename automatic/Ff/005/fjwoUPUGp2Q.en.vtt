00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.800 

there<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.829> go<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.280> want<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.090> put<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.359> pan<00:02:21.569> back

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
there we go I want to put the pan back

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.340 
there we go I want to put the pan back
on<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.109> heat<00:02:23.239> take<00:02:24.239> my<00:02:24.420> fresh<00:02:24.660> wash<00:02:24.900> spinach

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
on the heat take my fresh wash spinach

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.120 
on the heat take my fresh wash spinach
go<00:02:26.190> ahead<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.609> add<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.440> pan<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
go ahead and add that to the pan and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.410 
go ahead and add that to the pan and
we're<00:02:29.250> gonna<00:02:29.370> mix<00:02:29.579> that<00:02:29.730> around<00:02:29.880> until<00:02:30.359> it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
we're gonna mix that around until it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.009 
we're gonna mix that around until it
becomes<00:02:30.690> fully<00:02:30.930> wilted<00:02:32.630> now<00:02:33.630> I<00:02:33.660> know<00:02:33.780> this

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
becomes fully wilted now I know this

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.990 
becomes fully wilted now I know this
looks<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.380> lot<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.709> spinach<00:02:35.069> at<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.760> time

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
looks like a lot of spinach at this time

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.879 
looks like a lot of spinach at this time
but<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:36.630> when<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.019> starts<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.319> wilt<00:02:37.560> it'll

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
but it's when it starts to wilt it'll

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.220 
but it's when it starts to wilt it'll
really<00:02:38.069> reduce<00:02:38.549> down<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.239> it'll<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.720> perfect

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
really reduce down and it'll be perfect

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.789 
really reduce down and it'll be perfect
for<00:02:40.290> our<00:02:40.470> mixture<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.920> make<00:02:41.040> our<00:02:41.190> frittata<00:02:42.799> as

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
for our mixture to make our frittata as

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.699 
for our mixture to make our frittata as
you<00:02:44.760> can<00:02:44.880> see<00:02:45.030> our<00:02:45.180> spinach<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.690> reduced<00:02:46.079> it

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
you can see our spinach is reduced it

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.500 
you can see our spinach is reduced it
looks<00:02:46.889> perfect<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.880> we're<00:02:48.000> gonna<00:02:48.090> go<00:02:48.269> ahead

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
looks perfect so we're gonna go ahead

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.720 
looks perfect so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:48.660> add<00:02:48.720> our<00:02:48.750> egg<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.440> our<00:02:49.920> bacon<00:02:50.340> but<00:02:50.519> first

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
and add our egg and our bacon but first

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.339 
and add our egg and our bacon but first
we<00:02:50.849> have<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.120> remove<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.780> spinach<00:02:52.079> from<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
we have to remove the spinach from the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.129 
we have to remove the spinach from the
heat<00:02:52.639> so<00:02:53.639> let's<00:02:53.790> turn<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.120> off<00:02:54.180> we'll<00:02:54.989> move

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
heat so let's turn that off we'll move

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:02.320 
heat so let's turn that off we'll move
it<00:02:55.319> over<00:02:55.530> slightly<00:02:57.139> let's<00:02:58.139> add<00:02:58.260> our<00:02:58.440> froth<00:02:58.680> egg

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.940 

and<00:03:03.330> we'll<00:03:03.870> sprinkle<00:03:04.080> our<00:03:04.320> bacon<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.770> there

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
and we'll sprinkle our bacon in there

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.770 
and we'll sprinkle our bacon in there
but<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.490> also<00:03:05.610> may<00:03:05.940> want<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.360> just<00:03:06.540> leave<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
but we also may want to just leave a

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.920 
but we also may want to just leave a
little<00:03:07.110> bit<00:03:07.550> out<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.180> can<00:03:09.300> add<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.450> after

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
little bit out so we can add that after

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.100 
little bit out so we can add that after
we<00:03:10.020> mix<00:03:13.730> give<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.880> nice<00:03:15.090> mixture<00:03:15.480> give<00:03:15.960> it<00:03:16.080> a

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
we mix give it a nice mixture give it a

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.870 
we mix give it a nice mixture give it a
nice<00:03:16.260> stir<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.130> it's<00:03:17.280> evenly<00:03:17.640> distributed

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
nice stir so it's evenly distributed

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.820 
nice stir so it's evenly distributed
this<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.930> your<00:03:19.080> last<00:03:19.230> time<00:03:19.470> you're<00:03:19.650> gonna<00:03:19.710> be

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
this is your last time you're gonna be

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
this is your last time you're gonna be
able<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.220> stir<00:03:20.460> so<00:03:20.700> get<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:20.970> all<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.270> now<00:03:22.850> now

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
able to stir so get it all out now now

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.340 
able to stir so get it all out now now
that<00:03:24.000> we<00:03:24.120> stirred<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.570> we're<00:03:24.900> gonna<00:03:25.020> go<00:03:25.230> ahead

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
that we stirred it we're gonna go ahead

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.920 
that we stirred it we're gonna go ahead
and<00:03:25.530> put<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:25.980> back<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.190> medium<00:03:26.730> heat<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.240> when

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
and put it back on medium heat and when

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.420 
and put it back on medium heat and when
it<00:03:28.020> starts<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.410> set<00:03:28.650> that's<00:03:28.980> what<00:03:29.160> we're<00:03:29.250> ready

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
it starts to set that's what we're ready

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.080 
it starts to set that's what we're ready
to<00:03:29.550> put<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.970> oven<00:03:31.490> so<00:03:32.490> it<00:03:32.610> looks<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.850> our

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
to put in the oven so it looks like our

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.670 
to put in the oven so it looks like our
frittata<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.660> ready<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.990> go<00:03:34.110> ahead<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.440> put<00:03:34.590> in

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
frittata is ready to go ahead and put in

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.320 
frittata is ready to go ahead and put in
the<00:03:34.770> oven<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.430> best<00:03:35.640> way<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.820> check<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.300> just

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
the oven the best way to check is just

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.240 
the oven the best way to check is just
to<00:03:36.600> make<00:03:36.780> sure<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.650> see<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> edges

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
to make sure that you see that the edges

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.940 
to make sure that you see that the edges
are<00:03:38.730> staying<00:03:39.240> around<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.470> middle<00:03:40.770> is

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
are staying around and the middle is

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.350 
are staying around and the middle is
still<00:03:41.070> quite<00:03:41.459> liquidy<00:03:41.880> because<00:03:42.180> that's

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
still quite liquidy because that's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.900 
still quite liquidy because that's
what's<00:03:42.570> gonna<00:03:42.690> help<00:03:42.870> us<00:03:43.080> cook<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> oven

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
what's gonna help us cook in the oven

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.370 
what's gonna help us cook in the oven
but<00:03:44.910> before<00:03:45.270> I<00:03:45.300> go<00:03:45.420> ahead<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.690> do<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.050> I<00:03:46.170> want

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
but before I go ahead and do that I want

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.690 
but before I go ahead and do that I want
to<00:03:46.440> add<00:03:46.560> some<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.070> sharp<00:03:47.370> cheddar<00:03:47.550> cheese

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
to add some of this sharp cheddar cheese

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.699 
to add some of this sharp cheddar cheese
and<00:03:48.330> we<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.600> want<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.810> sprinkle<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.170> evenly

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
and we just want to sprinkle that evenly

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.350 
and we just want to sprinkle that evenly
over<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:50.040> top<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.550> gets<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.760> nice<00:03:50.880> coating

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
over the top so it gets a nice coating

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.930 
over the top so it gets a nice coating
when<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.810> oven<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.670> preheated<00:03:53.670> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
when it's in the oven I preheated the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.900 
when it's in the oven I preheated the
oven<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.270> 450<00:03:55.020> degrees<00:03:55.350> Fahrenheit<00:03:55.790> make<00:03:56.790> sure

oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit make sure

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.900 
oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit make sure
you<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:57.180> stick<00:03:57.390> an<00:03:57.510> oven-safe<00:03:57.810> pan<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.470> there

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
you just stick an oven-safe pan in there

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.430 
you just stick an oven-safe pan in there
shut<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.000> door<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.510> we'll<00:04:00.930> check<00:04:01.080> in<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.320> 10
