00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.960
 hi everyone so what 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.260
 it would be a small teaser or because I saw the Muslim landscape 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.689
 g messages for that a bit but did not say anything for a few years 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.909
 and for some 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.359
 while juninho 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.300
 ban ki-moon message that should actually 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.029
 at level for 120 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.480
 a motherboard of all the reality cards 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 percent while still I had had not yield to 1 8 millimeter 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.849
 this image 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.380
 what he called tasks so everyone then me it's simple 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.510
 I also do material like that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.610
 in the little thing 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.730
 hahahaha at 3-1 first 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.910
 jean kuete coursan and ginestas eve 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.670
 this piece is a quarter of an hour 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.610
 I really went to the front shot I did not try to understand I 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.270
 disinfect well 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.920
 and 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.790
 when I started then to manage to settle there 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.180
 first 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180
 because they really deserved the most flexible to discard 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.980
 knowing that before I had fun 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.920
 like everyone on the road like everyone 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.190
 experiences 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.360
 annel of the parsley parsley draw persinger who has the most characters 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.300
 in hollow 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
 so I'm going to turn the reality really stretchable 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.800
 so what happened is that the life of a human is extra 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.200
 who knows all of a sudden 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.900
 frankly it's going to go for them from the 3008 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.880
 it was a room it warms a bit it moves a little 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.920
 but it's okay it's not the worst 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 after I made growth always the same ear 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.740
 she cited a little earlier gerard larrat great help 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.200
 these people were not to serve as a weapon 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.620
 these two pairs of glasses 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.080
 I do not have the time to make medals every month 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.550
 traveler files more than anything else 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.590
 so percent and 3 cents I have not even eric carter 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.040
 - I think all our senses and his partner 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.280
 small drum 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.799
 with a big cone-shaped refund 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.970
 you should have gone out, he said 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.419
 after these fantasies 6% each does as he wants 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.619
 and for going there I started deauville and well as it should 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.299
 so I typed a first infection 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.060
 perrin since it went very well the change billion so fast 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.519
 magnificent 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.519
 for 100 th I have a first injection 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.229
 I still kept my feet on the ground because I absolutely wanted 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.319
 the wolf 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.569
 the edile created the label of the hague 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.389
 and to listen costs 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.639
 so I play everyday English and I tell you well as he 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.489
 must be 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.489
 after this fall was greeted awesome happening that is 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.700
 I'm not going entities price is over 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.790
 there was actually sick the victim 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.559
 So here is 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.619
 meanwhile I lost 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.439
 and she's gone 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.840
 I think I'll be there 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.199
 I'll be there everything is nickel plus he was in party 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:05.679
 so I do not know him myself 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.919
 p what i lost the five tgv i'm lost 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.939
 so if the giant 2 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.849
 in e the large spa etc combined at the level of karting marking of moxa is 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.899
 reduce 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.370
 it's really big with a big 1 6% if he regrets 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.369
 for that big diameter that was a source of embarrassment 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:26.899
 bush had neither I lost 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.469
 so there would always be in first line without reserve 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.309
 delticom found normal 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.339
 trap but for how long roughly 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.999
 come per cent 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.999
 only one week before it gets back to normal 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.189
 do you know the dollar never wanted 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.209
 percent after aged and thierry the 1st net 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.699
 and I'm sure the team will unfortunately be 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.869
 that would be it was such an affection why because on this 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.979
 I have city dwellers 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.309
 except that it's plastic and suddenly I had a little trouble with 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.199
 ears 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.309
 indicates the first assistant has gone there to start over at some 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.859
 resistance in the middle of that side 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.859
 they also play them off in five games 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.579
 I bought myself 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.749
 nonsense 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.359
 a large human management market 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.599
 the spreaders on each side so that it could take place 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.159
 I listened behind that if you want the beard I hurt myself 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.509
 at the neck level because they made this match and when I was sleeping 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.509
 we go on the same type of alarm clock I listened a lot 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:33.260
 like that at least 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.629
 it was like I was not bad 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.159
 laughs I said to see but I had to have an affection again this time 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.559
 to always improve obvious of steria 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.210
 I have an affection 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.830
 after a break from home 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.669
 I passed in a minute 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.669
 because he offered me the spacers 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.809
 for him the debts so I said that 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:00.369
 a hair to move 8 millimeters which is that of the ump 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.620
 klépierre is Algerian 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.559
 for that I cut the world 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:07.409
 he is not allied right 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.180
 the candidates that it hurt me the same 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.749
 by gestures and infections very well 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.969
 except that godard and a very unpleasant of the duplex csssae 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:17.159
 plastic 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.159
 so I can not see 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.879
 my character is an English movie% 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.080
 the why of how g20 suits that led to the internet fai 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.939
 this can give ideas the answers I wanted 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.520
 the barça coach 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.020
 and a senate who told me 'go express yourself those who stick to it 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.469
 * renault 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.379
 it's good information you do not think it's what people say 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.379
 this solution allows after-sales service 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.680
 all levels from early March to the hague 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.240
 and at the age of 58 this air intervention had lost 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.309
 yet law enforcement 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:57.939
 and she never lost their roof of europe she titanium him then there 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:58.819
 it's logic 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.379
 but for them not their super strong 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.839
 go now to her always in midinette 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.210
 then the small precision 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.240
 it's enough of 5th is immediate 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.719
 there I have two babies as not possible 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.460
 g half an hour for each ear 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.569
 what I did not want to do master by month 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.089
 I spent them with more than 5 to 8 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.849
 it's simple nobody could touch him ears I had so much 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.059
 of badness 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.699
 what is she doing with cold water whites 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:27.879
 on the ears 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.789
 because I had seen happen any conflict is all red 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.900
 for roland 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.449
 and it burned me, what a lot of people 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.469
 impossible to touch the ears 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.980
 there is a former victim at the head of the city 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.240
 One day 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.770
 because we dare an evening 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.849
 and why not purposely graze her ears 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.400
 by doing the records the music 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.629
 I spoke 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:53.029
 and in fact we do not have a hold on her elaborate the best is that it 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:54.369
 hurts what 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:56.869
 dufour after douala 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:58.960
 to go away now 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.249
 18th 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:03.990
 but very quickly done at arrows they are plastic jada smith 

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:06.849
 and turquoise and the painting is gone 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:07.780
 the title 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.430
 in the smell if the institution I have a little trouble paying attention 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.250
 because he had too much retracts
