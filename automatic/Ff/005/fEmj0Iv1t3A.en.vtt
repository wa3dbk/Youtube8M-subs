00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.950
 the people present to you here 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.460
 relationship I did on my iphone 5's 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.639
 operating system and offset remembering 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.260
 even though the beta version will be a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.840
 experience for you to have an idea 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:27.980
 how is the operating system of the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:33.680
 daer initial reads very well and makes a 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:36.149
 was a 3d screen moving with you 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.820
 Move the device in Mexico with guardianship 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.719
 it is also a system 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.809
 open operating system is still 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.020
 some cities of the desert island on the screen 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.360
 Blocking Character Vaccine 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.239
 Portuguese that keeps law as is 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.239
 totally without giving was only produced 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.379
 on the home screen of ciccone have changed 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.130
 drastically the question is more simple 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.210
 that the time was the previous ones of the system 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.210
 and 86 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.619
 so it's a matter of custom I tried 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.940
 approach the operating system more 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.840
 also a little here at the beginning until yesterday 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.560
 Effect in Article 3 than when you 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 the unit or change the direction of the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.770
 novel that keep stirring 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:40.900
 if they follow the lipstick effect pretty cool 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.560
 part of the applications that you 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.520
 the phone apart from the now cool folders 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.640
 that you can tell how many applications 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.980
 You want an infinite no more than 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.370
 background bidding step will create 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.370
 more 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.579
 but they are there within the stage you are 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.080
 seeing the beta system 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:11.060
 He gives so responds well on the island. 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.010
 strange for example the facetime hakim 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.290
 when you click on the military facetime 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.569
 totally crazy 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 in addition to authenticating it once in a while 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.209
 a line of the ball and only go back not here 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.800
 is working 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.110
 the applications I have installed on 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.549
 one of such bank users is 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.250
 operating normally 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.319
 now I have an application for example 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.319
 which is a camera asset 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.430
 this application a colleague who was in the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:50.940
 car, it's not working, it's not going 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.820
 getting the camera started comes to 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.270
 load and when you can load from 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.510
 so get out 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.040
 I did not like it I did not test the applications - 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.540
 further 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.550
 some believe in the problem in that there the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.870
 Brazilian system is cool 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.030
 some things have no settings 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.990
 also appears in English yet 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.130
 I have something different here nothing 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.880
 in the part of 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.080
 the climate here is the walk 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.080
 I speak of the week 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.620
 is a nifty thing also have to 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.670
 reflect and clock 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.670
 now he 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.360
 the best you could get excited and grab 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.120
 port with a real phone time 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.700
 It's more play this year. 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.280
 calendar application 4 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.560
 that was set to zero in the previous 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.280
 this watch will also leave one of the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.560
 links down there where the law is 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.150
 I do not really advise history 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.620
 even if it supports a beta 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.069
 also if you have enough water 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.750
 installed on your smartphone there can be 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:18.720
 to give a problem I could not stand the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.239
 anxiety in power and everything went well in 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.100
 beginning of July my work I found 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.380
 until it was some problem in the device 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.190
 but then ended up working full 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.190
 safari also changed a little bit 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.280
 That's what each one is, but it's worth it. 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:44.229
 was in chaos and it seems that made the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.849
 your option will leave in September yet 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.830
 anyone who is curious already wants to go out 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.849
 front was at risk and 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.849
 I'll leave nobody underneath. 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.809
 the messages 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:09.839
 the zico expects a good in simple seems 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:13.529
 well then for windows phone it's not lost 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:18.689
 some of the crisis had long had system 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:20.309
 and the team with whom I spoke yes 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:23.659
 bed again something that is essential 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:27.439
 dengue will also steal money 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.439
 necessary departure 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.090
 it was this one 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.090
 Hmm 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.880
 this is it 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.340
 any doubt and nobody down there to 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.930
 you're in a new system state 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.889
 operational 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.889
 a hug
