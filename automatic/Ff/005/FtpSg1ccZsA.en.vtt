00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.980
 and 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.269
 yes he is arrested because he has the conditions then we are already a bit

 we live so paid more money 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.300

 an overview 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.880
 good afternoon there we believe 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.090
 as the Germans could expect 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.760
 Christian Union are still stuck 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.210
 a piece of skull 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.010
 we do not know that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.160
 Berlin and London after the 2 2 0 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.640
 it does not seem that is the basis for the composition of the first 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 room 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.470
 the applicants 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.480
 players like messi 54e sometimes wonder how it goes according to the newspaper 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.430
 daily telegraph the factory 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.630
 The gamerules 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.630
 ask yourself 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.460
 it may be that all customers who divorced 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.280
 Greece immediately announced a gap in between 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.409
 according to the flag situation it is really not a second 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.240
 a blow 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 these are the cars 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 pick up that have been imposed 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
 this process is to choose a new parliament 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.460
 would you think of it 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.130
 especially ing it will not be but 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.130

 damon wayans 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.949
 but also for time 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.139
 he would follow 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.139
 it is therefore ahead 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.599
 rail zone 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.809
 a preliminary round 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:21.889
 the radio station which incidentally all cause the cheapest possible price 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.309
 fire out down 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.209
 then it becomes possible to get your car 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.209
 it was his best lap time at that time 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.009
 not yet know the first round 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.009
 the first start of a race are hard line-ups 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.969
 los angeles 7 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.969
 We expect 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.749
 previously there was a peephole to see these two 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.629
 he beats his 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.279
 after the rest 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.749
 soon was once again a basic place with ac milan 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:32.639
 this is the side of the field 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.639
 and suddenly a piece of cake and sleep disorders 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.559
 on November 21 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.499
 after he had himself 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.599
 then there may be 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.399
 who on it was a titanic battle years ago 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.589
 but I have some better in the competition 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.969
 after a year of living often mr m i will stay a while and indian 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.239
 drive more than 500 kilometers 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.439
