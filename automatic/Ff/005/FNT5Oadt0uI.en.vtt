00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
quality protein that you can find out

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.240 
quality protein that you can find out
there<00:01:36.060> okay<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:38.200> has<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.440> travel<00:01:38.920> all<00:01:39.070> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
there okay so this has a travel all the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.010 
there okay so this has a travel all the
way<00:01:39.280> from<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.729> east<00:01:39.759> coast<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.479> they<00:01:40.539> package

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
way from the east coast and they package

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.380 
way from the east coast and they package
it<00:01:41.050> up<00:01:41.229> really<00:01:41.619> well<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.670> course<00:01:42.940> it's<00:01:43.210> got

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
it up really well and of course it's got

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.910 
it up really well and of course it's got
dry<00:01:43.660> eyes<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.140> so<00:01:44.380> they<00:01:44.470> want<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.710> make<00:01:44.890> sure

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
dry eyes on it so they want to make sure

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.249 
dry eyes on it so they want to make sure
that<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:45.460> packed<00:01:45.759> as<00:01:45.940> well<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:46.539> when<00:01:47.140> you

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
that it's packed as well so when you

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.960 
that it's packed as well so when you
open<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:47.710> up<00:01:47.830> they<00:01:48.009> can<00:01:48.130> be<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> little<00:01:48.490> messing

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
open it up they can be a little messing

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.340 
open it up they can be a little messing
with<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.149> styrofoam<00:01:49.660> getting<00:01:49.899> everywhere<00:01:50.170> so

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
with the styrofoam getting everywhere so

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.779 
with the styrofoam getting everywhere so
I'd<00:01:50.410> like<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.649> open<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:50.950> up<00:01:51.070> right<00:01:51.280> by<00:01:51.429> my<00:01:51.580> door

fish<00:02:15.430> what<00:02:16.060> they<00:02:16.209> do<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.630> they<00:02:16.810> dip<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.380> a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
fish what they do is they dip it in a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.370 
fish what they do is they dip it in a
poly<00:02:17.880> triphosphate<00:02:18.880> which<00:02:19.510> makes<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.080> fish

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
poly triphosphate which makes the fish

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.550 
poly triphosphate which makes the fish
expand<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.580> hold<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.940> ton<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.209> water<00:02:22.510> hence<00:02:23.260> why

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
expand and hold a ton of water hence why

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.260 
expand and hold a ton of water hence why
when<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.770> cook<00:02:24.130> your<00:02:24.250> fish<00:02:24.520> they<00:02:24.940> always

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
when you cook your fish they always

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.449 
when you cook your fish they always
shrivel<00:02:25.720> down<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.319> get<00:02:26.470> half<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.830> ounces

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
shrivel down and you get half the ounces

excess<00:02:43.300> liquid<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.290> spend<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.220> little<00:02:45.400> bit

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
excess liquid so I spend a little bit

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.369 
excess liquid so I spend a little bit
more<00:02:45.760> money<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.510> integral<00:02:46.959> but<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.290> the

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
more money on the integral but at the

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.589 
more money on the integral but at the
same<00:02:47.590> time<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.069> ends<00:02:48.370> up<00:02:48.489> costing<00:02:48.940> me<00:02:49.239> less<00:02:49.450> in

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
same time it ends up costing me less in

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.720 
same time it ends up costing me less in
the<00:02:49.629> long<00:02:49.720> run<00:02:49.900> because<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:50.590> comes<00:02:51.099> out<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.580> be

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the long run because it comes out to be

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.410 
the long run because it comes out to be
more<00:02:52.290> more<00:02:53.290> bang<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.770> your<00:02:53.860> buck<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.940> I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
more more bang for your buck so I

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.070 
more more bang for your buck so I
ordered<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:56.260> time

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
ordered this time
