00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.950
 hello good in the samsung galaxy s 5 in 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.550
 resolution 4k that that's higher than the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.290
 full hd resolution obviously already here is 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.049
 at night we are in the city of mexico 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.940
 and that basically we wanted to see the 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.220
 colors so we are in some sources 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.689
 that have enough colors like you 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.180
 you can observe and it will serve me 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.180
 perfect for this kind of example 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 we were interested in projects 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.110
 we've already been 40 seconds and 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.290
 weight go 230 megs 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.910
 the idea and of course here the limit of 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.480
 4k video recording is five minutes 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.480
 maximum 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.970
 that is also a change here 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.780
 and also in the video test so that 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.780
 also focused a marine zoom 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 we should 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 yes 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.100
 Y 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.810
 onscreen 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 here 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.420
 and then this would roughly be 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.640
 a sample of videos to a camera of 16 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.640
 megapixels in the saint 75 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 4 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.090
 original so that the quality hd 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.860
 and see you 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.270
 2 minutes with 30 seconds and we have 830 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.270
 meters 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.730
 opening
