00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
to create those nice little like pleats

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.749 
to create those nice little like pleats
and<00:01:51.079> folds<00:01:51.500> just<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.890> give<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.159> some<00:01:52.430> dimension

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
and folds just to give it some dimension

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.539 
and folds just to give it some dimension
and<00:01:53.450> then<00:01:54.259> for<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.710> ice<00:01:54.860> cream<00:01:55.159> I'm<00:01:55.369> just

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
and then for the ice cream I'm just

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.209 
and then for the ice cream I'm just
grabbing<00:01:55.939> colors<00:01:56.210> around<00:01:56.540> them<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:57.860> just

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
grabbing colors around them I just

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.770 
grabbing colors around them I just
thought<00:01:58.549> since<00:01:58.610> there's<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.119> many<00:01:59.210> scoops<00:01:59.570> it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
thought since there's so many scoops it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.080 
thought since there's so many scoops it
can<00:01:59.899> be<00:02:00.020> just<00:02:00.229> every<00:02:00.619> flavor<00:02:00.950> imaginable<00:02:01.700> so

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
can be just every flavor imaginable so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.630 
can be just every flavor imaginable so
I'm<00:02:02.659> not<00:02:02.899> being<00:02:03.200> super<00:02:03.619> particularly<00:02:04.219> careful

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
I'm not being super particularly careful

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.100 
I'm not being super particularly careful
with<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.909> coloring<00:02:05.180> since<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.899> such<00:02:06.079> a

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
with the coloring since this is such a

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.070 
with the coloring since this is such a
like<00:02:06.469> smaller<00:02:06.920> ish<00:02:07.360> image<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:08.629> with<00:02:08.810> small

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
like smaller ish image like with small

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.839 
like smaller ish image like with small
areas<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.860> don't<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.459> really<00:02:10.819> really

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
areas you don't have to be really really

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.479 
areas you don't have to be really really
precise<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.709> wanted<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> colors<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.459> be

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
precise I just wanted the colors to be

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.339 
precise I just wanted the colors to be
nicely

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
nicely

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.470 
nicely
and<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:15.549> I<00:02:15.640> said<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.849> was<00:02:16.090> doing<00:02:16.269> this<00:02:16.329> before

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
and like I said I was doing this before

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.300 
and like I said I was doing this before
a<00:02:16.629> thunderstorm<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.290> even<00:02:18.099> though<00:02:18.189> I've

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
a thunderstorm so I even though I've

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.250 
a thunderstorm so I even though I've
sped<00:02:18.640> up<00:02:18.670> this<00:02:18.969> coloring<00:02:19.299> part<00:02:19.689> here<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.079> is

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
sped up this coloring part here this is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.380 
sped up this coloring part here this is
like<00:02:20.379> an<00:02:20.530> 800%<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.219> do<00:02:21.280> not<00:02:21.489> color<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.969> fast<00:02:22.180> I

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
like an 800% I do not color this fast I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.319 
like an 800% I do not color this fast I
wish<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.689> could<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.469> even<00:02:23.950> then<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.129> was<00:02:24.489> making

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
wish I could but even then I was making

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.880 
wish I could but even then I was making
this<00:02:25.420> card<00:02:25.689> quite<00:02:26.079> quickly<00:02:26.319> because<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.769> was

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
this card quite quickly because I was

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.470 
this card quite quickly because I was
worried<00:02:27.219> that<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.489> power<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.969> gonna<00:02:28.150> go<00:02:28.299> out

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
worried that the power is gonna go out

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.849 
worried that the power is gonna go out
and<00:02:28.659> I<00:02:28.689> wouldn't<00:02:28.959> get<00:02:29.049> an<00:02:29.140> emailed<00:02:29.409> off<00:02:29.620> in

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
and I wouldn't get an emailed off in

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.440 
and I wouldn't get an emailed off in
time<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.370> all<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.579> fun<00:02:30.790> stuff<00:02:30.849> because

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
time and all that fun stuff because

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.390 
time and all that fun stuff because
nothing<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.439> everything<00:02:32.920> getting<00:02:33.099> delayed

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
nothing like everything getting delayed

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.759 
nothing like everything getting delayed
and<00:02:33.730> life<00:02:34.299> interrupting<00:02:34.930> things<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.500> yeah

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
and life interrupting things and yeah

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
last minute so yeah anyway once I got

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.649 
last minute so yeah anyway once I got
mostly<00:02:42.430> image<00:02:42.639> colored<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.120> added<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.480> little

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
mostly image colored I added a little

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.849 
mostly image colored I added a little
bit<00:02:44.079> of<00:02:44.170> blue<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.379> background<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.829> really

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
bit of blue in the background you really

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.979 
bit of blue in the background you really
can't<00:02:45.430> see<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.239> just<00:02:46.269> bothered<00:02:46.750> me<00:02:46.870> to

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
can't see it but it just bothered me to

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.660 
can't see it but it just bothered me to
leave<00:02:47.109> it<00:02:47.230> completely<00:02:47.680> bare<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.459> just

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
leave it completely bare so I just

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.039 
leave it completely bare so I just
really<00:02:49.000> lightly<00:02:49.150> colored<00:02:49.389> it<00:02:49.659> and<00:02:49.750> then<00:02:49.900> just

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
really lightly colored it and then just

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.869 
really lightly colored it and then just
blended<00:02:50.409> it<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.620> with<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:51.069> mineral<00:02:51.579> spirits

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
blended it out with the mineral spirits

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.440 
blended it out with the mineral spirits
and<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.720> stump<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.400> then<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.120> grass

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
and a stump and then for this grass

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.509 
and a stump and then for this grass
after<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.169> colored<00:02:56.530> blended<00:02:56.919> it<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.159> just<00:02:57.400> took

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
after I colored blended it I just took

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.369 
after I colored blended it I just took
the<00:02:57.639> same<00:02:57.879> three<00:02:58.239> greens<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.870> starting<00:02:59.319> with

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
the same three greens and starting with

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.720 
the same three greens and starting with
the<00:02:59.530> lightest<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.069> then<00:03:00.189> working<00:03:00.370> over<00:03:00.669> to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the lightest and then working over to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.869 
the lightest and then working over to
the<00:03:00.819> darkest<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.689> just<00:03:01.900> flick<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:03.040> color<00:03:03.519> to

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
the darkest you just flick the color to

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.610 
the darkest you just flick the color to
create<00:03:04.030> little<00:03:04.480> grass<00:03:04.900> stamens<00:03:05.379> so<00:03:05.439> with<00:03:05.530> an

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
create little grass stamens so with an

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.960 
create little grass stamens so with an
image<00:03:05.889> like<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.159> it's<00:03:06.340> really<00:03:06.400> easy<00:03:06.579> because

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
image like this it's really easy because

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.309 
image like this it's really easy because
you've<00:03:07.180> kind<00:03:07.299> of<00:03:07.419> got<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.629> guide<00:03:07.930> of<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
you've kind of got that guide of the

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.949 
you've kind of got that guide of the
already<00:03:08.530> drawn<00:03:09.069> grass<00:03:09.489> stems<00:03:09.760> there<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.870> you

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
already drawn grass stems there but you

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.599 
already drawn grass stems there but you
can<00:03:11.109> do<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.379> of<00:03:11.530> course<00:03:11.560> with<00:03:11.919> any<00:03:12.099> little

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
can do this of course with any little

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.979 
can do this of course with any little
image<00:03:13.000> that<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.299> want<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.510> make<00:03:13.629> it<00:03:13.750> look<00:03:13.900> like

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
image that you want to make it look like

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.559 
image that you want to make it look like
it's<00:03:14.200> standing<00:03:14.500> outside<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:16.239> yeah<00:03:16.389> you<00:03:16.480> just

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
it's standing outside and yeah you just

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.199 
it's standing outside and yeah you just
flip<00:03:16.780> them<00:03:16.900> in<00:03:17.049> different<00:03:17.579> directions<00:03:18.579> do

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
flip them in different directions do

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.490 
flip them in different directions do
different<00:03:19.510> lengths<00:03:19.780> do<00:03:19.900> some<00:03:20.079> longer<00:03:20.470> some

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
different lengths do some longer some

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680 
different lengths do some longer some
shorter<00:03:20.769> little<00:03:21.639> dots<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:22.150> doesn't<00:03:22.419> have<00:03:22.540> to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
shorter little dots it doesn't have to

just<00:03:26.620> gives<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.370> little<00:03:27.849> bit<00:03:27.940> more<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.329> a

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
just gives it a little bit more of a

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.149 
just gives it a little bit more of a
real<00:03:28.659> look<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.440> adds<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.769> little<00:03:29.949> something

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
real look and it adds a little something

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.430 
real look and it adds a little something
fun<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.790> takes<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.150> few<00:03:31.329> seconds<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.199> I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
fun and it takes a few seconds so I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.979 
fun and it takes a few seconds so I
don't<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.699> too<00:03:33.879> too<00:03:34.060> often<00:03:34.449> but<00:03:34.720> when

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
don't do it too too often but when

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.270 
don't do it too too often but when
there's<00:03:35.319> images<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.919> where<00:03:36.099> they're

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
there's images like this where they're

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
kind of socially outside it just gives

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.170 
kind of socially outside it just gives
it<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.569> extra<00:03:37.690> something<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.250> once<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:40.060> was

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
it that extra something so once I was

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.849 
it that extra something so once I was
done<00:03:40.329> coloring<00:03:40.659> the<00:03:40.750> image<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:41.109> did<00:03:41.319> my<00:03:41.470> same

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
vellum that I'd trimmed down so this is

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.129 
vellum that I'd trimmed down so this is
lightweight<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.449> is<00:03:49.569> like<00:03:49.720> twenty-one

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
lightweight this is like twenty-one

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.750 
lightweight this is like twenty-one
pound<00:03:50.379> vellum<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.979> I<00:03:51.159> inked<00:03:51.370> up<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.549> stamp

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
pound vellum and I inked up the stamp

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.439 
pound vellum and I inked up the stamp
with<00:03:52.709> my<00:03:53.709> favorite<00:03:54.040> things<00:03:54.310> sweet<00:03:55.269> tooth

with my favorite things sweet tooth

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:57.589 
with my favorite things sweet tooth
pigment<00:03:55.810> ink<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.919> worked<00:03:57.159> with<00:03:57.340> this

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
pigment ink it worked with this

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.149 
pigment ink it worked with this
sentiment<00:03:58.599> sometimes<00:03:59.199> pigment<00:03:59.650> inks<00:03:59.859> can<00:04:00.010> be

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
sentiment sometimes pigment inks can be

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.770 
sentiment sometimes pigment inks can be
a<00:04:00.189> little<00:04:00.370> bit<00:04:00.609> harder<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.120> use<00:04:01.299> because

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
a little bit harder to use because

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.479 
a little bit harder to use because
they're<00:04:01.930> too<00:04:02.079> thick<00:04:02.349> you<00:04:02.620> know<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.370> you'll

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
they're too thick you know and you'll

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.849 
they're too thick you know and you'll
lose<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.970> detail<00:04:04.419> but<00:04:05.109> I'm<00:04:05.379> you're<00:04:05.650> still

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
lose the detail but I'm you're still

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.289 
lose the detail but I'm you're still
able<00:04:05.979> to<00:04:06.189> read<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:06.489> so<00:04:06.639> it's<00:04:06.790> fine<00:04:06.939> but<00:04:07.150> if

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
able to read this so it's fine but if

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.879 
able to read this so it's fine but if
it's<00:04:07.389> an<00:04:07.659> image<00:04:08.229> that's<00:04:08.349> either<00:04:08.590> really

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
it's an image that's either really

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.550 
it's an image that's either really
really<00:04:08.949> detailed<00:04:09.489> or<00:04:09.760> it's<00:04:10.319> you<00:04:11.319> know<00:04:11.379> really

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
really detailed or it's you know really

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.259 
really detailed or it's you know really
small<00:04:11.949> words<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.519> would<00:04:12.879> probably<00:04:13.030> use

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
small words I would probably use

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.369 
small words I would probably use
Versamark<00:04:13.780> because<00:04:13.959> then<00:04:14.049> it's<00:04:14.169> not<00:04:14.259> gonna

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
Versamark because then it's not gonna

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.439 
Versamark because then it's not gonna
like<00:04:14.560> lose<00:04:14.769> up<00:04:15.009> between<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:15.939> know<00:04:16.060> if<00:04:16.299> you

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
like lose up between you know if you

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.479 
like lose up between you know if you
don't<00:04:16.630> know<00:04:16.720> what<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.870> mean<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:18.280> worked

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
don't know what you mean but it worked

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.520 
don't know what you mean but it worked
and<00:04:18.669> always<00:04:19.180> using<00:04:19.509> a<00:04:19.720> detail<00:04:20.139> white

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
and always using a detail white

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.920 
and always using a detail white
embossing<00:04:21.070> powder<00:04:21.340> makes<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.389> big<00:04:22.570> difference

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
embossing powder makes a big difference

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.690 
embossing powder makes a big difference
as<00:04:23.080> well<00:04:23.200> so<00:04:23.469> you<00:04:23.529> don't<00:04:23.620> have<00:04:23.860> like<00:04:24.039> big<00:04:24.310> globs

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
as well so you don't have like big globs

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.400 
as well so you don't have like big globs
of<00:04:25.000> embossing<00:04:25.659> powder<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.409> totally<00:04:26.740> ruining

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
of embossing powder and totally ruining

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.150 
of embossing powder and totally ruining
fine<00:04:27.650> little<00:04:27.890> sentiment<00:04:28.490> like<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:29.840> I

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
fine little sentiment like that so I

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160 
fine little sentiment like that so I
grounded<00:04:31.160> all<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.490> edges<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.810> main<00:04:32.990> image

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
grounded all the edges of the main image

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.650 
grounded all the edges of the main image
here<00:04:33.500> with<00:04:33.770> my<00:04:34.160> little<00:04:34.340> ek<00:04:34.790> success<00:04:35.060> corner

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
here with my little ek success corner

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.330 
here with my little ek success corner
rounder<00:04:35.960> punch<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.500> then<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.830> course<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:37.190> had

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
rounder punch and then of course I had

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.580 
rounder punch and then of course I had
to<00:04:37.370> add<00:04:37.520> some<00:04:37.760> bling<00:04:37.970> so<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.690> just<00:04:39.200> grabbed<00:04:39.440> my

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
it a little bit extra sparkle because

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.660 
it a little bit extra sparkle because
it's<00:05:05.870> one<00:05:06.140> of<00:05:06.170> those<00:05:06.320> things<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.770> wear<00:05:07.010> yeah

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
that's why I have such a hard time

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.640 
that's why I have such a hard time
showing<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:09.020> on<00:05:09.110> videos<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.440> pictures

showing it on videos and pictures

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.440 
showing it on videos and pictures
because<00:05:10.220> in<00:05:10.460> real<00:05:10.700> life<00:05:10.730> when<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.120> hits<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
because in real life when it hits the

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.090 
because in real life when it hits the
light<00:05:11.600> you<00:05:11.690> can<00:05:11.840> see<00:05:11.870> it<00:05:12.140> but<00:05:12.620> it's<00:05:12.770> not<00:05:13.040> like

eyelets or just creative little ways to
adhere<00:06:36.470> it<00:06:36.590> so<00:06:36.800> this<00:06:36.979> is<00:06:37.160> why<00:06:37.280> it's<00:06:37.430> always<00:06:37.490> my

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
adhere it so this is why it's always my

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.370 
adhere it so this is why it's always my
go-to<00:06:37.970> you<00:06:38.150> just<00:06:38.330> wrap<00:06:38.600> it<00:06:38.630> and<00:06:38.930> tape<00:06:39.140> it<00:06:39.289> and

go-to you just wrap it and tape it and

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.959 
go-to you just wrap it and tape it and
then<00:06:39.530> you<00:06:39.620> can't<00:06:39.830> see<00:06:40.130> it

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
then you can't see it

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.419 
then you can't see it
