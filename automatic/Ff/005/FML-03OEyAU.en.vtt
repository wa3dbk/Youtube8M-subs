00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so let's just assume play fantasy

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.610 
so let's just assume play fantasy
matches<00:00:36.660> appear<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.079> assume<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.500> both

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
matches appear let's assume that both

okay<00:00:39.570> maybe<00:00:39.840> with<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> 1<00:00:40.140> through<00:00:40.320> 140<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:41.010> his

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
okay maybe with the 1 through 140 on his

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.560 
okay maybe with the 1 through 140 on his
way<00:00:41.760> up

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
way up

Chavez<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.559> his<00:00:43.800> best<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.340> my<00:00:44.520> opinion<00:00:44.550> at

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
Chavez was his best in my opinion at

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.260 
Chavez was his best in my opinion at
1:40<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.370> let's<00:00:47.370> say<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.760> fight<00:00:48.000> there

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
1:40 so let's say that they fight there

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.040 
1:40 so let's say that they fight there
okay<00:00:51.289> I'm<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.559> sure<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.160> don't<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:54.050> Chavez

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
okay I'm not sure I don't think Chavez

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.689 
okay I'm not sure I don't think Chavez

beats Mayweather on a with a knockout
okay<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.840> highly<00:01:01.140> possible<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:02.100> could

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it was controlled aggression he knew

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.960 
it was controlled aggression he knew
what<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:46.950> doing<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> wasn't<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.850> some

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
what he was doing it wasn't just some

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.639 
what he was doing it wasn't just some
wild<00:01:48.149> swinging<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:50.210> think<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.420> uh

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
wild swinging and I think that uh

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.770

Mayweather's<00:01:53.030> defensible<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.119> bother<00:01:54.329> him<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
Mayweather's defensible to bother him I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
Mayweather's defensible to bother him I
think<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:55.049> made<00:01:55.259> weathers<00:01:55.640> accurate

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
think they made weathers accurate

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
think they made weathers accurate

offense with a bottle of chocolates as
well<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:58.710> Chavez<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.130> always<00:01:59.430> there<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
well because Chavez is always there to

well because Chavez is always there to
get<00:01:59.820> hit<00:02:00.030> he<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.079> take<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:02.189> land<00:02:02.430> one<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
know and that's just the truth in the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.139 
know and that's just the truth in the
matter<00:02:04.710> when<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.009> comes<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.250> surveillance<00:02:05.490> he

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
matter when it comes to surveillance he

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.490 
matter when it comes to surveillance he
would<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.689> he<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.960> he<00:02:07.170> got<00:02:07.200> away<00:02:07.380> with

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
would and then he got he got away with

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.869 
would and then he got he got away with
it<00:02:07.680> because<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.099> his<00:02:08.340> chin<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.830> don't<00:02:11.640> see

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
it because of his chin but I don't see

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.200 
it because of his chin but I don't see
him<00:02:12.060> beating<00:02:12.390> Floyd<00:02:12.629> Mayweather

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
him beating Floyd Mayweather

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.550 
him beating Floyd Mayweather
this<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.480> my<00:02:13.630> opinion<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.990> think<00:02:14.020> other<00:02:14.380> guys

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
this is my opinion I think other guys

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.380 
this is my opinion I think other guys
from<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.310> era<00:02:15.640> would<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.000> beaten<00:02:16.210> me

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
from that era would have beaten me

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.020 
from that era would have beaten me
whether<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.560> Chavez<00:02:17.860> Chavez<00:02:18.820> has

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
whether but not Chavez Chavez has

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.300 
whether but not Chavez Chavez has
tailored<00:02:19.480> me<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:19.930> what<00:02:20.080> Mayweather<00:02:20.440> has<00:02:21.040> been

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
tailored me for what Mayweather has been

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.770 
tailored me for what Mayweather has been
groomed<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.730> beat<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.180> style<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.510> fighter

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
groomed to beat that style of fighter

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.870 
groomed to beat that style of fighter
he's<00:02:23.200> been<00:02:23.380> groomed<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.830> meet<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.580> style<00:02:24.820> of

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
he's been groomed to meet that style of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.150 
he's been groomed to meet that style of
fighters<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.530> think<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:26.860> he<00:02:26.920> would<00:02:27.040> have

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
fighters and I think that he would have

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.180 
fighters and I think that he would have
defeated<00:02:27.400> Chavez<00:02:28.000> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.420> my<00:02:28.690> opinion<00:02:29.190> if

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
defeated Chavez this is my opinion if

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.710 
defeated Chavez this is my opinion if
you<00:02:30.310> guys<00:02:30.460> see<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.790> differently<00:02:31.150> please<00:02:31.510> let

me<00:02:31.840> know<00:02:31.990> and<00:02:32.500> tell<00:02:32.800> me<00:02:32.920> why<00:02:33.070> you<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.250> Chavez

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.280

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.650 
would have beaten Floyd Mayweather or
