call it and this is achieved by getting
sniping<00:00:22.800> killed<00:00:23.010> at<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> distance<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.210> as<00:00:24.990> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
sniping killed at a distance and as you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.779 
sniping killed at a distance and as you
can<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.350> got<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> green<00:00:25.920> flashes<00:00:26.310> then<00:00:26.519> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
can see I got the green flashes then and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.880 
can see I got the green flashes then and
then<00:00:27.000> when<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.240> kill<00:00:27.449> zombies<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.830> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
then when you kill zombies just have a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
then when you kill zombies just have a
look<00:00:29.070> look<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:29.609> those<00:00:29.730> points<00:00:30.000> plus<00:00:30.390> 30

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
look look at all those points plus 30

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.350 
look look at all those points plus 30
plus<00:00:30.840> 30<00:00:31.170> plus<00:00:31.320> 30<00:00:31.619> plus<00:00:31.800> 30<00:00:32.070> plus<00:00:32.219> 30<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.210> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
plus 30 plus 30 plus 30 plus 30 and it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
plus 30 plus 30 plus 30 plus 30 and it
doesn't<00:00:33.600> stop<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> goes<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> plus<00:00:34.649> 16

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
doesn't stop there it goes up to plus 16

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.799 
doesn't stop there it goes up to plus 16
it<00:00:35.280> goes<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> plus<00:00:35.790> 19<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.420> goes<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.660> dog

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it goes up to plus 19 it goes up dog

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.170 
it goes up to plus 19 it goes up dog
plus<00:00:37.110> 120<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.670> keeps<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.030> going

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
plus 120 I think it just keeps on going

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.150 
plus 120 I think it just keeps on going
up<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.719> up<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.500> eventually<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.040> does

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
up and up and up but eventually it does

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
up and up and up but eventually it does
stop<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:41.969> sure<00:00:42.180> exactly<00:00:42.780> how<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
stop and I'm not sure exactly how to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
stop and I'm not sure exactly how to
lose<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.739> think<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.280> perhaps<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
lose it I think that perhaps you have to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.330 
lose it I think that perhaps you have to
keep<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.200> getting<00:00:46.440> killed<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.129> very

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
keep on getting killed at a very very

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
keep on getting killed at a very very
long<00:00:47.579> distance<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> don't<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.110> that

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
long distance and if you don't do that

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.270 
long distance and if you don't do that
often<00:00:50.100> enough<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:51.149> lose<00:00:51.510> its<00:00:51.780> perk

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
often enough then you will lose its perk

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
often enough then you will lose its perk
but<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.149> useful<00:00:54.539> perma

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
but is a very very very useful perma

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
but is a very very very useful perma
perk<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> makes<00:00:56.129> sniping<00:00:56.699> something

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
perk and it makes sniping something

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
perk and it makes sniping something
which<00:00:57.600> most<00:00:57.930> people<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.680> most<00:00:58.980> people

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
which most people because most people

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.650 
which most people because most people
when<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> comes<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> sniping<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.480> want

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
when it comes to sniping don't want

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.700 
when it comes to sniping don't want
anything<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.410> i<00:01:01.469> mean<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
anything to do with it i mean the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.080 
anything to do with it i mean the
Barrett<00:01:02.039> 50<00:01:02.160> Cal<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.699> pretty<00:01:03.000> shit<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.110> DSR<00:01:04.559> is

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
Barrett 50 Cal is pretty shit the DSR is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
Barrett 50 Cal is pretty shit the DSR is
fairly<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.170> nice<00:01:07.320> weapon<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.010> not

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
fairly it's a nice weapon that it's not

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.429 
fairly it's a nice weapon that it's not
particularly<00:01:08.369> great<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> SVU<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
particularly great and the SVU is

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.740 
particularly great and the SVU is
obviously<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> weapon<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.030> makes<00:01:12.270> sniping

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
obviously the weapon which makes sniping

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.399 
obviously the weapon which makes sniping
worthwhile<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:13.670> but<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
worthwhile now but you know as you can

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
worthwhile now but you know as you can
see<00:01:16.590> these<00:01:16.860> points<00:01:17.280> are<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.909> and
