00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
extra perfection and that's where this

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.190 
extra perfection and that's where this

my ways

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.530 
my ways
think<00:02:20.860> about<00:02:21.040> angled<00:02:21.520> brushes<00:02:21.760> like<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.120> one

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
think about angled brushes like this one

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
think about angled brushes like this one
that<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.750> really<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.890> bristles

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that I really like is that the bristles

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.280 
that I really like is that the bristles
are<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.760> lot<00:02:25.000> more<00:02:25.030> stiff<00:02:25.600> than<00:02:25.870> your<00:02:26.170> average

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
are a lot more stiff than your average

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.620 
are a lot more stiff than your average
lip<00:02:26.800> brush<00:02:27.100> which<00:02:27.400> means<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.030> get<00:02:28.209> extra

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
lip brush which means that I get extra

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.390 
lip brush which means that I get extra
control<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.620> product<00:02:29.950> doesn't<00:02:30.190> end<00:02:30.310> up

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
control and the product doesn't end up

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.850 
control and the product doesn't end up
all<00:02:30.550> over<00:02:30.580> my<00:02:30.940> face<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.990> combined<00:02:32.620> with<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
all over my face that combined with the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.680 
all over my face that combined with the
angle<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.430> tip<00:02:33.640> means<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.150> can<00:02:34.390> get<00:02:34.510> my

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
angle of the tip means I can get my

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.530 
angle of the tip means I can get my
Cupid's<00:02:35.230> bow<00:02:35.910> especially<00:02:36.910> even<00:02:37.330> which<00:02:37.510> is

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
Cupid's bow especially even which is

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.880 
Cupid's bow especially even which is
something<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.110> usually<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.680> problems

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
something that I usually have problems

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:55.700 
something that I usually have problems
with<00:02:39.870> demonstration<00:02:40.870> time

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.090 

mm<00:02:56.640> well<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.450> perfect<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.680> really<00:02:58.980> good

mm well it's perfect the really good

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.280

thing<00:02:59.280> about<00:02:59.310> these<00:02:59.640> brushes<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.960> very

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
thing about these brushes is the very

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.290 
thing about these brushes is the very
narrow<00:03:01.650> tip<00:03:02.100> kind<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.670> gives<00:03:02.850> me<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.060> lot<00:03:03.270> of

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
narrow tip kind of gives me a lot of

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.660 
narrow tip kind of gives me a lot of
control<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.290> actually<00:03:04.440> even<00:03:04.830> use<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
control so I can actually even use the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.490 
control so I can actually even use the
brush<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.270> lipstick<00:03:06.720> almost<00:03:06.990> as<00:03:07.290> lip
