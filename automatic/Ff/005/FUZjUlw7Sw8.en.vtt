don't want to put too much pressure on

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.750 
don't want to put too much pressure on
words<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:53.309> thing<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.610> I've<00:00:53.730> been

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
words because one thing that I've been

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.700 
words because one thing that I've been
repeating<00:00:54.360> again<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.719> again<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
repeating again and again that for the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.810 
repeating again and again that for the
last<00:00:55.890> 12<00:00:56.129> months<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.550> been<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
last 12 months we have been in a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.520 
last 12 months we have been in a
pressure<00:00:57.030> cooker<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.020> had<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.379> win

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pressure cooker because we had to win

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
pressure cooker because we had to win
every<00:00:58.829> game<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.789> were<00:00:59.879> playing<00:01:00.149> against<00:01:00.449> any

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
every game we were playing against any

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
every game we were playing against any
team<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.230> obviously<00:01:01.530> any<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.520> games<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
team and obviously any all the games are

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.789 
team and obviously any all the games are
like<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> finals<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.600> us<00:01:03.719> obviously<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.619> is

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like a finals for us obviously this is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
like a finals for us obviously this is
nothing<00:01:05.460> new<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.640> us<00:01:05.850> obvious<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.689> there

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
nothing new for us obvious it is there

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.179 
nothing new for us obvious it is there
would<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.110> some<00:01:07.290> extra<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> pressure<00:01:08.010> now

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
would be some extra bit of pressure now

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
would be some extra bit of pressure now
because<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.060> close<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> now

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
because it's we're so close to it now

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
because it's we're so close to it now
but<00:01:10.320> obviously<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> boys<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.310> quite

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
but obviously I think the boys are quite

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.800 
but obviously I think the boys are quite
quite<00:01:11.729> quite<00:01:11.850> used<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
quite quite used to it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.170 
quite quite used to it
I<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.650> five<00:01:13.979> wins<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> row<00:01:14.729> you've

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
I think that's five wins in a row you've

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
I think that's five wins in a row you've
you've<00:01:15.689> produced<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> say<00:01:16.740> every<00:01:17.220> game

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you've produced as you say every game

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
you've produced as you say every game
has<00:01:17.700> been<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> final<00:01:18.570> how<00:01:19.140> did<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> players

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
has been a final how did the players

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.160 
has been a final how did the players
cope<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> sort<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.790> pressure<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.630> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
cope with that sort of pressure but I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.740 
cope with that sort of pressure but I
think<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.369> good<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.509> sort<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
think it was good to be in that sort of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
think it was good to be in that sort of
pressure<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:26.009> are<00:01:26.070> used<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> now

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
pressure because they are used to it now

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
pressure because they are used to it now
because<00:01:26.970> if<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.509> were<00:01:27.630> coming<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
because if you were coming in and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
because if you were coming in and
obviously<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> sudden<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.610> pressure

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
obviously all of a sudden this pressure

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.310 
obviously all of a sudden this pressure
would<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.030> come<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.299> us<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.200> have

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
would have come to us that would have

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
would have come to us that would have
been<00:01:31.530> something<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.070> worry<00:01:32.460> about

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
been something to worry about

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
been something to worry about
but<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.409> can't<00:01:34.710> cope

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
but now we know that they can't cope

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560 
but now we know that they can't cope
with<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.490> obviously<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.240> done<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
with it and obviously we have done it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
with it and obviously we have done it
against<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> good<00:01:37.049> teams<00:01:37.229> we've<00:01:37.560> done<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and one days and the forest so this was

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
and one days and the forest so this was
just<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.200> whitewashed<00:01:49.680> all<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> time<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
just like whitewashed all the time so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.520 
just like whitewashed all the time so
these<00:01:50.880> these<00:01:51.180> things<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.110> helped

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
these these things I think that helped

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.780

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.609 
and obviously the boys are used to it
now<00:01:53.909> which<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.630> used<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> panic<00:01:55.170> before<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
now which they used to panic before and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
now which they used to panic before and
obviously<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.460> go<00:01:56.640> look<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.149> our<00:01:57.270> son<00:01:57.689> four

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
to exploit that and obviously the better

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.570 
to exploit that and obviously the better
we<00:03:46.350> exploit<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:47.010> because<00:03:47.250> they<00:03:47.340> are<00:03:47.400> a<00:03:47.430> good

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
we exploit that because they are a good

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.890 
we exploit that because they are a good
feeling<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.000> balling<00:03:48.330> start<00:03:48.510> we<00:03:48.600> have<00:03:48.690> seen
