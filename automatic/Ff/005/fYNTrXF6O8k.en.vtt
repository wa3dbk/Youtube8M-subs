 think of 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.910
 Well, firstly it is important to me that the circles were 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.010
 cream to make foam 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.360
 so that the cube and in time brought besides 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.070
 the fact that he cooked it very well 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.070
 you need to bring them to be alive 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.319
 and of course it is also important that he was not 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.319
 overcooked i love coffee brighter 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.200

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:59.879

 is that we have more than 75 kopecks 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:06.000
