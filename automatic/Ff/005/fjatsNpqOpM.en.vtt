this<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.340> rainy<00:00:05.640> day<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.630> the<00:00:06.810> tank<00:00:07.470> is

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:07.559 
this is a rainy day and the tank is

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:08.959 
this is a rainy day and the tank is
overflowing<00:00:07.980> here's<00:00:08.280> something<00:00:08.670> I'd<00:00:08.760> like

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
overflowing here's something I'd like

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.910 
overflowing here's something I'd like
very<00:00:09.600> much<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.020> I'd<00:00:10.139> like<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.410> share<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.740> you

very much and I'd like to share with you

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.369 
very much and I'd like to share with you
there's<00:00:11.789> a<00:00:11.850> nice<00:00:12.000> little<00:00:12.209> kitchen<00:00:12.930> sink

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
there's a nice little kitchen sink

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.730 
there's a nice little kitchen sink
cabinet<00:00:14.330> very<00:00:15.330> very<00:00:15.660> simple<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.500> running

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
cabinet very very simple we have running

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.060 
cabinet very very simple we have running
water<00:00:16.970> because<00:00:18.199> I'll<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.620> simple

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
water because I'll have a very simple

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.120 
water because I'll have a very simple
gravity<00:00:20.340> feed<00:00:20.760> system<00:00:21.470> there's<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.560> container

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
gravity feed system there's a container

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.830 
gravity feed system there's a container
being<00:00:23.700> fed<00:00:23.940> by<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.170> rain<00:00:25.530> gutter<00:00:25.740> off<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.100> row

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
being fed by the rain gutter off the row

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.240 
being fed by the rain gutter off the row
and<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:28.260> feeding<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.830> overflowing

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
and it's feeding in and overflowing

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.279 
and it's feeding in and overflowing
obviously<00:00:29.850> you<00:00:30.449> see<00:00:30.690> I<00:00:30.720> think<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.170> see

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
obviously you see I think you can see

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.599 
obviously you see I think you can see
the<00:00:31.380> water<00:00:31.530> point<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.250> each<00:00:35.250> time<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
the water point and that each time it

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.910 
the water point and that each time it
rains<00:00:35.850> fills<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.510> tank<00:00:36.859> and<00:00:39.559> there's<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
rains fills this tank and there's just a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.000 
rains fills this tank and there's just a
simple<00:00:41.309> hose<00:00:41.519> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> bottom<00:00:42.589> runs<00:00:43.589> into<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
simple hose on the bottom runs into the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.450 
simple hose on the bottom runs into the
sink

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
sink

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.899 
sink
that's<00:00:44.609> it<00:00:44.819> gravity<00:00:45.479> fed<00:00:46.159> a<00:00:47.839> water<00:00:48.839> system<00:00:49.350> so

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
that's it gravity fed a water system so

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.849 
that's it gravity fed a water system so
I<00:00:50.909> mean<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.989> simple<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> would<00:00:52.589> have<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
I mean this is so simple I would have to

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.660 
I mean this is so simple I would have to
raise<00:00:53.010> my<00:00:53.219> tank<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.760> higher<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:55.670> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
raise my tank a little higher because to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
raise my tank a little higher because to
get<00:00:56.819> enough<00:00:57.030> pressure<00:00:57.239> obviously<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.499> flow

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
get enough pressure obviously to flow

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
get enough pressure obviously to flow
out<00:00:58.769> but<00:00:59.639> to<00:00:59.729> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> tank<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.389> back<00:01:00.569> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
out but to have a tank on the back of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
out but to have a tank on the back of
that<00:01:00.870> they'll<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.199> perfect<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.370> was

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that they'll be perfect so I think I was

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.740 
that they'll be perfect so I think I was
thinking<00:01:05.820> about<00:01:05.909> doing<00:01:06.120> something<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
thinking about doing something like this

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:15.219 
thinking about doing something like this
before<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.869> example<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.320> RV

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.200 

have<00:01:15.439> another<00:01:15.770> sink<00:01:16.100> even<00:01:16.579> an<00:01:16.729> outdoor<00:01:16.880> shower

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
have another sink even an outdoor shower

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.649 
have another sink even an outdoor shower
possibly<00:01:17.890> so<00:01:18.890> nice<00:01:19.850> idea<00:01:20.240> there

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
possibly so nice idea there

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.749 
possibly so nice idea there
the<00:01:21.289> Australians<00:01:21.860> they<00:01:22.420> really<00:01:23.420> use<00:01:23.630> the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
the Australians they really use the

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.029 
the Australians they really use the
rainwater<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.000> list<00:01:29.179> extent<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.259> I'm

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
rainwater to the list extent and I'm

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.630 
rainwater to the list extent and I'm
learning<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.399> lot<00:01:31.429> over<00:01:31.880> here<00:01:32.229> about<00:01:33.640> true

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
learning a lot over here about true

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.309 
learning a lot over here about true
off-grid<00:01:35.119> living<00:01:35.299> in<00:01:35.569> a<00:01:35.630> real-life<00:01:35.869> situation

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
off-grid living in a real-life situation

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.580 
off-grid living in a real-life situation
I<00:01:37.069> do<00:01:37.850> live<00:01:38.179> off<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.509> grid<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.140> can<00:01:39.350> still

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
I do live off the grid but I can still

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.609 
I do live off the grid but I can still
learn<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.770> lot<00:01:40.039> and<00:01:40.990> never<00:01:41.990> claim<00:01:42.289> to<00:01:42.409> be<00:01:42.530> an

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
learn a lot and never claim to be an

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.399 
learn a lot and never claim to be an
expert<00:01:42.740> on<00:01:43.039> any<00:01:43.189> one<00:01:43.340> thing<00:01:44.110> anybody<00:01:45.110> says

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
expert on any one thing anybody says

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.429 
expert on any one thing anybody says
they<00:01:45.619> have<00:01:45.829> nothing<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.250> learn<00:01:46.399> well<00:01:47.439> they're

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
they have nothing to learn well they're

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.800 
they have nothing to learn well they're
probably<00:01:48.560> hard-headed<00:01:49.060> or<00:01:50.060> they<00:01:50.360> might<00:01:50.479> be<00:01:50.539> an

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
probably hard-headed or they might be an

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.719 
probably hard-headed or they might be an
expert<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:51.229> there's<00:01:51.500> very<00:01:51.649> few<00:01:52.569> but<00:01:53.569> anyway

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
expert but there's very few but anyway

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.259 
expert but there's very few but anyway
that's<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:56.030> nice<00:01:56.750> idea<00:01:57.079> there
