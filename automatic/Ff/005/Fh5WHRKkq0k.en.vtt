hi this is ko and this is a short
tutorial<00:00:11.590> on<00:00:11.769> getting<00:00:12.010> started<00:00:12.190> in<00:00:12.699> minecraft

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
tutorial on getting started in minecraft

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.959 
tutorial on getting started in minecraft
so<00:00:14.740> you've<00:00:14.859> just<00:00:14.889> bought<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.400> game<00:00:15.639> and

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
so you've just bought the game and

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.210 
so you've just bought the game and
you're<00:00:16.059> looking<00:00:16.330> at<00:00:16.449> the<00:00:16.570> title<00:00:16.900> screen

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you're looking at the title screen

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.700 
you're looking at the title screen
wondering<00:00:18.220> what's<00:00:18.369> going<00:00:18.550> on<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.680> first

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
wondering what's going on the first

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.840 
wondering what's going on the first
thing<00:00:21.070> we<00:00:21.160> should<00:00:21.310> do<00:00:21.400> is<00:00:21.520> look<00:00:21.640> at<00:00:21.760> the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
thing we should do is look at the

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.050 
thing we should do is look at the
options<00:00:22.980> now<00:00:23.980> here<00:00:24.160> in<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.340> options<00:00:24.520> you<00:00:24.910> have

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
options now here in the options you have

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.840 
options now here in the options you have
your<00:00:25.210> music<00:00:25.690> and<00:00:25.840> sound<00:00:26.050> sliders<00:00:26.850> normally

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
your music and sound sliders normally

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.220 
your music and sound sliders normally
they<00:00:27.970> start<00:00:28.210> off<00:00:28.300> at<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.449> hundred<00:00:28.600> percent<00:00:28.810> but

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
they start off at a hundred percent but

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
they start off at a hundred percent but
I've<00:00:29.350> set<00:00:29.529> them<00:00:29.619> down<00:00:29.860> a<00:00:29.890> bit<00:00:30.039> so<00:00:30.400> that<00:00:30.460> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
I've set them down a bit so that the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.150 
I've set them down a bit so that the
music<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:31.869> sound<00:00:32.109> doesn't<00:00:32.349> overpower<00:00:32.739> me

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
music and sound doesn't overpower me

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.270 
music and sound doesn't overpower me
during<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.520> video<00:00:34.379> you've<00:00:35.379> got<00:00:35.590> your<00:00:35.800> invert

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
during the video you've got your invert

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.759 
during the video you've got your invert
Mouse<00:00:36.550> depending<00:00:37.420> on<00:00:37.510> how<00:00:37.629> you<00:00:38.469> like<00:00:38.620> your

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
Mouse depending on how you like your

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.200 
Mouse depending on how you like your
mouse<00:00:38.949> to<00:00:39.159> operate<00:00:39.550> mouse<00:00:40.359> sensitivity<00:00:42.210> it's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
mouse to operate mouse sensitivity it's

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.119 
mouse to operate mouse sensitivity it's
kind<00:00:43.809> of<00:00:43.839> controls<00:00:44.199> how<00:00:44.379> fast<00:00:44.409> your<00:00:44.979> mouse

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
kind of controls how fast your mouse

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.289 
kind of controls how fast your mouse
moves<00:00:45.460> around<00:00:46.409> render<00:00:47.409> distance<00:00:47.559> far<00:00:48.159> this<00:00:49.120> is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
moves around render distance far this is

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.389 
moves around render distance far this is
a<00:00:49.329> performance<00:00:49.809> tweak<00:00:50.139> you<00:00:50.319> can<00:00:50.499> set<00:00:51.190> your

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
a performance tweak you can set your

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.919 
a performance tweak you can set your
render<00:00:51.699> distance<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:52.269> a<00:00:52.299> shorter<00:00:52.780> distance

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
render distance to a shorter distance

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.770 
render distance to a shorter distance
and<00:00:53.440> it<00:00:53.499> will<00:00:53.620> perform<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.940> bit<00:00:55.089> better<00:00:55.269> for<00:00:55.629> you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
and it will perform a bit better for you

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.559 
and it will perform a bit better for you
if<00:00:55.929> you<00:00:56.049> have<00:00:56.199> a<00:00:56.229> slower<00:00:56.499> computer<00:00:57.569> view

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.569 
if you have a slower computer view

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.629 
if you have a slower computer view
bobbing<00:00:58.989> I<00:00:59.139> have<00:00:59.319> off<00:00:59.589> for<00:01:00.069> making<00:01:00.309> videos

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
bobbing I have off for making videos

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:02.899 
bobbing I have off for making videos
because<00:01:00.999> some<00:01:01.179> people<00:01:01.420> get<00:01:02.019> motion<00:01:02.499> sickness

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
because some people get motion sickness

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.140 
because some people get motion sickness
but<00:01:03.909> what<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.390> is<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:05.610> kind<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:06.700> movement

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
but what that is is a kind of movement

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.790 
but what that is is a kind of movement
that<00:01:07.510> your<00:01:07.750> character<00:01:08.110> does<00:01:08.260> while<00:01:08.470> you<00:01:08.560> walk

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
that your character does while you walk

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.150 
that your character does while you walk
to<00:01:09.100> make<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:09.370> feel<00:01:09.760> more<00:01:09.820> realistic<00:01:11.160> 3d

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
to make it feel more realistic 3d

glasses the old style you can play in
three<00:01:20.050> dimensions<00:01:20.860> it's<00:01:21.670> actually<00:01:22.000> pretty

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
three dimensions it's actually pretty

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.320 
three dimensions it's actually pretty
cool<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.600> should<00:01:22.630> try<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:24.060> limit<00:01:25.060> framerate

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
cool you should try it limit framerate

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.590 
cool you should try it limit framerate
is<00:01:25.600> another<00:01:25.810> performance<00:01:26.260> tweak<00:01:27.180> well<00:01:28.180> if<00:01:28.450> you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
is another performance tweak well if you

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.770 
is another performance tweak well if you
if<00:01:28.900> you<00:01:29.020> see<00:01:29.200> what<00:01:30.160> they<00:01:30.280> call<00:01:30.460> tearing<00:01:31.060> when

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
if you see what they call tearing when

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.680 
if you see what they call tearing when
you<00:01:31.900> turn<00:01:32.560> your<00:01:32.800> view<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.400> game<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:34.630> is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
you turn your view in the game this is

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.510 
you turn your view in the game this is
supposed<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.200> help<00:01:35.380> mitigate<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:38.520> fancy

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
supposed to help mitigate that fancy

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.730 
supposed to help mitigate that fancy
graphics<00:01:40.000> that's<00:01:40.990> another<00:01:41.290> performance

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
graphics that's another performance

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.970 
graphics that's another performance
tweak<00:01:42.070> if<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.340> set<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:42.730> to<00:01:42.870> fast<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:44.770> game

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
tweak if you set this to fast the game

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.230 
tweak if you set this to fast the game
might<00:01:45.160> perform<00:01:45.400> a<00:01:45.520> little<00:01:45.640> bit<00:01:45.790> better<00:01:45.970> for

might perform a little bit better for

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.380 
might perform a little bit better for
you<00:01:46.390> if<00:01:46.540> you<00:01:46.600> have<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.810> slower<00:01:47.080> computer<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.700> of
