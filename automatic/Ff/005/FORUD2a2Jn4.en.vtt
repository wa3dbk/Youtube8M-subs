a long way fact the pool right now is

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.249 
a long way fact the pool right now is
filled<00:00:15.880> for<00:00:16.150> testing<00:00:16.540> purposes<00:00:16.990> they'll

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
filled for testing purposes they'll

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.580 
filled for testing purposes they'll
drain<00:00:17.529> it<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:17.830> then<00:00:18.760> tile<00:00:19.119> it<00:00:19.330> from<00:00:19.510> there<00:00:19.690> if

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
drain it and then tile it from there if

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.929 
drain it and then tile it from there if
you<00:00:20.680> look<00:00:20.830> down<00:00:20.949> to<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.220> dining<00:00:21.580> well<00:00:21.730> they

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
you look down to the dining well they

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.460 
you look down to the dining well they
have<00:00:22.090> started<00:00:22.480> the<00:00:22.539> tiling<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.080> you<00:00:23.170> can<00:00:23.289> see

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
have started the tiling and you can see

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.560 
have started the tiling and you can see
some<00:00:23.680> of<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.800> targets<00:00:24.010> on<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.119> wall<00:00:25.330> right

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
some of the targets on the wall right

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.929 
some of the targets on the wall right
now<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:26.949> work<00:00:27.130> is<00:00:27.250> really<00:00:27.430> progressed
