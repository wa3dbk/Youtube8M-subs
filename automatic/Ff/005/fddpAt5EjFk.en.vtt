00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.580
 what they do is open it 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 as a there will be once I open them they go to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.400
 take off the face they will take out the folder that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.810
 says lies 2.0 that the version once 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.770
 have it open what contains a 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.530
 folder is a note from lm that says something 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.240
 there silly but it also contains a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.790
 file that is called sting up and that is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 a dl is like a game file and the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.909
 another folder is that of Miami thrown 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.920
 you way this folder and tucked and 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.229
 they will give the game if the game is not 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 open and send them sting or error 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.929
 from what they do 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.920
 it is in this sting dll file what 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.500
 they do is put it in the carpetania 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 and you already said that you should 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.110
 grab can be game then already if 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.700
 it's not that it makes the only mistake or 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 failure that some people can give you 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.690
 if it does not work one can also 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.820
 get to work at once to me 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.880
 He has made that mistake and the folder 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.530
 l but I do not know if they have to move the other 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.810
 time or I do not know but he's supposed to owe them 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.630
 to work at once if they do not put the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.610
 file and that's basically already that would be 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.640
