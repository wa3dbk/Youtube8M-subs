Confirmed<00:00:05.400> I'm<00:00:05.970> Tobias<00:00:06.330> weights<00:00:06.720> their

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930

domination<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> pre<00:00:07.740> loading<00:00:08.069> screen<00:00:08.340> and

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
domination on the pre loading screen and

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.150 
domination on the pre loading screen and
I<00:00:09.030> swear<00:00:09.240> that's<00:00:09.330> not<00:00:09.510> what<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.750> voted<00:00:10.230> for<00:00:10.469> but

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
I swear that's not what I voted for but

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.459 
I swear that's not what I voted for but
obviously<00:00:12.120> turbine<00:00:12.599> isn't<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> best<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.259> maps

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
obviously turbine isn't the best of maps

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.039 
obviously turbine isn't the best of maps
but<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.160> good<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.330> support<00:00:15.870> so

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
but what it is good for is a support so

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.930 
but what it is good for is a support so
they're<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> lodestar<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> swamp<00:00:17.699> I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
they're on the lodestar in the swamp I

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.730 
they're on the lodestar in the swamp I
think<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.570> made<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> clicking<00:00:19.439> noise<00:00:19.470> when

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
think I just made a clicking noise when

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.990 
think I just made a clicking noise when
I<00:00:19.770> said<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:19.949> sentence<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.520> thrown<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> low

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
I said that sentence but thrown the low

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000 
I said that sentence but thrown the low
start<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.420> swarm<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:22.650> hoping<00:00:22.830> that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
start on the swarm and I'm hoping that

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.060 
start on the swarm and I'm hoping that
I'm<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.550> able<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.470> get<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.619> few<00:00:25.830> kills

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
I'm going to be able to get a few kills

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.550 
I'm going to be able to get a few kills
this<00:00:26.310> game<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.090> guy<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.840> reloading<00:00:28.439> or

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
this game so this guy is reloading or

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.929 
this game so this guy is reloading or
cutting<00:00:28.859> back<00:00:28.980> his<00:00:29.099> nub<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.580> was<00:00:29.699> an<00:00:29.820> easy

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
cutting back his nub so that was an easy

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.550 
cutting back his nub so that was an easy
kill<00:00:30.300> couldn't<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.990> killed<00:00:31.170> me<00:00:31.320> unless<00:00:31.500> he

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
kill couldn't have killed me unless he

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.130 
kill couldn't have killed me unless he
pulled<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.920> I've<00:00:32.040> aside<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.579> something

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
in the middle of the map somewhere so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.459 
in the middle of the map somewhere so
I'm<00:00:38.850> gonna<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.120> switch<00:00:39.809> sides<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.350> not

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
a fan of this right hand side right now

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.880 
a fan of this right hand side right now
they're<00:00:43.020> probably<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.649> running

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
they're probably going to be running

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
they're probably going to be running
down<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.239> see<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.539> our<00:00:45.750> team

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
down here you can see that all our team

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.540 
down here you can see that all our team
went<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> right<00:00:46.590> hand<00:00:46.739> side<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.250> can

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
went on the right hand side so you can

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.860 
went on the right hand side so you can
tell<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.969> there's<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> the

on<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.899> side<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.440> how<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> knew<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
on this side so that's how I knew that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.950 
on this side so that's how I knew that
guy<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.190> gonna<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.719> why<00:00:54.809> you've

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
got to be careful on this side of the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.830 
got to be careful on this side of the
map<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:57.239> put<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> straw

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
map right now because they put the straw

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
map right now because they put the straw
right<00:00:58.050> through<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.410> teammates<00:00:58.879> okay<00:00:59.879> we're

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
getting close to these VCS and I've

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.280 
getting close to these VCS and I've
gotta<00:01:01.910> try<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> stay<00:01:03.180> behind<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.870> teammates

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
gotta try to stay behind my teammates

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.830 
gotta try to stay behind my teammates
because<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.390> don't<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.510> trying<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> keep

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
because I don't know I'm trying to keep

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.620 
because I don't know I'm trying to keep
this<00:01:07.170> one<00:01:07.350> over<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.740> direction

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
this one over that direction

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.850 
this one over that direction
cuz<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> best<00:01:09.930> thing<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.680> keep

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
cuz the best thing you can do is keep

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
cuz the best thing you can do is keep
that<00:01:10.920> enemies<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.490> spawn<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.180> side<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that enemies or spawn on one side of the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.789 
that enemies or spawn on one side of the
map<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.080> you're<00:01:13.229> good<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.619> after

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
map and then you're good to go after

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.109 
map and then you're good to go after
that<00:01:14.810> because<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.049> start<00:01:16.110> spawning

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
that because if they start spawning

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.370 
that because if they start spawning
two<00:01:18.119> sides<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.049> front<00:01:19.259> I'm

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
two sides of you like in front I'm

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.330 
two sides of you like in front I'm
behind<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.770> that's<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.070> you've<00:01:20.189> got<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
behind you that's one you've got a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.499 
behind you that's one you've got a
problem<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:20.790> obviously<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.270> cover

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
problem because obviously your cover

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.300 
problem because obviously your cover
isn't<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.830> good<00:01:22.860> enough<00:01:23.130> food<00:01:23.280> for

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
isn't going to be good enough food for
