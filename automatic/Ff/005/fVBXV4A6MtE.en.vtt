00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.090
 how many times do we pass in front of a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.120
 River 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.660
 how many times we pass and do not keep it 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.510
 not even a glance, perhaps absorbed 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.760
 in the thoughts of our daily life 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.880
 how many times the watercourse that is 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.529
 find right in our where we 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.960
 we live in our own context 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.490
 citizen is it river to the canal 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.769
 how many times it comes completely 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.769
 ignored and neglected by us 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.920
 we have just faced this 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030
 spot above the sluice of the certosa di pavia 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.950
 which fortunately gave us one 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.600
 nice catch thanks for the soccer help 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.950
 now let's go down to looking for 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.989
 glory let us say that the millions hours 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.690
 we will do in the low area that we say 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.640
 sport of the beautiful daniele which the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.920
 next spot that we are going to visit 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.569
 now let's go to another lock where 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.290
 I hope to find some big mouthfuls 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.350
 of Italy 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.200
 ok and then we'll go down into the final vessels 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.019
 to take a while all those meanwhile 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.120
 the light forces are going down is the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.220
 good time is coming 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.450
 and then stefano pastorelli in Milan 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.860
 when they told us that stefano 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.140
 passarello to come to pescara milano 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.350
 we could not miss because in short 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.940
 in the views all you lacked the street pc 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.370
 so right inside what 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.200
 then it is a metropolis like milano ee la 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.209
 his and we say his hinterland is one 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.519
 particular peach fine francesco is 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.940
 definitely an absolutely context 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:56.030
 unusual for me is used to a limestone 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.459
 much wilder scenes I have to tell you I have to 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.590
 confess now that it's just us you it 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.140
 I have to say I really have to tell you that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.660
 I was absolutely fascinated 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.269
 of what it can offer a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.690
 urban context like how I milano 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.060
 could enjoy beauties and foreshortenings 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.940
 that I could never have observed with 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.320
 so much attention as fishing 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.480
 therefore also a technique that really 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.430
 brings the person the passionate to live 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.230
 these corners that are a bit hidden 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.940
 because they remain a little behind the scenes 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.959
 but right next to it 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.680
 than instead to the traffic of the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.269
 metropolis 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.859
 here it is enough to move a few meters e 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.989
 these old shutters are discovered 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.540
 corners that many in maybe never have 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.769
 not even seen by living here in Milan 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.109
 absolutely francesco and perhaps really 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.560
 in these words this is you 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.390
 you said yes it condenses what is the 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.329
 charm of this fishing of charm that 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.540
 of street phishing because it allows us 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.400
 to see and live to live there 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.829
 our city and in the right way 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.019
 in the right way like us 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.480
 we should live it and not travel or not 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.519
 absent-mindedly as we are obliged to 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.830
 make a simple technique we have seen 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.549
 as with precisely artificial world is the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.520
 your transmission 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.570
 really an artificial is enough 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.370
 see a little more than one because maybe 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.890
 the species change a little for the species 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.520
 specific animals that attend these 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.200
 waterways 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.770
 but just a little cannetta is enough 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.890
 absolutely absolutely artificial 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.660
 the slenderness of the fishing set does ago 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.910
 a philosophy for this technique of 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.870
 fishing around a bicycle with it 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.640
 snowboard with what you can 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.710
 absolutely francesco also the 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.440
 spend an hour two hours maybe earlier 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.600
 to go to work or after work well 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.270
 what we want more nothing better 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.970
 that spend two hours in this ours 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.590
 beautiful city 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.270
 fishing is obviously a surprise 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.880
 all we lived was seeing 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.650
 many species that have come out means 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.810
 that in short, a sign that these waters do not 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.840
 they are then so polluted as they say there is 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.270
 fish would not live is absolutely 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.300
 a casket a casket not bad 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.370
 that's what there is 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.430
 they conserve these waters because they really are 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.110
 we could catch all the predators 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.950
 of the plan and this this surely 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.500
 means that quality 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.240
 water is not not bad at all not 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.620
 it is by no means negative then for all 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.970
 friends not to find that they want 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.530
 relive these moments that you have 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.040
 passed in the city of Milan and in his 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.320
 hinterland 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.280
 with this technique we give your speech 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.520
 the appointment as usual 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.420
 let's remember the 811 of sky italia fiji 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.620
 on TV in a specific appointment 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.330
 absolutely dedicated to fishing with 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.510
 our world artificial lures 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.510
 artificial 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.690
 a company also because we come anyway 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.800
 the bank that won everything had too 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:53.509
 a collier 2004 to finish napoli not 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.509
 it still exists marine it continues 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.870
 first Mediterranean and then the ocean 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.870
 Atlantic
