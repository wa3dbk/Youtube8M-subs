00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:22.910
 Hello. Today we will talk about our second trip to Europe . 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.900
 4 The last time I explained this, 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.189
 It was. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.989
 Today , I'm going to explain the reason for the trip to Europe . 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.690
 Once you are back in Europe, the screen is basically a package tour 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.660
 You think about two things a lot. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.460
 A great deal of backpacking trips 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.330
 There are various types of tones, for example train travel using trains. 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.400
 Maybe. 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:53.990
 It can be a bus or low-cost travel, or these days 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.770
 It's a car trip. 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.810
 Cars can also be rented, dorms available. 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.689
 There are many ways 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:10.100
 Once a day, it is the greatest advantage of a backpacking trip . 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:15.530
 I 'm going to do the things I want to do in time for my appointment . 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.640
 What if they heard anything during the ten days around Europe Witch rats in Paris 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.700
 Maybe. 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.970
 Or maybe 10 days to 10 days . 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.970
 That's how I can travel all the way I want 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.890
 Backpacking medicine is the biggest advantage. 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:35.630
 In the case of backpacking, nursing is now a cheap part of your thinking. 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.710
 I can think about it. It's very cheap, depending on how you prepare . 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.510
 Maybe. 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:46.100
 In some ways, it can be very expensive compared to package travel. 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.780
 I can not go backpacking because I can carry it with my money 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.229
 If you're ready 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.190
 I have a lot of preparation in advance . 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.750
 Packaged browser is ready to make a trip to TB while I want to 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.750
 It is most important to do 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:09.320
 In Europe, the train is really connected to every corner. 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.340
 So, it's a very good continent to travel on a train 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.670
 I have. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.400
 Because there are many connections between country and country , city and city , 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.390
 So to be able to move easily the biggest of the many ways Backpacking 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.590
 I have a number. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:29.360
 When you travel on a train , you can say that a Eurail Pass is almost essential. 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.350
 Not every country has a passport . For more information on Eurail Pass 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.960
 next time 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.990
 I'll explain everything to you. Anyway, think of the Eurail Pass. 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.130
 Now, when I travel on a train, I get a note. 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.870
 Uh, depending on a lot of things like elections or Eurail Pass Now and Schedule 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.470
 I will clear it. 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.820
 Although it can be said to be an advantage of train travel, 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.750
 You can. 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.130
 The principal of your hostel is also important when traveling on a train . 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.210
 For example, there are a lot of luggage to go to a very remote hotel in the train station. 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.459
 If 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:07.310
 Would be difficult to make, but in spite of only one day, one kind of gang Spa Party 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.870
 Going to go away inconvenient things like that 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:16.430
 If so , come to the nearest 4 train stations and catch the hotel. 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:21.050
 Even if the bush is far from the train station when you move the next city over your luggage 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:25.990
 I will travel once, travel, and come back and drink. It's okay. 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:31.060
 It's the smartest way to start. 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:35.340
 For example, the train and yacht are a little more expensive than the downtown . 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:40.000
 Even if you have difficulty in your body, 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:45.310
 If possible, it seems to be best to catch a bear tanan new accommodation 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.860
 But presented a few days stay in the city, we'll have the city 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.640
 As far as possible, it is much better to grab a hostel near the city 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.640
 It seems like a way. 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.910
 4 And another kind of backpacking trip Recently I have traveled a great deal 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:09.410
 The way to leave is a European trip with a car. 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:13.550
 In the case of a car, there are a lot of cars in the country . 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:18.590
 That's because it's right to be right . 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:25.250
 No matter how many luggage you have, there is no inconvenience in moving with your luggage. 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:29.389
 Also I want to go gageon the city at night, with no time constraints early in the morning or institute 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.380
 It can be a very useful way to go to cities that are difficult to access by public transportation. 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.210
 I will. 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:39.560
 But the disadvantage is that it is too powerful and costly to do it alone . 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:43.669
 In this case, you have to leave at least three people together. 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.660
 I do not care if it's just a week or so to rent a car. 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.340
 For example, if you use a lot of lycans nowadays , 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.400
 You are traveling 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.750
 If you do not mind, it will be very difficult. 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.890
 Mind is not right, but that can be fun to your whole one month 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.600
 If I do not fit in the village, I want to go to Jung, but why am I going over there? 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.430
 Itguyo can do a lot of thinking 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.140
 That's why it's so hard to travel, and compared to that of the train, 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.970
 It can fall a lot. 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:18.620
 Train trips are divided into two groups if you do not mind one or four people 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.580
 Give it to me , or I'll go out on my own trip. 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.120
 But 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.950
 The car has the drawback that it has to be done together to the end 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:32.270
 But where others are not kind yet tough public transport where such a change easily 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.860
 You can move around and it's also affordable 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.120
 I have accommodation. 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.550
 If you are well prepared for the cost because you can find such accommodation 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:45.650
 You can save a lot . 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.510
 Instead, if you want to travel oriented metropolis like to recommend Lad, just by the Avenue 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.090
 In the case of Mr. 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:58.100
 Parking fee and tollgate b Because these things are so expensive, 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:04.010
 I would like to recommend a car trip when traveling on a small town. 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.789
 In one case, when a trip to Europe earlier this year a month traveling by car 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.140
 And 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:14.630
 After that, I traveled by train for a month using the Eurail Pass. 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:18.710
 Hold me like this if you look at the word line using several methods and card 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:23.180
 Finally, we need to train to get hold Lee's trip to the car that is following 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.950
 How to use any number of different means of transportation in this manner also good 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.870
 It could be a way. 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:35.390
 And even if it is a backpacking trip with a backpacking train, 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:37.190
 Do not be too stubborn to even more appropriate means of transportation too far distance train 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:41.690
 It's hard to try. 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:44.690
 If you are a low-cost airline or any other bus, 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:50.210
 It can be a very good way too. 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:56.240
 If you like Bill 4 was there or whether you're traveling by car to travel by train 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:59.570
 Five of the city mainly doing the trip without the top Whether using only low cost airline 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:04.280
 I think it's more important how we prepared it. 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:09.020
 In the case of self- regulation , there is an advantage of being able to travel freely , 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:13.850
 If you do not do well, you can be more powerful and more self-disciplined. 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:17.930
 And if you can not cope easily with the difficulties that you have now 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:22.910
 Because there are so many, you should make as much preparation as possible. 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:28.370
 If not saying turn the package or what my organization backpacker woman ah 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:33.710
 You can choose a trip that you would like to give at a travel agency wiz event like a hotel pack . 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:36.330
 It saves money and much more mind having to purchase and also that the clinical and less body 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:42.380
 I can travel. 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:42.380
 Hooray
