00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:15.536
today we prepare Piadina, the ancient bread of poor
 people one of the easiest recipe to make

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:32.605
you need flour, better general purpose, lard,somebody uses olive oil but
 it gives piadina a different taste, milk and salt

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:51.659
yeast is an optional, as being originally piadina a poor bread
 it wasn't used, but we suggest to use it

00:00:53.056 --> 00:01:03.987
now we prepare the yeast, a pinch of sugar in lukewarm milk,
 if the milk is cold the yeast will not melt

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.441
now we stir well until the yeast is melted

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:40.600
while the yeast is melting prepare the dough by adding salt
 and lard, few salt otherwise piadina will not leaven

00:01:46.183 --> 00:02:04.140
add two tablespoons of lard for 1/2 kilo of flour, if you use
 the oil 4 tablespoons, the lard and milk will make piadina elastic

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:12.730
now we add the milk with melted yeast

00:02:17.502 --> 00:02:23.040
now we begin to make the dough for piadina, you
 can use a knead machine if you like

00:02:24.012 --> 00:02:26.010
first time i suggest you to knead it by
 hands, so you can test the dough consistence

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.170
as depending on used flour you can add some milk
 more or less for having the right consistence

00:02:48.787 --> 00:03:04.910
we must knead the dough until soft and not sticky, for this you must
 knead it at least 10 minutes for making the lard well melt

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:15.380
if all was made correctely you must have no flour
 neither on your hands nor on the board

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:28.090
and the ball should be rather elastic. Sprinkle the ball with few
 flour and put it leavening in a lukewarm place

00:03:28.093 --> 00:03:30.090
