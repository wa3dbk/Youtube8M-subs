00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
had made this video two years ago in my

had made this video two years ago in my
apartment<00:00:30.130> with<00:00:30.400> an<00:00:30.550> iPhone<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.270> audio<00:00:32.169> is

horrible<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.070> editing<00:00:33.700> is<00:00:33.850> not<00:00:34.030> very<00:00:34.270> good

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
horrible and editing is not very good

either<00:00:34.780> but<00:00:35.380> I<00:00:35.440> think<00:00:35.620> is<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.740> good<00:00:35.860> idea<00:00:35.980> so<00:00:36.220> I'm

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
either but I think is a good idea so I'm

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.430 
either but I think is a good idea so I'm
going<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.700> make<00:00:36.850> a<00:00:36.880> new<00:00:37.120> version<00:00:37.329> and<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:38.290> know

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
going to make a new version and I know

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.380 
going to make a new version and I know
it<00:00:38.620> goes<00:00:38.829> without<00:00:38.980> saying<00:00:39.490> if<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:40.030> do<00:00:40.180> any

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
it goes without saying if you do any

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.900 
it goes without saying if you do any
projects<00:00:41.020> do<00:00:41.140> them<00:00:41.290> safely<00:00:41.620> as<00:00:42.070> possible<00:00:42.190> and

this<00:01:07.299> video<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.840> definitely<00:01:08.650> not<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.159> best

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
this video is definitely not the best

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.120 
this video is definitely not the best
way<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.940> use<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:10.690> hammer<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.170> chisel<00:01:11.320> but<00:01:11.860> that's

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
way I use a hammer and chisel but that's

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.490

what<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:12.340> had<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.150> worked<00:01:13.330> for<00:01:13.570> me<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.900> way

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
what I had and it worked for me the way

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.080 
what I had and it worked for me the way
you<00:01:14.530> open<00:01:15.070> your<00:01:15.159> coconut<00:01:15.580> will<00:01:15.700> probably<00:01:16.000> be

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
you open your coconut will probably be

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.880 
you open your coconut will probably be
different<00:01:16.330> from<00:01:16.600> somebody<00:01:17.049> else<00:01:17.260> because<00:01:17.560> it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
different from somebody else because it

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.350 
different from somebody else because it
really<00:01:18.130> depends<00:01:18.549> on<00:01:18.670> what<00:01:18.850> tools<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.330> have

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360

and<00:01:19.810> how<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.500> want<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.159> coconut<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.880> look

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
and how you want the coconut to look

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.480 
and how you want the coconut to look
once<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:22.930> crack<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.350> open<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:23.979> quickly<00:01:24.369> I'm

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
once you crack it open so quickly I'm

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.190 
once you crack it open so quickly I'm
going<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.670> go<00:01:24.790> over<00:01:24.820> some<00:01:25.240> tools<00:01:25.510> but<00:01:25.720> remember

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.660 
to keep and use the meat I have also
used<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.260> oven<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:24.100> microwave

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
used the oven and a microwave

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.509 
used the oven and a microwave
but<00:03:25.360> my<00:03:25.450> logic<00:03:25.840> was<00:03:25.900> by<00:03:26.230> boiling<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.040> coconut

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
but my logic was by boiling the coconut

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.100 
but my logic was by boiling the coconut
it<00:03:27.670> will<00:03:27.790> release<00:03:28.120> some<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.600> tannins

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
it will release some of the tannins

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.370 
it will release some of the tannins
before<00:03:30.010> going<00:03:30.250> into<00:03:30.519> my<00:03:30.700> tank<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:32.019> also

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
before going into my tank you can also

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.380 
before going into my tank you can also
deep<00:03:32.680> freeze<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.190> coconut<00:03:33.670> and<00:03:33.880> then<00:03:34.060> crack

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
deep freeze the coconut and then crack

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.630 
deep freeze the coconut and then crack
it<00:03:34.570> open<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.530> meat<00:03:35.709> will<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.130> in<00:03:36.400> one

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
it open and the meat will be in one

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.509 
it open and the meat will be in one
solid<00:03:37.090> fall<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:38.170> haven't<00:03:38.680> tried<00:03:38.890> this<00:03:39.100> yet<00:03:39.160> but

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
solid fall I haven't tried this yet but

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.180 
solid fall I haven't tried this yet but
it<00:03:39.670> looks<00:03:39.700> like<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.360> might<00:03:40.900> destroy<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.860> shell

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
it looks like it might destroy the shell

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.420 
it looks like it might destroy the shell
step<00:03:43.150> number<00:03:43.390> five<00:03:43.950> removing<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.010> meat<00:03:45.130> from

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
pry out these pieces easily and you

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.220 
pry out these pieces easily and you
probably<00:04:03.910> won't<00:04:04.060> have<00:04:04.209> flying<00:04:04.510> shrapnel<00:04:04.840> like

much smaller scale here's a cool trick

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.850 
much smaller scale here's a cool trick
you<00:04:40.449> can<00:04:40.599> do<00:04:40.780> if<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.199> have<00:04:41.229> some<00:04:41.590> aquarium

you can do if you have some aquarium
loss<00:04:42.310> if<00:04:42.610> you<00:04:43.000> don't<00:04:43.210> have<00:04:43.360> moss<00:04:43.689> you<00:04:44.020> can<00:04:44.259> have

loss if you don't have moss you can have

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.249

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
cool little moss covered coconut there's

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.510 
cool little moss covered coconut there's
many<00:05:02.020> ways<00:05:02.080> to<00:05:02.439> be<00:05:02.560> creative<00:05:02.860> I've<00:05:03.279> actually

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
many ways to be creative I've actually

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.600 
many ways to be creative I've actually
made<00:05:04.479> a<00:05:04.750> coconut<00:05:05.020> where<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.650> drilled<00:05:06.129> out<00:05:06.279> two

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
made a coconut where I drilled out two

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.059 
made a coconut where I drilled out two
large<00:05:06.909> holes<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.750> was<00:05:07.960> kind<00:05:08.169> of<00:05:08.229> difficult<00:05:08.439> but

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
large holes it was kind of difficult but

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.469 
large holes it was kind of difficult but
