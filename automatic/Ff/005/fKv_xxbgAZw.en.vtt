00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.090
 big hello everyone i'm glad 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.170
 greet you on your channel 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.330
 I will show you how to make today's video 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.010
 very popular hairstyle now I even 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 don't try and do the right thing i'm doing 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.869
 so how convenient is it for me to hold 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.420
 long looked beautiful to me it is not 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.430
 too problematic to do if 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.930
 you wonder how i do the hairstyle then 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.530
 stay with me all nice 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.239
 view 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.460
 in order to make this styling us 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
 need a hairbrush some hairpins 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.809
 crab can be clamps i this styling 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.980
 do with two different spoons 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 here is a different diameter 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.000
 if i need to do quick to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.730
 curls are not necessarily kept for a long time I 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
 did this here like and if not needed 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.260
 to curl hold on debt so they 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.030
 were more elastic then i'm doing this 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.770
 curling it on this curling turns 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.500
 very fine first curls 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 but then when they cool down a bit and in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.700
 Concept I will give them a comb will be very 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.740
 beautiful such smooth waves if you have 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.750
 hair is very bad keeps any curls 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.030
 it is better to wash your hair first 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.040
 dry with mousse after 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.049
 score a curl lightly spray it with varnish 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 do not take such a varnish which is well prom 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.009
 stick hair because in the end we 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.380
 you will need to turn on immediately determine 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.360
 which part you will be laying 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.610
 I usually do the parting 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.680
 he is my duck seats and leave 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:35.240
 Basically, not me, I let the hair in two 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.240
 parts and well kept 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.700
 split each side for part 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.870
 I always start from far to overcome 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.740
 all windows should look the same way 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 I'm a chick she does from the face 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.380
 after I have poured curl 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.380
 so much with already in the group 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.680
 that's what should happen 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.390
 and leave it stopping the same 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.390
 do with all the other hair 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.099
 then again I cool a lot of music 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.080
 move on here is what should 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.640
 get the bottom we have already brought 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.250
 sure all hide and seek must look into 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.290
 one side of the face now turn to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.990
 the top of doing the same 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.570
 so I will not show you when 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.160
 I'll finish all the curls of icons back from this 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.660
 countries curls have cooled 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.660
 I just share them with my hands 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.379
 and in principle they fit in 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.379
 one big wave 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.069
 here you are 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.170
 Of course, you can also correct these waves 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.260
 invisible on so stab be like what 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.599
 that time so that the hair in a more even 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.989
 worried worms now feel different 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.989
 parties 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.200
 That turned out to be so everyday 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.269
 option hollywood wave hollywood 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.219
 styling you name and how you want 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.469
 personally I have such windows 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:53.370
 long is the first option as possible 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:56.650
 get such smooth beautiful waves 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:01.560
 second option i just take a comb and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.560
 carefully comb all curls 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.329
 here already a wave is obtained such more 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:18.019
 large curls not such services lt and 2 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:20.600
 the sides do not need to comb very hard 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.090
 to curls and did not change their shape and 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.400
 But in the end what kind of styling turned out 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.639
 such a casual version of hollywood 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.639
 lamas 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.890
