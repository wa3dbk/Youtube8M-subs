 is the press center of the superbowl 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.690
 precisely there is behind the area that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.940
 they call it the radio rock that is where 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.780
 there are all the seasons 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.730
 Americans mainly those that 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.640
 so much getting here the fox study 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.290
 nfl network sports as all those who 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.100
 many of those that are installed here are installed 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.770
 transmit from here from the center of 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.859
 press many reporters from other countries 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.679
 They also give themselves a date but Miguel 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.879
 today something very interesting happened never 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.750
 something of this nature had happened 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.610
 is that the tree family 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.130
 He decided to give a press conference or 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.000
 the league asked dads to do 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.000
 press conference because 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.550
 obviously the subject of which all 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.800
 they're asking because it's the dads of 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.660
 the two cars that are going to be in the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.640
 super bowl if an unpublished fact we have 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.840
 players had goodly 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.780
 teams that will participate in 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.089
 superbowl coaches coaches 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.220
 manager inactive players in

 general of the nfl ex players artists 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.700
 but never the parents and remedy has been 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.710
 weird to think that the dads of some 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.720
 good coach player were going to be 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
 good to have a press conference 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.340
 for them alone but it turns out that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.259
 so they are the hard bop was 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.030
 enough for both Jackie and 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.530
 jackson paper mom and dad had 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.780
 45 minutes of attention 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.369
 of the press and lots of 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.680
 stories that told peculiar and that 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.180
 they praised only would have imagined if in 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.000
 the funny stories we're going 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.940

 he said that if he talks to us too much 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.840
 did not shut up and the truth is that it's a 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.590
 sir a guy who has many 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.549

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.830

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.040
 You see Mr. hardware igualito 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.329
 big brother physically there 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.090
 who sees that he is also very excited 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.400
 of telling things that you never see good 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.070
 who never never saw and will never know what 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.370
 they have been said as what kaepernick colin 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.600
 that Jim told him that in the second round 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.010
 they were looking at who was going to select 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.690
 and what he said is going to be a marshal of 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.180
 field who is going to be a son are you with 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.610
 someone there is no one with you do not promise 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.110
 that you do not tell your mom and if we go 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.370
 to go for kaepernick colin which is one of 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.590
 the best field marshals of this 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.630
 draft that says even the best player 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.550
 American football has already available 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.440
 from that moment was the name 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.150
 calling capone what good now the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.100
 star not the rising star of the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.150
 49 precisely let's hear this 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.530
 part as told by the father d 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.530
 of jim and de joe hart 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.140
 5 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.830
 efe 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.760
 then there is the colin test that peron 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.710
 and what was the cordoba and the future of the 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.570
 49 it was not just about the 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.400
 injury they were already preparing 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.380
 hardly have a renewal for 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.120
 the ex smith because they knew that colin 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.440
 kaepernick was a chorus back in which 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.750
 could have future in the end the mother and 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.730
 the father of the hard bop as they demonstrate 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.620
 is this good attitude that they maintain 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.960
 they obviously say that it is only one step 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.100
 more in life they are as proud as 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.540
 the day began to play in the 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.860
 high school like the day they had their 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.140
 first job of head coaches 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.300
 at school as the day they arrived 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.430
 the nfl because as they see it they are 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.200
 just one more step and it also counts 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.840
 a very very curious anecdote 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.760
 archie manning himself ila dad 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.320
 and peyton, this is a situation 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.580
 similar and when he knew they were going to 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.930
 face on the day of the action of 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.640
 thanksgiving as he dismissed a 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.520
 call to tell them more or less that it 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.349
 prepare for what they came and good 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.569
 the advice he gave them is not a 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.919
 very deep advice true but but 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.750
 it was interesting that also archie 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.310
 Manning told him to comment 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.500
 well I'm calm because when 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.580
 they fought for I was happy 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.500
 because I was on the offensive of 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.819
 indianápolis and supported it and then 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.979
 there was the offensive of giants and the 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.690
 supported good is obviously where not 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.280
 there was trouble to go another team 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.229
 what they obviously obviously went for 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.430
 face this weekend that by 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.220
 true they said they will not dress or 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:33.220
 purple or red avoid any bad 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.530
 any good misinterpretation 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.630
 we are going to leave this 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.849
 Today's blog tomorrow there's everything 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.979
 a lot of activity is already here 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:43.780
 We'll tell you a little about what it was 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.970
 the press conference of what will be 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.289
 the part-time show that stops 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.610
 those who do not like the game but well 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.720
 the superbowl because there are many people 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.849
 many also is that they gather for that 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.190
 Well, it's also an interesting topic 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.289
 we leave them here on the site 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.389
 dotcom option and that they follow all the 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.800
 coverage on our website and 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.280
 also if they can do it in the middle 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.280
 TV
