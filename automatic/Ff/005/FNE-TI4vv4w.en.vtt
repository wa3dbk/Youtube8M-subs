up I wasn't using this curtain for
curtain<00:00:24.750> purposes<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.680> when<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> see<00:00:26.609> stuff<00:00:27.000> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
curtain purposes so when I see stuff I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.609 
curtain purposes so when I see stuff I
look<00:00:27.840> at<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.939> arm<00:00:29.939> fabric<00:00:30.869> because<00:00:31.260> fabric

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
look at it as arm fabric because fabric

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.470 
look at it as arm fabric because fabric
is<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.980> expensive<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.270> like<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is so expensive so when you see like a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.990 
is so expensive so when you see like a
big<00:00:33.719> sheet<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> big<00:00:35.010> curtain<00:00:35.399> or<00:00:35.940> something

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
big sheet or a big curtain or something

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
big sheet or a big curtain or something
like<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:36.989> something<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.410> want

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
like that and you got something you want

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.229 
like that and you got something you want
to<00:00:37.620> make<00:00:37.800> ain't<00:00:38.370> no<00:00:38.460> need<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:38.820> out<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:38.969> buy

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
to make ain't no need to go out and buy

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.270 
to make ain't no need to go out and buy
no<00:00:39.450> expensive<00:00:40.079> fabric<00:00:40.469> which<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.649> probably

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
no expensive fabric which is probably

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.380 
no expensive fabric which is probably
some<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.670> fabric<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.149> would<00:00:42.360> be
