00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.810
 hello to all moose hunters 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.180
 the asset of the hawks is meant to illustrate 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.060
 the stewardship procedure 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.720
 of moose for registration occupy 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 anti-hunting holidays page 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 remember that only moose harvested 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.410
 legally in quebec can be 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.570
 registered at the records club what the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.360
 qualified pana will only have to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.329
 visit the triple gate w became infatuated 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.719
 space.com wii will be able to download the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.090
 official registration forms and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.160
 will then be to record the results 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.260
 measurement and the others 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.690
 requested information and to explain 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.730
 all at the address mentioned with a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.050
 picture as clear as possible of the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.240
 hunter with game 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.860
 the plume where the head naturalized 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.050
 however even if the plume does not reach 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.520
 not the minimum score 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.190
 will finally come this group of friends or a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.290
 hunters association to use the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.390
 measuring system to compare their 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.500
 plumes harvested on a friendly basis 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.500
 but precise 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.930
 all measures must be 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.250
 carried out at the eighths of pause close 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.740
 using a tape measure 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.390
 flexible is recommendable and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.870
 the use of an electrical incident 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.840
 non- expandable facilitates measurements on 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.360
 the surface as after each taking of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.190
 measures it's about confirming it in 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.150
 aligning the thread the ribbon name to 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.550
 measure and note their results for 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.410
 simplify the additions since he's going 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.920
 all fractions at 1 8th of an inch 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.450
 like for example 4/8 instead of a 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 half 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.260
 the first measure is that of the most 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 large scale of the plume and it must 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.710
 be done at right angles with slap 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.710
 central grade 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.480
 to get there the participant will 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.360
 hold your head so that a 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.910
 central axis of the rank is at a distance with 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.840
 the ground while one side of the plume is 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.010
 leaning against a wall while holding the 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.320
 head to this position 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.210
 let's invent and then be held to 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.000
 the gap against the other side of the plume 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.040
 and the measurement will be done at right angles 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.410
 between the stick and the wall 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.170
 this way brother prodigal the true 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.370
 scale measure 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.260
 we must then count our lamps 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.590
 is on each side of the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.590
 plume 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.549
 to be considered a real 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.189
 point a projection must have a 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.290
 length of at least 1 inch by measuring 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.620
 from a straight line connecting the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.930
 hollow on each side of the tip 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.360
 the width of the wall fault is measured on the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.629
 better with an electric wire in contact 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.700
 with the back surface in the painting 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:14.290
 you have to use an amber square on 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.260
 their inner edges of the mature woman 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.019
 and then measure at right angles to this 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.940
 novel is a hollow between two points the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.580
 where the width is the largest 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.390
 this must be done on the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.760
 two sides of the plume the length of the 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.910
 pan of wall is measured again in 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.140
 using an electric wire in contact 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.700
 with the entire surface of the hull palm 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 this disproportionate length from a 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.930
 hollow between two upper points 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.329
 to another palm of the palmyre 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.910
 frontal where the length and the most 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.060
 great again this measure will 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.560
 performed on both sides of the plume 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.099
 to finish at the measures the circumference 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:02.049
 at the base of each town hall where this 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.940
 circumference is the smallest and 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.010
 I hope that these few 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.319
 directions will help you 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.840
 task to measure your part in the final 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.760
 and that your trophy for is going 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.060
 find in the club list and 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.060
 ungrateful
