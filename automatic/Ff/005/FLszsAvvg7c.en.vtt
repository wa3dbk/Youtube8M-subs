and you know start seeing some of the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.870 
and you know start seeing some of the
workouts<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.130> kind<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.370> work<00:02:31.610> with<00:02:31.790> the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
workouts and just kind of work with the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.820 
workouts and just kind of work with the
videos<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.840> way<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.200> start<00:02:33.530> really

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
videos so this way you can start really

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.620 
videos so this way you can start really
you<00:02:34.160> know<00:02:34.250> developing<00:02:34.820> some<00:02:35.030> muscle<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
you know developing some muscle and a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.900 
you know developing some muscle and a
lot<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.470> stuff<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.860> really<00:02:37.070> basic<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.790> way

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
lot of stuff is really basic so this way

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.670 
lot of stuff is really basic so this way
it<00:02:37.970> doesn't<00:02:38.090> take<00:02:38.360> any<00:02:38.540> prior<00:02:38.810> experience<00:02:38.840> and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
it doesn't take any prior experience and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.610 
it doesn't take any prior experience and
that's<00:02:39.950> really<00:02:40.310> good<00:02:40.610> way<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.790> start<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:42.350> as

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
that's really good way to start but as

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.530 
that's really good way to start but as
you<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.490> progress<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.060> want<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.300> get<00:02:44.390> some

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
you as you progress you want to get some

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.660 
you as you progress you want to get some
next-level<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.800> definitely<00:02:46.250> something

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
next-level you definitely something

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.130 
next-level you definitely something
that's<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.910> lot<00:02:47.030> more<00:02:47.090> structural<00:02:47.690> eyes<00:02:47.780> that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
that's a lot more structural eyes that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.840 
that's a lot more structural eyes that
can<00:02:48.260> go<00:02:48.440> from<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.130> know<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.400> beginning<00:02:49.730> point

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
can go from you know a beginning point

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.150 
can go from you know a beginning point
all<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.690> way<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.350> on<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> end<00:02:51.740> where<00:02:52.130> you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
all the way to the on the end where you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.890 
all the way to the on the end where you
totally<00:02:52.610> can<00:02:52.760> transform<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.240> body<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.840> you

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
totally can transform the body and you

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.600 
totally can transform the body and you
don't<00:02:53.930> have<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.200> body<00:02:54.350> that<00:02:54.470> you<00:02:54.590> want<00:02:54.620> and

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
don't have the body that you want and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.530 
don't have the body that you want and
you<00:02:55.670> can<00:02:55.700> definitely<00:02:55.910> find<00:02:56.180> that<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.450> our

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
you can definitely find that in our

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.600 
you can definitely find that in our
program<00:02:56.840> most<00:02:57.500> definitely<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:57.980> what<00:02:58.459> one

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
program most definitely and what one

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.070 
program most definitely and what one
thing<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:59.000> i<00:02:59.209> think<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.510> lot<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.690> people<00:02:59.959> have

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
thing which i think a lot of people have

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.270 
thing which i think a lot of people have
in<00:03:00.200> their<00:03:00.260> head<00:03:00.470> for<00:03:00.500> why<00:03:00.830> they're<00:03:00.980> only<00:03:01.100> doing

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
in their head for why they're only doing

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.160 
in their head for why they're only doing
the<00:03:01.430> diets<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.940> because<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.810> thing<00:03:02.959> would<00:03:03.050> be

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the diets is because the thing would be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.870

easier<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.620> just<00:03:03.800> diet<00:03:04.220> than<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.580> diet<00:03:04.790> and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880

out<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.610> that's<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.450> actually<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.780> lot

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
out that that's a it's actually a lot

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.660 
out that that's a it's actually a lot
easier<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.440> workouts<00:03:09.800> because<00:03:10.160> you

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
easier to do the workouts because you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.980 
easier to do the workouts because you
don't<00:03:10.880> have<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.180> anywhere<00:03:11.450> near<00:03:11.630> as<00:03:11.780> strict

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
on the diet and you don't have to cut

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.350 
on the diet and you don't have to cut
your<00:03:13.190> calories<00:03:13.340> by<00:03:13.700> anywhere<00:03:13.970> near<00:03:14.150> as<00:03:14.240> much

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
your calories by anywhere near as much

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.180 
your calories by anywhere near as much
exactly<00:03:14.900> cuz<00:03:15.290> working<00:03:15.680> out<00:03:15.770> actually

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
exactly cuz working out actually

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.520 
exactly cuz working out actually

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
for a lot of different things so when

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
for a lot of different things so when
you're<00:04:33.730> out<00:04:33.760> there<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.180> your<00:04:34.270> body<00:04:34.450> is

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
you're out there and your body is

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.380 
you're out there and your body is
starving<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.230> you<00:04:35.920> have<00:04:36.130> food<00:04:36.400> around<00:04:36.760> you're

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
starving and you have food around you're

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.450 
starving and you have food around you're
going<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.630> eat<00:04:37.900> whatever<00:04:38.440> is<00:04:38.860> in<00:04:39.040> front<00:04:39.250> of<00:04:39.370> you

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
going to eat whatever is in front of you

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.220 
going to eat whatever is in front of you
because<00:04:39.820> your<00:04:40.000> body<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.300> switching<00:04:40.840> into<00:04:41.080> that

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
because your body is switching into that

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.540 
because your body is switching into that
mode<00:04:41.410> your<00:04:41.590> brain<00:04:41.740> is<00:04:41.890> switching<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.340> mode

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
mode your brain is switching that mode

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.430 
mode your brain is switching that mode
to<00:04:42.700> where<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:42.970> need<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.420> eat<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.690> now<00:04:44.020> survive

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
to where you need to eat to now survive

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.860 
to where you need to eat to now survive
so<00:04:44.890> dieting<00:04:45.730> is<00:04:45.820> out<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.090> window<00:04:46.240> you<00:04:46.840> know

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870

so dieting is out the window you know
that's<00:04:47.140> a<00:04:47.320> that's<00:04:47.500> a<00:04:47.770> really<00:04:48.070> big<00:04:48.220> reason<00:04:48.460> why

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
that's a that's a really big reason why

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.180 
that's a that's a really big reason why
people<00:04:49.510> stay<00:04:49.960> on<00:04:49.990> diets<00:04:50.470> for<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:50.920> know<00:04:51.010> a
