00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
been around for a long time but

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.430 
been around for a long time but
traditionally<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.420> only<00:01:15.659> good<00:01:16.080> for

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
traditionally it was only good for

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.630 
traditionally it was only good for
indoor<00:01:17.070> use<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:19.380> last<00:01:19.620> decade<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.520> have

indoor use in the last decade we have

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
indoor use in the last decade we have
seen<00:01:20.909> improvements<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.870> the<00:01:22.020> chemistry<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
seen improvements in the chemistry of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.030 
seen improvements in the chemistry of
PVA<00:01:23.310> clues<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:24.930> are<00:01:25.050> now<00:01:25.229> waterproof

PVA clues that they are now waterproof

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.480 
PVA clues that they are now waterproof
and<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:27.210> even<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.840> some<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> longer

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and we even have some that have a longer

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.180 
and we even have some that have a longer
open<00:01:30.120> time<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.260> great<00:01:31.560> when<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
open time which is great when you have a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.390 
open time which is great when you have a
complicated<00:01:33.060> assembly<00:01:33.990> let's<00:01:34.799> take<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> look

complicated assembly let's take a look

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.810 
complicated assembly let's take a look
at<00:01:35.549> some<00:01:35.729> other<00:01:36.000> factors<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.840> affect<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:38.490> glue

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
at some other factors that affect a glue

the<00:01:43.110> wood<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.680> any<00:01:43.950> glue<00:01:44.340> joint<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.970> very

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the wood in any glue joint is very

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.160 
the wood in any glue joint is very
important<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.400> smoother<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> better<00:01:48.299> either

important the smoother the better either

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.609 
important the smoother the better either
through<00:01:49.860> sanding<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.030> through<00:01:51.810> planing<00:01:52.440> a

through sanding or through planing a

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.250 
through sanding or through planing a
great<00:01:53.369> trick<00:01:53.760> for<00:01:54.030> gluing<00:01:54.450> two<00:01:54.750> boards

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
great trick for gluing two boards

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.920 
great trick for gluing two boards
together<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.369> fold<00:01:56.670> them<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> book

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
together is to fold them up like a book

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.710 
together is to fold them up like a book
and<00:01:58.290> now<00:01:59.189> either<00:01:59.490> take<00:01:59.850> them<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> jointer

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
and now either take them to the jointer

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
and now either take them to the jointer
as<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> pair<00:02:01.650> or<00:02:02.330> clamp<00:02:03.330> them<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.780> your<00:02:04.049> bench<00:02:04.380> as

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
as a pair or clamp them in your bench as

as a pair or clamp them in your bench as
a<00:02:04.799> pair<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.840> now<00:02:06.840> taking<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.799> jointer<00:02:08.280> plane

plane them into end until you get a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.289 
plane them into end until you get a
continuous<00:02:15.360> chip<00:02:16.069> full<00:02:17.069> width<00:02:17.400> off<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:18.060> both

any hobby store by simply putting a
little<00:03:09.650> glue<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.280> like<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:14.239> now<00:03:14.750> take<00:03:14.780> my

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
little glue on like so I can now take my

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.260 
little glue on like so I can now take my
brayer<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:17.360> roll<00:03:17.690> that<00:03:18.020> glue<00:03:18.350> out<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:20.060> I

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
brayer and just roll that glue out and I

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.729 
brayer and just roll that glue out and I
have<00:03:20.510> complete<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.340> uniform<00:03:22.340> application

with a constant thickness to the glue I

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.390 
with a constant thickness to the glue I
now<00:03:30.620> simply<00:03:31.130> line<00:03:31.640> these<00:03:32.019> parts<00:03:33.019> up<00:03:33.230> put<00:03:34.190> some

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
now simply line these parts up put some

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.479 
now simply line these parts up put some
clamps<00:03:34.820> on<00:03:35.000> them<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.330> let<00:03:36.019> them<00:03:36.200> dry<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.890> great

trick<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.239> write<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.690> time<00:03:39.049> of<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:40.040> glue

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
trick is to write the time of the glue

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.009 
trick is to write the time of the glue
up<00:03:40.970> down<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.280> know<00:03:43.610> for<00:03:43.970> sure<00:03:44.330> when

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
up down so that you know for sure when

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.170 
up down so that you know for sure when
the<00:03:45.200> glue<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.440> dry<00:03:45.650> enough<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.489> work<00:03:46.730> with<00:03:46.760> it

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
the glue is dry enough to work with it

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.630 
the glue is dry enough to work with it
another<00:03:48.019> thing<00:03:48.380> is<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.590> keep<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:49.100> nice<00:03:49.250> damp
