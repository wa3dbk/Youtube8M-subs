shooting any one of these targets this

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.870 
shooting any one of these targets this
probably<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.409> enough<00:01:36.710> for<00:01:36.920> most<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.220> us<00:01:37.369> but

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
probably is enough for most of us but

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.880 
probably is enough for most of us but
this<00:01:38.000> is<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.299> Iron<00:01:38.450> Man<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.229> you've<00:01:39.710> got

this is the Iron Man and you've got
certain<00:01:40.280> criteria<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.909> meet<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:41.840> in<00:01:41.960> this

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
certain criteria to meet so in this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.690 
certain criteria to meet so in this
stage<00:01:42.380> you've<00:01:42.979> got<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.220> shoot<00:01:43.490> from

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
stage you've got to shoot from

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.590 
stage you've got to shoot from
underneath<00:01:44.000> here<00:01:46.420> one<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.540> the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
underneath here one of the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.740 
underneath here one of the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
is that these stages are long I didn't

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.940 
is that these stages are long I didn't
think<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.200> was<00:01:54.259> ever<00:01:54.350> going<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.649> get<00:01:54.770> out<00:01:54.920> of

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
think I was ever going to get out of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.790 
think I was ever going to get out of
here<00:01:55.190> there's<00:01:55.789> targets<00:01:56.210> everywhere

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.620
