00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.000
 join 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.380
 You should only know that the products 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.540
 I give away all of them once 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 defied not used now but up 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.110
 slipped my disinfected hand 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.520
 let's start right now with us 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.369
 a foundation and that is it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.590
 promotional finish foundation with hyaluron the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.619
 I'll have it new in the range 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.240
 the phase 05 10 b threshold which is mine 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.009
 definitely too dark I have the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.659
 Formation at home tried me where 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.610
 nobody sees it so i just see how 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.799
 the foundation behaves on the skin 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.409
 I came to the conclusion that is 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.840
 a very nice foundation is for but 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.610
 only for oily skin for mixed skin and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.920
 Oily skin does not dry your skin 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.689
 emphasize dry create very very strong 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.119
 is very strong in drought 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.799
 That's why this is wrong 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.119
 not for me but for people the oily 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.860
 I think skin could have 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.390
 be happy with it as we have 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.800
 Next, this product is great 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.569
 has interested and that is that the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.610
 liquid glass 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.860
 I have only ten china in the paint 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.330
 So the half color that suits me very much 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.000
 well, I wear them today under the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.160
 eye and I have to say I got it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 still set before that they have one 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.970
 camouflage should be 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.440
 I thought it is this ultra covering 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.269
 but not just like one 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.340
 medium well cover or concealer 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.170
 comparable to the fit with concealer 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 I would say maybe not quite like that 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.940
 creamy but from the ceiling on force 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.890
 in any case very comparable 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.209
 and i have to say as said color top 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.250
 I think she is very beautiful 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.080
 I would have faded as I said 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.330
 Covering something presented as me 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.209
 But really disturbs on this camouflage 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.430
 is the following and that is the ultras 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.290
 Strongly perfumed you smell that totally 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.300
 if you do that 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.530
 it smells like a well-known couple 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.840
 now it is not clear what kind of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.610
 one is pretty good but i honestly 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.569
 contractual me so close to the eye on since 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.250
 I do not really want that one 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.260
 product is so heavily perfumed or 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.110
 about optimized do not understand the meaning 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.220
 very much behind it for me that way 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.230
 a case 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.209
 Two products that I have besides 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.190
 would give away a foundation 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.459
 are once fixing by patrice 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.890
 brubecks and that is such a wax 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.900
 in the form of a pin of the crane bring out the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.489
 just pigmented i just have that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.950
 unfortunately in a much too dark color 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.120
 get in the 0 30 chocolate 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.950
 Moselle 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.420
 I think that's called really great 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.549
 and I imagine it to be one 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.260
 great product is if you just her 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.269
 already has beautiful eyebrows and the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.680
 wants to fix old in the morning and one 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.420
 wants to give a little color on it 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.129
 then this is a great product so me 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.900
 think that works really well 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.780
 and then I have patrice here 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.549
 which is a magic powder and that is 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.140
 it a pen you turn on then you have 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.480
 her here in sponge applicator in here 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.010
 Eyeshadow and the points just there, so to speak 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.560
 such a and could then with the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.390
 Applicator to apply as much to 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.129
 I find that theory in practice 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.599
 Product not very successful with this 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.580
 sponge applicator can really do that 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.340
 not so good on the eye wear 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.780
 So brushing up brush then I think 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.159
 the color not very successful the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.730
 The color is only ten west side 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.320
 story 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.419
 that's just one 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.650
 silver glitter maybe very nice 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.790
 for New Year's Eve 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.139
 I can imagine that 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.790
 somehow an eye make-up once again 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.860
 to top and glitter in the eye make up 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.840
 but otherwise for everyday life 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.759
 is that nothing we come to 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.740
 my favorite category and forced 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.919
 I once got products there 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.560
 the multi med blush in color 0 20 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.150
 countries full of the beautiful name I find 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.100
 and that is also a leaf with 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.780
 then mix different colors 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.949
 could know something like that already from 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.259
 patrice team just do it again 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.520
 revised i find the color very much 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.400
 this is a very nice one 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.860
 Tomorrow beary throne supertoll for the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.169
 winter and everyday life and I am 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.270
 also the texture great silky matte very much 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.610
 beautiful to blend a very successful 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.260
 Blush I think it's just time 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.699
 again such a color you already know 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.949
 she has already seen 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.300
 and if you have a lot of make-up like me 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.800
 then you have such a color already 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.840
 That's why I wish that 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.030
 patrice in addition to such everyday use 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.220
 also something is loud or what colors 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.229
 very special brings out with a lot 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.150
 shimmer or whatever that would be 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.880
 I really wish but otherwise 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.380
 good blush little but no loose 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.270
 because I already have a lot of myself 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.979
 we own such colors 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.990
 a highlight and I love 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.570
 highlighter namely that the healing is 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.470
 single powder in the color only 20 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.800
 champaign 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.570
 this looks very structured 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.370
 I like the surface very much 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.139
 good and the color is really great 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.260
 a very nice warm golden 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.900
 champagne to'n just glittering 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.310
 with shimmer can be really great 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.659
 I am excited can do more 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.280
 one does not say an absolute one 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.599
 recommendation before we go to the lips 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.490
 I wanted to come again 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.139
 briefly address the nail polish patrice 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.940

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.620
 nice then once a choral tower with 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.440
 I also like golden glitter 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.330
 really good then a brown matter do 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.760
 very resourceful for the winter and 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.099
 then another youtube with the pearl 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.750

 they are great on the lips 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.100
 great for everyday life and now there is 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.070
 just the color makes only 60 blackberry 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.290
 because a very nice reddish bear 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.240
 sound with very low fab release them 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.800
 doing very fresh on the lips and 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.120
 I am very happy that it is this color 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.680

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.180
 shine empire fluid lipstick you see 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.870

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.030
 packaging 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.710
 I got two colors from it and 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.760
 Although once the color only 10 to be 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.620
 continued 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.480
 I'll give it away because it's easy 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.800
 so newton is that goes on my lips 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.480
 I lost so much 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.210
 Pigmented lips do not do that 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.850
 and then the color is only 60 mary 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.830
 barry i'm wearing straight and thats 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.150
 Likewise lipsticks in lipgloss shapes 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.710
 that is, they should be pigmented so 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.640
 like a lipstick but feel 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.380
 like a lipgloss 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.260
 I can confirm that too I am the 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.300
 Pigmentation is very beautiful 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.770
 Great distribution is not at all 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.650
 sticky on the lips it feels 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.390
 proven lip balm on the lips 

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.980
 I think that's great bleeding 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.690
 I also do not know I have some 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.910
 I'm not the problem now and she 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.560
 above all, are very beautiful 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.540
 They do not think that's great now 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.520
 all day if you eat or drink 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.740
 of course it goes away but it remains 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.210
 very beautiful steyn back and they carry 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.669
 evenly and I find that 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.630
 very great for everyday life too or 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:51.669
 I'll be there for the rest of you, too 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.620
 definitely see more colors 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.910
 Do you already have patrice products? 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.080
 tested then you have mine 

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.950

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.600

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.460
 otherwise do not forget on instagram 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.530
 to stop by because of the raffle 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.640
 everybody worked hard and I hope 

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.900
