backwards<00:02:25.390> as<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:29.170> Acorn<00:02:30.170> holds<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.940> code

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
backwards as in the Acorn holds the code

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.290 
backwards as in the Acorn holds the code
to<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> oak<00:02:32.720> tree<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:34.220> it's<00:02:34.880> about<00:02:35.120> our

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
to the oak tree and it's about our

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.110 
to the oak tree and it's about our
callings<00:02:35.840> about<00:02:36.530> how<00:02:36.680> they<00:02:36.950> can<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.430> found<00:02:37.880> in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
callings about how they can be found in

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.330 
callings about how they can be found in
our<00:02:38.240> childhoods<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.200> how<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.100> need<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
our childhoods and how we need to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.960 
our childhoods and how we need to
forgive<00:02:40.670> children<00:02:41.180> for<00:02:41.390> their<00:02:41.800> idiosyncratic

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
forgive children for their idiosyncratic

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.800 
forgive children for their idiosyncratic
behavior<00:02:44.680> because<00:02:45.940> they're<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.120> Acorn

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
behavior because they're the Acorn

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.140 
behavior because they're the Acorn
sometimes<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.350> little<00:02:48.440> branch<00:02:48.800> soul<00:02:49.280> bursts

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
sometimes a little branch soul bursts

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.360 
sometimes a little branch soul bursts
out<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.260> Acorn<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.739> you<00:02:51.860> have<00:02:51.950> no<00:02:52.100> idea

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
out of the Acorn and you have no idea

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.310 
out of the Acorn and you have no idea
where<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.610> came<00:02:52.760> from<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.209> we<00:02:53.989> need<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.230> be

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
where it came from but we need to be

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.720 
where it came from but we need to be
patient<00:02:54.709> with<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:54.830> because<00:02:55.130> it's<00:02:55.280> going

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
patient with that because it's going

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.050 
patient with that because it's going
somewhere<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.630> I've<00:02:57.080> had<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> lot<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:58.060> struggle

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
somewhere and I've had a lot of struggle

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.790 
somewhere and I've had a lot of struggle
with<00:02:59.150> my<00:02:59.300> calling<00:02:59.810> and<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.530> book<00:03:00.680> is

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
with my calling and so this book is

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.100 
with my calling and so this book is
really<00:03:00.980> good<00:03:01.220> for<00:03:01.459> me<00:03:01.610> it's<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:02.110> yeah

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
really good for me it's like yeah

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.900 
really good for me it's like yeah
talking<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.650> one<00:03:03.770> of<00:03:03.860> my<00:03:03.920> dad's<00:03:04.100> friends<00:03:04.459> about

talking to one of my dad's friends about

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.610 
talking to one of my dad's friends about
why<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.209> hell<00:03:05.450> did<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.720> do<00:03:05.780> this<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.290> how<00:03:06.410> did<00:03:06.530> I

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
why the hell did I do this and how did I

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.550 
why the hell did I do this and how did I
let<00:03:06.800> this<00:03:06.980> happen<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.610> just<00:03:08.290> because<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
let this happen and just because of the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.760 
let this happen and just because of the
guitar<00:03:10.010> all<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:10.910> had<00:03:11.239> just<00:03:12.080> cause<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.709> a

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
guitar all of this had just cause of a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.350 
guitar all of this had just cause of a
piece<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.010> wood<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:15.080> only<00:03:15.530> book<00:03:16.489> I<00:03:16.760> think<00:03:16.850> that

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
piece of wood the only book I think that

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.759 
piece of wood the only book I think that
has<00:03:17.620> genuinely<00:03:18.620> changed<00:03:19.010> my<00:03:19.489> perspective<00:03:19.910> as

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
has genuinely changed my perspective as

a<00:03:44.360> lovely<00:03:44.630> way<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:44.959> write<00:03:45.380> about<00:03:45.500> science<00:03:46.489> I

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
a lovely way to write about science I

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.240 
a lovely way to write about science I
realized<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.480> it<00:03:47.690> brought<00:03:47.930> together<00:03:48.250> two

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
realized that it brought together two

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.190 
realized that it brought together two
aspects<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:50.030> my<00:03:50.180> perception<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:50.989> had

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
aspects of my perception that I had

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.199 
aspects of my perception that I had
always<00:03:51.350> struggled<00:03:52.280> with<00:03:52.640> before<00:03:52.820> thinking

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
always struggled with before thinking

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.009 
always struggled with before thinking
one<00:03:53.540> opposed<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.290> other<00:03:55.750> humanity<00:03:56.750> and

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
one opposed to the other humanity and

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.020 
one opposed to the other humanity and
science<00:03:57.799> and<00:03:58.010> one<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.280> not<00:03:58.430> hot<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.000> other

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
science and one is not hot and the other

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.500 
science and one is not hot and the other
cold<00:03:59.510> they<00:04:00.080> actually<00:04:00.560> are<00:04:01.299> exactly<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.480> same

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
cold they actually are exactly the same

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.009 
cold they actually are exactly the same
thing

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
thing

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.610 
thing
I<00:04:03.730> took<00:04:04.730> four<00:04:05.209> years<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.810> write<00:04:05.989> this<00:04:06.170> book<00:04:06.500> it

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
I took four years to write this book it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.020 
I took four years to write this book it
was<00:04:06.709> essentially<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.310> book<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.610> was<00:04:07.760> already

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
was essentially a book that was already

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.390 
was essentially a book that was already
written<00:04:08.360> it<00:04:08.840> was<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:08.989> diary<00:04:09.260> but<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.160> was<00:04:10.250> one

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
written it was a diary but it was one

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.460 
written it was a diary but it was one
that<00:04:10.489> made<00:04:10.640> no<00:04:10.760> sense<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:11.810> was<00:04:12.079> quite

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
that made no sense and it was quite

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.120 
that made no sense and it was quite
esoteric<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:13.640> is<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.480> for<00:04:15.350> two<00:04:15.500> years

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
esoteric and is really for two years

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.729 
esoteric and is really for two years
it<00:04:16.190> was<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.459> book<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:16.760> just<00:04:17.239> sucked<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.049> then

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
it was a book that just sucked and then

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.370 
it was a book that just sucked and then
for<00:04:19.010> two<00:04:19.220> more<00:04:19.430> years

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
for two more years

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:28.380 
for two more years
was<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:22.350> voice<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.830> had<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.640> let<00:04:25.450> fly<00:04:27.390> but

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
was a voice that I had to let fly but

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.630 
was a voice that I had to let fly but
not<00:04:28.420> the<00:04:28.780> way<00:04:28.900> lyrics<00:04:29.350> fly<00:04:29.620> lyrics<00:04:30.160> are<00:04:30.310> just

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
not the way lyrics fly lyrics are just

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.550 
not the way lyrics fly lyrics are just
they<00:04:31.570> puke<00:04:32.020> themselves<00:04:32.680> out<00:04:32.860> for<00:04:33.310> me<00:04:33.490> anyway<00:04:34.060> I

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
they puke themselves out for me anyway I

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.820 
they puke themselves out for me anyway I
hear<00:04:35.560> them<00:04:35.800> as<00:04:36.390> an<00:04:37.390> instrument<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.020> phonetic

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
hear them as an instrument of phonetic

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.330 
hear them as an instrument of phonetic
melody<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:40.020> when<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.050> try<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.620> sing<00:04:41.950> lyrics

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.690 
melody and when I try to sing lyrics
that<00:04:42.670> are<00:04:42.790> wrong<00:04:43.530> they<00:04:44.530> stick<00:04:44.860> in<00:04:45.010> my<00:04:45.160> throat<00:04:45.190> I

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
that are wrong they stick in my throat I

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.940 
that are wrong they stick in my throat I
feel<00:04:45.910> like<00:04:46.030> I'm<00:04:46.150> lying<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.470> not<00:04:47.650> until

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
feel like I'm lying and it's not until

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.010 
feel like I'm lying and it's not until
they<00:04:48.160> spill<00:04:48.790> out<00:04:48.970> that<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.300> know<00:04:49.450> I'm<00:04:49.690> telling

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
they spill out that I know I'm telling

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.710 
they spill out that I know I'm telling
the<00:04:50.110> truth<00:04:50.140> because<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.860> often<00:04:51.760> miss<00:04:52.270> hear<00:04:52.540> them

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
the truth because I often miss hear them

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.240 
the truth because I often miss hear them
to<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.960> point<00:04:53.110> where<00:04:53.230> I'm<00:04:53.410> singing<00:04:53.950> lyrics

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
to the point where I'm singing lyrics

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.600 
to the point where I'm singing lyrics
that<00:04:54.760> rhyme<00:04:55.210> with<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.570> correct<00:04:55.960> lyrics<00:04:56.610> which

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
that rhyme with the correct lyrics which

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.810 
that rhyme with the correct lyrics which
is<00:04:57.790> dumb<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:02.440> almost<00:05:02.890> got<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.370> that<00:05:03.640> point

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
is dumb and I almost got to that point

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.430 
is dumb and I almost got to that point
where<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.150> book<00:05:04.870> was<00:05:04.900> sort<00:05:05.290> of<00:05:05.410> flying<00:05:06.330> but<00:05:07.440> it

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
where the book was sort of flying but it

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.380 
where the book was sort of flying but it
has<00:05:08.620> nothing<00:05:08.950> to<00:05:08.980> do<00:05:09.220> with<00:05:09.250> my<00:05:09.520> throat<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.270> it

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
has nothing to do with my throat and it

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.120 
has nothing to do with my throat and it
has<00:05:10.510> nothing<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.870> do<00:05:11.110> with<00:05:11.140> listening<00:05:11.890> to

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
has nothing to do with listening to

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.260 
has nothing to do with listening to
what's<00:05:12.340> in<00:05:12.520> the<00:05:12.550> ether

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
what's in the ether

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.110 
what's in the ether
they're<00:05:14.260> just<00:05:14.440> trying<00:05:14.770> not<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:15.010> lie<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:15.880> maybe

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
they're just trying not to lie so maybe

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.870 
they're just trying not to lie so maybe
they<00:05:16.330> have<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.480> in<00:05:16.840> common
