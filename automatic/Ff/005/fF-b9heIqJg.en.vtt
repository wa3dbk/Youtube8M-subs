I missed some other ones this right here
is<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.909> much<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.180> overall<00:01:48.479> tone<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.049> how

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
is pretty much the overall tone of how

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.639 
is pretty much the overall tone of how
this<00:01:49.710> game<00:01:49.950> went<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.659> we<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:52.140> kept<00:01:52.470> turning

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
this game went down we just kept turning

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.550 
this game went down we just kept turning
the<00:01:52.920> ball<00:01:53.040> over<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.909> then<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.110> kept

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the ball over and then we just kept

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
the ball over and then we just kept
giving<00:01:55.740> him<00:01:56.009> easy<00:01:56.189> looks<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.909> didn't<00:01:57.149> even

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
giving him easy looks well I didn't even

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.340 
giving him easy looks well I didn't even
bother<00:01:57.450> running<00:01:57.630> down

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
bother running down

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.770 
bother running down
because<00:01:59.220> there's<00:01:59.939> nothing<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.600> at<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
because there's nothing I can do at that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
because there's nothing I can do at that
time<00:02:00.950> I'm<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> game<00:02:02.490> we're<00:02:02.909> down<00:02:03.060> by

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
time I'm back in the game we're down by

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
time I'm back in the game we're down by
10<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:05.900> Jefferson<00:02:06.900> gets<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.200> steal<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.799> I'm

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
10 and Jefferson gets the steal and I'm

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.729 
10 and Jefferson gets the steal and I'm
just<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:08.850> want<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> ball<00:02:09.600> here<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
just I just want the ball here and I

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.800 
just I just want the ball here and I
don't<00:02:11.280> get<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.150> happens<00:02:12.510> maybe

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
don't get it and this happens maybe

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.240 
don't get it and this happens maybe
three<00:02:13.200> or<00:02:13.230> four<00:02:13.440> times<00:02:13.620> throughout<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.100> game

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
three or four times throughout the game

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.140 
three or four times throughout the game
and<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.700> just<00:02:14.940> gets<00:02:15.120> really<00:02:15.390> frustrating<00:02:15.860> so

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and it just gets really frustrating so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.300 
and it just gets really frustrating so
like<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> fool<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.810> go<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.200> another<00:02:19.290> shot<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:19.980> i

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
like a fool I go for another shot and i

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.790 
like a fool I go for another shot and i
miss<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:21.090> much<00:02:21.569> as<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.900> wanted<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.290> take<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.500> shot

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
miss as much as I wanted to take a shot

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.860 
miss as much as I wanted to take a shot
right<00:02:23.040> here<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.520> didn't<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.120> have<00:02:24.330> one<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
right here I didn't really have one and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.990 
right here I didn't really have one and
i<00:02:25.170> found<00:02:25.410> Tiago<00:02:25.860> Splitter<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.520> easy<00:02:26.640> dunk

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
i found Tiago Splitter for the easy dunk

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.949 
i found Tiago Splitter for the easy dunk
so<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.720> mean<00:02:28.470> why<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.370> here's<00:02:30.150> Nate<00:02:30.360> Robinson

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
so I mean why not here's Nate Robinson

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.960 
so I mean why not here's Nate Robinson
thinking<00:02:31.319> is<00:02:31.440> good<00:02:31.470> taking<00:02:32.130> three<00:02:32.430> missing

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
Jefferson gives it to me so I take the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.540 
Jefferson gives it to me so I take the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
game as you can see the Thunder have the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.729 
game as you can see the Thunder have the
ball<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:47.970> also<00:02:48.420> pretty<00:02:49.290> much<00:02:49.530> how

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
ball and this is also pretty much how

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.699 
ball and this is also pretty much how
the<00:02:49.769> game<00:02:50.130> win<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.600> thunders<00:02:52.019> kept<00:02:52.319> making

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the game win the thunders kept making

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.100 
the game win the thunders kept making
threes<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:54.120> wouldn't<00:02:54.450> think<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.840> Thunder

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
threes you wouldn't think the Thunder

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.990 
threes you wouldn't think the Thunder
would<00:02:55.230> come<00:02:55.410> out<00:02:55.530> here<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.100> shooting

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
would come out here and just shooting

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
would come out here and just shooting
lights<00:02:57.269> out<00:02:57.420> from<00:02:57.630> Three's<00:02:57.959> what<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:58.769> did

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
lights out from Three's what they did

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.539 
lights out from Three's what they did
and<00:02:59.850> just<00:02:59.910> like<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> Thunder<00:03:00.959> in<00:03:01.019> real<00:03:01.170> life

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
and just like the Thunder in real life

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.880 
and just like the Thunder in real life
they<00:03:02.549> blocked<00:03:03.000> almost<00:03:03.900> everything<00:03:04.650> we're

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
they blocked almost everything we're

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.009 
they blocked almost everything we're
putting<00:03:05.190> up<00:03:05.310> down<00:03:05.640> by<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.880> basket<00:03:06.420> between

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
putting up down by the basket between

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.920 
putting up down by the basket between
Ibaka<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.980> Perkins<00:03:08.299> we<00:03:09.299> just<00:03:09.540> couldn't<00:03:09.840> get

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
Ibaka and Perkins we just couldn't get

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.710 
Ibaka and Perkins we just couldn't get
anything<00:03:10.549> like<00:03:11.549> an<00:03:11.670> open<00:03:11.970> shot<00:03:12.239> down<00:03:12.480> man

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
anything like an open shot down man

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.410 
anything like an open shot down man
here's<00:03:13.350> another<00:03:13.590> good<00:03:13.890> joke<00:03:14.190> Robinson<00:03:15.060> mrs.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
here's another good joke Robinson mrs.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.270 
here's another good joke Robinson mrs.
it<00:03:15.570> Ginobli<00:03:15.959> gets<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.320> rebound<00:03:16.440> tosses<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.250> to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it Ginobli gets the rebound tosses it to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.060 
it Ginobli gets the rebound tosses it to
me<00:03:17.459> down<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.910> court<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:19.230> go<00:03:19.650> for<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.859> layup

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
me down the court and I go for the layup

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.580 
me down the court and I go for the layup
and<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.549> again<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.329> I'm<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.109> having<00:03:22.350> really

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
and this again so I'm just having really

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.069 
and this again so I'm just having really
bad<00:03:22.620> luck<00:03:23.010> all<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.840> clock<00:03:25.049> is

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
bad luck all right so the clock is

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.289 
bad luck all right so the clock is
running<00:03:25.440> down<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:26.100> want<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.430> end<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.640> half<00:03:26.850> on<00:03:27.269> a

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
running down I want to end the half on a

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.780 
running down I want to end the half on a
positive<00:03:27.540> note<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.950> decided<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.430> go<00:03:29.579> for

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
positive note and I decided to go for

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.960 
positive note and I decided to go for
the<00:03:29.850> spin<00:03:30.600> there<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.079> as<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.980> can<00:03:32.160> see<00:03:32.190> Durant

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the spin there and as you can see Durant

down<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> court<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.380> go<00:04:22.620> for<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.860> skill<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.430> I
