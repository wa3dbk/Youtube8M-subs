00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello how about clipping friends we 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.100
 we find rubens sambueza 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 midfielder of the eagles of america 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.660
 in the life of a soccer player because the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.590
 Revenge word is always inherent 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.730
 not if I honestly do not think so much 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.590
 as revenge but are possibilities 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 opportunities that arise and I 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 it seems we have a nice opportunity 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 the tournament that comes from being able to make a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.660
 good championship and reach the final 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.520
 that we all want as a foreigner 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.910
 team rubens is the commitment what 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 you feel older to be able to help 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.770
 the team more than anything yes sure 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.760
 always all eyes are on 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 in what foreigners can do 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.579
 it seems that we have formed a good 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.170
 group a good team and we can give you 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.390
 fight anyone 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.969
 is to work hard this preseason and 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.370
 when the tournament starts, know that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.659
 we have great great qualities 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
 players like to get what 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.220
 we all want your experience that you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.780
 tells how this America will look in the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.830
 2013 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.640
 the truth that very well the group does not 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.540
 disarmed too much comrades have come 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.950
 new ones that have been well matched to the group 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.159
 I always said it is a human group 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.470
 very very healthy and that also makes that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.940
 we can achieve great things we are 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.830
 united on and off the court and 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.270
 also that seems to be very important 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.470
 what is the commitment commitment is the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.440
 day to day work day by day 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.240
 striving to the fullest for when we 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.130
 touch play do the best and obviously 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.530
 I hope that is that now we can get 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.360
 a title of the year that comes from the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 preseason although they go party after 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.070
 party they talk not that is undeniable 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.040
 yes and yes sure as you said you already 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.060
 the club has been eliminated in two 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.450
 semifinals and the truth that bad because 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.940
 this club because of the demand it has for 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.860
 the commitment to get champion out there 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.760
 those semifinals are worthless 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.099
 so 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.500
 is to pass it to reach the final win it and 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.019
 well we are working very hard to 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.269
 that in the personal plane as it will face 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.829
 I know this closing 2013 through 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.620
 an injury that are always inopportune 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.040
 but but comes a rubens sambueza with 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.290
 everything yes yes the truth that luckily the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.980
 injury I'm already very well finish the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.300
 liguilla matches well obviously I 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.550
 I would have liked it there 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.800
 to be in the beginning as it was 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.830
 against toluca but I feel very good 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.400
 working hard because it seems that what 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.070
 what remains fruit is work 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.890
 and well I'm getting into everything 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.870
 so that to continue for a for the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.000
 good way in your mind and in the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.600
 no player is doing banking rubens 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.210
 he did not assure nobody likes that relay 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.070
 from anyone and strives every day to 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:11.050
 to get to be a headline obviously 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.860
 it depends on one but it also depends on the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.710
 technical if you see it right or if what you can 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.570
 be among the eleven that start but 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.420
 good for that is this is a very group 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.670
 competitive and we are preparing very 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.190
 well the truth rubens the last tournament 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.170
 that always arrived because there are people 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.530
 that maybe he does not believe today he has to live 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.630
 osvaldo martínez, you showed yourself 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.520
 in the end what is the message 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.830
 in that sense towards people now that 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.090
 arrives at osvaldo 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:46.500
 The same thing that I said does not seem to me that 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.500
 you have to judge it ahead of time 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.730
 Osvaldito is a great player as he does not 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.980
 we are all of us here 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.870
 for something they hire a club so 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.530
 important as it is the america it seems that 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.209
 the most important thing is to work every day 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.330
 and there the good results are going to come 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.970
 do not give importance to there so many 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.180
 critics are always going to exist I said it 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.910
 when I arrived and good sometimes those bad 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.819
 criticisms make you stronger 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.739
 and can achieve great things finally 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.850
 rubén you can people dream in this 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.370
 new next year yes yes the truth yes 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.420
 how are we all dreaming 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.400
 from the from the utilero to 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.190
 until the last player coaching staff 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.430
 leaders we dream that the year that 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.250
 come be very good for the america and 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.630
 Well hopefully we can get it 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.130
 best of luck for the team 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.350
 thank you very much for the time rubens 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.450
 now to you and greetings very 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.510
