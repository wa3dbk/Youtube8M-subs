00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.870
 friends, we are getting closer every day 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.900
 that this new dlc arrives that will bring 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.179
 some totally new vehicles and 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.460
 well let's say we are with a 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.559
 very big question to know how 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.810
 is going to behave this motorcycle the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.239
 typical vindicator motorcycle because 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.860
 it has very futuristic features and 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.989
 let's say there is a very 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.700
 great in the gta community to know 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.110
 the performance if it's going to be a new 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.149
 triplet that is going to eat at 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.829
 current motorcycles or really going to 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.960
 be one more that will only stand out 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.660
 by its design we will remember that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.130
 motorcycles let's say they are the ones 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.110
 they won the driving test that I did 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.880
 because in the first place there is the link to kuma 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.350
 it's a very powerful motorcycle has a 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.690
 good selection and handling is 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.480
 surprising in second place we have the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.310
 tinka multi and then let's say 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.280
 they are practically motorcycles that are 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.960
 focused and very sport focused on 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.060
 speed focused on acceleration 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.570
 we have the one that goes in third place that is 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.950
 the carbon rs and well go if there is a 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.739
 feature that these have 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.200
 motorcycles is that they have say a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.820
 totally sporting approach a focus 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.240
 towards speed a focus 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.200
 and the performance now let's see the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.950
 let's say that the equivalent in life 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.040
 real in Latin kakuma is a ducati 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.740
 streetfighter and then on horses 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.650
 force has 155 and the motor let's say that 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.760
 the size in public centers is 999 per 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.229
 there was 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.270
 now we have the booty line here 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:36.229
 same has 177 horsepower and 999 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.880
 here is one let's say there is a common 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.500
 dispute that maybe there are two 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.720
 motorcycles that can also be this 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.399
 breed but see the numbers the numbers 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.050
 they are incredibly big to that is what 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.470
 that we are going to concentrate now the 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.330
 coal rs equal has horsepower 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.530
 171 and a displacement in centimeters 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.789
 cubic of 1198 that is an engine 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.490
 impressively large we are going to 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.450
 wash you wash and 801 r &amp; r it is a 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.970
 ducati 848 has 134 force heads and a 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.509
 Minor scroll is already like 800 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.039
 and then let's go now yes make a cross 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.920
 of information make a comparison 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.450
 direct against what will be the tinka 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.360
 vindicator in life 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.970
 it is an nm wave of four 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.920
 points and we clearly see the size of the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.370
 motor that are cubic centimeters 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.280
 that is at 745 that is to say this 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 motorcycle did not beat him in the size of the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.849
 engine to none of the four that 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.680
 we have in the first place of the test 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.819
 of driving a driving test that yes 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.709
 they are interested I will leave it in the 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.440
 description of the video to know the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.900
 performance of motorcycles and then 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.690
 let's say that the first impression is of 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.900
 that the motor of this motorcycle is 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.450
 minor is also very probably 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.239
 the power will also be lower and here already 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.549
 we started to say that we already have the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.459
 first element to place it within 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.709
 the table within the whole group of 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.750
 motorcycles that we have and then I 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.269
 I think that with this we would place it 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.480
 below the minimum of these four 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.660
 motorcycles you can already go let's say 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.239
 in the table much below these 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.620
 four now we go with the next 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.720
 aspect that interests us what are the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.340
 horsepower and then in the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.170
 horsepower is plummeting 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.620
 totally the hope that we had 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.870
 on 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.549
 we have a hope that 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.290
 this motorcycle because of the traits that are 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.530
 our tourists had a performance 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.019
 greater but not here we already see clearly 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.480
 the focus of this motorcycle is 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.430
 motorcycle is not focused towards what 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.470
 what is the high performance is not 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.959
 focused on sportsmanship and for 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.019
 course is not focused on having a 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.110
 let's say that a great acceleration a 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.390
 great speed because it has nothing else 54 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.010
 horsepower is comparing those 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.040
 numbers against the 4 that we showed 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.190
 that bring numbers of 170 150 that is 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.410
 totally falls short rather this 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.450
 motorcycle let's say it's focused 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.609
 towards what is the future of 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.239
 schools let's say these Japanese 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.849
 crazy because they did a job let's say 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.950
 that very good design very futuristic and 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.220
 they said then this is one this is a 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.760
 approach as we say that for what 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.530
 It can be a scooter in the future 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.470
 so then we practically place 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.720
 this motorcycle let's say it's not going to be 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.900
 of high performance and we locate it therefore very 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.240
 below 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.229
 sports motorcycles let's see which one 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.539
 is the last word because go this is 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.340
 considering the real approaches of the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.440
 motorcycles let's see what it is that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.690
 says rock star rock star has the last 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.240
 word to see how he designs this 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.740
 motorcycle if it really breaks with the 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.509
 rules of reality and gives you a super 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.270
 let's say a super motor and a super 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.100
 sportsmanship or simply also follows 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.770
 the rules of how life behaves 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.740
 real and places it in a moderate position 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.080
 go clearly the appeal of this 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.270
 motorcycle, it is a design, it is a 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.160
 very attractive design for some is going 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.889
 to like others outright and they will say that 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.990
 motorcycle so horrible but good this 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.880
 is what we found and then let's see 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.550
 the last word has rock star there 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.199
 one that is going to have a modest performance 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.160
 of moderate performance you what 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.160
 say goodbye goodbye 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.950
 yes
