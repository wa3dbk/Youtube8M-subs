00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
going to break it so we actually break

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.779 
going to break it so we actually break
one<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.740> that<00:00:22.740> one<00:00:22.890> has<00:00:23.100> broken<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.550> four

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
one and that one has broken at four

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.089 
one and that one has broken at four
kilos<00:00:24.240> we're<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.320> using<00:00:25.560> five<00:00:25.740> kilo

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
kilos we're going to be using five kilo

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.070 
kilos we're going to be using five kilo
drag<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.519> breaking<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.029> four<00:00:27.240> kilos<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.810> great

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
drag so breaking up four kilos is great

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.189 
drag so breaking up four kilos is great
now<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.830> important<00:00:29.310> thing<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:30.199> understand

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
now the important thing to understand

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
now the important thing to understand
with<00:00:31.410> rubber<00:00:31.890> bands<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.489> they<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.850> two<00:00:33.120> ends

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
with rubber bands is they have two ends

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.190 
with rubber bands is they have two ends
if<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.290> won<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.680> around<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> line<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.200> put

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
if I won this around the line and put

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.590 
if I won this around the line and put
both<00:00:37.380> ends<00:00:37.649> back<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> line<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.210> two

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
both ends back to the line we have two

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
both ends back to the line we have two
times<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.350> breaking<00:00:40.530> strain<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.430> so

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
times the breaking strain not one so

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.389 
times the breaking strain not one so
that<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.690> eight<00:00:43.290> kilos<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.100> for

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
that would now be eight kilos not for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.650 
that would now be eight kilos not for
what<00:00:44.820> we're<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> do<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.700 
what we're going to do is we're going to
connect<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> rubber<00:00:46.170> band<00:00:48.110> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> line<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
connect a rubber band to the line and

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.830 
connect a rubber band to the line and
put<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> air<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.670> go

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.960 

and<00:00:56.740> when<00:00:56.860> we<00:00:56.980> put<00:00:57.160> on<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.310> rubber<00:00:57.550> band<00:00:57.790> we

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
and when we put on a rubber band we

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.850 
and when we put on a rubber band we
don't<00:00:58.210> want<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:58.660> slip<00:00:58.930> so<00:00:59.530> it's<00:00:59.680> very

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
don't want it to slip so it's very

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.400 
don't want it to slip so it's very
important<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:01.300> turn<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.990> rubber<00:01:02.140> band

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
important that you turn the rubber band

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.220 
important that you turn the rubber band
around<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.890> nylon<00:01:03.390> lots<00:01:04.390> of<00:01:04.570> times<00:01:04.809> here<00:01:05.140> I'm

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
around the nylon lots of times here I'm

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.720 
around the nylon lots of times here I'm
going<00:01:05.410> to<00:01:05.530> do<00:01:05.770> it<00:01:06.480> about<00:01:07.480> 10<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.770> 20<00:01:09.220> times<00:01:09.430> that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
going to do it about 10 to 20 times that

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.280 
going to do it about 10 to 20 times that
make<00:01:09.970> sure<00:01:10.180> it's<00:01:10.360> just<00:01:10.570> not<00:01:10.810> going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.050> slip

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
make sure it's just not going to slip

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.990 
make sure it's just not going to slip
and<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:12.010> should<00:01:12.220> actually<00:01:12.370> stretch<00:01:12.790> the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
and you should actually stretch the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.570 
and you should actually stretch the
rubber<00:01:13.120> band<00:01:13.450> on<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:13.900> it's<00:01:14.020> got<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.200> nice<00:01:14.580> tight

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
rubber band on so it's got a nice tight

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.010 
rubber band on so it's got a nice tight
fit<00:01:17.760> if<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:18.910> slips<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.300> will<00:01:19.450> damage<00:01:19.660> your<00:01:19.870> line

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
fit if it slips it will damage your line

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.990 
fit if it slips it will damage your line
if<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.290> doesn't<00:01:20.590> slip<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.860> won't<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.220> because

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
if it doesn't slip it won't and because

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.850 
if it doesn't slip it won't and because
we've<00:01:22.210> got<00:01:22.360> one<00:01:22.510> end<00:01:22.750> breaking<00:01:23.170> it's<00:01:23.290> 4<00:01:23.470> kilos

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
we've got one end breaking it's 4 kilos

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.000 
we've got one end breaking it's 4 kilos
we<00:01:24.700> only<00:01:24.970> want<00:01:25.240> one<00:01:25.480> end<00:01:25.750> to<00:01:26.050> go<00:01:26.170> back<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.890> the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
we only want one end to go back to the

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.160 
we only want one end to go back to the
line<00:01:27.280> but<00:01:27.880> if<00:01:28.000> we<00:01:28.119> have<00:01:28.300> two<00:01:28.510> ends<00:01:28.690> going<00:01:28.930> back

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
line but if we have two ends going back

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.460 
line but if we have two ends going back
it<00:01:29.590> doubles<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.369> rate<00:01:30.670> now<00:01:31.570> most<00:01:32.350> times

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
it doubles the rate now most times

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.730 
it doubles the rate now most times
people<00:01:33.130> use<00:01:33.310> outriggers<00:01:33.910> they're<00:01:34.360> using<00:01:34.930> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
people use outriggers they're using the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.440 
people use outriggers they're using the
system<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.220> involves<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:36.880> clip<00:01:37.090> at<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.330> end

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
system that involves a clip at the end

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.630 
system that involves a clip at the end
so<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:37.810> gotta<00:01:38.020> spend<00:01:38.710> all<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.979> time<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.430> pull

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
so you gotta spend all the time to pull

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.230 
so you gotta spend all the time to pull
this<00:01:39.729> down<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.560> called<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.830> halyard

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
this down this is called a halyard

this down this is called a halyard
pulling<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.330> hell<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:43.570> down<00:01:46.350> open<00:01:47.350> up<00:01:47.440> the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
pulling the hell you down open up the

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.240 
pulling the hell you down open up the
clip<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.950> you<00:01:48.070> use<00:01:48.310> Engle<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.830> rubberband

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
clip that you use Engle the rubberband

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.420 
clip that you use Engle the rubberband
in<00:01:51.430> close<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.150> clip<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.509> you're<00:01:52.630> using<00:01:53.430> lots

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
in close the clip that you're using lots

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
it's going to break the rubber band and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.670 
it's going to break the rubber band and

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.140 
back now that's something we don't use
in<00:03:57.980> other<00:03:58.040> suits<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:58.490> we're<00:03:58.610> using<00:03:58.790> two

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
in other suits so we're using two

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.030 
in other suits so we're using two
totally<00:03:59.960> different<00:03:59.990> systems<00:04:00.650> on<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.890> one

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
totally different systems on the one

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.840 
totally different systems on the one
boat<00:04:01.280> when<00:04:01.880> we<00:04:01.910> pull<00:04:02.270> this<00:04:02.450> line<00:04:02.720> here<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:04.790> is

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
boat when we pull this line here this is

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.300 
boat when we pull this line here this is
a<00:04:05.000> flat<00:04:05.450> line<00:04:05.630> we've<00:04:06.260> got<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.470> direct<00:04:06.860> contact

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
a flat line we've got a direct contact

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.620 
a flat line we've got a direct contact
so<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.550> hook<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.790> going<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.000> go<00:04:08.120> straight<00:04:08.450> in

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
so the hook is going to go straight in

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.870 
so the hook is going to go straight in
so<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.560> solution<00:04:10.130> that<00:04:10.160> we<00:04:10.370> have<00:04:10.459> found<00:04:10.640> to

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
so the solution that we have found to

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.160 
so the solution that we have found to
use<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.720> using<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.470> tag<00:04:12.830> line<00:04:13.840> once<00:04:14.840> again<00:04:14.930> we're

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
use is using a tag line once again we're

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.030 
use is using a tag line once again we're
going<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.320> use<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.500> rubber<00:04:15.709> band<00:04:17.709> at<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:18.859> time

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
going to use a rubber band at this time

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.380 
going to use a rubber band at this time
we're<00:04:19.160> going<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.310> use<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.489> tag<00:04:19.790> line<00:04:20.030> this<00:04:20.330> is

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
we're going to use a tag line this is

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.180 
we're going to use a tag line this is
the<00:04:20.630> tag<00:04:20.810> line<00:04:21.020> simply<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.470> piece<00:04:21.680> of<00:04:21.830> venetian

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
the tag line simply a piece of venetian

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.890 
the tag line simply a piece of venetian
blind<00:04:22.400> cord<00:04:22.700> on<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.300> end<00:04:23.419> of<00:04:23.480> a<00:04:23.600> line<00:04:23.870> that

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
blind cord on the end of a line that

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.850 
blind cord on the end of a line that
goes<00:04:24.169> all<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.470> way<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.890> tip<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:26.860> we've

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
goes all the way to the tip and we've

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.170 
goes all the way to the tip and we've
got<00:04:27.950> this<00:04:28.070> great<00:04:28.280> little<00:04:28.430> gizmo<00:04:28.850> which<00:04:29.030> is<00:04:29.150> a

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
got this great little gizmo which is a

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.700 
got this great little gizmo which is a
tag<00:04:29.450> line<00:04:29.660> return<00:04:30.790> once<00:04:31.790> it<00:04:31.940> goes<00:04:32.060> up<00:04:32.240> there

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
tag line return once it goes up there

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.900 
tag line return once it goes up there
that<00:04:33.710> return<00:04:34.040> brings<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.460> all<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.610> way<00:04:34.730> down

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
that return brings it all the way down
