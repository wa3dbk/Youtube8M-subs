probably just looked at first or that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.490

there<00:02:29.770> but<00:02:30.430> all<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.880> these<00:02:31.060> are<00:02:31.240> very<00:02:31.600> very

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
there but all of these are very very

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.690 
there but all of these are very very
fall<00:02:32.290> appropriate<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.100> like<00:02:33.310> all<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.550> them

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
fall appropriate and I like all of them

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.810 
fall appropriate and I like all of them
so<00:02:34.180> much<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:35.560> palette<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.340> also<00:02:36.760> an

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
so much this palette is also an

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.940 
so much this palette is also an
investment<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.480> a<00:02:37.600> $60<00:02:38.290> palette<00:02:38.800> but<00:02:38.890> I

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
investment this is a $60 palette but I

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.340 
investment this is a $60 palette but I
think<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.430> can<00:02:39.550> really<00:02:39.850> work<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.810> every

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
think that it can really work for every

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.340 
think that it can really work for every
day<00:02:41.970> for<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.060> fall<00:02:43.270> time<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.630> has<00:02:43.780> some<00:02:44.170> more

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
day for the fall time it has some more

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.530 
day for the fall time it has some more
colors<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:44.950> there<00:02:45.100> than<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> naked<00:02:45.790> does<00:02:45.970> but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540

didn't<00:04:35.870> like<00:04:36.380> it<00:04:36.560> took<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.800> lot<00:04:36.889> of<00:04:36.949> time<00:04:37.190> and

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
didn't like it took a lot of time and

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.310 
didn't like it took a lot of time and
put<00:04:37.490> together<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.570> saves<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:38.990> like<00:04:39.169> the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
put together and it saves on like the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.110 
put together and it saves on like the
amount<00:04:39.350> of<00:04:39.620> time<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:40.010> lipstick<00:04:40.430> does<00:04:40.610> but

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
amount of time that a lipstick does but

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.600 
amount of time that a lipstick does but
it<00:04:41.240> only<00:04:41.389> takes<00:04:41.780> up<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.169> time<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.889> apply<00:04:43.220> that

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
it only takes up the time to apply that

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.879 
it only takes up the time to apply that
a<00:04:43.669> lip<00:04:43.880> gloss<00:04:43.910> does<00:04:44.419> and<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.320> also<00:04:45.470> has<00:04:45.860> a

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
a lip gloss does and it also has a

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.190 
a lip gloss does and it also has a
finish<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> lip<00:04:46.760> gloss<00:04:46.790> does<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:47.870> it's<00:04:48.020> all
