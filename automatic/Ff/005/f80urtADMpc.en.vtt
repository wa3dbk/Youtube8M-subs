00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
click wheel and here's another one which

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.000 
click wheel and here's another one which
is<00:00:33.300> also<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:33.960> important<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.829> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
is also very important and this is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.250 
is also very important and this is
probably<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:35.899> one<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> most

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
probably the one that's one of the most

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.440 
probably the one that's one of the most
difficult<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.980> replace<00:00:38.250> because<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.149> cannot

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
difficult to replace because you cannot

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
difficult to replace because you cannot

get this ribbon cable out let's say you

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.110 
get this ribbon cable out let's say you
just<00:00:41.520> rip<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> cable<00:00:42.090> broke<00:00:43.640> this<00:00:44.640> ribbon

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
just rip the cable broke this ribbon

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.170 
just rip the cable broke this ribbon
cable<00:00:45.230> connects<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:47.640> other<00:00:47.760> part<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
cable connects to the other part of the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.529 
cable connects to the other part of the
iPod<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.780> help<00:00:48.960> these<00:00:49.320> two<00:00:49.559> parts<00:00:49.890> interface

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
iPod to help these two parts interface

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.900 
iPod to help these two parts interface
now<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:53.840> earphone<00:00:54.840> jack<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
now here you have your earphone jack and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.150 
now here you have your earphone jack and
hold<00:00:56.910> button<00:00:57.210> assembly

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
hold button assembly

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.750 
hold button assembly
so<00:00:59.160> this<00:01:00.829> interfaces<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.489> part

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
so this interfaces this with this part

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.359 
so this interfaces this with this part
of<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> iPod<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> work<00:01:03.989> together<00:01:04.369> now

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
of the iPod for it to work together now
