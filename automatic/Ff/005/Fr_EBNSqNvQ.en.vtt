00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 This week we have one more 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.490
 Assassin writing I'll tell you one 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.309
 the difference between the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.309
 playstation 4 and xbox one loose in 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 of my awesome bmb friends I'm out 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.439
 There is no beer at home. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.850
 You are against beer. 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.380
 will have served for a long time here in the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.380
 channel this week the launch of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.900
 assassin's creed black flag or a 124 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.630
 played this synergy cut all the others 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
 I threw the last one also at 123 which went well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.530
 cool but now you win is as follows 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 question is that these subscribers are a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.340
 game to be bad if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.780
 are two studios working on two 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.120
 different games do not know when you have a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.920
 game a launch has another studio 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.450
 working the next time, then who? 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 do not know the ubisoft recently released 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 that these inscribed will be a series 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 annual then every year will have a new game 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 this critical sense and I'm thinking 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.480
 assassin's creed in the beginning he was a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.780
 game so ball show that counted the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 history and in the gut kids 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.769
 the history of mankind put a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.840
 a little for those who do not know the story 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.729
 say goodbye suddenly you also play the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.380
 first the first at first the dung 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.030
 a few seconds second game in the series 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.950
 which in my opinion is the best of all 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 but the concept of assassin's creed is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 basically take the history of the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.100
 humanity and us in the holes of history 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.560
 try to fit the story of the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.090
 assassins or the Templars at last 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 find out you will not know 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.570
 only regret I mistake the ubisoft released 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.220
 some books and satisfied 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 many people praised it says 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.860
 virus are very good I think maybe 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.689
 you better look for the gods 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.829
 I do not have to play the game I think 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.630
 You earn a lot more by learning the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.979
 Portuguese and I'm thinking, will it be? 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.170
 this sensitivity is even to be a 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.700
 annual game because you get the kids from 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.470
 story books have embedded in a 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 story that is not playing the way 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 in the real history of the state fits a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 new story line tries to talk about 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.220
 facts that have occurred in cash a new 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.600
 story up 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.100
 Does this sensitivity really be the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.320
 to be a normal game is that you have 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.850
 more special care to be honest 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.469
 what you're doing is critical because 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.810
 I 'm afraid of murder's creed. 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.610
 become a colloquy and why I say this 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.780
 Why did I get put in a game? 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.549
 behind the other simply to win 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.829
 money and not worry that the fact 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.899
 that finally pleased all fans of the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.670
 series of situations asking what was the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.620
 history of the game put a story 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.510
 well worked out with really cool text 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.680
 Anyway, I'm afraid the guys mess 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.060
 throughout the series and simply to 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.459
 make money that I think is what 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.799
 the guys are going to do it unfortunately and now 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.720
 begins the war of islands next 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.060
 generation officially officialized 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.750
 now I oficializei does not have to 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.360
 where to run 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.450
 You can start fighting in the comments. 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.010
 xbox the best year playstation 4 is better 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.170
 because for those who do not know when xbox 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.209
 announced below was announced the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.159
 playstation 4 playstation 4 do with 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.200
 looks better than xbox one 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.200
 Only for those who do not know the xbox 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.780
 maintained a change in the pecs in the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.220
 radio settings and he'll stick to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.690
 dick with playstation 4 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.370
 some producers have said that they have no 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.590
 make a difference between the two 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.299
 Sony recently announced that the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.400
 badge you that you will be able to make 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.900
 Nokia headset will be able to do with eight 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.549
 people simultaneously 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.079
 Microsoft immediately announced that 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.629
 you can do with eight people too 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.220
 the kinect bid I find the two useless 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.500
 consoles will have kinect there 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.120
 sony is a copy of shopping do not know w 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.829
 how is your income functional and not 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.120
 talk a lot about how amazing it is 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.890
 it seems this is not just a similar thing 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.419
 Kinect does not say anything about it in 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.310
 really talk a little bit more in a non 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.900
 give much emphasis do not know because it is a 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.430
 new thing that we did not have a 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.019
 playstation is that sucks now 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.549
 It looks like it looks like a kinect I know 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.169
 there as a professional does not have much 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.209
 information about how this 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.769
 interaction with games and everything 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.060
 any way kinect or not for me no 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.799
 proposed to be of no use at all 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.379
 of the two I think the differential factor 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.780
 of this new generation as it was the other 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.730
 As I said several times, it 's good to be the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.760
 unique and will now have a factor 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.859
 in Brazil, especially the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.299
 here overseas as well but it will be 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.069
 the price factor because here abroad 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.410
 for those who do not know the xbox it is a bit 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.699
 more expensive than Playstation 4 but not me 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.959
 mistake is a bit more expensive because this is 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.790
 the picture because it comes with that bunch 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.799
 cnet I do not know if they will release a year later 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.419
 your customer and will stay the same price I 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.599
 I really do not know but the president knows 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.459
 that playstation 4 is an absurdity of 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.500
 price compared to xbox the year then 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.480
 consequently the price factor will be 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.919
 a turning point in the war of consoles 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.109
 will have very beautiful that will turn 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.449
 because of the price of these viruses and 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:19.169
 talked about both microsoft microsoft and 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:21.180
 a knife in the galley charging from xbox live 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.669
 microsoft points now a lot of people are going 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.620
 have to change because sony or can 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.880
 that in general I keep big fan of 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.070
 sony by exclusive 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.290
 but as it is in the beginning of generation, I 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.510
 unfortunately I will not have the option of 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.130
 choose xbox the year playstation 4 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.110
 How am I a video game fan? 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.550
 I will not be able to overcome the xbox will be 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.460
 launched here in Finland for those who do not 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.750
 knows 8 countries had an xbox 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.160
 honored among them were those who 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.440
 fuck finland then the final going 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.150
 xbox or postponed then will face the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.710
 playstation 4 that will arrive on the 29th 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.480
 next month as soon as I get the 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.220
 console you can be sure to have a 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.440
 box will have review do not know how it is 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.390
 does the embargo still demonstrate the 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.610
 game dashboard but I'll try to get 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.680
 first hand I'm seeing'm still 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.390
 seeing is not guaranteed from a 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.040
 sony the official sony store for power 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.990
 make the first impressions in the 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.400
 sony clear in advance I know you have one 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.650
 wrapped embargo on the internet you do not 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.360
 can show dashboard of playstation 4 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.130
 but once you have some information and 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.750
 if I can get it in the sony store because 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.340
 There is not in my city, there is only one other. 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.810
