00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 the option but then to take into account 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 the tips prior milestones before adopting 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.000
 we are high accompanies us that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.610
 is to focus on making a decision 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.289
 responsible when adopting the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 adoption process of an animal of 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.340
 company is free but requires 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.059
 the necessary care for 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 welfare of the same at this time there 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.190
 250 animals in preparation for the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.770
 adoption program are animals that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.260
 are in the treatment areas and in 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.960
 pre surgical area waiting to be 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.150
 sterilized after the day 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.200
 are from last Sunday in the park 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.270
 simón bolívar we had a 100% success 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.580
 in the adaptability of animals that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.820
 we carry for the moment in the center of 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.670
 zoonoses we have 25 dogs and cats 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.040
 which are increasing exponentially 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.229
 at the moment they are passing to 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 surgery program to move to 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.740
 adoption program is not the campaign 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.149
 is focused because in the district 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.310
 capital we have a high number of 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.560
 animals that roam on public roads is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.110
 without owner thing that for the entity 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.840
 makes a huge step back to extract the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 animals to the zoonosis center once 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
 they arrive at the center they have to pass a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.710
 period while they are passed to 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.080
 Sterilization is dewormed 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.340
 identify behind a microchip and 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 then they put all scheme of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.130
 vaccination then that is a process 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.990
 long and really demanding in costs 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.850
 if a person has taken the important 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.679
 decision to have a new member in your 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.660
 Steps 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.730
 well as we said in principle is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.819
 want in second instance have to 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.879
 go to the zoonoses center 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.189
 look at what kind of animals we have if

 he believes that there are some of them that 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.120
 can be compatible with him then 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.609
 We now present and fill out a 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.719
