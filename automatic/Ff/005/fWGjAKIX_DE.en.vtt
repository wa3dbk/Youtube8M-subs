 gaddafi wants guido contini the song 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.319
 swiftly the us cinema grace in scharnitz for 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.700
 third time has the international 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.620
 dog sled race in scharnitz 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.809
 took place and the heat has 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.460
 neither the makers nor the huskies what 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.580
 done but sit yourself in the next 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.580
 contribution 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.840
 we are in now seems the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.510
 dog sled race every year 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.029
 this time because the weather when in the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.160
 think back years or extreme 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.020
 minusgrade buys today at +6 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 down here really 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.950
 crazy about this season 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 The weather here often allows the race 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.149
 It's great that it really is 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.340
 everything in the enthusiastic we have this year 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 for the first time new jumps one night 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.829
 on thursday it took place 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.390
 Wow it was so many spectators 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.520
 terrific even have to go into the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.770
 bake karwendel and now it has 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.160
 traditional races we have 80 teams 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.899
 here from seven nations and the race 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 is really very popular that it 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.519
 a top runner the top always teamed them 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 say that more or less that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 his whole year traveling 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.060
 from yukon trail to scharnitz across 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.010
 about the world and the great here in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.200
 charlies is that on the track 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.900
 Direction ground takes place very much 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.270
 long just has fancy straight pieces 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.420
 and that is something very special 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.009
 because the normal trails are more for 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.900
 the wind blows and the dogs can not 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.400
 get on the speed like here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.759
 with us and that's why the race is like that 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 popular it is the third international 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.340
 dog sled race mechanics fire was 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.799
 only one night we run 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.270
 are about ten to twelve people 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.070
 in action we also provide the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.320
 stretch items in pour break and on 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.869
 clear the ground and the starters and the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.549
 timekeeping I believe without the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.950
 honorary functionaries would be enough 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 not possible to run as run 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.719
 although in a dog race the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.840
 Timekeeping in itself not a big one 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.880
 problem means there are strong ones 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.100
 Start times and are the distances 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.009
 the city distances are two minutes and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.670
 there is enough time so there is no 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.519
 problems 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.709
 the time is measured at tenth the 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.019
 konrad lie whether one from the sports club 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.670
 Charles already mentioned this year 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.040
 third time the international 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.930
 dog sledding in scharnitz 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.030
 on saturday and sunday there was ever 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.819
 a run in the machiner and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.860
 sled dogs could expand this 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.720
 both runs are added together and 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.150
 The winners then become the maturity 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.890
 determine the respective category if 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.530
 a once the passion of 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.989
 huskies fans bug will not get you 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.830
 let's get started , let's talk about it 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:50.030
 as started without 2003 with a 400 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.190
 class with four dogs and I'm mine 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.459
 first jump races and then races 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.230
 changes to the distance and penultimate 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.450
 actually mainly medium distance 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.599
 and long distance race with distributor 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.310
 alaskan malamuten we lay 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.000
 they already throw wood all around 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:12.380
 So we have 119 81 one can 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.600
 first poverty war and have a throw 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.680
 doing with the bitch have had 400 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.739
 and have now increased to 10,115 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.370
 you on the way with the quandt so more 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.829
 drive 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.000
 the training starts in autumn with three 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.160
 until four times a week and now during 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.290
 the racing season depending on what we long 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.850
 race more drive what you partly 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.889
 but during the week you are also the one 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.180
 only short training but completely without 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.250
 training is not possible 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.380
 michael plank rist leader of the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.790
 International sled dog race 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.670

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.670
 categories at this sport event 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.150
 we differentiate between rough new ones 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.060
 the category where cross-country skier with dog 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.769
 which goes on the round course and then where 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.600
 the sledges are curious about the course 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.040
 are on the way and there we have at the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.870
 sled then stretched the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.120
 distinction according to number of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.389
 clamped 100 there is a category 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.440
 for two dogs a category for 400 for 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.759
 604 800 and then the quasi 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.500
 royal discipline for huskies 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:18.560
 Span with more than 80 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.900
 we already have colleagues there in the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.880
 principle from december to february each 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.730
 weekend to be on a race 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.740
 What has nothing here is nothing 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.440
 surely the circumstance that it is one of the 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.060
 beautiful race is and warm colleagues 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.590
 then only a few races drive 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.750
 they are also secures with the start 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.550
 despite the heat breaking in for the 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.100
 huskies no problem 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.890
 they ran and asked the numerous 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.420
 a huge shoe is looking forward to it 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.870
 you're back to that 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.870
 next year
