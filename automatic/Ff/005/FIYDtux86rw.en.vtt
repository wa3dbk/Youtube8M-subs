00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.990
 in sao paulo programmed 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.360
 there are seven thousand buses is the total of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 fleets of the 75 companies operating in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.240
 capital but only this month 1,500 of the 7 thousand 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 buses are stopped 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 the alleged grounds are various lack of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.060
 parts 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.539
 buses without minimum conditions of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.149
 safety or lack of crew 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.489
 few drivers and collectors because the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.550
 offered wages are low 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.649
 who suffers most from this situation is the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.320
 that you will see now in this report 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 afternoon edition special time 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.860

 You'll catch the bus with us at five 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.660
 and a half in the morning and will know the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.879
 they think passengers leaving 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.059

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.070
 the place is itaberaba is five and a half from 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.260
 morning and the queue already in order 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 It's people who need to get up very early. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.580
 to get two sometimes up to three 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 driving directions to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.700
 job 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 the buses are slow but few 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.380
 passengers are relaxed and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.010
 distressed at almost the whole endpoint of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.020
 bus 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.640
 a police officer is always on duty to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.979
 organize the entrance and avoid 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.689
 confusions that tend to form because 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.689
 no one wants to be late for service 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.670
 taking five hours to work in 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 pines and she 's in the lava for six years 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.650
 I'm here six hours, that still counts. 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.369
 with exposures two driving takes one 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.880
 gets worse 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.740
 I'll take one that's the one to get one that 56 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.520
 and silver 6 in the barn 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.290
 But this I'm late happens to you. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.540
 delaying too much work because of 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.310
 position last week bringing 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.799
 enough rain even had no condition 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.270
 here everyone looks at her I think it is 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.880
 everybody stay at home 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.619
 the driving here is in the same hand and when 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.960
 You come in that happens, I hope, day. 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.700
 days and the Sunday that the panel has 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.500
 one segment border back to back 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.549
 I pick up after lunch is lose in the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.610
 Sunday 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.920
 who arrives late loses the day and loses 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.550
 paid Sunday for it 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 push-push is great 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.200
 Everyone squeezes in the doorway, I see 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.240
 tell mona maria da grace gonçalves that 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.120
 take the bus at the final point of the pompeii 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.580
 Bus lapa half hour here they 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.740
 They say it is 15 fifteen minutes but not 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 It's half an hour when we form people. 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.320
 stay here for an hour you can not take 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.370
 where he drops dirty kids people get 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.380
 I hurt all this because I just think 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.980
 What about this whole mess here in the morning? 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.430
 It's good, it finally leaves, that lack is unique. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.520
 same day the bus company 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.810
 not ever on bus here could of form 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.000
 none 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.060
 unfortunately joe this bus line 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.490
 here is pompous but it is not 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.310
 solving nothing at all 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.090
 We 're always going to fill up the booklet. 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.640
 it is overcrowded it will not crowded overcrowded 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.820
 the bus drivers to escom 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.050
 safety of passengers and their own 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.200
 traveling the overcrowded 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.360
 but for them there is no other way out 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.320
 people go on this bus in the morning is 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.320
 generally is 110 115 100 according to 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.989
 reach the goal of 100 to 120 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.440
 more than 36 people can travel 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.870
 on foot what goes most people will because 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.350
 the condition is not sufficient public and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.120
 agent cooperates with passengers to 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.610
 people risks taking passengers 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.100
 to cooperate with passengers on the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.290
 because you see a person 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.600
 hanging on the door and can hurt us 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.510
 It has already harmed much out including 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.140
 even I already have a cross of 40 accidents 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.739
 with people now only watching or passing 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.890
 hit a car with the person falls the only one 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.550
 the driver's fault, and then we are 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.320
 Thank you for stopping the car and looking for 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.930
 close the door when you give in to close 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.110
 of some more fall in addition the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.330
 only too crowded is bad to go to 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.550
 The store that gets heavier is 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.290
 especially overcrowded 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.580
 is more dangerous than with a stocking 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.020
 sitting on a 30 to 40 leg sofa 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.980
 This way it's more dangerous there. 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.290
 1 90% more 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.250
 Would you rather stay and wait two or three? 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:37.510
 in the door of our lady the door to 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:42.490
 china by auto bus padlock on the door 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:46.390
 No you do not think so and it's too bad. 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:53.340
 today because there is only one man missing 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:57.830
 name forced to travel is dangerous but 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:02.000
 need the black night 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.810
 30 in Brazil at least 30 today 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.830
 or less, it's cool, there's another 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:14.930
 Rio starts the journey of the 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.210
 hours of movement is difficult. 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.170
 the average speed of buses 10 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.170
 kilometers kilometers 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:31.199
 60% of the detran information 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.809
 currently in circulation in são paulo 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.029
 does not have security 

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:38.039
 they are not collected because this 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.189
 would further aggravate the situation of 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.189
 transports 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.790
 the bus goes super crowded both in the morning 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.950
 cedure on the way to work as in the 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.080
 around the clock and for those who stay 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.250
 waiting for intermediate points to 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.390
 situation is worse 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.390
 some buses to 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:25.149
 how not to stop at a very common point 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:28.240
 Everyday we come to six hours here. 

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:30.809
 they leave 7 6 15 term this is when the years 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.809
 come leisure 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.850
 I think this is more a lack of 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.580
 competition in another queue if it had 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.440
 another firm would not have such a lack of 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.300
 bus as it has then that the company 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.550
 preserve - bus 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.510
 I think it's the one to win more 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.700
 money because a car when it loads 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.520
 too noticed the load of 2 right face 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.200
 so not interesting to him for two 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.670
 cars on the line being that makes it a 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:14.130
 two service sao paulo has 75 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.940
 companies a total fleet of seven thousand 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.880
 bus 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.250
 currently stand at 1,500. 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.340
 garages for lack of drivers and 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.540
 collectors for lack of parts or for 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:30.140
 lack of minimum security conditions 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.140
