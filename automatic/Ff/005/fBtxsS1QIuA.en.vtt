00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
some graphics around depending on how

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.650 
some graphics around depending on how
strong<00:04:12.000> your<00:04:12.300> card<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:13.200> handle<00:04:13.500> okay<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.660> you

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
strong your card can handle okay so you

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.470 
strong your card can handle okay so you
can<00:04:15.840> change<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.230> resolution<00:04:16.380> um<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:17.730> you<00:04:18.209> do

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
can change the resolution um if you do

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.120 
can change the resolution um if you do
one<00:04:19.200> or<00:04:19.700> 1280<00:04:20.700> by<00:04:20.970> 720<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:21.960> will<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.290> 720

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
one or 1280 by 720 this will be 720

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.969 
one or 1280 by 720 this will be 720
pixels<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:24.780> can<00:04:24.960> make<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.410> as<00:04:25.530> high<00:04:25.680> as<00:04:25.740> you

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
pixels you can make it as high as you

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.440 
pixels you can make it as high as you
want

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
want

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.510 
want
or<00:04:27.900> we<00:04:28.050> could<00:04:28.200> do<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.440> automatic<00:04:29.040> which<00:04:29.310> is

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
or we could do it automatic which is

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.550 
or we could do it automatic which is
what<00:04:29.700> it's<00:04:29.820> automatically<00:04:30.360> said<00:04:30.630> s<00:04:30.810> but<00:04:31.410> this

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
what it's automatically said s but this

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.980 
what it's automatically said s but this
will<00:04:31.770> force<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.520> be<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.450> higher

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
will force it to be of a higher

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.190 
will force it to be of a higher
definition<00:04:34.440> even<00:04:35.280> higher<00:04:35.730> than<00:04:36.000> actual<00:04:36.990> week

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
definition even higher than actual week

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.800 
definition even higher than actual week
and<00:04:37.530> actually<00:04:37.680> get<00:04:38.270> depending<00:04:39.270> on<00:04:39.390> how<00:04:39.480> strong

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
and actually get depending on how strong

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.890 
and actually get depending on how strong
