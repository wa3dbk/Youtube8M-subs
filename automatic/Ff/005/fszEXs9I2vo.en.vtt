00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 would they eat people meat 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.530
 but what if there is a piece of human in every piece of meat 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.570
 The average German is three times as meat as healthy for 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.519
 he is 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.050
 Over the past 60 years, global meat consumption has quadrupled and 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.259
 will more than double again in the next decades 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.429
 for so much meat is already here tons of grain at here 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.820
 At the same time, one billion people suffer from malnutrition 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.380
 and every three seconds a person dies from the effects of hunger 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 animal husbandry also contributes greatly to the pollution and waste of 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.720
 Water at 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.460
 around 40 percent of the world population has no access to clean drinking water 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 for a kilo of beef alone, we will have over 15,000 liters of water 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.370
 consumed 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.510
 With this amount you could shower for a whole year daily 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.430
 Around the globe life is at least 38 minutes hence the rainforest 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.270
 cleared Wilhelm 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.940
 Most of the film is destroyed by planes for banks or 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.590
 for the cultivation of feed to create fortune and the planet 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.610
 we can not survive in the long run 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 In addition, animal husbandry accounts for one-fifth of global greenhouse gases 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.520
 responsible for 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.550
 the consumption of animal products caused more greenhouse gases than the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.570
 worldwide for using ships and planes together as a cars 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.990
 The emergence of animal diseases such as bird and swine flu 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.180
 through our high meat consumption and the associated mass animal husbandry 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.260
 favored 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.660
 the more sick animals were torn 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.810
 are you more 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 Â«This also affects usÂ» 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.390
 dapd and of course the excessive meat consumption also harms us directly 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.090
 High blood pressure cardiovascular diseases diabetes 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.660
 Stuffed Exchange Disorders Picht gallstones fatty liver cancer and skin 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.220
 Diseases many afflictions anyone indirectly with with our good 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220
 healthy and meat annoying diet together 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.619
 It is up to each one of us to survive on the one hand 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:23.929
 Sustainably secure the planet
