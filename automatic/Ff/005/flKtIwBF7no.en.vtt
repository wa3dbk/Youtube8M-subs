00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.140
 have left behind the heat the humidity 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.420

 October 14th 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.050
 the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.160
 the colors that the rough ones 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.890

 what a beautiful animal looks like its horns like a crown this is undoubtedly the king of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490
 forest 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.950
 is the paradise 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.210
 last night it snowed 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.170
 what joy I woke up everything was covered in snow it looked like a card 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.080
 postcard I was shoveling the snow and I was so happy that they hit me 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.690
 about her 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.700
 then we play a snowball war with the neighbors 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.610
 How nice it is to live here 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.640
 the motor grader stepped clearing the street and I had to make another 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.820
 snow 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.040

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.310
 it snowed again last night 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.740
 When I finished hitting, the motor grader went back on the other hand and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.289
 again facing the front of house if not all of dirty snow 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.219

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:19.619

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.019
 my hands are full of calcium because of the word 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.209
 I think the cuckold of the motor grader 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.930
 he watches me and as soon as it's over he comes back and fills me with snow all over again 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:47.209
 I shit on the motor grader 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.669

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.309
 the fat man of the newscast turned 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:01.169
 instead of 30 centimeters fell 98 serbia 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:06.489

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.159

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.369

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.380
 I used to call my cousin and the seafood I did not want to do 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.830

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.959

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.259
 at that animal point 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.709
 for the arrangement of the car I will get a shower and a half 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.669
 I am convinced that God wanted the deer to carry it to a 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.259
 the hunters should have killed her until all 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:54.529

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.529

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:07.389

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.660
