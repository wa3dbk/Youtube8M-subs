00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.180
 defense should only loved to knife 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:28.180
 we have seen icebreaker is one of the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:29.920
 oriental now we see dagger and from 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.890
 here he 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.190
 ok sinks is a linear hit 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 a lunge that can go on the whole 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:54.280
 center line of the body from the eyes 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:58.449
 heart throat nominated genitals and serves a 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.390
 attack just a lunge we do not 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.370
 others who think as if it were a 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.340
 direct punch 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:11.260
 obviously the guard remember not this one 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.590
 but these do not expose the inner part 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.070
 ok for forearms but the outside 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.219
 and I always protect my heart throat 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.860
 well the organs of the central part of the 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:26.369
 thrombus he arrives make other than 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 go out 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.009
 I go out ok 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:42.399
 once released in the cram a gaza e 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:48.209
 always parade ok and blow and I can hit 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:53.560
 with the tip of the chin and the open hand 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:55.450
 in the eyes I go out I put pressure to 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.009
 to prevent him from continuing to pull me 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.189
 stab wounds 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:06.159
 at the same time, I hit 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.890
 agricultural lever on the wrist with the body I go 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.440
 towards him because in reality he 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.610
 will try to take the knife e 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.010
 so it's this job 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.989
 I go out pressure I hit the lever I push 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.989
 towards him disabled 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:44.700
 I go out hit I go to him 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:48.180
 the balances then summarizing I leave the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.790
 attack line put pressure col 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:58.200
 body I go to strike I put in lever to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.299
 wrist that I push towards the scene with the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.439
 body I can help you by closing the 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:09.989
 distance that is discouraging him 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:12.199
 can change hands ok and bring alcohol 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.199
 tel 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.720
 well this is the case a right point the 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.780
 right 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.490
 and if I find one who will have the knife says 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.520
 with the left 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.630
 a left-handed person can't do the same 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.930
 mirrored speech because having the 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:55.650
 left forward I struggle 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:00.610
 I struggle to rotate I struggle 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:05.080
 we are in the gym i know ok in the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.690
 problem in fast reality 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.410
 I struggle because this is ahead 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:20.010
 turning and then I don't go out the technique 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:20.010
 how it is the same as the right civic one 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.459
 desktop 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:34.900
 right left 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.900
 so if I was doing this work right 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:48.580
 it's the accident I do this job 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:50.259
 ok check hit i hit ok milano 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:59.660
 they strike again 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:05:03.949
 ok 12 is the usual speech and I push ok 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:09.910
 to close the makes the movement in the 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:14.770
 his arm I hit I catch 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.770
 disarm the disk again 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.940
 [Music] 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.080
 the problem of all the stabs that 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.500
 not different from each ok pulling many 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.670
 so I have to fend and go and e 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.410
 I ca n't always control that 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:52.710
 no one will give you security in front of a 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.320
 knife not to hurt you we try to 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.340
 take your skin home away from doing 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:02.220
 sink the knife in vital points 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:06.380
 with practice training if 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.630
 these speed coordination ok power 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.850
 knowledge of the human body therefore knowing 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.830
 where to strike as to destroy 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.380
 the opponent 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.630
 all this baggage goes up 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.560
 probability of success 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:25.200
 no one guarantees us 100 percent 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.360
 of success in a street fight 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.070
 especially in front of an aggressor 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.860
 armed with a knife for the knife not 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.180
 just sink the knife cuts too 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.990
 that when leaning on the knife e 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:42.330
 size that you don't need to sink into 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.720
 heart a throat to hurt you too 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.930
 simply by cutting there a finger a 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:53.340
 tendon a vein makes you much less 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:56.250
 combative then ram train at 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:02.220
 dynamism in non-technical techniques 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:05.040
 classic static technique the work must 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.580
 being dynamic that arrives I don't go out 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:12.710
 control it calcium in the genitals 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:19.980
 he gets paid taboo and drives away ok 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:22.430
 this I want to see this 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.430
 work
