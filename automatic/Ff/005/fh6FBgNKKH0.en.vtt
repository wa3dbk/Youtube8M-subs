 2 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.970
 ride scratched 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.190
 since last time among resented 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 about the abundance of spoilers my review 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.980
 on wolfenstein 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.409
 this time it will be a little different 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 Today I will tell you about watch dogs and about 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.089
 tom what is this sad shit well 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.760
 10 reasons why watch now 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.469
 dogs sucks ass this will not hit parade 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.339
 from admissible jambs find simple 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.369
 mistakes is just a list of well drove 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.140
 number 10 plot john carmack once 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.299
 blurted out that the video game plot is needed 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.190
 as much as he needs in porn 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.409
 I will not talk about why 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.280
 Carmack did not see the difference between breasts 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.409
 and porno me 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.600
 the watch dogs plot has the feeling that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.220
 got out of the box sochi standard 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 plot for video game cinema 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.479
 no wonder ubisoft is anything 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.350
 did not tell the story of the game almost to 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 release itself 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.300
 he's just not there and numbers are stealing 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.369
 money from people in retaliation for it 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.170
 commit about deer and armed people on 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.909
 motorcycles die as a result 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 Eiden's nieces now he's looking 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.369
 it's my fault I'm watching a movie with steven 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.959
 sigalom ok first question from what are you 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.780
 I expected to start stealing 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.479
 thought no one would notice the loss of money 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.720
 or victims just say okay about 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.020
 what kind of justice is the second question 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.679
 in the accident killed nieces not daughter not 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.220
 wife 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:05.099
 neither parents nor even sister niece 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.810
 what kind of motivation and tenders grew up in 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.879
 Ingushetia something to arrange 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.979
 bloody revenge for his death 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.580
 niece would be better if i watch a movie with 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.100
 Steven Sigalom watch dogs game 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 number nine cars 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.820
 I don't know what I expected from the implementation 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.980
 driving watch watch dogs 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.050
 the only game ubisoft on which they 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.710
 could practice was san driver 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.200
 francisco 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.510
 driving a car at watch dogs is simple 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.430
 unbearable torture not only 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.800
 machine control does not respond and yours 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.960
 actions in almost no way in chicago 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.330
 It seems to live exclusively street racing 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.010
 each machine is pumped to such an extent 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.540
 that vomits with the local accelerates to 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.640
 maximum speed practically 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.110
 instantly while turning it 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.740
 asard on and means refuses to 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.020
 principle 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.710
 between cars do not differ at all 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.550
 nothing they all go exactly the same 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.860
 collision interactions this 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.450
 just a joke kind of all who breaks 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.330
 the car league scatter in different 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.550
 sides like bowling from a bunch of yourself 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.860
 some debris with damage 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.900
 no way appear on the car i can 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.360
 Of course to assume that this pier is just 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.310
 really sucks carries frame that he bought 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.360
 once again confirms the guess 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.280
 that he grew up in mgu sewing number eight 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.310
 passers can not be beaten but you can 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.230
 shoot I don't know what I wrote thought 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.880
 when they made this decision 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.250
 that it is severely restricting freedom 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.440
 the player's actions so the lack of 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.960
 game opportunities to beat women upset 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.060
 any normal person can answer 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.980
 find the Ingush behavior only in nature 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.120
 on the streets of major cities when she starred 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.250
 interspersed with threats 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.770
 nails are available only if he has 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.320
 in the hands of a shortbridge 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.510
 number seven system check point of watch 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.940
 dogs was developed almost since 2009 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.790
 first years on the hall was 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.430
 sample checkpoint system 2009 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.890
 if normal 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.569
 each key element of the task is responsible 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.609
 for checkpoints, that is, here you can 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.159
 fight at the very end and start all 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.719
 anew from the very beginning need 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.680
 covert passage with such a system 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:08.540
 check-points start to enrage even more 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.730
 number six can not shoot out of the car 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.680
 how hard was it to add 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.079
 opportunity to take while riding 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.150
 what do i do in the open world game 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.910
 if I can not murder scene Rowan 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.829
 Tupac I can assume that having 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.870
 opportunities of Khakassia on your way 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.550
 that's very very cool i can 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.590
 suggest that the developers wanted 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.560
 to the player to the maximum use this 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.930
 opportunity but it does not justify 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.160
 castration of game number five monotony 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.650
 messi watch dogs boil down to two 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.539
 scripts a sneak on closed 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.030
 territory and covertly without possibility 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.099
 by the way the election of all to kill 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.759
 to hack something b 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.710
 catch up with someone and kill everyone remember 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.900
 is there any particular mission to call 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.210
 your favorite in the game is simply impossible 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.490
 there is also no task in the game 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.130
 which time would just be fun i 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.020
 I do not require high-class humor and satire 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.090
 but really it was impossible to add at least 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.849
 any funny situation along the way 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.190
 plot ah well yes how could I forget kumho 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.480
 spheres are only very serious 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.000
 things 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.660
 number four no customization 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.960
 character 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.090
 pi to 5 i could turn the goods of the joker 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.080
 put rbg on your shoulder and go 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.780
 rob caravans 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.700
 watch dogs can change the color scheme and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.240
 clothes shaft 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.800
 just wale i didn't see anything like that 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.800
 in single gene bases no no what kind 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.020
 miserable separated him i play beijing 5 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.960
 why can't i be a hacker who 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:46.580
 wears a dress that is so difficult number three 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.940
 frankly stupid implementation of the main 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.730
 networks we are all under the hood private life 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.310
 all our personal information does not exist 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.830
 uploaded to coca-cola 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.270
 the game does not develop at all and you 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.190
 ubiquitous observation and 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.770
 centralized control mechanisms 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.750
 cities really could not be put under 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.180
 doubt the propriety of the main character in his 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.310
 the means of achieving the goals could not be 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.470
 add doubts about loyalty 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.760
 tea or us information which 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.190
 could be adjusted 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.320
 the special services the game is trying to be 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.870
 serious but at the same time gives dullness 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.910
 a little more than fully whale again by 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.310
 Much of it deals with Tim over 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.140
 all than you can but the game 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.930
 throws up pretty serious moments 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:32.270
 like the torture scene watch dogs 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.000
 nothing at all she just 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.340
 there is all 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.260
 number two can't jump another one 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.790
 incredibly complex function which is not 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.370
 got implementation by virtue 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.000
 limited budget, what else can 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.400
 to tell 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.960
 aiden pier can't jump i could 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.090
 ok about tommy 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.010
 versetti can't swim myself 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.610
 floating better than a stone thrown into 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:58.010
 water jump but it may still number 1 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.170
 music in the game I was unhappy 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.780
 the absence of china again radio stations with 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.970
 metals, non-defective electronics watch dogs 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.280
 I just turned off the music despite 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.710
 advanced management 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.900
 soundtrack music selection worthy 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.640
 playing songs that their makdonals 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.560
 tenderness make her rather 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.370
 get rid of their food and leave 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.250
 the room 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.620
 These were 10 reasons why watch dogs 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.110
 sucks ass not all problems 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.880
 the game is just the tip of the iceberg such 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.220
 incredible hack was not already 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.290
 a long, long time ago I had to sell 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.150
 your copy of watch dogs to avoid staining 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.880
 a copy of wolfenstein which lay by 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.520
 next to the next shit I did not say about 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.480
 version optimization for pc 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.400
 frank ugliness versions for 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.360
 consoles last generation and very 

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.620
 very very large number of bugs 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.870
 stay away from this 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.260
 more that bitcoin could be made into a pirates 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.260
 miner
