case<00:00:30.179> I'm<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> try<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.420> get<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.570> panel

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
case I'm going to try and get this panel

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.010 
case I'm going to try and get this panel
to<00:00:34.469> mate<00:00:34.680> against<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:36.000> factory<00:00:36.480> panel<00:00:36.870> right

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
to mate against this factory panel right

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
here and that will made it up and when

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770 
here and that will made it up and when
I'm<00:01:10.260> done<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.780> the

I'm done it will look like this the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
I'm done it will look like this the
other<00:01:12.930> side<00:01:13.229> that's<00:01:13.439> already<00:01:13.710> completed<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
other side that's already completed and

other side that's already completed and
as<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:16.070> pretty<00:01:17.070> much<00:01:17.310> right

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
as you can see it is pretty much right

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.960 
as you can see it is pretty much right
up<00:01:18.090> against<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:20.280> panel<00:01:20.689> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.080> so

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
up against the panel all the way up so

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.580 
up against the panel all the way up so
in<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> case<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.570> use<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.080> long<00:01:25.229> strand

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
in this case I use some long strand

let's<00:01:28.860> walk<00:01:29.159> through<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> steps

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
let's walk through some of the steps

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
let's walk through some of the steps
once<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.430> panel<00:01:32.729> mocked<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.180> next

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
once you get your panel mocked up next

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
once you get your panel mocked up next
thing<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.409> take<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> area<00:01:35.100> off<00:01:35.250> real<00:01:35.579> good

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
thing is to take the area off real good

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.520 
thing is to take the area off real good
and<00:01:36.890> then<00:01:37.890> your<00:01:38.630> then<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.750> need<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> put<00:01:40.200> some

and then your then you need to put some
kind<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.950> releasing<00:01:41.280> agent<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.750> masking

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
kind of a releasing agent on the masking

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.429 
kind of a releasing agent on the masking
tape<00:01:43.790> just<00:01:44.790> some<00:01:45.030> automotive<00:01:45.420> car<00:01:45.810> wax<00:01:46.049> works

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
in the extra gap in this case I'm going

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.889 
in the extra gap in this case I'm going
to<00:01:53.070> use<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.640> long<00:01:53.970> strand<00:01:54.329> Kitty<00:01:54.540> here

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to use some long strand Kitty here

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:29.850 
to use some long strand Kitty here
so<00:01:55.110> let<00:01:55.259> me<00:01:55.320> show<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.560> how<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.890> that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.699 

okay<00:02:30.860> with<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.130> panel<00:02:31.430> out<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:32.180> can<00:02:32.330> see<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
okay with the panel out you can see that

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.910 
okay with the panel out you can see that
there's<00:02:33.709> some<00:02:33.860> left<00:02:34.100> over<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:35.120> it's<00:02:35.270> time<00:02:35.510> to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
there's some left over so it's time to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.790 
there's some left over so it's time to
send<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.100> down<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.959> just<00:02:39.200> get<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.620> where

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
send that down and just get it to where

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:51.090 
send that down and just get it to where
it'll<00:02:39.980> be<00:02:40.550> nice<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.970> flat<00:02:41.150> with<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.480> panel

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.530 

all<00:02:52.100> right<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.400> finish<00:02:52.640> these<00:02:52.910> panels<00:02:53.360> off

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
all right so to finish these panels off

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.000 
all right so to finish these panels off
fill<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.200> screw<00:02:54.500> holes

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
fill in the screw holes

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.430 
fill in the screw holes
we'll<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.400> reuse<00:02:55.700> some<00:02:55.910> body<00:02:56.810> filler<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.290> do

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
we'll just reuse some body filler to do

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.890 
we'll just reuse some body filler to do
that<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.280> we'll<00:02:58.580> extend<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.060> over<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.510> fill

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
that and we'll extend it over and fill

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.199
