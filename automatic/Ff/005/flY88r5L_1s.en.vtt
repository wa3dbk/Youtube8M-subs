 stay with his base 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.250
 taking advantage of the French this time we have to z 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.880
 go all this 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.210
 in the evening 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.210
 notice the fantasy xr 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.760
 he holds with their access to the texts that emerges from the club 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.850
 it's tough all over the country for the arrival of vancouver mike 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.770
 trust in this group and I look at the oral questions 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.930
 ball loss 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.250
 for berri land attention attention it goes very quickly in front 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.890
 small plane and its arteries 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.090
 the recycler of france this source 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 they are yellow 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.340
 the calculations and the 10th of August 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 relief for the moment he has injured his femur and should attract 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.060
 rescue teams to work 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.300
 he also played villeurbanne two days 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.980
 in his colleague knows by heart 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.660
 in short quite well still does the proof that the private 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 the games 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.820
 ten years it is the tight heart have made sail 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.900
 if the follow 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.780
 the Assize Court inside the tutelage 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.090
 your crazy gesture 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.220
 that's why because it's terrible it's scary 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 offensive rebound 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:16.469
 attention however lost by the star has notably lost with modo people who 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.759
 want 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.909
 yet the action still the two southern teachers 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.859
 so the fundamentals 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.989
 face to simply hold passengers 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.989
 it plays fast beauty with my financial karachi busy 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.849
 if dismissed not credible 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.309
 with six counters the news 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.579
 a person with his eighty meter of regaine this is the 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.619
 title role 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.279
 the reverse sap solutions of the text 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:43.069
 the simplicity 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.069
 in Frankfurt 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.329
 with clearer charisma 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.789
 because opposite 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.469
 I am fair 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.099
 it is true that the score 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.099
 in the corridor of the almost unanimous opinion 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.099
 and of course the year after having limited 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.329
 we find his place in the semi-finals these works it is here that we waited 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 in the contracting 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.559
 to this day from florida 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.179
 so it's probably its currency 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.179
 a campaign assassin for small businesses 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:24.869
 a little further 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:26.869
 in this same race 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.949
 then the victim who caused some concern 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:33.049
 Pierre-Alain Chapuis 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 the interface meant the shift 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.669
 ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.889
 it's only three key points 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.379
 woe to drugs 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.389
 that is the most important 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.219
 face these french-there tonight 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.139
