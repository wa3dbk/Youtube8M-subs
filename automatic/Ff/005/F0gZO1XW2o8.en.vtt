what<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.280> suggest<00:00:46.550> basically<00:00:47.329> about<00:00:47.510> sort<00:00:47.780> of

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
what I suggest basically about sort of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.510 
what I suggest basically about sort of
two<00:00:47.960> or<00:00:48.050> three<00:00:48.230> days<00:00:48.379> before<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:48.949> show<00:00:49.190> is

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
two or three days before the show is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.080 
two or three days before the show is
just<00:00:49.760> slowly<00:00:50.090> slowly<00:00:50.420> cut<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.170> water<00:00:51.350> back

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
just slowly slowly cut the water back

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.520 
just slowly slowly cut the water back
sort<00:00:53.090> of<00:00:53.180> three<00:00:53.510> days<00:00:53.690> out<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.170> ward<00:00:54.379> would

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
sort of three days out the ward would

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.959 
sort of three days out the ward would
drop<00:00:55.039> back<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.250> about<00:00:55.520> four<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.940> half

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
drop back to about four and a half

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.090 
drop back to about four and a half
liters<00:00:56.510> two<00:00:57.020> days<00:00:57.230> out<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.440> drop<00:00:57.770> back<00:00:57.920> down

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
liters two days out and drop back down

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.760 
liters two days out and drop back down
to<00:00:58.309> about<00:00:58.460> four<00:00:58.760> four<00:00:59.420> liters<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.260> then<00:01:00.620> one

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
to about four four liters and then one

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.549 
to about four four liters and then one
day<00:01:00.920> out<00:01:01.070> from<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.640> show<00:01:01.850> basically<00:01:02.600> probably

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
day out from the show basically probably

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.380 
day out from the show basically probably
filtering<00:01:04.100> maybe<00:01:04.250> one<00:01:04.519> liter<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> water<00:01:05.120> what

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
filtering maybe one liter a water what

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.090 
filtering maybe one liter a water what
that's<00:01:05.570> actually<00:01:05.690> gonna<00:01:05.990> do<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:06.980> when

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
that's actually gonna do and then when

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.320 
that's actually gonna do and then when
you<00:01:07.190> shut<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:07.550> water<00:01:07.730> off<00:01:08.030> straightaway

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
you shut that water off straightaway

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.970 
you shut that water off straightaway
what<00:01:08.990> will<00:01:09.110> happen<00:01:09.380> your<00:01:09.470> body<00:01:09.710> won't

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
what will happen your body won't

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.250 
what will happen your body won't
memorize<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.730> fact<00:01:10.970> that<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.630> still<00:01:11.960> thinks

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
memorize the fact that it still thinks

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.360 
memorize the fact that it still thinks
it's<00:01:12.410> actually<00:01:12.710> consider<00:01:13.070> you're<00:01:13.160> going<00:01:13.310> to

still<00:01:13.520> be<00:01:13.670> consuming<00:01:14.150> water<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.050> it<00:01:15.200> will<00:01:15.380> just

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
still be consuming water so it will just

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.460 
still be consuming water so it will just
be<00:01:15.620> human<00:01:15.830> nature<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.280> your<00:01:16.430> body<00:01:16.580> just<00:01:16.670> just

to keep sort of pee and that fluid out
and<00:01:20.810> what<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.050> will<00:01:21.140> actually<00:01:21.230> do<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.710> it<00:01:21.740> will

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
work you know I mean obviously

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.440 
work you know I mean obviously
everybody's<00:03:10.970> different

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
everybody's different

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.570 
everybody's different
it<00:03:11.959> might<00:03:12.230> take<00:03:12.470> sometimes<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:13.069> few<00:03:13.310> sort<00:03:13.519> of

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
it might take sometimes a few sort of

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.949 
it might take sometimes a few sort of
trial-and-error<00:03:13.970> attempts<00:03:14.630> but<00:03:14.780> what<00:03:14.930> I

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
trial-and-error attempts but what I

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.770 
trial-and-error attempts but what I
would<00:03:15.049> suggest<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.819> you<00:03:17.180> get<00:03:17.330> ready<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:17.720> a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
show about two weeks out and obviously

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.099 
show about two weeks out and obviously

you've not used these methods before get
ready<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:21.530> you're<00:03:21.680> two<00:03:21.829> weeks<00:03:21.859> out<00:03:22.160> from<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
ready so you're two weeks out from the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.420 
ready so you're two weeks out from the
show<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:23.109> try<00:03:24.109> these<00:03:24.170> things<00:03:24.530> you<00:03:25.220> know<00:03:25.250> you

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
show and try these things you know you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.569 
show and try these things you know you
will<00:03:25.730> see<00:03:25.970> what<00:03:26.810> which<00:03:27.530> pathways<00:03:28.130> your<00:03:28.340> body's

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
will see what which pathways your body's

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.789 
will see what which pathways your body's
ever<00:03:28.730> gonna<00:03:29.090> go<00:03:29.299> with<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.630> exactly<00:03:30.290> everybody

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
ever gonna go with it exactly everybody

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.259 
ever gonna go with it exactly everybody
is<00:03:30.980> different<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.549> that's<00:03:31.730> one<00:03:31.940> thing<00:03:32.120> to

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
is different and that's one thing to

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.240 
is different and that's one thing to
know<00:03:32.420> is<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.630> with<00:03:33.410> everybody's<00:03:34.010> different

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
know is that with everybody's different

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.390 
know is that with everybody's different
metabolisms<00:03:34.940> not<00:03:35.630> one<00:03:36.019> system<00:03:36.530> works<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.130> you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
metabolisms not one system works and you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.490 
metabolisms not one system works and you
being<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.700> trainer<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.510> have<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> array<00:03:39.380> of

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
being a trainer you have a array of

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.750 
being a trainer you have a array of
athletes<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.010> every<00:03:40.250> one<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.430> them<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.730> have

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
athletes and every one of them you have

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.789 
athletes and every one of them you have
to<00:03:40.910> do<00:03:41.150> something<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:42.140> may<00:03:42.350> be<00:03:42.410> different

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
to do something that may be different

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.490 
to do something that may be different
than<00:03:43.100> it's<00:03:43.430> not<00:03:43.519> just<00:03:43.880> one<00:03:44.150> type<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.660> way<00:03:45.470> of

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
than it's not just one type of way of

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.550 
than it's not just one type of way of
like<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:46.160> know<00:03:46.190> doing<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.180> type<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.170> diet<00:03:48.350> that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
like you know doing a type of diet that

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.930 
like you know doing a type of diet that
you're<00:03:48.680> doing<00:03:48.799> for<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.130> individual<00:03:49.790> or

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
you're doing for that individual or

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.729 
you're doing for that individual or
trying<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.329> make<00:03:50.420> sure<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.989> they<00:03:51.410> dry<00:03:51.709> out

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
trying to make sure that they dry out

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.170 
trying to make sure that they dry out
and<00:03:52.250> may<00:03:52.310> be<00:03:52.370> different<00:03:52.760> for<00:03:52.880> each<00:03:52.910> one<00:03:53.150> of

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
and may be different for each one of

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.759 
and may be different for each one of
these<00:03:53.329> individuals<00:03:53.900> that's<00:03:54.170> right<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.530> in

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
these individuals that's right and in

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.140 
these individuals that's right and in
it's<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:55.040> learning<00:03:55.280> curve<00:03:55.489> for<00:03:55.549> myself<00:03:56.000> as<00:03:56.120> well

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
it's a learning curve for myself as well

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.090 
it's a learning curve for myself as well
because<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:57.410> know<00:03:57.470> sometimes<00:03:57.920> you're

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
because you know sometimes you're

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.620 
because you know sometimes you're
working<00:03:58.370> off<00:03:58.639> a<00:03:58.670> blank<00:03:58.940> canvas<00:03:59.329> you<00:03:59.600> know

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
working off a blank canvas you know

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.670 
working off a blank canvas you know
you're<00:03:59.840> working<00:04:00.109> off<00:04:00.230> something<00:04:00.500> from

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
you're working off something from

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.660 
you're working off something from
scratch<00:04:02.109> so<00:04:03.109> it's<00:04:04.069> very<00:04:04.220> much<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.459> learning

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
scratch so it's very much a learning

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.370 
scratch so it's very much a learning
curve<00:04:05.030> as<00:04:05.209> well<00:04:05.359> you've<00:04:05.600> got<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.019> sort<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.200> work

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
curve as well you've got to sort of work

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.559 
curve as well you've got to sort of work
at<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.590> base<00:04:06.769> baseline<00:04:07.519> build<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:07.970> profile<00:04:08.389> for

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
at a base baseline build a profile for

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.449 
at a base baseline build a profile for
those<00:04:08.720> clients<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.290> then<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.889> was<00:04:10.010> as<00:04:10.160> I<00:04:10.280> say

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
those clients and then I was as I say

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.370 
those clients and then I was as I say
you<00:04:10.730> know<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:10.910> learning<00:04:11.569> from<00:04:11.870> them<00:04:12.109> as<00:04:12.260> much

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
you know you learning from them as much

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.259 
you know you learning from them as much
as<00:04:12.560> they're<00:04:12.709> learning<00:04:12.799> from<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.340> well<00:04:14.060> that's

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
as they're learning from you well that's

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.019 
as they're learning from you well that's
a<00:04:14.450> great<00:04:14.540> question
