obviously the last four upgrades to

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
obviously the last four upgrades to
damage<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.310> need<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> glue<00:01:59.850> my<00:02:00.000> helium

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
damage you will need to glue my helium

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.920 
damage you will need to glue my helium
filaments<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.189> ascendant<00:02:02.189> energy<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.570> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
filaments and ascendant energy so the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
filaments and ascendant energy so the
overall<00:02:04.049> design<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:04.979> obviously<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
overall design of it is obviously in the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.449 
overall design of it is obviously in the
iron<00:02:06.149> banner<00:02:06.479> gold<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.829> got<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> iron

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
iron banner gold and it got the iron

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.249 
iron banner gold and it got the iron
banner<00:02:08.729> logo<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.599> as<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.229> see

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
banner logo there and as you can see

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.450 
banner logo there and as you can see
just<00:02:10.619> up<00:02:10.800> there<00:02:10.920> there's<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> little

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
just up there there's a little

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.090 
just up there there's a little
off<00:02:11.580> as<00:02:11.790> well<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.960> general<00:02:13.230> scout<00:02:13.890> rifle

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
off as well it's the general scout rifle

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.760 
off as well it's the general scout rifle
design<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.420> does<00:02:15.630> look<00:02:15.660> slightly<00:02:16.200> bigger<00:02:16.500> when

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
design it does look slightly bigger when

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.180 
design it does look slightly bigger when
holding<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.280> though<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:17.790> think<00:02:18.740> not<00:02:19.740> entirely

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
holding it though I think not entirely

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.120 
holding it though I think not entirely
sure<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.590> vision<00:02:22.890> of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
sure but I do have a vision of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.310 
sure but I do have a vision of
confidence<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.850> well<00:02:24.120> let<00:02:24.360> me<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.480> equip

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
confidence as well let me just equip

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.880 
confidence as well let me just equip
that<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.430> yeah<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.120> kind<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.420> looks<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> same

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that and yeah it kind of looks the same

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.240 
that and yeah it kind of looks the same
so<00:02:29.300> let<00:02:30.300> me<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.570> equip<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:31.140> one<00:02:31.290> again<00:02:31.860> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so let me just equip that one again and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
so let me just equip that one again and
as<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.880> can<00:02:33.000> see<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.420> slightly<00:02:33.810> different

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
as you can see it's slightly different

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.260 
as you can see it's slightly different
vision<00:02:34.710> of<00:02:34.800> confluence<00:02:35.220> has<00:02:35.610> those<00:02:35.910> little

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
vision of confluence has those little

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.950 
vision of confluence has those little
bit<00:02:36.990> set<00:02:37.290> down<00:02:37.620> here<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.760> kind<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.600> barrel

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
bit set down here and the kind of barrel

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.910 
bit set down here and the kind of barrel
is<00:02:40.170> different<00:02:40.770> as<00:02:40.890> well<00:02:42.380> mu<00:02:43.380> as<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.770> see

this is quite a thin long barrel on the

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.610 
this is quite a thin long barrel on the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
fire rate is a little bit slow to be

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.000 
fire rate is a little bit slow to be
honest<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.850> also<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.600> doesn't<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:25.140> full

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
honest and also it doesn't have full

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.640 
honest and also it doesn't have full
auto<00:03:26.190> oh<00:03:26.730> let's<00:03:27.660> go<00:03:27.780> down<00:03:27.960> here<00:03:28.230> we've<00:03:28.440> got<00:03:28.470> a

auto oh let's go down here we've got a
sort<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.100> crota<00:03:30.500> let's<00:03:31.500> go<00:03:31.650> kill<00:03:31.950> some<00:03:32.310> hive

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.610 

now<00:03:38.880> if<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> guys<00:03:39.330> have<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.080> vision<00:03:40.440> of

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
now if you guys have the vision of

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.940 
now if you guys have the vision of
confluency<00:03:41.490> we<00:03:41.580> all<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.330> has

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
confluency we all know that that has

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.620 
confluency we all know that that has
full<00:03:43.950> auto<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.580> basically<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.330> hold<00:03:45.510> a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
full auto so basically you can hold a

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.820 
full auto so basically you can hold a
trigger<00:03:45.900> button<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.590> will<00:03:46.650> just

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
trigger button and it will just

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.240 
trigger button and it will just
continuously<00:03:47.550> fire<00:03:48.500> with<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.710> one<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:49.980> do

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
continuously fire with this one you do

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.200 
continuously fire with this one you do
have<00:03:50.520> to<00:03:50.670> keep<00:03:50.880> pressing<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.960> fire<00:03:53.210> so

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
have to keep pressing it to fire so

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.170 
have to keep pressing it to fire so
