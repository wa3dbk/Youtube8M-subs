have the container handy and i think
it's<00:00:20.640> useful<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.560> begin<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.740> stretch<00:00:22.980> without

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it's useful so begin my stretch without

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.279 
it's useful so begin my stretch without
into<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> line<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.119> had<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> coiled<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.140> y'all

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
into a line I had a coiled up for y'all

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.740 
into a line I had a coiled up for y'all
so<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> table<00:00:26.640> there<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
so you can see it on the table there you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.939 
so you can see it on the table there you
go<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:29.449> go<00:00:30.449> ahead<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> fold<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> into<00:00:31.650> half

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
go and go ahead and fold it into half

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.740 
go and go ahead and fold it into half
being<00:00:32.520> careful<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.210> doesn't<00:00:33.480> attach

or<00:00:33.989> just<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.260> places<00:00:35.000> make<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> big<00:00:36.329> circle

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
or just your places make a big circle

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
or just your places make a big circle
and<00:00:37.700> just<00:00:38.700> let<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> go<00:00:39.860> all<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> way<00:00:41.010> down<00:00:41.100> on

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and just let it go all the way down on

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.000 
and just let it go all the way down on
its<00:00:41.700> own<00:00:43.640> carefully<00:00:45.289> like<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.860> you've

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
its own carefully like that so you've

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.569 
its own carefully like that so you've
got<00:00:47.239> X<00:00:48.239> amount<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:49.020> roses<00:00:49.530> too<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:50.129> sure<00:00:50.340> man

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
got X amount of roses too not sure man

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.560 
got X amount of roses too not sure man
and<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.629> you'll<00:00:51.840> notice<00:00:51.870> there's<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.829> and

where<00:00:54.570> there's<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.410> extra<00:00:55.739> mag

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
where there's going to be one extra mag

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.959 
where there's going to be one extra mag
good<00:00:56.340> go<00:00:57.300> ahead<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> take<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.960> off<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
good go ahead and take that off and

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.580 
good go ahead and take that off and
place<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.539> box<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:01.199> wherever<00:01:01.410> you

place it into your box or wherever you
want<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.770> put<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> doesn't<00:01:02.969> get

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
want to put it so that it doesn't get

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.789 
want to put it so that it doesn't get
lost<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.409> meantime<00:01:04.939> fold<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.119> again

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
lost in the meantime fold it again

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.350 
lost in the meantime fold it again
carefully<00:01:07.799> super<00:01:08.610> carefully<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:11.369> create<00:01:11.729> X

using your buckyball case cut off six

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.390 
using your buckyball case cut off six
rows<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.820> four<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:33.259> add<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:34.829> extra<00:01:35.100> ball

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
rows of four and add that one extra ball

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.830 
rows of four and add that one extra ball
to<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.140> make<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.619> line<00:01:41.840> carefully

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
to it and make it into a line carefully

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.069 
to it and make it into a line carefully
attach<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> rest<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> buckyballs

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
attach it to the rest of the buckyballs

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.560 
attach it to the rest of the buckyballs
you<00:01:46.079> should<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> line<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.570> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you should have a line now and it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:59.440 
you should have a line now and it's
going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.930> 5<00:01:49.229> x<00:01:49.530> 25<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:51.110> fold<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.679 

you<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.049> stacks<00:02:01.439> of

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
you just want to get stacks of

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:10.100 
you just want to get stacks of
five-by-five<00:02:04.340> continue<00:02:05.340> folding<00:02:09.020> you<00:02:10.020> have

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
five-by-five continue folding you have

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.199 
five-by-five continue folding you have
to<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.380> pretty<00:02:10.530> careful<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.280> part<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.880> can

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
to be pretty careful on this part it can

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:19.130 
to be pretty careful on this part it can
be<00:02:12.330> pretty<00:02:12.510> tricky<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.660> there<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.959> go<00:02:18.989> you

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
be pretty tricky so and there you go you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.769 
be pretty tricky so and there you go you
got<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.470> cube
