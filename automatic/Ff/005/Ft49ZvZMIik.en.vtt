00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.120 

the<00:01:24.659> LSD<00:01:24.930> site<00:01:25.290> also<00:01:25.470> comes<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.920> two<00:01:26.100> different

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the LSD site also comes in two different

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.340 
the LSD site also comes in two different
sizes<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:28.020> sets<00:01:28.229> these

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
sizes I think that really sets these

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
sizes I think that really sets these
apart<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> ability<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> swap<00:01:29.610> lenses<00:01:30.060> very

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
apart is the ability to swap lenses very

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
apart is the ability to swap lenses very
easily<00:01:30.500> now<00:01:31.500> they<00:01:31.619> only<00:01:31.770> come<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.369> lens

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
easily now they only come with one lens

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.010 
easily now they only come with one lens
but<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:32.970> able<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> order<00:01:33.479> other<00:01:33.630> lenses

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
but you're able to order other lenses

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.469 
but you're able to order other lenses
with<00:01:34.200> different<00:01:34.470> light<00:01:34.590> conditions<00:01:35.479> so

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
with different light conditions so

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:48.649 
with different light conditions so
simply<00:01:37.079> taking<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.439> arms<00:01:37.770> up<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:47.659> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
simply taking the arms up like that you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.330 
simply taking the arms up like that you
can<00:01:48.840> also<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> prescription<00:01:49.500> insert<00:01:50.159> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
these this clips inside the lens is very

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.630 
these this clips inside the lens is very
easy<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.100> removable<00:01:56.520> by<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> user<00:01:57.180> so
