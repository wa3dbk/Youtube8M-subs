00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.620
 welcome you all to this video in 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.210
 general essence of this 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:15.299
 many have encountered such a problem when 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 launch gta buckle that whether launcher and there 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.350
 does not start so the game itself is not 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.840
 starts the game starts but little 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 video memory and in general today I want you 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.359
 tell two ways to solve the problem 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.050
 for cards and nvidia and for well for 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.570
 holders of cards and nvidia and n.d. 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.360
 Well, I have a regular card 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.059
 I checked on others bye and on my own 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.559
 everything works so you should not 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.460
 be you should not cause problems 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.469
 I will not run the game myself 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.140
 it works for me just in full 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.140
 brief in general when we start playing 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:02.460
 There is a launcher and many when 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.920
 launcher started everything there says that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 you logged in you wait for about a minute 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.790
 the door then appears such a window where 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.939
 written unknown error occurred 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.640
 click repeat or click run 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.320
 safe mode so that the coast so that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.950
 the game started at the minimum 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.890
 settings 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.939
 if this problem is familiar to you then you 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.960
 got here there where glad to do 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.200
 for nvidia card holders many 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.799
 they wrote that it was all due to the fact that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.170
 you account contains characters from 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.500
 Cyrillic is fine with me and characters 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.380
 Cyrillic everything works that's what us 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.479
 make for owners of nvidia go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.110
 device manager he is with us 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.720
 but if you have windows 8 you can 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.250
 for example, click the parameters panel 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.570
 system management and security 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.590
 system 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 here you will have written all sorts 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 characteristics of your computer and here 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.100
 device manager click and here 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.620
 video adapter 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.510
 as you can see I have m t rad and intel 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.030
 if you see you do not put in 2 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.650
 will nvidia and here in click intel 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.660
 disable disable card in intel 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.760
 run the game and when the game started 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.320
 turn on the fast Lithuanian card and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.740
 play should you go should be 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:38.920
 All right, so what about nvidia 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.460
 now tell about md here more 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.440
 hemorrhoids because many say that 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.950
 problems running more on index 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.450
 cards and laptops i have md and 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.020
 laptop combo well 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.050
 I climbed a lot of forums and crossed everything 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.140
 together and it happened you so i tried 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.140
 and start it shut off one 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.850
 card run the game on include 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.430
 again I have a card once 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.030
 It turned out only once with the first 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 attempts then the second day of the 15th of us 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.150
 so patches break and save today 18 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.920
 On the 15th, I suffered about five hours. 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.590
 five hours I could not ban the game cars 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.480
 I started but I started 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.740
 a small window and wrote that instead 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.920
 my two gigabytes 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.920
 two gigabytes of video memory was only 512 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.810
 megabyte I mean I could at minimum 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.820
 play only 3-4 fps is impossible all 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.830
 because even though I am them 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.100
 flat card disconnected ran on them 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.320
 stuffy I don't care comp for some reason 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.720
 I saw only meters, that is, and the board 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.720
 512 megabytes of video memory and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.650
 I helped at the same time as 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.300

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.280
 times and it didn't work out for me anymore 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.500
