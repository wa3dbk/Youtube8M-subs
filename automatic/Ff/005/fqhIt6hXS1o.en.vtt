00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.680
 yes 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.400
 welcome to a new video 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.689
 this time we are in five of the best 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.220
 modes to mark position 0.11 points 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.080
 this does not work for everyone good 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 we are in week 2 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.140
 Y 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.120
 and good guys for the first of the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.120
 week 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:48.839
 of food the passage of time and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.850
 Well, if we do not manage to fill it 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.960
 as in many PCs we would die 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.820
 completely but they would not be 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.250
 eliminated hearts we have to eat 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.250
 then a little more difficulty 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.759
 and for the next one we have because 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.340
 basically it's a very simple but 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.649
 too useful at the same time because then 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 you know when we remove a block from below 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.630
 of wood then with obviously with a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.670
 ax then it would be removing everything 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.869
 full up is super cool is like 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.630
 the tri capi hector but a version 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.759
 even simpler 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.469
 is the following way I hope that you 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.060
 Like you have the description and 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.520
 well let's go with the next 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.740
 for the third we have an incredible the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.659
 which is to run and crouch is 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.409
 super cool nothing but work instead of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.759
 that works with the basic buttons that 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.759
 I hope this is updated 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.009
 we have two little buttons as called 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.380
 upper right corner as we can 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.220
 observe if we press pop but that 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.049
 it came out as if it moved good 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.399
 we have two super cool buttons on 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.610
 which the first is obviously for 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.910
 run 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.360
 so I have a small bus but as 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.610
 can see they can run basically 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.490
 and ccoo is obviously with the one below it is 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.930
 to bend over but I do not feel that 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.050
 it's useless because everything is music and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.730
 you know, you do not leave us ok but for not 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.800
 fall down we know the place to touch 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.690
 well nothing this is the third way we can 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.090
 consequently for the fourth way we have 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.590
 el knock out games created by walt 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.140
 there is incredible is a very similar way 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.480
 to what is his way but this is how 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.790
 a little more more complete I liked it 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.580
 too much is this is too similar 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 to jump ways is not that it's like that 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.290
 a bit more simple version 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.790
 basic comes all the cubes and more than 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.440
 nothing seems to take a breath but of 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.200
 PC version that we still do not have 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.000
 but with this net it is incredible not 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.590
 and good as you can see we can 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.720
 make any cube like tom maney 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.970
 game released here we have all 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.280
 the lists we do not have to stop the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.049
 export and everything I think to be fourth 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.299
 and is going to dedicate to update this mode 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.810
 that is incredible and then nothing guys 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.790
 we do with the last mode none 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 guys for the last way we have a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.810
 multi incredible which is about 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.459
 add them what are more doors like 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.590
 can see is nervous doors 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.910
 all the woods I do not remember very well 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.890
 what they are called now but it's amazing 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.019
 they will still find in the leave the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.670
 description is just the same we are going to 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.160
 grow like other doors nothing more than 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.019
 with different wood we are not going to take 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.090
 over here until the kraft eo this is 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.130
 with the orange wood is the conduit of 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.359
 hamadi is white this is the wood 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.769
 darker is the jungle wood 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.569
 this wood, I do not believe what it's called 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.430
 but the same is incredible I liked it 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.440
 too this this way we have as 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.230
 what more to decorate our homes more

 are the super doors obviously used 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.099
 texture then they're going to have to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.630
 install the texture and then nothing I hope 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.579

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.680
