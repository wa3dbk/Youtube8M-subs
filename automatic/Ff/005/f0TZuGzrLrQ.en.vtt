00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
something i've been fighting with for a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.040 
something i've been fighting with for a
while<00:00:37.860> trying<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> use<00:00:39.320> handheld<00:00:40.320> camcorders

trying to get them to integrate with the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.420 
trying to get them to integrate with the
third<00:00:45.120> party<00:00:45.480> software<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:46.230> ultra<00:00:47.010> studio

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
third party software like ultra studio

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.299 
third party software like ultra studio
and<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:48.660> would<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.960> solutions<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.040> short

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and they would be solutions for a short

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.560 
and they would be solutions for a short
while<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.760> i'm<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.940> soon<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.390> an

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
while and i'm as soon as there was an

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.880 
while and i'm as soon as there was an
upgrade<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:53.489> OS<00:00:53.820> system<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:55.050> mac<00:00:55.649> for

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
upgrade to the OS system on mac for

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
upgrade to the OS system on mac for
instance<00:00:56.280> i<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:57.390> back<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.809> drawing<00:00:57.870> board

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
instance i was back to the drawing board

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.279 
instance i was back to the drawing board
so<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.690> total<00:01:00.690> total<00:01:00.960> plug-and-play

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
so this is a total total plug-and-play

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.799 
so this is a total total plug-and-play
there's<00:01:01.800> no<00:01:01.920> software<00:01:02.219> really<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.149> download

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
there's no software really to download

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.749 
there's no software really to download
it<00:01:03.989> doesn't<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.559> work<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:05.249> a<00:01:05.399> camcorder

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
it doesn't really work like a camcorder

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.199 
it doesn't really work like a camcorder
it<00:01:06.659> works<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.439> systems<00:01:08.249> like<00:01:08.459> live<00:01:08.850> cast

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209 
it works with systems like live cast

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:12.590 
it works with systems like live cast
live<00:01:09.840> life<00:01:10.109> casting<00:01:10.529> with<00:01:10.709> wire<00:01:10.979> cast<00:01:11.600> for
