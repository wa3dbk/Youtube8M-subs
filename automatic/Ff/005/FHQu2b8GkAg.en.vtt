00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.789
 to admit it I like it too all 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.350
 the decorations including the characters 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.119

 you which little creature had eaten for 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.270
 first for this recipe I will use a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.399
 sponge cake with a diameter of 26 cm 500 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 grams of strawberries per 100 grams of 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.980
 whipped cream wets the pineapple how much 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.840
 just deprive your face in the cream 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:57.210
 mounted I put the cut strawberries in 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 we mix pieces gently with the help 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.300
 of a knife I remove the part 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.300
 top of the sponge cake 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.050
 and a cut two parts 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.140
 I placed the sponge cake 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.780
 on the platter 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.380
 I insert the bathroom zip hinge 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380
 the entire surface 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.289
 put the face and level well 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.380

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:37.319
 sponge cake bath the entire surface 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:39.630
 with the remaining pineapple wets leave 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.030
 rest in the fridge for about an hour 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.430
 after that time I remove the zipper e 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:03:07.230
 cover the whole cake with the cream of 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:03:09.630

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.310
 turquoise sugar paste spread with 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.720
 to facilitate coverage or rolled up 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.490
 the sugar paste from a rolling pin 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.890

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.700
