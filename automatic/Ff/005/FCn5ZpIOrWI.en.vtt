another black ops 2 weapon guide this
time<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.480> am<00:00:12.719> focusing<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.799> submachine

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
time I am focusing on the submachine

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.829 
time I am focusing on the submachine
guns<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.790> I've<00:00:14.880> got<00:00:15.059> all<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> pictures<00:00:15.540> of

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
guns and I've got all the pictures of

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689 
guns and I've got all the pictures of
them<00:00:16.020> at<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> bottom<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.770> then<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> chart

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
them at the bottom and then the chart

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.070 
them at the bottom and then the chart
that<00:00:17.910> shows<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> damage<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.750> everything

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
that shows the damage and everything

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.390 
that shows the damage and everything
like<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.230> make<00:00:19.560> sure<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.800> check<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.189> my

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
like that make sure you check out my

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.099 
like that make sure you check out my
assault<00:00:20.760> rifle<00:00:21.180> guide<00:00:21.330> before<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.900> watch

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
assault rifle guide before you watch

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.200 
assault rifle guide before you watch
this<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.619> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> probably<00:00:23.490> explained<00:00:24.029> things

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
this I kind of probably explained things

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.849 
this I kind of probably explained things
a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.480> bit<00:00:24.630> better<00:00:24.779> about<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.350> chart<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
a little bit better about this chart and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.750 
a little bit better about this chart and
I'm<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> little<00:00:26.369> bit<00:00:26.550> faster

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
I'm going to go a little bit faster

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.570 
I'm going to go a little bit faster
through<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:28.349> over<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.220> have

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
through this one now over here I have

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.450 
through this one now over here I have
all<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.179> fully<00:00:30.539> automatic<00:00:31.349> SMGs<00:00:32.009> together

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
all the fully automatic SMGs together

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.910 
all the fully automatic SMGs together
you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.540> see<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.960> five<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.829> then

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
you can see all five of them and then

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
you can see all five of them and then
there<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> three<00:00:35.670> round<00:00:35.850> burst<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.510> right

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
there is a three round burst one right

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
there is a three round burst one right
there<00:00:37.079> which<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> kind<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.800> new<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.010> don't<00:00:38.309> know

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
there which is kind of new I don't know

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430 
there which is kind of new I don't know
if<00:00:38.520> that's<00:00:38.730> ever<00:00:38.969> happened<00:00:39.420> before<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.050> can't

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
if that's ever happened before I can't

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
if that's ever happened before I can't
remember<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.800> three<00:00:41.010> round<00:00:41.160> burst<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:41.940> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
remember a three round burst one but I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.490 
remember a three round burst one but I
haven't<00:00:42.329> had<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> chance<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.899> unlock<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.260> or

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
haven't had a chance to unlock it or

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.690 
haven't had a chance to unlock it or
check<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.370> look<00:00:44.399> at<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
check it out but we can look at the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 
check it out but we can look at the
stats<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.149> everything<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.649> go

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
stats and everything like that as we go

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.610 
stats and everything like that as we go
through<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.309> now<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.989> fully

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
through here now I have the fully

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
through here now I have the fully
automatic<00:00:50.309> ones<00:00:50.550> grouped<00:00:51.030> according<00:00:51.300> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
automatic ones grouped according to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
automatic ones grouped according to
damage<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> assault

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
damage now just like with the assault

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
damage now just like with the assault
rifles<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.510> had<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> hire<00:00:54.930> damaged<00:00:55.320> ones<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.770> top

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
rifles I had to hire damaged ones on top

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
rifles I had to hire damaged ones on top
and<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.699> lower<00:00:56.879> damaged<00:00:57.270> ones<00:00:57.510> down<00:00:57.809> below<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and the lower damaged ones down below so

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.760 
and the lower damaged ones down below so
the<00:00:58.559> MSMC<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.120> PDW<00:01:00.719> both<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.320> kill<00:01:01.559> with

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the MSMC and the PDW both can kill with

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.189 
the MSMC and the PDW both can kill with
three<00:01:02.100> bullets<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> mp7

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
three bullets and the actually the mp7

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
three bullets and the actually the mp7
the<00:01:04.559> vector<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.920> Scorpion<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.460> also<00:01:05.670> kill

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the vector and Scorpion can also kill

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.520 
the vector and Scorpion can also kill
with<00:01:06.270> three<00:01:06.450> bullets<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:06.990> shoot<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.380> many

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
with three bullets if they shoot so many

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.590 
with three bullets if they shoot so many
in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> head<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:08.909> technically<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
in the head and I think technically the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050 
in the head and I think technically the
essay<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.200> MSMC<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.400> probably<00:01:11.610> kill<00:01:11.909> with

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
essay the MSMC could probably kill with

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.520 
essay the MSMC could probably kill with
two<00:01:12.210> bullets<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> get<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> head<00:01:13.080> shot<00:01:13.110> on

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
two bullets if you get a head shot on

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.890 
two bullets if you get a head shot on
one<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:15.390> you're<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.720> shooting

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
one of them but if you're just shooting

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440 
one of them but if you're just shooting
normally<00:01:16.470> apples<00:01:17.250> apples<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.150> wanted<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
normally apples apples I just wanted to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
normally apples apples I just wanted to
show<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.439> look<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.040> much

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
show you now take a look at how much

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.149 
show you now take a look at how much
ammo<00:01:20.460> comes<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.450> these<00:01:21.689> weapons<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.500> PDW

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
ammo comes with these weapons the PDW

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
ammo comes with these weapons the PDW
has<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> clear<00:01:23.970> advantage<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.869> hold<00:01:24.990> 50

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
has a clear advantage it can hold 50

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.580 
has a clear advantage it can hold 50
rounds<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.950> normal<00:01:26.159> clip<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.580> 67<00:01:27.270> an

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
rounds in a normal clip or 67 an

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
rounds in a normal clip or 67 an
extended<00:01:28.590> clip<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.460> gets<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
extended clip so that gets it that's a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.230 
extended clip so that gets it that's a
nice<00:01:30.420> advantage<00:01:30.840> over<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> MSMC<00:01:32.030> damage<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
nice advantage over the MSMC damage the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.800 
nice advantage over the MSMC damage the
MSMC<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.290> higher<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.610> tell<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.060> three

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
MSMC is higher but I tell you what three

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359 
MSMC is higher but I tell you what three
bullets<00:01:37.170> from<00:01:37.320> either<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> kill

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
bullets from either one is going to kill

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.300 
bullets from either one is going to kill
so<00:01:38.640> yeah<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.119> 40<00:01:39.630> instead<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.229> 35<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.040> it's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so yeah it's 40 instead of 35 but it's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.499 
so yeah it's 40 instead of 35 but it's
still<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.000> same<00:01:42.180> amount<00:01:42.420> of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
still going to be the same amount of

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.480 
still going to be the same amount of
bullets<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.810> kill<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.560> might<00:01:43.950> play<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> factor

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
bullets to kill that might play a factor

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
bullets to kill that might play a factor
if<00:01:44.850> you're<00:01:45.060> shooting<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.600> something<00:01:46.020> having

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
if you're shooting in something having

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.950 
if you're shooting in something having
that<00:01:46.439> higher<00:01:46.649> damage<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:48.600> might<00:01:48.810> give

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that higher damage so that might give

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.920 
that higher damage so that might give
the<00:01:49.079> edge<00:01:49.200> there<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> MSMC<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> min

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the edge there to the MSMC now the min

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.480 
the edge there to the MSMC now the min
damage<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> same<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.100> actually<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
damage is the same and it's actually the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.789 
damage is the same and it's actually the
same<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.880> all<00:01:54.030> them<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> drops<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.840> 18<00:01:55.560> so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
same on all them it drops down to 18 so

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.889 
same on all them it drops down to 18 so
that<00:01:55.950> means<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> furthest<00:01:56.880> range<00:01:57.270> when

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that means that the furthest range when

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
that means that the furthest range when
it<00:01:58.020> drops<00:01:58.229> down<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.740> 18<00:01:59.159> damage<00:01:59.579> it's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
it drops down to that 18 damage it's

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.429 
it drops down to that 18 damage it's
going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> take<00:02:00.390> six<00:02:00.719> bullets<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.259> take

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
going to take six bullets to take

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.980 
going to take six bullets to take
somebody<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.119> see<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.479> rounds

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
somebody out as you can see the rounds

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.770 
somebody out as you can see the rounds
per<00:02:04.140> minute<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.070> 720<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.240> both<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.659> them

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
per minute is that 720 for both of them

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.830 
per minute is that 720 for both of them
if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.740> slap<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.429> rapid<00:02:08.849> fire<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.360> pops<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
if you slap on rapid fire that pops it

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.290 
if you slap on rapid fire that pops it
up<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.229> 900<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.099> gets<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.760> range<00:02:12.000> of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
up to 900 and gets it in the range of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.820 
up to 900 and gets it in the range of
the<00:02:12.690> mp7<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.530> vector

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the mp7 and vector

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
the mp7 and vector
of<00:02:14.310> course<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.640> scorpion<00:02:15.120> jumps<00:02:15.450> up<00:02:15.570> from

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
of course the scorpion jumps up from

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.620 
of course the scorpion jumps up from
there<00:02:16.050> but<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.250> kill<00:02:17.610> range<00:02:17.880> right

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
there but here is the kill range right

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.660 
there but here is the kill range right
if<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.080> shoot<00:02:19.320> three<00:02:19.680> bullets<00:02:20.010> into<00:02:20.220> somebody

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
if you shoot three bullets into somebody

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.600 
if you shoot three bullets into somebody
and<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.900> up<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.650> 50<00:02:23.160> units

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and you can do that up to that 50 units

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.880 
and you can do that up to that 50 units
and<00:02:23.910> with<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> PDW<00:02:25.320> it's<00:02:25.470> only<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.830> be

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and with the PDW it's only going to be

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.550 
and with the PDW it's only going to be
34<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.880> range<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.390> better<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> S

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
34 so the range is better with the S

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.270 
34 so the range is better with the S
with<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> MSMC<00:02:30.260> alright<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.800> gives<00:02:32.010> that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
with the MSMC alright so that gives that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.740 
with the MSMC alright so that gives that
a<00:02:32.310> slight<00:02:32.670> advantage<00:02:32.850> though<00:02:33.240> they're<00:02:33.450> pretty

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
a slight advantage though they're pretty

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.420 
a slight advantage though they're pretty
close<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.440> see<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.620> continue<00:02:35.250> on

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
close but you can see that continue on

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.820 
close but you can see that continue on
out<00:02:35.700> with<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.360> four<00:02:36.600> shots<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.590> five

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
out with the four shots and the five

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.640 
out with the four shots and the five
shots<00:02:38.310> hips<00:02:39.210> spread<00:02:39.360> for<00:02:39.780> all<00:02:39.930> these<00:02:40.170> weapons

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
shots hips spread for all these weapons

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.880 
shots hips spread for all these weapons
is<00:02:40.830> really<00:02:41.370> low<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.020> assault<00:02:43.290> rifles<00:02:43.710> and

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
is really low for the assault rifles and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.220 
is really low for the assault rifles and
I<00:02:43.950> put<00:02:44.190> low<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.480> submachine<00:02:45.900> guns

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
I put low and for the submachine guns

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.890 
I put low and for the submachine guns
i'm<00:02:46.380> putting<00:02:46.680> very<00:02:47.130> low<00:02:47.400> i<00:02:47.670> actually<00:02:48.420> don't

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
i'm putting very low i actually don't

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.810 
i'm putting very low i actually don't
really<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.430> i've<00:02:50.610> seen

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
really like that you know i've seen

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.580 
really like that you know i've seen
people<00:02:51.000> running<00:02:51.480> around<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:52.050> hip<00:02:52.290> firing

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
people running around this hip firing

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.230 
people running around this hip firing
with<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.130> assault<00:02:53.459> rifles<00:02:53.820> they<00:02:53.940> put<00:02:54.120> that

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
with these assault rifles they put that

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.480 
with these assault rifles they put that
little<00:02:54.420> laser<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.620> laser<00:02:55.830> guider<00:02:56.160> and

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
little laser on it that laser guider and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.699 
little laser on it that laser guider and
they<00:02:56.760> don't<00:02:56.910> even<00:02:57.209> ever<00:02:57.420> aim<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.410> know<00:02:58.530> they

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
they don't even ever aim you know they

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.100 
they don't even ever aim you know they
just<00:02:58.920> shoot<00:02:59.160> from<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.760> hip<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.959> do

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
just shoot from the hip and you can do

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.170 
just shoot from the hip and you can do
that<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.070> very<00:03:02.400> low<00:03:02.610> hip<00:03:02.850> spread

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
that with the with a very low hip spread

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.580 
that with the with a very low hip spread
so<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.360> don't<00:03:03.570> really<00:03:03.690> care<00:03:03.959> for<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.440> this

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
so I don't really care for that in this

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.650 
so I don't really care for that in this
game<00:03:04.800> which<00:03:05.010> they<00:03:05.160> changed<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.880> bit<00:03:06.030> now

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
game which they changed a little bit now

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.110 
game which they changed a little bit now
for<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.170> aim<00:03:07.350> down<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.550> out<00:03:08.670> that's<00:03:08.970> when

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
for the aim down in and out that's when

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.760 
for the aim down in and out that's when
you're<00:03:09.300> raising<00:03:09.510> your<00:03:09.660> gun<00:03:09.900> up<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.140> aim<00:03:10.590> down

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
you're raising your gun up to aim down

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.410 
you're raising your gun up to aim down
the<00:03:10.830> sights<00:03:10.980> or<00:03:11.400> putting<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.850> down<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.270> can

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
the sights or putting it down you can

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.180 
the sights or putting it down you can
see<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.630> all<00:03:12.959> those<00:03:13.230> are<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> same<00:03:13.830> for<00:03:14.070> all

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
see that all those are the same for all

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.380 
see that all those are the same for all
the<00:03:14.340> weapons<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.760> I'm<00:03:14.820> not<00:03:14.940> going<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.180> really

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the weapons so I'm not going to really

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.600 
the weapons so I'm not going to really
talk<00:03:15.600> about<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.740> raise<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.220> drop<00:03:17.250> time

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
talk about that the raise and drop time

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.190 
talk about that the raise and drop time
from<00:03:17.850> when<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.090> start<00:03:18.330> running<00:03:18.480> or<00:03:18.930> stop

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
from when you start running or stop

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.020 
from when you start running or stop
running<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.070> know<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.370> gun<00:03:20.550> comes<00:03:20.850> up

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
running and you know your gun comes up

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.600 
running and you know your gun comes up
for<00:03:21.209> goes<00:03:21.360> down<00:03:21.890> those<00:03:22.890> are<00:03:23.130> all<00:03:23.280> pretty

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
for goes down those are all pretty

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.400 
for goes down those are all pretty
similar<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.269> there's<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.840> little<00:03:25.170> bit<00:03:25.350> of

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
similar to there's a little bit of

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.380 
similar to there's a little bit of
difference<00:03:25.739> but<00:03:26.580> not<00:03:26.760> much<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.180> I'm<00:03:27.239> not

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
difference but not much so I'm not

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.240 
difference but not much so I'm not
really<00:03:27.510> going<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.780> focus<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.260> those<00:03:28.500> either<00:03:28.950> as

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
really going to focus on those either as

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.050 
really going to focus on those either as
far<00:03:29.880> as<00:03:29.910> reload<00:03:30.570> times<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.110> can<00:03:31.260> see<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.470> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
far as reload times you can see that the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.620 
far as reload times you can see that the
MSMC<00:03:33.260> result<00:03:34.260> reloads<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:35.100> slightly<00:03:36.030> quicker

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
MSMC result reloads a slightly quicker

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.620 
MSMC result reloads a slightly quicker
than<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.950> PDW<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:38.880> I'd<00:03:39.030> give<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.360> advantage

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
than the PDW so I'd give the advantage

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.050 
than the PDW so I'd give the advantage
in<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.050> area<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:40.830> those<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.670> know<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.850> can

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
in that area so those you know you can

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.170 
in that area so those you know you can
compare<00:03:42.330> those<00:03:42.570> if<00:03:43.080> we<00:03:43.200> go<00:03:43.350> down<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:44.180> lower

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
compare those if we go down to the lower

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.430 
compare those if we go down to the lower
damage<00:03:45.480> ones<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:47.459> see<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.970> mp7<00:03:48.330> has<00:03:49.050> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
damage ones you see that the mp7 has the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.280 
damage ones you see that the mp7 has the
higher<00:03:49.709> capacity<00:03:50.519> in<00:03:50.730> its<00:03:50.910> clip<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.840> know<00:03:51.989> but

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
higher capacity in its clip you know but

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.580 
higher capacity in its clip you know but
it's<00:03:52.440> not<00:03:52.769> that<00:03:53.070> big<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.850> difference<00:03:54.590> moving

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it's not that big of a difference moving

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.740 
it's not that big of a difference moving
on<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.890> next<00:03:56.160> category<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.090> damages<00:03:57.570> are

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
on to the next category the damages are

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.570 
on to the next category the damages are
all<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.019> same<00:03:58.200> whether<00:03:58.530> it's<00:03:58.769> max<00:03:59.100> that's<00:03:59.340> up

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
all the same whether it's max that's up

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.820 
all the same whether it's max that's up
close<00:03:59.850> you<00:03:59.880> know<00:04:00.120> or<00:04:00.450> men<00:04:01.200> that's<00:04:01.560> at<00:04:01.800> a

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
close you know or men that's at a

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.170 
close you know or men that's at a
distance<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:04.320> you<00:04:05.070> know<00:04:05.220> rpms<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.060> can

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
distance and the you know rpms you can

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.150 
distance and the you know rpms you can
see<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.750> mp7<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.410> vector<00:04:07.709> are<00:04:07.830> both<00:04:08.010> the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
see that the mp7 and vector are both the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.970 
see that the mp7 and vector are both the
same<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.239> scorpion<00:04:09.870> evo<00:04:10.170> me<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.830> that

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
same but the scorpion evo me and that

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.130 
same but the scorpion evo me and that
jumps<00:04:11.430> up<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.820> especially<00:04:12.150> if<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.600> put<00:04:12.810> rapid

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
jumps up and especially if you put rapid

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.660 
jumps up and especially if you put rapid
fire<00:04:13.320> on<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.650> holy<00:04:13.890> smokes<00:04:14.280> that's<00:04:14.519> like

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
fire on that holy smokes that's like

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.580 
fire on that holy smokes that's like
cheese<00:04:14.970> was<00:04:15.209> coming<00:04:15.540> out<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.810> gun<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:16.380> I

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
cheese was coming out of that gun so I

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.710 
cheese was coming out of that gun so I
definitely<00:04:17.459> equipped<00:04:17.940> scavenger<00:04:18.479> if<00:04:18.600> you're

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
definitely equipped scavenger if you're

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.180 
definitely equipped scavenger if you're
going<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.870> run<00:04:18.930> around<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.410> gun<00:04:19.620> with<00:04:19.799> rapid

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
going to run around that gun with rapid

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.890 
going to run around that gun with rapid
fire<00:04:20.370> but<00:04:20.640> man<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:20.910> just<00:04:21.239> seems<00:04:21.450> like<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.630> huge

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
fire but man that just seems like a huge

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.440 
fire but man that just seems like a huge
advantage<00:04:22.400> being<00:04:23.400> able<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.640> shoot<00:04:23.729> that<00:04:24.120> fast

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
advantage being able to shoot that fast

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.570 
advantage being able to shoot that fast
but<00:04:25.110> as<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.440> can<00:04:25.530> see<00:04:25.710> for<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.010> range<00:04:26.250> all

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
but as you can see for the range all

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.740 
but as you can see for the range all
three<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.000> those<00:04:27.210> can

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
three of those can

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.510 
three of those can
kill<00:04:27.990> within<00:04:28.170> three<00:04:28.560> shots<00:04:28.860> unless<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.400> get<00:04:29.460> a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
kill within three shots unless you get a

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.300 
kill within three shots unless you get a
head<00:04:29.700> shot<00:04:29.930> but<00:04:30.930> four<00:04:31.200> shots<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.890> see<00:04:32.100> that

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
head shot but four shots you see that

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.460 
head shot but four shots you see that
the<00:04:32.430> mp7<00:04:32.700> has<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.480> best<00:04:33.690> range<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.290> take

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the mp7 has the best range to take

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.680 
the mp7 has the best range to take
somebody<00:04:34.860> out<00:04:34.920> it's<00:04:35.370> nearly<00:04:35.760> twice<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.330> of

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
somebody out it's nearly twice that of

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.260 
somebody out it's nearly twice that of
the<00:04:36.990> scorpion<00:04:37.470> evo<00:04:37.860> but<00:04:38.820> you're<00:04:39.030> going<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.210> be

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
the scorpion evo but you're going to be

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.030 
the scorpion evo but you're going to be
up<00:04:39.300> close<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.660> in<00:04:39.960> somebody's<00:04:40.590> face<00:04:40.770> with

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
up close and in somebody's face with

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.920 
up close and in somebody's face with
these<00:04:41.220> weapons<00:04:41.700> not<00:04:41.910> shooting<00:04:42.270> at<00:04:42.390> a<00:04:42.450> distance

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
these weapons not shooting at a distance

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.420 
these weapons not shooting at a distance
so<00:04:43.080> I<00:04:43.110> don't<00:04:43.350> know<00:04:43.410> how<00:04:43.530> much<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.770> really

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
so I don't know how much that really

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.790 
so I don't know how much that really
matters<00:04:45.270> now<00:04:45.420> something<00:04:45.840> interesting<00:04:46.440> check

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
matters now something interesting check

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.370 
matters now something interesting check
out<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.100> five<00:04:47.400> shot<00:04:47.990> you<00:04:48.990> can<00:04:49.170> kill<00:04:49.350> somebody

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
out the five shot you can kill somebody

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.400 
out the five shot you can kill somebody
with<00:04:49.710> five<00:04:50.100> bullets<00:04:50.280> Eddie<00:04:50.670> at<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.150> much<00:04:51.840> longer

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
with five bullets Eddie at a much longer

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.220 
with five bullets Eddie at a much longer
distance<00:04:53.250> with<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.610> scorpion<00:04:54.090> evo<00:04:54.390> then<00:04:55.050> the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
distance with the scorpion evo then the

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.710 
distance with the scorpion evo then the
other<00:04:55.410> two<00:04:55.500> guns<00:04:56.130> in<00:04:56.460> this<00:04:56.640> category<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.690> I

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
other two guns in this category and I

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.540 
other two guns in this category and I
don't<00:04:58.080> really<00:04:58.320> understand<00:04:58.920> that<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.130> don't<00:04:59.370> get

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
don't really understand that I don't get

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.460 
don't really understand that I don't get
that<00:04:59.700> if<00:04:59.910> you<00:05:00.030> know<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.390> answer<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.900> please

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
that if you know the answer that please

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.020 
that if you know the answer that please
let<00:05:01.680> me<00:05:01.710> know<00:05:01.860> but<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.580> just<00:05:02.610> seems<00:05:02.820> like

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
let me know but that just seems like

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.790 
let me know but that just seems like
it's<00:05:03.300> a<00:05:03.390> huge<00:05:03.660> advantage<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.260> of<00:05:04.350> course<00:05:04.560> six

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
it's a huge advantage and of course six

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.990 
it's a huge advantage and of course six
bullets<00:05:05.100> with<00:05:05.250> any<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.550> these<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.820> going<00:05:05.940> to

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
bullets with any of these is going to

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.330 
bullets with any of these is going to
kill<00:05:06.290> moving<00:05:07.290> on<00:05:07.410> though<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.680> can<00:05:07.919> see<00:05:08.130> that

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
kill moving on though you can see that

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.570 
kill moving on though you can see that
the<00:05:08.520> reload<00:05:09.000> times<00:05:09.330> are<00:05:09.750> pretty<00:05:10.440> similar<00:05:10.860> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
the reload times are pretty similar the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.600 
the reload times are pretty similar the
mp7<00:05:12.030> seems<00:05:12.570> like<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.930> reloads<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.650> slowest

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
mp7 seems like it reloads the slowest

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.330 
mp7 seems like it reloads the slowest
when<00:05:14.760> it<00:05:14.880> comes<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.300> adding<00:05:15.770> but<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.860> fastest

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
when it comes to adding but the fastest

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.340 
when it comes to adding but the fastest
when<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.669> comes<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> full<00:05:18.510> reload<00:05:18.960> so<00:05:19.320> I

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
when it comes to a full reload so I

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.530 
when it comes to a full reload so I
don't<00:05:19.620> really<00:05:19.770> get<00:05:20.460> why<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.880> differences

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
don't really get why the differences

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.300 
don't really get why the differences
there<00:05:21.840> and<00:05:22.110> why<00:05:22.320> they<00:05:22.470> changed<00:05:22.710> but<00:05:23.040> that's

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
there and why they changed but that's

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.880 
there and why they changed but that's
just<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.700> way<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.060> now<00:05:24.570> as<00:05:25.260> far<00:05:25.590> as<00:05:25.650> the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
just the way it is now as far as the

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.950 
just the way it is now as far as the
last<00:05:26.040> one<00:05:26.310> three<00:05:26.610> round<00:05:26.790> burst<00:05:27.000> weapon<00:05:27.390> like<00:05:27.840> I

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
last one three round burst weapon like I

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.420 
last one three round burst weapon like I
said<00:05:28.140> I<00:05:28.169> haven't<00:05:28.560> unlocked<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:29.010> so<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.160> haven't

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
said I haven't unlocked it so I haven't

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.730 
said I haven't unlocked it so I haven't
had<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.090> chance<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.660> really<00:05:30.810> try<00:05:31.200> it<00:05:31.260> out<00:05:31.470> but

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
had a chance to really try it out but

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.010 
had a chance to really try it out but
man<00:05:31.979> it<00:05:32.100> looks<00:05:32.250> really<00:05:32.610> interesting<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.990> can

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
man it looks really interesting you can

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.409 
man it looks really interesting you can
see<00:05:34.380> that<00:05:34.410> ammo<00:05:35.040> looks<00:05:35.550> pretty<00:05:35.760> similar<00:05:36.240> to

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
see that ammo looks pretty similar to

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.310 
see that ammo looks pretty similar to
the<00:05:37.200> you<00:05:37.680> know<00:05:37.800> lower<00:05:38.120> damaged<00:05:39.120> ones<00:05:39.479> with<00:05:39.810> 36

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
the you know lower damaged ones with 36

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.530 
the you know lower damaged ones with 36
rounds<00:05:40.890> that<00:05:41.550> seems<00:05:41.790> pretty<00:05:41.970> nice<00:05:42.210> it's

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
rounds that seems pretty nice it's

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.020 
rounds that seems pretty nice it's
shooting<00:05:42.990> three<00:05:43.290> rounds<00:05:43.650> per<00:05:43.890> burst<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.550> you

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
shooting three rounds per burst and you

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.510 
shooting three rounds per burst and you
have<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.300> lower<00:05:45.510> damage<00:05:45.780> like<00:05:46.140> those<00:05:46.440> as<00:05:47.250> far

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
have the lower damage like those as far

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.480 
have the lower damage like those as far
as<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:48.000> RPM<00:05:48.540> so<00:05:48.810> look<00:05:49.020> at<00:05:49.140> that<00:05:49.320> right<00:05:50.190> in<00:05:50.340> the

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
as the RPM so look at that right in the

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.330 
as the RPM so look at that right in the
middle<00:05:50.930> slightly<00:05:51.930> above<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.350> mp7<00:05:52.590> and<00:05:53.010> vector

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
middle slightly above the mp7 and vector

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.360 
middle slightly above the mp7 and vector
you<00:05:53.760> know<00:05:53.910> clap<00:05:54.780> on<00:05:54.960> rapid<00:05:55.440> fire<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:55.950> it<00:05:56.070> jumps

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
you know clap on rapid fire and it jumps

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.080 
you know clap on rapid fire and it jumps
up<00:05:56.520> almost<00:05:56.729> fifty<00:05:57.270> percent<00:05:57.690> so<00:05:58.050> that<00:05:58.440> is<00:05:58.710> nice

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
up almost fifty percent so that is nice

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.600 
up almost fifty percent so that is nice
and<00:06:00.090> you<00:06:00.240> can<00:06:00.390> see<00:06:00.630> that<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:01.350> kill<00:06:02.040> range<00:06:02.310> is

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
and you can see that the kill range is

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.240 
and you can see that the kill range is
pretty<00:06:02.700> soon<00:06:03.270> similar<00:06:04.050> to<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.710> other<00:06:04.740> ones

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
pretty soon similar to the other ones

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.590 
pretty soon similar to the other ones
you<00:06:05.460> know<00:06:05.550> especially<00:06:05.700> it's<00:06:06.120> pretty<00:06:06.360> similar

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
you know especially it's pretty similar

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.020 
you know especially it's pretty similar
to<00:06:06.780> the<00:06:07.169> vector<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:08.520> can<00:06:08.640> see<00:06:08.880> it's

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
to the vector and you can see it's

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.080 
to the vector and you can see it's
reload<00:06:09.450> rates<00:06:09.919> reloading<00:06:10.919> yeah<00:06:11.700> pretty

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
reload rates reloading yeah pretty

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.050 
reload rates reloading yeah pretty
similar<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:13.110> mp7<00:06:13.979> a<00:06:14.460> little<00:06:14.640> bit<00:06:14.760> slower

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
similar to the mp7 a little bit slower

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.440 
similar to the mp7 a little bit slower
when<00:06:15.300> it's<00:06:15.450> a<00:06:15.570> free<00:06:15.830> full<00:06:16.830> reload<00:06:17.460> but<00:06:17.790> there

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
when it's a free full reload but there

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.990 
when it's a free full reload but there
are<00:06:18.720> all<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.169> SMGs<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.100> their<00:06:20.310> stats<00:06:20.669> you

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
are all the SMGs and their stats you

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.190 
are all the SMGs and their stats you
know<00:06:21.120> make<00:06:21.330> sure<00:06:21.479> you<00:06:21.570> take<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:21.810> time<00:06:21.960> and

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
know make sure you take the time and

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.310 
know make sure you take the time and
compare<00:06:22.800> them<00:06:22.890> I<00:06:23.180> like<00:06:24.180> to<00:06:24.360> compare<00:06:24.780> the<00:06:25.020> you

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
compare them I like to compare the you

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.530 
compare them I like to compare the you
know<00:06:25.800> faster<00:06:26.220> firing<00:06:26.430> ones<00:06:26.880> to<00:06:27.120> the<00:06:27.150> slower

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
know faster firing ones to the slower

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.180 
know faster firing ones to the slower
firing<00:06:27.840> ones<00:06:28.380> you<00:06:28.590> might<00:06:28.710> want<00:06:28.950> to<00:06:29.010> put<00:06:29.160> on

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
firing ones you might want to put on

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.909 
firing ones you might want to put on
rapid<00:06:29.640> fire<00:06:29.850> on<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.870> slower<00:06:31.140> firing<00:06:31.470> ones

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
rapid fire on the the slower firing ones

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.490 
rapid fire on the the slower firing ones
you<00:06:32.370> know<00:06:32.570> that<00:06:33.570> have<00:06:33.750> the<00:06:33.870> higher<00:06:33.990> damage<00:06:34.260> you

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
you know that have the higher damage you

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.350 
you know that have the higher damage you
might<00:06:34.650> not<00:06:34.860> but<00:06:35.580> I'm<00:06:35.820> really<00:06:35.970> looking<00:06:36.330> forward

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
might not but I'm really looking forward

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.570 
might not but I'm really looking forward
to<00:06:36.630> trying<00:06:36.810> out<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.229> scorpion<00:06:37.710> evo<00:06:38.010> I<00:06:38.190> had<00:06:38.550> a

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
to trying out the scorpion evo I had a

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.490 
to trying out the scorpion evo I had a
lot<00:06:38.760> of<00:06:38.820> fun<00:06:39.090> with<00:06:39.240> it<00:06:39.419> as<00:06:39.599> a<00:06:39.630> default<00:06:40.200> class

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
lot of fun with it as a default class

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.450 
lot of fun with it as a default class
that<00:06:40.710> was<00:06:40.860> pretty<00:06:41.070> much

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
that was pretty much
