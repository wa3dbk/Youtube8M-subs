00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello welcome to delicious recipe 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.839
 today we are going to learn how to make a meringue 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.169
 easy to decorate cakes for this 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.570
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:20.360
 ingredients 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:25.350
 sugar a clean container suitable for 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.930
 fire a whisk egg whites 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.740
 a pot with hot water to make 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.740
 water bath 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 and of course we are going to place the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.580
 clear in the bowl in kettle to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.500
 a saucepan whatever they have on hand 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.500
 let's incorporate the sugar 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 and we are going to stir it with a spatula 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.030
 We are going to try to integrate sugar with 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.030
 the clear 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.429
 once we integrate the whites with the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.699
 sugar we are going to take to this 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:05.070
 suitable vessel for fire in a bain marie 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.290
 and we are going to take the precaution of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.740
 Take it with a dish towel so as not to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.740
 burn us 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.380
 we place 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.690
 the container in a bain- marie and we started 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.740
 to stir immediately we revolve 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.079
 we stir 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.680
 we do not stop stirring because remember 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:28.370
 that are clear and that can be reached 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.590
 cook but we stir them 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.660
 the procedure is very easy we are going to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.960
 stir until we notice that the sugar 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.800
 it is disintegrating that the granules of 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.530
 sugar they disintegrate and for that we are going to 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.060
 go checking from time to time 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.130
 let's stop and touch 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.620
 that's the point just when we notice that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.020
 the sugar is no longer 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.550
 that's why we removed it and started 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.820
 beat with the electric mixer always 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.080
 we take the container with some 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.980
 repasador not to burn us 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.980
 and we are going to beat and we are going to be checking 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.060
 at that time I add a pinch 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:18.390
 of salt a pinch of salt is what enters 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.400
 between the two fingers only that and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.230
 let's go checking the consistency 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.900
 that has the merengue if it's what 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:31.680
 we want we can also 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:35.069
 add a teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.470
 and the idea is to beat until the 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.720
 container is completely cooled 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.750
 as we are going to go beating we are going to 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.710
 go noticing that the consistency is made 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.650
 increasingly thicker harder 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.650
 this meringue serves perfectly for 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.079
 decorate cakes and it is very firm 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.200
 so if we remember suddenly with 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:03.890
 some mouthpiece or spout will remain 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.269
 perfect there we already have the merengue with 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.269
 the consistency very firm 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.290
 and if we want it 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.280
 with harder peaks we will continue 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.379
 beating a little more we corroborate that the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.050
 point is the right one doing this 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.540
 movement if you do not roll over the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.930
 head the whites means that the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.810
 meringue is firm and we can 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.700
 decorate our cakes or do what 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.470
