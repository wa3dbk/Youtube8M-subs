00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
of compressor not much again it'll come

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.880 
of compressor not much again it'll come
in<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:42.190> louder<00:01:42.400> parts<00:01:42.850> but<00:01:43.600> but<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.110> it

plug-in you might not be familiar with

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.660 
plug-in you might not be familiar with
it's<00:01:52.150> it's<00:01:52.360> it's<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:54.340> know<00:01:54.430> what<00:01:54.580> the

it's it's it's a I don't know what the
hell<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:54.910> is<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.210> think<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.750> little

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
hell it is but I think of it a little

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.770 
hell it is but I think of it a little
bit<00:01:56.380> as<00:01:56.500> up<00:01:56.710> as<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.460> multiband<00:01:58.030> saturation

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
bit as up as a multiband saturation

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.630 
bit as up as a multiband saturation
plugin<00:01:59.229> where<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.410> can<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.100> do<00:02:00.220> multiple

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
plugin where I can I can do multiple

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.969 
plugin where I can I can do multiple
things<00:02:00.880> with<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.210> saturation<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:02.830> want

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
things with the saturation and I want

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.640 
things with the saturation and I want
you<00:02:03.070> just<00:02:03.220> if<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.700> don't<00:02:03.850> have<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.240> then<00:02:04.650> go

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
you just if you don't have it then go

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.530 
you just if you don't have it then go
online<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:06.310> get<00:02:06.580> a<00:02:06.610> demo<00:02:07.030> but<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:07.420> can

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
online and just get a demo but you can

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:19.860 
online and just get a demo but you can
see<00:02:07.720> what<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:07.960> watch<00:02:08.350> this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.670 

it's<00:02:20.870> amazing<00:02:21.349> in<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:23.469> just<00:02:24.469> adding

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
it's amazing in it so just adding

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.589 
it's amazing in it so just adding
saturation<00:02:25.549> but<00:02:25.670> I'm<00:02:25.819> adding<00:02:26.030> different

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
saturation but I'm adding different

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.300 
saturation but I'm adding different
amounts<00:02:26.959> at<00:02:27.079> these<00:02:27.230> different<00:02:27.650> frequencies

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
amounts at these different frequencies

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.490 
amounts at these different frequencies
and<00:02:28.459> you<00:02:28.519> can<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.870> can<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.200> things

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
and you can you can you can do things

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.869 
and you can you can you can do things
other<00:02:30.859> things<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.519> it

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.349 
that's a great plugin a lot of people
haven't<00:02:34.310> discovered<00:02:34.639> it<00:02:34.819> yet<00:02:34.879> but<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.329> should

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
haven't discovered it yet but it should

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.280 
haven't discovered it yet but it should
be<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.780> your<00:02:35.900> radar<00:02:36.079> and<00:02:36.700> then<00:02:38.079> this<00:02:39.079> is<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
be on your radar and then this is the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.479 
be on your radar and then this is the
same<00:02:39.469> effect<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.310> acoustic

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
same effect I have on the acoustic

00:02:40.489 --> 00:03:19.600 
same effect I have on the acoustic
guitar<00:02:40.849> some<00:02:41.120> reverb

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.309 

so<00:03:20.610> we've<00:03:20.790> got<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:20.940> little<00:03:21.420> bit<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.780> vitalizer

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
so we've got a little bit of a vitalizer

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.729 
so we've got a little bit of a vitalizer
get<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> little<00:03:22.950> bit<00:03:23.069> of<00:03:23.220> width<00:03:23.940> out<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.540> it

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
get a little bit of width out of it

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.960 
get a little bit of width out of it
I<00:03:27.620> really<00:03:28.620> use<00:03:28.800> this<00:03:28.950> reverb<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.459> should<00:03:29.640> use<00:03:29.819> it

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
I really use this reverb I should use it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.479 
I really use this reverb I should use it
more<00:03:30.000> often<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:30.569> really<00:03:30.900> really<00:03:31.170> good

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
more often it's really really good

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.940 
more often it's really really good
and<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> old<00:03:33.540> classic<00:03:34.290> dimension<00:03:34.769> D

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
and then the old classic dimension D

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.640 
and then the old classic dimension D
which<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.370> favorite<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.879> mine<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.080> all<00:03:37.410> of

those things combined and and you get a

00:03:39.840 --> 00:04:07.630 
those things combined and and you get a
pretty<00:03:40.019> cool<00:03:40.349> sound

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.580
