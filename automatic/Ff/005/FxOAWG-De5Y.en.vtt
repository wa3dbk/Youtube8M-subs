attention my heel is off the ground it
is<00:02:05.970> only<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.300> front<00:02:06.570> part<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.870> my<00:02:07.020> foot<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
is only the front part of my foot that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
is only the front part of my foot that
is<00:02:08.190> where<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> balance<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.910> created<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.660> going

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
is where the balance is created I going

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
is where the balance is created I going
to<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> pivot<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.129> one<00:02:11.310> point<00:02:11.340> I'm

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
to have to pivot and at one point I'm

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.300 
to have to pivot and at one point I'm
only<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.170> part<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.830> my<00:02:14.010> foot

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
only going to be on that part of my foot

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.580 
only going to be on that part of my foot
that's<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.879> no<00:02:15.120> hands<00:02:15.330> no<00:02:15.510> feet<00:02:15.599> not<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.440> that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
that's it no hands no feet not just that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.920 
that's it no hands no feet not just that
so<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.370> want<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> make<00:02:17.670> sure<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.780> heel

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
so you want to make sure that the heel

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.420 
so you want to make sure that the heel
is<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.440> cannot<00:02:19.769> do<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:19.980> move<00:02:20.280> with<00:02:20.400> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
is up you cannot do this move with a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.089 
is up you cannot do this move with a
flat<00:02:20.640> foot<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.690> next<00:02:22.019> step<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.500> transition

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
flat foot the next step is to transition

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.610 
flat foot the next step is to transition
the<00:02:23.340> weight<00:02:23.489> from<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.420> leg<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.290> hand

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the weight from this leg up to the hand

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.380 
the weight from this leg up to the hand
and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.780 
and
leg<00:02:26.750> here<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:28.069> leg<00:02:28.280> will<00:02:28.400> come<00:02:28.550> off<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
leg here so this leg will come off the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.710 
leg here so this leg will come off the
ground<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.390> weight<00:02:29.510> will<00:02:29.630> be

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
ground and all the weight will be

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.530 
ground and all the weight will be
supported<00:02:30.140> by<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.500> arm<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.520> leg<00:02:31.760> right

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
supported by this arm and this leg right

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.050 
supported by this arm and this leg right
it<00:02:32.959> comes<00:02:33.290> up<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:34.310> next<00:02:34.340> step<00:02:34.760> that's<00:02:34.880> going

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
it comes up the next step that's going

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.000 
it comes up the next step that's going
to<00:02:35.120> happen<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:36.050> foot<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.800> come

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
to happen this foot is going to come

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.970 
to happen this foot is going to come
through<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:38.150> arm<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.440> foot<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.860> are

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
through the arm and the foot that are

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.130 
through the arm and the foot that are
bracing<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:40.910> right<00:02:41.240> will<00:02:41.630> come<00:02:41.840> through<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
bracing so right will come through the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.680 
bracing so right will come through the
center<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:43.160> will<00:02:43.310> transition<00:02:43.700> this<00:02:44.390> hand

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
center and you will transition this hand

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.630 
center and you will transition this hand
to<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.959> obstacle<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:46.610> like<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:46.940> boom<00:02:49.870> pull

of a push and twist so let's talk about
the<00:03:03.560> push<00:03:03.770> first<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:05.209> once<00:03:05.480> you've

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
the push first so once you've

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.960 
the push first so once you've
transitioned<00:03:06.019> your<00:03:06.320> hands<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.800> hear<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.700> next

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
thing that's going to happen is going to

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.420 
thing that's going to happen is going to
have<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.260> be<00:03:09.350> an<00:03:09.440> incredible<00:03:09.920> amount<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.190> force

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
have to be an incredible amount of force

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.009 
have to be an incredible amount of force
exerted<00:03:10.760> you're<00:03:11.420> going<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.600> have<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.810> push

down on the obstacle so you're going to

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.340 
down on the obstacle so you're going to
want<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.090> start<00:03:14.269> with<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.480> arm<00:03:14.630> slightly<00:03:14.989> bent

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
sequence so the original hand that

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.870 
sequence so the original hand that
planted<00:03:26.810> will<00:03:26.959> be<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.170> first<00:03:27.380> two<00:03:27.530> pushes<00:03:27.880> the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
planted will be the first two pushes the

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.330 
planted will be the first two pushes the
second<00:03:29.540> hand<00:03:29.870> will<00:03:30.290> stay<00:03:30.560> on<00:03:30.739> long<00:03:31.010> enough<00:03:31.040> to

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
second hand will stay on long enough to

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.590 
second hand will stay on long enough to
maintain<00:03:31.459> your<00:03:31.700> balance<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.269> then<00:03:32.480> it's

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
maintain your balance and then it's

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.240 
maintain your balance and then it's
going<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.750> push<00:03:33.019> some<00:03:33.260> more<00:03:33.440> it's<00:03:34.040> very

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
going to push some more it's very

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.160 
going to push some more it's very
important<00:03:34.760> that<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.910> get<00:03:35.120> this<00:03:35.269> rhythm<00:03:35.540> but

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
important that you get this rhythm but

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.229 
important that you get this rhythm but
at<00:03:36.410> some<00:03:36.860> point<00:03:36.890> both<00:03:37.579> of<00:03:37.790> your<00:03:37.910> hands<00:03:38.090> are

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
at some point both of your hands are

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.520 
at some point both of your hands are
going<00:03:38.329> to<00:03:38.390> come<00:03:38.450> off<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:38.900> obstacle<00:03:39.290> if

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
going to come off of this obstacle if

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.319 
going to come off of this obstacle if
you<00:03:39.980> leave<00:03:40.130> one<00:03:40.400> behind<00:03:40.430> it's<00:03:41.030> going<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.209> open

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
you leave one behind it's going to open

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.850 
you leave one behind it's going to open
up<00:03:41.540> your<00:03:41.600> chest<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.019> completely<00:03:42.320> mess<00:03:42.560> up<00:03:42.739> the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
up your chest and completely mess up the

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.319 
up your chest and completely mess up the
move<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:43.579> remember<00:03:43.910> push<00:03:44.690> hard<00:03:45.140> push<00:03:45.410> hard<00:03:46.329> you

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
move so remember push hard push hard you

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.780 
move so remember push hard push hard you
can<00:03:47.510> also<00:03:47.690> accentuate<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.530> push<00:03:48.739> by<00:03:49.370> pulling

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
can also accentuate the push by pulling

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.910 
can also accentuate the push by pulling
your<00:03:49.940> neck<00:03:50.180> up<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:51.260> back<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.650> your<00:03:51.739> head

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.259 
your neck up the back of your head
raising<00:03:52.370> your<00:03:52.400> chin<00:03:52.760> raising<00:03:53.150> your

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
raising your chin raising your

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.759 
raising your chin raising your
collarbone<00:03:53.690> anything<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.200> can<00:03:54.320> think<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.590> to

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
collarbone anything you can think of to

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.920 
collarbone anything you can think of to
get<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.579> whole<00:03:55.880> portion<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.540> off<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
get this whole portion of you off of the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.330 
get this whole portion of you off of the
ground<00:03:57.079> but<00:03:57.560> it's<00:03:57.709> really<00:03:57.920> important<00:03:58.310> that

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
ground but it's really important that

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.180 
ground but it's really important that
this<00:03:58.790> part<00:03:59.329> happens<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.110> this<00:04:00.620> part<00:04:00.920> doesn't

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
this part happens if this part doesn't

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.880 
this part happens if this part doesn't
happen<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.730> move<00:04:01.940> doesn't<00:04:02.329> happen<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:03.110> make

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
happen the move doesn't happen so make

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.740 
happen the move doesn't happen so make
sure<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.100> you<00:04:04.280> push<00:04:04.519> now<00:04:05.030> when<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.450> push

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
sure that you push now when you push

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.539 
sure that you push now when you push
your<00:04:05.930> actually<00:04:06.290> pushing<00:04:06.650> back<00:04:06.920> down<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:07.489> way

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
your actually pushing back down this way

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.660 
your actually pushing back down this way
into<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.570> foot<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.470> foot<00:04:09.799> that's<00:04:10.010> planted<00:04:10.519> in

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
into the foot the foot that's planted in

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.620 
into the foot the foot that's planted in
pivoting<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.120> remember<00:04:11.329> the<00:04:11.420> one<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.600> showed

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
pivoting you remember the one I showed

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.660 
pivoting you remember the one I showed
you<00:04:11.930> with<00:04:12.049> your<00:04:12.170> heel<00:04:12.350> up<00:04:12.560> that's<00:04:13.190> actually

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
you with your heel up that's actually

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.789 
you with your heel up that's actually
going<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.910> be<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.150> point<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.870> stays<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.590> the

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
going to be the point that stays on the

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.750 
going to be the point that stays on the
ground<00:04:17.289> so<00:04:18.289> you<00:04:18.560> remember<00:04:19.220> when<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.400> said<00:04:19.489> there

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
ground so you remember when I said there

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.710 
ground so you remember when I said there
was<00:04:19.850> actually<00:04:20.120> going<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.299> be<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.390> point<00:04:20.630> to

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
was actually going to be a point to

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.480 
was actually going to be a point to
where<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.959> were<00:04:21.079> turning<00:04:21.289> blindly<00:04:21.890> or<00:04:22.400> you

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
where you were turning blindly or you

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.770 
where you were turning blindly or you
wouldn't<00:04:22.640> be<00:04:22.700> able<00:04:22.789> to<00:04:22.940> see<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.150> ground<00:04:23.360> and

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
wouldn't be able to see the ground and

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.719 
wouldn't be able to see the ground and
where<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.080> kind<00:04:24.289> of<00:04:24.320> just<00:04:24.470> had<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.830> hope<00:04:25.550> it

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
where you kind of just had to hope it

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.750 
where you kind of just had to hope it
all<00:04:25.850> goes<00:04:26.000> well<00:04:26.060> well<00:04:26.990> this<00:04:27.140> is<00:04:27.169> that<00:04:27.380> point

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
all goes well well this is that point

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.159 
all goes well well this is that point
right<00:04:28.760> after<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.150> push<00:04:29.360> comes<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.840> push<00:04:30.020> of

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
right after the push comes the push of

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.469 
right after the push comes the push of
the<00:04:30.200> hands<00:04:30.669> it's<00:04:31.669> happening<00:04:32.210> simultaneously

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
the hands it's happening simultaneously

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.779 
the hands it's happening simultaneously
with<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.229> drive<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.890> leg<00:04:34.220> you<00:04:34.460> remember<00:04:34.700> the

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
with a drive of the leg you remember the

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.850 
with a drive of the leg you remember the
leg<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.090> went<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.479> center

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
leg that went to the center

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.070 
leg that went to the center
this<00:04:37.860> guy<00:04:38.160> when<00:04:39.000> he<00:04:39.090> comes<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.510> center<00:04:39.930> and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
this guy when he comes to the center and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.950 
this guy when he comes to the center and
you're<00:04:40.500> pivoting<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:41.550> actually<00:04:42.060> goes<00:04:42.240> up<00:04:42.510> and

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
you're pivoting it actually goes up and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.880 
you're pivoting it actually goes up and
over<00:04:43.650> your<00:04:43.860> body<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.990> tricky<00:04:46.440> part<00:04:46.680> about<00:04:46.740> it

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
over your body the tricky part about it

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.370 
over your body the tricky part about it
is<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:48.630> only<00:04:48.810> part<00:04:49.110> of<00:04:49.230> you<00:04:49.350> that's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
is is the only part of you that's

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.680 
is is the only part of you that's
attached<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.430> box<00:04:50.640> at<00:04:50.850> this<00:04:51.120> point<00:04:51.510> is

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
attached to the box at this point is

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.230 
attached to the box at this point is
this<00:04:52.500> foot<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.370> leg<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.640> swinging<00:04:54.000> up<00:04:54.090> and

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
this foot and the leg is swinging up and

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.730 
this foot and the leg is swinging up and
around<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:54.990> what<00:04:55.140> I'm<00:04:55.200> going<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.380> do<00:04:55.560> is

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
around you so what I'm going to do is

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.930 
around you so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:55.860> going<00:04:55.890> to<00:04:56.040> do<00:04:56.130> this<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.310> few<00:04:56.400> times<00:04:56.550> from<00:04:56.820> a

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
I'm going to do this a few times from a

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.980 
I'm going to do this a few times from a
couple<00:04:57.180> different<00:04:57.270> angles<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:57.870> may<00:04:57.960> even

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
couple different angles and we may even

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.500 
couple different angles and we may even
slow<00:04:58.440> mo<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:59.160> that<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.430> can<00:04:59.640> see<00:04:59.970> exactly

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
slow mo it so that you can see exactly

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.320 
slow mo it so that you can see exactly
what's<00:05:00.930> going<00:05:01.170> on<00:05:01.470> it's<00:05:02.130> kind<00:05:02.580> of<00:05:02.730> scary<00:05:03.060> and

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
what's going on it's kind of scary and

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.720 
what's going on it's kind of scary and
you<00:05:03.810> have<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.140> use<00:05:04.290> multiple<00:05:05.190> parts<00:05:05.520> of<00:05:05.610> your

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
you have to use multiple parts of your

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.610 
you have to use multiple parts of your
body<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.150> let's<00:05:06.780> start<00:05:06.990> breaking<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:07.440> whole

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
body so let's start breaking this whole

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.260 
body so let's start breaking this whole
part<00:05:07.860> of<00:05:07.920> the<00:05:07.980> move<00:05:08.250> down<00:05:08.460> because<00:05:08.730> this<00:05:08.910> part

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
part of the move down because this part

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.940 
part of the move down because this part
of<00:05:09.450> the<00:05:09.540> move<00:05:09.690> is<00:05:09.810> actually<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.290> beastly<00:05:10.830> as

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
of the move is actually the beastly as

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.340 
of the move is actually the beastly as
part<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.310> move<00:05:11.430> here<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.330> goes<00:05:12.480> pay

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
part of the move here it goes pay

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.140 
part of the move here it goes pay
attention<00:05:13.410> because<00:05:13.980> what's<00:05:14.640> going<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.850> happen

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
attention because what's going to happen

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.030 
attention because what's going to happen
is<00:05:15.300> that<00:05:15.810> Center<00:05:16.140> like<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.470> swinging<00:05:16.770> like

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
is that Center like that swinging like

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.980 
is that Center like that swinging like
is<00:05:17.190> going<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.430> come<00:05:17.610> up<00:05:18.000> through<00:05:18.360> this<00:05:18.480> way<00:05:18.720> and

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
is going to come up through this way and

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.830 
is going to come up through this way and
it's<00:05:19.500> gonna<00:05:19.650> draw<00:05:20.010> like<00:05:20.280> this<00:05:20.310> crazy<00:05:20.880> 270

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
it's gonna draw like this crazy 270

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.160 
it's gonna draw like this crazy 270
circle<00:05:22.290> it's<00:05:23.130> probably<00:05:23.640> more<00:05:23.820> like<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.060> 360<00:05:24.780> but

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
circle it's probably more like a 360 but

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.690 
circle it's probably more like a 360 but
the<00:05:25.590> power<00:05:25.770> doesn't<00:05:25.980> really<00:05:26.280> set<00:05:26.520> in<00:05:26.670> until

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
the power doesn't really set in until

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.110 
the power doesn't really set in until
your<00:05:27.600> past<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.110> 90<00:05:28.520> 90<00:05:29.520> marks<00:05:29.670> so<00:05:29.940> it's

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
your past the 90 90 marks so it's

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.530 
your past the 90 90 marks so it's
definitely<00:05:30.420> a<00:05:30.510> 27<00:05:31.020> or<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:31.680> 270<00:05:32.310> but<00:05:32.940> pay

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
definitely a 27 or a 270 but pay

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.790 
definitely a 27 or a 270 but pay
attention<00:05:33.570> to<00:05:34.020> how<00:05:34.140> it<00:05:34.290> throws<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.710> you'll

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
attention to how it throws and you'll

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.680 
attention to how it throws and you'll
notice<00:05:35.100> that<00:05:35.130> I<00:05:35.250> push<00:05:35.550> up<00:05:35.790> there's<00:05:36.450> also

notice that I push up there's also

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.030 
notice that I push up there's also

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
other side but we'll get to that pay

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.450 
other side but we'll get to that pay
attention<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.380> leg<00:05:40.530> comes<00:05:40.710> up<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.220> around

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
attention that leg comes up and around

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:56.770

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:02.129 
and around that is really important now

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:03.950 
and around that is really important now
the<00:06:02.189> same<00:06:02.669> leg<00:06:02.909> that<00:06:03.060> drives<00:06:03.509> through<00:06:03.810> this
