off of went after you froth it gives you
a<00:00:28.560> little<00:00:28.740> bit<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.099> time<00:00:29.400> before<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> milk

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
a little bit more time before that milk

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.290 
a little bit more time before that milk
gets<00:00:30.420> crusted<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.980> has<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> four<00:00:32.940> hole

controls the steam temperature and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.910 
controls the steam temperature and
pressure<00:00:44.420> let's<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:46.230> see<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.649> works

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
pressure let's let's see how this works

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.410 
pressure let's let's see how this works
first<00:00:47.640> we're<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:47.910> purge<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:50.390> make<00:00:51.390> sure

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
first we're gonna purge this make sure

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.380 
first we're gonna purge this make sure
we<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.870> some<00:00:51.930> dry<00:00:52.920> steam<00:00:56.090> next<00:00:57.090> we're<00:00:57.270> going

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
we get some dry steam next we're going

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.270 
we get some dry steam next we're going
to<00:00:57.510> insert<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:59.250> below<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> surface

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
to insert this just below the surface

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.100 
to insert this just below the surface
turn<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> off<00:01:03.559> pretty<00:01:04.559> powerful<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
turn it off pretty powerful you want to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.219 
turn it off pretty powerful you want to
make<00:01:07.229> sure<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.530> get<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> whirlpool<00:01:08.130> motion

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.219 

touch<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.250> warm<00:01:14.720> as<00:01:15.720> soon<00:01:16.110> as

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
touch it to see if it's warm as soon as

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
touch it to see if it's warm as soon as
it<00:01:16.380> gets<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.220> warm<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it gets a little bit warm you want to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.480 
it gets a little bit warm you want to
submerge<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.170> steam<00:01:19.470> wand<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.920> little<00:01:20.340> bit

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
submerge the steam wand a little bit

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
submerge the steam wand a little bit
under<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> surface<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.320> hot<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
under the surface when it's hot to the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890 
under the surface when it's hot to the
touch<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.580> when<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> turn<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> steam

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
touch is when you want to turn the steam

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
touch is when you want to turn the steam
off<00:01:26.360> right<00:01:27.360> away<00:01:27.890> most<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.460> want<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
off right away most the time you want to

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
off right away most the time you want to
just<00:01:29.970> wipe<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.990> first<00:01:33.409> purge<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.410 

let's<00:01:40.720> see<00:01:40.930> how<00:01:41.080> this<00:01:44.370> you<00:01:45.370> can<00:01:45.550> tell<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:46.120> good

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
let's see how this you can tell a good

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.500 
let's see how this you can tell a good
milk<00:01:47.260> steaming<00:01:47.710> when<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.180> glossy<00:01:50.110> and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
milk steaming when it is glossy and
