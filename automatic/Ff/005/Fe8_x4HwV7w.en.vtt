00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
want to win just didn't happen what was

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
want to win just didn't happen what was
the<00:01:41.250> spirit<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.970> atmosphere<00:01:42.119> like

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the spirit like the atmosphere like

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.319 
the spirit like the atmosphere like
whether<00:01:42.990> any<00:01:43.380> divisions<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.670> even<00:01:45.000> squad

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
whether any divisions in this even squad

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.600 
whether any divisions in this even squad
I<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:46.259> people<00:01:46.439> talked<00:01:46.799> about<00:01:47.070> divisions

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I think people talked about divisions

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.160 
I think people talked about divisions
but<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.210> only<00:01:48.479> happened<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.110> we

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
but I think that only happened when we

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
but I think that only happened when we
didn't<00:01:49.439> win<00:01:49.560> our<00:01:49.680> first<00:01:49.829> two<00:01:50.070> games<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.729> when

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
didn't win our first two games and when

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.840 
didn't win our first two games and when
you<00:01:51.450> don't<00:01:51.720> win<00:01:52.079> games<00:01:52.310> people<00:01:53.310> start<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.729> look

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you don't win games people start to look

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.030 
you don't win games people start to look
into<00:01:54.240> things<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.780> think<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.560> know<00:01:55.590> there<00:01:55.920> are

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
into things and think you know there are

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.149 
into things and think you know there are
things<00:01:56.219> happening<00:01:56.869> she<00:01:57.869> wasn't<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.009> know
