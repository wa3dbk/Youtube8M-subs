want<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> do<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:12.680> get<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.860> paper<00:02:13.160> clip<00:02:13.400> bend<00:02:13.940> it

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
want to do is get a paper clip bend it

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.990 
want to do is get a paper clip bend it
straight<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.860> put<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.010> against<00:02:16.340> one<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.809 
straight and put it against one of the
clips<00:02:17.269> in<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:18.530> are<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.769> housed<00:02:19.069> by<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
clips in that are is housed by the

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.420 
clips in that are is housed by the
receptacle<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.810> then<00:02:21.590> what<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:21.830> want<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.280> do

receptacle and then what you want to do
is<00:02:22.670> push<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.769> as<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.330> create<00:02:26.920> greater

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
is push in so as to create greater

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.180 
is push in so as to create greater
spring<00:02:28.400> tension<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.930> contact<00:02:30.500> will

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
spring tension and now this contact will

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.100 
spring tension and now this contact will
make<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> better<00:02:31.819> contact<00:02:32.390> with<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.840> jack

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
make a better contact with the jack

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.770 
make a better contact with the jack
itself<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.890> jack<00:02:34.130> plug<00:02:34.459> there<00:02:35.450> will<00:02:35.569> be<00:02:35.750> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
itself the jack plug there will be a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.190 
itself the jack plug there will be a
second<00:02:36.470> point<00:02:36.680> also<00:02:37.489> for<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.299> second<00:02:38.690> contact

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
second point also for the second contact

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.620 
second point also for the second contact
and<00:02:39.440> you'll<00:02:39.920> want<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.190> push<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.670> in<00:02:40.940> also<00:02:41.420> in

and you'll want to push that in also in

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.820 
and you'll want to push that in also in
order<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.019> increase<00:02:42.380> its<00:02:42.709> tension<00:02:43.690> finally

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
order to increase its tension finally

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.890 
order to increase its tension finally
the<00:02:45.830> contact<00:02:46.580> at<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> end<00:02:47.150> of<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.630> jack

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the contact at the end of the jack

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.530 
the contact at the end of the jack
receptacle<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.250> can<00:02:49.430> push<00:02:49.670> down<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.209> that

the mp3 player you want to snap the case

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.890 
the mp3 player you want to snap the case
back<00:03:56.099> together<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.269> should<00:03:57.480> work<00:03:57.510> out

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
back together and it should work out

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.860 
back together and it should work out
just<00:03:57.959> fine<00:03:58.319> if<00:03:59.129> it<00:03:59.340> doesn't<00:03:59.760> well<00:04:00.450> then<00:04:00.720> that

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
just fine if it doesn't well then that

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.509 
just fine if it doesn't well then that
probably<00:04:01.110> means<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.680> there's<00:04:01.950> some<00:04:02.160> sort<00:04:02.190> of

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
probably means that there's some sort of

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.759 
probably means that there's some sort of
internal<00:04:03.090> problem<00:04:03.780> with<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.050> electronics<00:04:04.680> of
