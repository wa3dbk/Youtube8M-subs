00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.220 
which is up to you I actually don't want
to<00:04:05.400> do<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:06.209> because<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.570> didn't<00:04:06.840> have<00:04:06.959> pins

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
to do it it's because I didn't have pins

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.009 
to do it it's because I didn't have pins
in<00:04:07.410> here<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.860> pinned<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.910> then<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.840> don't

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
in here I pinned it and then you don't

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.259 
in here I pinned it and then you don't
have<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.380> twist<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.920> like<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.459> said<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:12.030> can't

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
have to twist it like I said you can't

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.780 
have to twist it like I said you can't
just<00:04:12.450> put<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:12.750> around<00:04:12.950> but<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:13.980> wanna<00:04:14.250> twist<00:04:14.519> it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
just put it around but I wanna twist it

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.630 
just put it around but I wanna twist it
slightly<00:04:15.169> then<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.320> get<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:17.220> tell<00:04:17.489> you

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
slightly then I get it and I tell you

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.000 
slightly then I get it and I tell you
once<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.660> tie<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.109> into<00:04:19.260> a<00:04:19.440> knot<00:04:19.470> if<00:04:19.830> you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
once you can tie it into a knot if you

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.680 
once you can tie it into a knot if you
want

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
want

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.640 
want
I<00:04:22.600> tie<00:04:23.600> it<00:04:23.630> once<00:04:23.900> because<00:04:24.170> it<00:04:24.290> doesn't<00:04:24.530> really

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
I tie it once because it doesn't really

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.770 
I tie it once because it doesn't really
move<00:04:24.890> about<00:04:25.190> but<00:04:25.910> if<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.150> was<00:04:26.270> doing<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.570> to

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
move about but if I was doing this to

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.110 
move about but if I was doing this to
you<00:04:26.930> now<00:04:27.080> tie<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.380> twice<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:29.030> know

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
you now tie it twice so that you know

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.450 
you now tie it twice so that you know
cuz<00:04:29.270> I'm<00:04:29.390> there<00:04:29.540> all<00:04:29.660> day<00:04:29.870> I'm<00:04:30.260> doing<00:04:31.220> things
