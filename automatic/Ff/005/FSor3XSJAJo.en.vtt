aquarium since last time I've removed

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.320 
aquarium since last time I've removed
the<00:00:13.110> purple<00:00:13.410> fire<00:00:13.590> fish<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.700> replaced<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the purple fire fish and replaced it

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.460 
the purple fire fish and replaced it
with<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.870> small<00:00:16.490> clownfish<00:00:18.289> they've<00:00:19.289> worked

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
with a small clownfish they've worked

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.800 
with a small clownfish they've worked
out<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.920> social<00:00:20.130> hierarchy<00:00:20.539> pretty<00:00:21.539> quickly

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
out the social hierarchy pretty quickly

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.759 
out the social hierarchy pretty quickly
so<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> larger<00:00:22.800> black<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.880> white<00:00:24.029> clownfish

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
so the larger black and white clownfish

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.230 
so the larger black and white clownfish
has<00:00:25.769> become<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> female<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> younger

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
has become the female and the younger

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.109 
has become the female and the younger
one<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:28.039> taking<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> male<00:00:29.369> stance<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
one is taking the male stance in the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.620 
one is taking the male stance in the
dominant<00:00:30.510> structure<00:00:31.790> the<00:00:32.790> pulsing<00:00:33.329> zinnia

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
dominant structure the pulsing zinnia

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.459 
dominant structure the pulsing zinnia
has<00:00:33.809> spread<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.200> wildfire<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.230> also

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
has spread like wildfire and the I also

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.060 
has spread like wildfire and the I also
added<00:00:37.739> an<00:00:37.950> enemy<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> clownfish<00:00:39.899> which

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
added an enemy for the clownfish which

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
added an enemy for the clownfish which
is<00:00:41.070> doing<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.460> well<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.120> enemy<00:00:42.480> eats<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is doing really well the enemy eats a

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
is doing really well the enemy eats a
lot<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> clownfish<00:00:44.430> haven't

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
lot and just the clownfish haven't

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.000 
lot and just the clownfish haven't
really<00:00:44.969> taken<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> yet<00:00:45.890> but<00:00:46.890> that's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
really taken up to it yet but that's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.529 
really taken up to it yet but that's
fine<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:47.460> sure<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:47.820> notice<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> soon
