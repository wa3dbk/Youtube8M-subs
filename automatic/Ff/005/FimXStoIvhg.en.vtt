ball<00:04:59.340> for<00:04:59.550> two<00:04:59.790> seconds<00:05:00.330> then<00:05:00.900> she<00:05:01.140> can<00:05:01.290> use<00:05:01.470> it

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
ball for two seconds then she can use it

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.080 
ball for two seconds then she can use it
again<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:04.229> descend<00:05:04.890> upon<00:05:04.979> a<00:05:05.130> nearby<00:05:05.400> enemy

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
the ground then you have two seconds

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.850 
the ground then you have two seconds
inside<00:05:11.790> so<00:05:12.000> tell<00:05:12.180> me<00:05:12.210> when<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.690> land<00:05:12.900> on<00:05:13.110> so

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
let's take a look at it again and use it

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.940 
let's take a look at it again and use it
on<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.750> ground<00:05:15.900> right<00:05:16.080> here<00:05:16.140> since<00:05:16.500> my<00:05:16.620> knees

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
on the ground I'm talkable and use it

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.350 
on the ground I'm talkable and use it
again<00:05:19.260> under<00:05:19.530> spider<00:05:19.940> actually<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:20.970> was<00:05:21.150> too

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
for 1.5 seconds that's 10 direction

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:05.600 
for 1.5 seconds that's 10 direction
doesn't<00:07:04.409> increase<00:07:04.770> with<00:07:04.949> ranks<00:07:05.279> but<00:07:05.460> the

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 
doesn't increase with ranks but the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.300 
doesn't increase with ranks but the
coolant<00:07:05.909> does<00:07:06.060> reduce<00:07:06.389> so<00:07:07.050> let's<00:07:07.229> use<00:07:07.440> it<00:07:07.469> it's

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
coolant does reduce so let's use it it's

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.619 
coolant does reduce so let's use it it's
a<00:07:08.339> little<00:07:08.639> bit<00:07:08.789> hard<00:07:08.969> to<00:07:09.029> knock<00:07:09.240> stat<00:07:09.509> in

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:09.629 
a little bit hard to knock stat in

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.329 
a little bit hard to knock stat in
teamfights<00:07:09.930> so<00:07:10.529> that<00:07:10.680> probably<00:07:10.979> will<00:07:11.129> beat

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:11.339 
teamfights so that probably will beat

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:12.950 
teamfights so that probably will beat
wittle<00:07:11.669> bit<00:07:11.819> to<00:07:12.000> get<00:07:12.360> a<00:07:12.479> little<00:07:12.629> bit<00:07:12.839> more

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
wittle bit to get a little bit more

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.110 
wittle bit to get a little bit more
visibility<00:07:13.409> there<00:07:13.800> so<00:07:14.580> as<00:07:14.639> you<00:07:14.729> can<00:07:14.849> see<00:07:15.000> it's

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
visibility there so as you can see it's

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.850 
visibility there so as you can see it's
pretty<00:07:15.300> straight<00:07:15.509> for<00:07:15.750> just<00:07:16.020> a<00:07:16.139> single<00:07:16.620> line

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
pretty straight for just a single line

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.149 
pretty straight for just a single line
nuke<00:07:17.400> when<00:07:17.849> I<00:07:17.879> still<00:07:18.150> shot<00:07:18.360> look<00:07:18.719> Stan<00:07:19.589> I<00:07:19.830> mean

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:20.159 
nuke when I still shot look Stan I mean

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.939 
nuke when I still shot look Stan I mean
