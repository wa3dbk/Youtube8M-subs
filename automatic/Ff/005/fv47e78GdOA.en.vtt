00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
little bit like Metroid I guess with the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.660 
little bit like Metroid I guess with the
way<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:12.470> done<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:16.100> would<00:03:16.280> pop<00:03:16.460> out

way that it's done that would pop out

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.050 
way that it's done that would pop out
here<00:03:17.560> now<00:03:18.560> this<00:03:18.770> part<00:03:19.070> always<00:03:19.280> confused<00:03:19.880> me<00:03:19.970> I
