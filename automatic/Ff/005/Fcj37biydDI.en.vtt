 all blocks are served to us at once 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 also this hatchet can be used on 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.119
 big farther in tropical trees are you 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.340

 take the time to chop down 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.880
 just such a tree thanks for 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.690
 this topic you can speak for 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:28.590
 one could so we look we chop all 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:33.990
 only leaves fall 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 higher thanks to this such a hand we 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.510
 knocked out a whole stack of tropical 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.330
 trees now with this ax can 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.880
 go through the jungle and play a tree 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.850
 wholesale don't have to waste you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.220
 time to chop down a tree and so now 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.049
 I'll tell you how to craft this hatchet 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.740
 crafting this hatchet is uncomplicated 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.100
 but dear all we need to do 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.280
 so these are two sticks and 5 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.599
 diamonds and we get here such 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.709
 ax that can be used on 60 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.359
 trees no matter what small or 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.599
 large 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:20.440
 exactly 60 here is such an interesting and 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.410
 very useful mod 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.800
 which will ease our life minecraft well 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.530
 and now let's talk about 2 molds are you still 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.740
 you lay out a scheme like this 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:39.940
 that's the way it's time to walk already in the 21st century 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:44.100
 into the world of wireless technology like this 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.470
 working we press wala signal there 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.960
 check where redstone will be out 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.220
 pillar or so since so wireless 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.470
 technologies work oh well yes 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.800
 they actually work this mod 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.190
 add us here and so the transmitter and 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.760
 here is such a receiver now I will show 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.130
 how they craft craft them pretty 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.350
 simple we lay out like this 4 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:17.340
 iron here and so 4 1 volume field for 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:22.810
 transmitter put redstone torch here 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:26.500
 Well, for the receiver all the same thing only 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.200
 in the center of the lever that is trance mister this 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.010
 we have a transmitter receiver it is with us 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:42.489
 receiver and so demonstrate how 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:49.980
 it works so we have a receiver set 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:53.160
 immediately put two lamps for demonstration 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.720
 well and our trance mister transmitter 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:02.260
 connect the lever to it and light the wala 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.130
 this block also has its own 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.510
 the uniqueness of this such tsiferki 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:12.459
 that will help us separate the signals then 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.550
 is if we allow to expose here one 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.680
 pen 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.100
 then he is respectively guests because 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.310
 Our transmitter sends me a signal 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.010
 only on receiver with signal 0 none 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.190
 what others that is if we allow 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.820
 put here is one our zero 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.960
 will go out 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.180
 And the unit will light up 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.610
 There may be ten such signals. 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.010
 thousand can be set here 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.990
 from zero to nine thousand nine hundred 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.520
 ninety nine 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.550
 I think that hardly any of you 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.130
 build so many mechanisms requiring 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.710
 such a number of different signals and on 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.530
 this could completely exhaust itself 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.350
 that's all thanks to everyone for watching with 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.940
