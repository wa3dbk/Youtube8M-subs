you are already entered into the contest

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.850 
you are already entered into the contest
so<00:05:48.030> if<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:48.180> didn't<00:05:48.360> stay<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.510> the<00:05:48.660> end<00:05:48.860> you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
so if you didn't stay to the end you

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.750 
so if you didn't stay to the end you
probably<00:05:50.100> aren't<00:05:50.430> going<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.640> leave<00:05:50.700> that

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
probably aren't going to leave that

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.660 
probably aren't going to leave that
