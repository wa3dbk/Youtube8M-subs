 [music] 

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello today with you again I 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.980
 alex brash and today we will have 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.660
 video review on absolutely not 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.240
 relevant my past videos 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.599
 overview of the operating system topic 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.330
 windows 8 windows 7 and windows xp up 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.380
 immediately speak 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.240
 microphone and I have to use 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.400
 this white shit that doesn't 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 recorded in the far distance even 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 with amplification, why did I go 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 actually all this started hiring wandering 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.079
 on the internet site I stumbled upon 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.120
 microsoft that may 31, 2012 was 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.940
 released - 8 release preview 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.950
 And since this is the final version, then 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.739
 it should be all the same as 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 the final version well, and interested 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.329
 tudes syudy 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.710
 downloaded made boot disk installed 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.539
 and was very surprised pleasantly surprised by this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.800
 operating system first 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.989
 construction not from my past 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.510
 operating system windows 7 it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.299
 turns on twice as fast in the second 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.850
 she has great speed 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.080
 it supports all my devices all 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 my programs all my games she does not lag 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.920
 does not crash and so on as well as this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.490
 only trial i think windows 8 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.080
 the final version will be much better as 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.270
 I treat windows xp 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 yes, I respected the operating system of the year 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.560
 three or four years ago until windows 7 came out 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.740
 and then I realized that dramatically 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.590
 outdated that it is outdated by technology 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.280
 processor that it is outdated will fight 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.990
 that it is outdated by the design of the system 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.130
 that she is radically outdated 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.290
 high-speed system i.e. 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.979
 for example the same windows expand it 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.970
 can not 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.560
 which is very, very sad and I realized that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.869
 this is no one 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.509
 the desired operating system will not be it 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.729
 call shit and whether somehow so 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.369
 just survived at one time but 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.580
 let's call shit those people who write 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.770
 to the question what operating system 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.540
 the best on the internet windows xp 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.519
 windows xp windows xp 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.950
 I know nothing windows 7 is equal to windows 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.110
 xp here it is you shit actually 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.980
 because any man who 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.900
 enjoyed 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.810
 operating system windows 7 he immediately 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.989
 she will tell you that on a good computer 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.860
 much better and much more convenient than 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.780
 windows xp 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 strictly speaking and either you have old 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.860
 dumb not supporting windows 7 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.040
 computers and either you don't have a brain and what 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.430
 respectively 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.170
 most likely what can I say about 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.349
 windows 7 i worked with this operating 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.630
 system two years two years good 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.700
 I can say that this is the best 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.819
 operating system today 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.830
 The moment why I think so because she 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.989
 much faster windows xp because 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.549
 she is much prettier to wear and because 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.810
 she supports modern games 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:06.690
 directx 11 because it is very convenient 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.570
 without lags and so on actually 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.670
 saying windows 7 in my heart 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.500
 Now let's talk about all that I already 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.950
 said 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.890
 As you understood, I was installing windows 7 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.910
 because windows 8 whatever it is 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.580
 was good this is only a trial version 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.700
 of course if you are as interested 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.890
 in these questions a person like me put 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.860
 nothing will lag on health 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.720
 will be fine but desirable of course 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.390
 wait for the final version 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.770
 windows 8 when already with pleasure 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.460
 you can put it and use it 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.560
 here, as they say, is a matter of choice 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.930
 windows 7 is better operating sti 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.840
 windows xp outdated operating 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.190
 windows 8 systems . 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.220
 progressive operating system 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.310
 this is my opinion my next review 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.470
 there will be a review on windows 8 for show you 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.500
 core functions and and 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.150
 menu unlike rushed 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.150
 bye everyone and see you soon 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:27.790
