00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:21.180
 new smart passion the first difference 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.539
 it will look like the nose but it's a different way 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.400
 to connect the windshield line 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 at the front with a valuable one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.050
 improvement in the so-called pedestrian impact la 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.750
 real difference you can grasp if the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 look at you from the front you see it is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.550
 enlarged by as much as ten centimeters e 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 above all the roadway has increased 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.789
 14.4 percent and this will have 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.100
 influence on driving pleasure and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.050
 ease of maneuvering in the city in 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.050
 parking in the steering 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.159
 no 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.310
 the recovery in the fourth from 60 kilometers 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.300
 the hour as in fifth from 70 is rather 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.610
 low 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.220
 and this also because the reports to the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.110
 exchange rates are so long it is true that the 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.810
 maximum speed is reached in 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.450
 fourth or even the power regime 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.409
 maximum indeed it stops at 5000 rpm 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.009
 instead of the 6000 it is like having a dozen 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.009
 of horses less 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.160
 the hand for skill changes is good either 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.560
 in grafting both in selection above all 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.640
 the rest feels good when the gear 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.820
 enter without any roughness to the limit 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.500
 only the selection load in the line 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.140
 right which is that of the fifth of the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.990
 retro can sometimes seem a little 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.340
 woody and instead in rapid gear changes 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:07.540
 pleasant enough as you can 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.540
 see here pleasant and quick 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.660
 the balance between understeer and 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.180
 oversteer and almost sporty is 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.160
 in fact approaching the limit the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.220
 drift of the front axle and of that 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.830
 back are almost similar and therefore 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.450
 it becomes very reactive to the pedal 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.030
 accelerator 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.130
 which means that in case of errata 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.810
 speed assessment of 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.810
 distance of a curve enough a 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.810
 release the throttle you hear 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.610
 the smart that tends to close the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.140
 trajectory 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.320
 in short, a behavior is not 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.560
 pleasant but also secure tied up 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.360
 to the increase of the roadways to the new 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.650
 tire sizing 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.650
 new suspension set 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.090
 about the steering and his 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.129
 incredible turning radius 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.890
 we begin to swerve and the rack 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.500
 driven by the electric motor that acts 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.079
 directly on her requires little 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.690
 effort and now let's look at how 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.480
 change the steering ratio as you go 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.239
 increase the flying angle you see is not 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.430
 progressive but the turning radius 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.950
 decreases much more than I do 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.859
 turn the steering wheel practically as if 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:38.200
 rear right wheel was firm a 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.200
 good advantage for city traffic 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.879
 watching the smart from this point of 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.280
 view you understand how this new smart 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.109
 and manage to reduce his so much 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.239
 turning radius 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.640
 then we said that the car is 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.189
 enlarged by 10 centimeters but 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.409
 above all the roadway has increased 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:05.359
 front from 1200 85 mm to 1400 and 70 è 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.200
 more than 14 percent 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:12.439
 then let's try to turn this wheel 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.079
 believe that that wheel compartment has increased 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.750
 and then the poster wheel do more e 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.690
 here it even reaches 49 degrees 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.639
 here is the secret of the decrease of 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.330
 very tight turning radius 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.330
 competitive 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:34.650
 good city routes is evident 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.199
 comfort linked to the dimensions and to the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.590
 turning radius 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:43.650
 look here but it's not the only benefit 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.120
 of the new smart is indeed we go 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.460
 try it on the opinion here 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.280
 here you immediately feel that thanks to 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.050
 increased suspension travel e 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.630
 especially thanks to the shoulder of the 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.300
 plomatic now bar 65 in front and 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.509
 bar 60 behind and even bread is 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.900
 comfort has also become acceptable 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:11.039
 on surfaces like these has become 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.569
 acceptable therefore an excellent result 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.569
 in the city routes 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.330
 has improved a lot especially in the 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.370
 life and turning radius that 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.950
 are the main qualities for a 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.590
 city ​​car but not underestimated 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.960
 its dynamic qualities increase in 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.890
 roadways did very well and the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.660
 overcoming initial shyness has 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.500
 turned his guide 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:56.340
 today more reactive almost pleasant e 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.830
 finally the dimensions are really 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:05.830
 competitive the only one in line with the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:08.890
 feared nice demographic increase 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.660
 practical but also fashionable and fun 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.220
 today we will try it together on the hills 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.890
 around turin and in the city center 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.590
 let's go the new ego to a three engine 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.840
 one-liter cylinders and 69 horses 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.610
 just the right power for these 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.720
 small cars that need to read 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.720
 consume little
