terms of cost of production so the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
producing in the United States so we can

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.129

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
would say that if we can continue to on

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.360 
would say that if we can continue to on
the<00:04:56.510> trend<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:57.020> 5<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.710> 6<00:04:57.740> percent<00:04:58.220> increase

the trend of 5 to 6 percent increase
would<00:04:58.640> be<00:04:58.700> extremely<00:04:59.150> happy<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.510> don't<00:04:59.780> think

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
would be extremely happy I don't think

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.430
