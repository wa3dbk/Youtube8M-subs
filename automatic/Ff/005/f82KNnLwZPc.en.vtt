need another moisturizer on top of this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.240 
need another moisturizer on top of this
but<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> fact<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> description<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
but the fact that in the description it

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
but the fact that in the description it
says<00:01:11.490> use<00:01:11.760> alone<00:01:12.360> or<00:01:12.720> under<00:01:13.200> makeup<00:01:13.409> it

says use alone or under makeup it

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
says use alone or under makeup it
implies<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.030> would<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.330> only

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
bumps that I was seeing or you know a

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.939

little uneven texture that you might
notice<00:03:48.189> in<00:03:48.549> here<00:03:48.909> around<00:03:49.120> your<00:03:49.419> pores<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.049> don't

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
notice in here around your pores I don't

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.199 
notice in here around your pores I don't
think<00:03:50.379> I<00:03:50.470> had<00:03:50.620> massive<00:03:51.129> pores<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.699> start<00:03:52.000> with

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
think I had massive pores to start with

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.379 
think I had massive pores to start with
but<00:03:52.479> I<00:03:52.509> really<00:03:53.199> don't<00:03:53.379> notice<00:03:53.829> them<00:03:54.009> now<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:55.209> I

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
but I really don't notice them now and I

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.270 
but I really don't notice them now and I
do<00:03:55.449> think<00:03:55.989> this<00:03:56.169> is<00:03:56.319> maybe<00:03:56.500> had<00:03:56.739> an<00:03:56.859> effect<00:03:57.159> on

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
do think this is maybe had an effect on

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.249 
do think this is maybe had an effect on
some<00:03:57.579> fine<00:03:57.849> lines<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.419> certain<00:03:58.780> areas<00:03:59.079> and

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
some fine lines in certain areas and

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.110 
some fine lines in certain areas and
that<00:03:59.349> may<00:03:59.650> have<00:03:59.769> been<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.280> eye<00:04:00.310> cream<00:04:00.819> doing

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
that may have been the eye cream doing

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.210 
that may have been the eye cream doing
its<00:04:01.269> job<00:04:01.540> as<00:04:01.750> well<00:04:01.959> because<00:04:02.379> I<00:04:02.560> don't<00:04:03.040> notice

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
its job as well because I don't notice

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.520 
its job as well because I don't notice
as<00:04:03.519> much<00:04:03.729> right<00:04:04.030> here<00:04:04.479> right<00:04:05.049> on<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.290> under

reason why I haven't been using this in
the<00:04:31.150> daytime<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:31.810> because<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.140> like<00:04:32.320> to<00:04:32.470> use<00:04:32.530> a

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
the daytime is because I like to use a

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.340 
the daytime is because I like to use a
moisturizer<00:04:32.890> that<00:04:33.340> contains<00:04:33.790> SPF<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.960> if<00:04:35.200> they

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
moisturizer that contains SPF so if they

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.780 
moisturizer that contains SPF so if they
put<00:04:35.380> something<00:04:35.950> like<00:04:36.070> this<00:04:36.220> out<00:04:36.400> released

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
put something like this out released

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.520 
put something like this out released
something<00:04:37.030> with<00:04:37.240> SPF<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.840> would<00:04:37.960> probably<00:04:38.350> buy

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
something with SPF I would probably buy

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.050 
something with SPF I would probably buy
that<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.160> honestly<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.640> think<00:04:39.700> this<00:04:39.910> is

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
that and honestly I think this is

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.730 
that and honestly I think this is
probably<00:04:40.210> going<00:04:40.420> to<00:04:40.510> hold<00:04:40.750> its<00:04:40.960> spot<00:04:41.290> as<00:04:41.500> my

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
probably going to hold its spot as my
