the<00:00:18.090> problem<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.539> when<00:00:18.720> you're<00:00:18.810> doing

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the problem is when you're doing

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.380

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
bit warmer these would be good for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.600 
bit warmer these would be good for

and the comodo sports right here these
are<00:00:52.110> there<00:00:52.260> they're<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.789> around<00:00:54.440> version

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
are there they're all around version

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.860 
are there they're all around version
these<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:56.940> bit<00:00:57.149> newer<00:00:57.420> than<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
these are a little bit newer than the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.340 
these are a little bit newer than the
bit<00:00:58.170> closed<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.530> believe<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:01.170> these

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
bit closed I believe and then these

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.830 
bit closed I believe and then these
right<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.879> original<00:01:03.149> ones<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
right here are the original ones that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
right here are the original ones that
they<00:01:03.960> came<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.159> these<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.580> called

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
they came out with and these are called

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.210 
they came out with and these are called
I<00:01:06.060> believe<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.540> KS<00:01:07.020> O's<00:01:07.260> these<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
I believe the KS O's these are just the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.920 
I believe the KS O's these are just the
originals<00:01:08.760> that's<00:01:09.210> why<00:01:09.360> they<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.659> little

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
originals that's why they have little

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.859 
originals that's why they have little
velcro<00:01:10.200> strap<00:01:10.770> around<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.420> if<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.600> look<00:01:12.750> at

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
velcro strap around them if you look at

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
velcro strap around them if you look at
the<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.110> two<00:01:13.380> styles<00:01:14.420> they<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:16.790> pulled

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the other two styles they have pulled

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.630 
the other two styles they have pulled
this<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.770> slide<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.460> down

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
this up and you just slide that down

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
this up and you just slide that down
that<00:01:20.970> tightens<00:01:21.330> them<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:22.049> version<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.680> think

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that tightens them this version I think

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
that tightens them this version I think
feels<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.460> lot<00:01:23.580> better<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.119> foot<00:01:24.390> than<00:01:24.600> the

feels a lot better on your foot than the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.350 
feels a lot better on your foot than the
