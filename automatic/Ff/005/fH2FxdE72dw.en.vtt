00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
about half a scoop because you always

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.400 
about half a scoop because you always
want<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.270> test<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.629> tolerance<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.170> these

basic stuff and I'm but you know just
always<00:01:04.350> test<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.650> tolerance<00:01:05.040> even<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.309> it

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
always test your tolerance even if it

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.039 
always test your tolerance even if it
says<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.640> or<00:01:05.790> two<00:01:05.909> scoops<00:01:06.240> probably<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.990> do

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
says one or two scoops probably just do

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
says one or two scoops probably just do
a<00:01:07.080> half<00:01:07.290> your<00:01:07.560> first<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:08.119> but<00:01:09.119> tried<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> out

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
a half your first time but tried it out

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.539 
a half your first time but tried it out
I<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> good<00:01:09.990> boost<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.430> by<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I got a good boost from it but by the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.980 
I got a good boost from it but by the
second<00:01:11.939> day<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.090> tried<00:01:12.270> another<00:01:12.479> half<00:01:12.689> scoop

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
second day I tried another half scoop

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
second day I tried another half scoop
and<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.920> didn't<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.369> big<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.000> big<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and I didn't really get big that big of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.700 
and I didn't really get big that big of
a<00:01:15.330> boost<00:01:15.509> from<00:01:15.750> him<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> went<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> full

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
a boost from him so I went to a full

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.219 
a boost from him so I went to a full
scoop<00:01:17.060> did<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> couple<00:01:18.600> days<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
scoop did that for a couple days and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
scoop did that for a couple days and
then<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.759> tapered<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.509> me<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> mean

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
then I kind of tapered off for me I mean

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
then I kind of tapered off for me I mean
maybe<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.259> different<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.710> other<00:01:22.860> people

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
maybe it's different for other people

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.670 
maybe it's different for other people
but<00:01:24.060> over<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> course<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.659> week<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.590> know

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
but over the course of a week I you know

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.990 
but over the course of a week I you know
I<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:25.890> already<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.549> scoop<00:01:26.790> scoop

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
I was already up to like a scoop scoop

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
I was already up to like a scoop scoop
and<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> half<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.780> wasn't<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.799> feeling<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and a half and wasn't really feeling a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.670 
and a half and wasn't really feeling a
whole<00:01:29.400> lot<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.380> mean<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.590> was

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
whole lot from it so is I mean it was

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
whole lot from it so is I mean it was
pretty<00:01:31.799> good<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.070> first<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.640> kind<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pretty good at first it's kind of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
pretty good at first it's kind of
tapered<00:01:33.240> off<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.600> took<00:01:33.780> some<00:01:33.930> time<00:01:34.079> off<00:01:34.380> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
tapered off I took some time off and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
tapered off I took some time off and
jump<00:01:34.950> back<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> still<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.509> getting<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
jump back on it and still not getting a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
jump back on it and still not getting a
whole<00:01:36.990> big<00:01:37.200> boost<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.009> honestly<00:01:38.430> it's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
whole big boost from it so honestly it's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.630 
whole big boost from it so honestly it's
not<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.049> not<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:41.220> great<00:01:41.430> for

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
not you know it's not that great for

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.010 
not you know it's not that great for
that<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> other<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:42.869> say

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that but the other thing I will say

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830 
that but the other thing I will say
about<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.880> did<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.270> really<00:01:45.570> good

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
about it is that it did get really good

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
about it is that it did get really good
pumps<00:01:46.380> though<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.299> know

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
it's got creatine nitrate in it so I did

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's got creatine nitrate in it so I did
get<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.939> good<00:01:51.119> pumps<00:01:51.479> from<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
get really good pumps from it but the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.460
