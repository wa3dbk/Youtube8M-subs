making<00:02:01.610> very<00:02:02.119> good<00:02:02.210> shots<00:02:02.570> right<00:02:02.780> over<00:02:02.960> then

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
making very good shots right over then

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.359 
making very good shots right over then
second<00:02:03.440> arrow<00:02:03.530> plus<00:02:03.710> he's<00:02:03.860> going<00:02:04.070> straighter

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
second arrow plus he's going straighter

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.520 
second arrow plus he's going straighter
we<00:02:04.520> can<00:02:04.670> see<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.909> trajectory<00:02:05.600> if<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.229> could<00:02:06.380> say

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
we can see the trajectory if I could say

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.859 
we can see the trajectory if I could say
that<00:02:06.560> work<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.460> down<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.119> in<00:02:08.360> where

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
that work it's just down and in where

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.449 
that work it's just down and in where
these<00:02:09.019> other<00:02:09.170> guys<00:02:09.410> are<00:02:09.709> looping<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> ball

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
these other guys are looping the ball

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.540 
these other guys are looping the ball
out<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.150> back<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.560> right<00:02:13.100> now<00:02:13.130> they're

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
out and back in and right now they're

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.380 
out and back in and right now they're
fish<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:16.430> tough<00:02:16.700> though<00:02:16.850> when<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.120> played

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
fish it's tough though when you played

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.170 
fish it's tough though when you played

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the finals well what happened is they

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.380 
the finals well what happened is they
came<00:02:27.800> out<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.160> practice<00:02:28.550> balls<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:29.150> they

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
came out of the practice balls and they

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.000 
came out of the practice balls and they
started<00:02:29.750> throwing<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.110> ball<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.410> they<00:02:30.890> were

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
started throwing the ball and they were

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.009 
started throwing the ball and they were
getting<00:02:31.160> what<00:02:31.370> they<00:02:31.519> call<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:32.510> he<00:02:32.660> shoots<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
getting what they call as he shoots the

getting what they call as he shoots the
610<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.560> makes<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.130> very<00:02:34.459> good<00:02:34.850> reaction<00:02:35.300> at

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
610 it makes it a very good reaction at

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.640 
610 it makes it a very good reaction at
the<00:02:35.450> back<00:02:35.660> end<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.019> lane<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.350> ball<00:02:36.500> was

going<00:02:36.800> down<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.160> lane<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.370> hooking<00:02:37.940> very

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
going down the lane and hooking very

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.759 
going down the lane and hooking very
hard<00:02:38.600> at<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> back<00:02:38.989> end<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.380> then<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.620> the

hard at the back end and then as the

there<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:43.010> oil<00:02:43.250> started<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.700> carry<00:02:43.940> down<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
there that oil started to carry down the

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.850 
there that oil started to carry down the
lane<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.690> ball<00:02:44.870> wasn't<00:02:45.260> hooking<00:02:45.650> back

quite<00:02:46.220> as<00:02:46.370> much<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.850> there's<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.150> little

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
quite as much and there's a little

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.850 
quite as much and there's a little
adjustment<00:02:47.840> there<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.350> there's<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.620> little

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
adjustment there and there's a little

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.160 
adjustment there and there's a little
what<00:02:49.549> they<00:02:49.579> call<00:02:49.700> in-between<00:02:50.510> time<00:02:50.840> with<00:02:51.049> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
what they call in-between time with the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.020 
what they call in-between time with the
lanes<00:02:51.410> there<00:02:51.769> there<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.370> they<00:02:52.760> get<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:52.910> little

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
lanes there there and they get a little

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.699 
lanes there there and they get a little
flaky<00:02:53.329> sometimes<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.110> guy<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.380> goes<00:02:54.470> down

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
flaky sometimes the guy that goes down

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.210 
flaky sometimes the guy that goes down
and<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.010> has<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.250> better<00:02:55.489> shot<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:57.220> Baker

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
and in has the better shot then Baker

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.710 
and in has the better shot then Baker

an<00:03:16.010> awful<00:03:16.310> big<00:03:16.459> hurry<00:03:16.489> well<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:17.390> kind<00:03:17.510> of

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
an awful big hurry well it's kind of

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.270 
an awful big hurry well it's kind of
amazing<00:03:17.750> too<00:03:18.110> with<00:03:18.290> Baker<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.650> probably<00:03:19.010> his

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
amazing too with Baker I probably his

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.370 
amazing too with Baker I probably his
biggest<00:03:19.880> asset<00:03:20.359> is<00:03:20.420> his<00:03:20.540> ability<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.079> change

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
biggest asset is his ability to change

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.349 
biggest asset is his ability to change
speeds<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.340> think<00:03:22.579> with<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.850> bowling<00:03:23.180> ball<00:03:23.209> and

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
speeds I think with the bowling ball and

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.789 
speeds I think with the bowling ball and
you<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.600> see<00:03:23.750> how<00:03:23.870> slow<00:03:24.200> he's<00:03:24.350> throwing<00:03:24.620> he's

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
you can see how slow he's throwing he's

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.050 
you can see how slow he's throwing he's
trying<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.100> get<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.280> ball<00:03:25.400> dog<00:03:25.609> back<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.030> just

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
trying to get the ball dog back it just

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.160
