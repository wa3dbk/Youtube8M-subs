just<00:05:40.760> too<00:05:40.970> much<00:05:41.150> chaos<00:05:41.570> for<00:05:41.810> that<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.110> actually

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
just too much chaos for that to actually

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.680 
just too much chaos for that to actually
work<00:05:42.740> for<00:05:43.639> players<00:05:43.849> like<00:05:44.090> that<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.360> would

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
work for players like that I would

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.839 
work for players like that I would
recommend<00:05:45.020> playing<00:05:45.740> with<00:05:46.159> a<00:05:46.400> much<00:05:46.669> smaller

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
recommend playing with a much smaller

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.570 
recommend playing with a much smaller
group<00:05:47.169> if<00:05:48.169> you've<00:05:48.320> got<00:05:48.500> between<00:05:48.740> two<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:49.340> five

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
group if you've got between two and five

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.850 
group if you've got between two and five
players<00:05:50.090> there's<00:05:50.570> enough<00:05:51.050> information<00:05:51.349> out

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
players there's enough information out

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.430 
players there's enough information out
there<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:52.490> there's<00:05:52.970> little<00:05:53.630> enough<00:05:53.900> action

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
there and there's little enough action

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.469 
there and there's little enough action
that<00:05:55.009> you<00:05:55.130> can<00:05:55.280> still<00:05:55.550> treat<00:05:55.849> this<00:05:56.000> as<00:05:56.210> much

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
that you can still treat this as much

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.810 
that you can still treat this as much
more<00:05:56.780> of<00:05:56.870> a<00:05:56.960> deduction<00:05:57.380> game<00:05:57.560> now<00:05:58.550> I

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
more of a deduction game now I

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.510 
more of a deduction game now I
absolutely<00:05:59.210> love<00:06:00.199> the<00:06:00.710> chaos<00:06:01.009> I<00:06:01.190> think<00:06:01.340> that's

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
absolutely love the chaos I think that's

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.730 
absolutely love the chaos I think that's
where<00:06:01.669> masquerade<00:06:02.150> really<00:06:02.539> shines<00:06:02.840> this<00:06:03.530> is

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
where masquerade really shines this is

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.320 
where masquerade really shines this is
supposed<00:06:04.159> to<00:06:04.340> be<00:06:04.430> crazy<00:06:04.610> this<00:06:04.880> is<00:06:04.940> supposed<00:06:05.270> to

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
supposed to be crazy this is supposed to

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.640 
supposed to be crazy this is supposed to
be<00:06:05.389> chaotic<00:06:05.690> you're<00:06:05.960> supposed<00:06:06.229> to<00:06:06.380> forget

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
be chaotic you're supposed to forget

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.920 
be chaotic you're supposed to forget
what's<00:06:06.889> going<00:06:07.190> on<00:06:07.400> some<00:06:08.240> of<00:06:08.270> the<00:06:08.389> best<00:06:08.630> moments

what's going on some of the best moments
in<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.440> game<00:06:09.470> are<00:06:09.919> if<00:06:10.009> somebody<00:06:10.340> is

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
in the game are if somebody is

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.550 
in the game are if somebody is
absolutely<00:06:11.240> convinced<00:06:11.990> that<00:06:12.080> they<00:06:12.320> have<00:06:12.530> a

face it really does have this great kind
of<00:06:22.310> carnivalesque<00:06:23.060> party<00:06:23.570> atmosphere<00:06:23.780> and

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
of carnivalesque party atmosphere and

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.240 
of carnivalesque party atmosphere and
it's<00:06:25.370> a<00:06:25.550> huge<00:06:26.180> amount<00:06:26.630> of<00:06:26.810> fun<00:06:26.990> to<00:06:27.199> play<00:06:27.380> with

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
it's a huge amount of fun to play with

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.800 
it's a huge amount of fun to play with
all<00:06:28.430> of<00:06:28.550> that<00:06:28.699> randomness<00:06:29.060> there<00:06:29.330> is<00:06:29.479> also

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
all of that randomness there is also

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.749 
all of that randomness there is also
some<00:06:30.259> good<00:06:30.500> tactical<00:06:31.009> decision-making<00:06:31.550> that

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
some good tactical decision-making that

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.339 
some good tactical decision-making that
happens<00:06:32.150> just<00:06:32.479> because<00:06:32.960> it's<00:06:33.080> chaotic

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
happens just because it's chaotic

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.810 
happens just because it's chaotic
doesn't<00:06:33.830> mean<00:06:33.979> that<00:06:34.159> it's<00:06:34.310> bereft<00:06:34.639> of

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
doesn't mean that it's bereft of

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.100 
doesn't mean that it's bereft of
strategy<00:06:35.360> and

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
strategy and

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.200 
strategy and
are<00:06:36.230> some<00:06:36.470> really<00:06:36.770> interesting<00:06:36.950> ways<00:06:37.670> to<00:06:37.700> use

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
are some really interesting ways to use

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.330 
are some really interesting ways to use
the<00:06:38.390> different<00:06:38.690> character<00:06:39.110> roles<00:06:39.320> not<00:06:39.980> only

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
the different character roles not only

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.900 
the different character roles not only
to<00:06:40.490> get<00:06:40.610> you<00:06:40.730> closer<00:06:40.970> to<00:06:41.210> victory<00:06:41.330> but<00:06:42.260> also<00:06:42.500> to

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
to get you closer to victory but also to

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.280 
to get you closer to victory but also to
force<00:06:43.910> the<00:06:44.090> other<00:06:44.120> players<00:06:44.630> into<00:06:44.990> making

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
force the other players into making

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.710 
force the other players into making
certain<00:06:45.500> decisions<00:06:46.130> force<00:06:47.000> them<00:06:47.240> in<00:06:47.480> to

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
certain decisions force them in to

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.950 
certain decisions force them in to
reveal<00:06:47.990> their<00:06:48.230> cards<00:06:49.000> you<00:06:50.000> might<00:06:50.150> even<00:06:50.420> kind

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
reveal their cards you might even kind

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.660 
reveal their cards you might even kind
of<00:06:51.050> torpedo<00:06:51.530> your<00:06:51.710> chances<00:06:52.160> of<00:06:52.280> using<00:06:52.580> an

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 
of torpedo your chances of using an

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.580 
of torpedo your chances of using an
action<00:06:53.060> to<00:06:53.210> try<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.480> force<00:06:53.750> other<00:06:53.990> people<00:06:54.380> into

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
action to try to force other people into

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.020 
action to try to force other people into
revealing<00:06:54.800> if<00:06:55.100> they<00:06:55.220> think<00:06:55.280> they<00:06:55.670> have<00:06:55.850> that

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
revealing if they think they have that

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.760 
revealing if they think they have that
if<00:06:56.270> you<00:06:56.390> think<00:06:56.630> they<00:06:56.810> have<00:06:57.020> a<00:06:57.050> particular<00:06:57.260> card

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
if you think they have a particular card

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.890 
if you think they have a particular card
so<00:06:58.460> there's<00:06:58.640> some<00:06:58.820> really<00:06:59.090> interesting<00:06:59.240> kind

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
so there's some really interesting kind

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.870 
so there's some really interesting kind
of<00:07:00.050> social<00:07:00.620> manipulation<00:07:00.950> that<00:07:01.460> can<00:07:01.580> happen

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
of social manipulation that can happen

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.400 
of social manipulation that can happen
in<00:07:01.970> this<00:07:02.090> game<00:07:02.150> and<00:07:02.630> it<00:07:02.990> works<00:07:03.200> incredibly

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
in this game and it works incredibly

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.610 
in this game and it works incredibly
well<00:07:04.070> at<00:07:04.250> that<00:07:04.280> level
