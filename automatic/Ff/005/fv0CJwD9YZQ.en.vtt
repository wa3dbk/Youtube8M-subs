00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
realistic in for 2 12 13 is really

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.450 
realistic in for 2 12 13 is really
because<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.720> think<00:01:34.900> by<00:01:34.990> 13<00:01:35.380> 14<00:01:35.770> it's<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.220> little

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
because I think by 13 14 it's a little

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.890 
because I think by 13 14 it's a little
harder<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.940> get<00:01:37.090> them<00:01:37.270> onto<00:01:37.420> something<00:01:37.780> like

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
harder to get them onto something like

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.780 
harder to get them onto something like
this<00:01:38.020> but<00:01:38.200> again<00:01:38.440> it's<00:01:38.620> the<00:01:39.430> other<00:01:39.549> thing<00:01:39.760> that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
this but again it's the other thing that

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.940 
this but again it's the other thing that
we<00:01:39.970> do<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.120> applications<00:01:41.110> so<00:01:41.470> whatever

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
we do is applications so whatever

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.890 
we do is applications so whatever
applications<00:01:42.880> you've<00:01:43.000> downloaded<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.870> can

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
applications you've downloaded you can
