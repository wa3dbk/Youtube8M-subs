00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.790 

so<00:00:39.280> I<00:00:39.310> will<00:00:39.640> try<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:39.970> maybe<00:00:40.240> swap<00:00:40.750> it<00:00:40.870> over<00:00:40.900> for

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.290 

single-screen<00:00:44.800> I'm<00:00:45.430> not<00:00:45.640> sure<00:00:45.820> how<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.030> game

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
single-screen I'm not sure how the game

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.720 
single-screen I'm not sure how the game
plays<00:00:46.540> other<00:00:47.410> than<00:00:47.680> it's<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.950> sort<00:00:48.220> of<00:00:48.250> party

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730

style<00:00:49.030> game<00:00:49.300> so<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:50.290> I'd<00:00:50.410> leave<00:00:50.560> both<00:00:51.160> screens

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
style game so so I'd leave both screens

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
style game so so I'd leave both screens
on<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:52.030> start<00:00:52.330> with<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.660> see<00:00:52.780> how<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:52.960> goes
