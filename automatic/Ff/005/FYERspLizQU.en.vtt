00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.070

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.210
 Pushkin 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.619
 and even that is not all but in general a piece is not 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.170
 certainly not small but normal if 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.390
 you could not learn a fable for me both are worth 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.559
 and poem bytovuhi must learn 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.530
 I definitely hope everyone learned it 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.960
 and in your silence, okay, I'll start 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.690
 ask by magazine 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.199

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:46.649
 the desire to learn what you have 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.820
 Now transplanted do not have to please anyone 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.799

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.910

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.349
