00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.890
 well we'll see how to see the polarity 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.590
 inside the trainer to proceed to 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.730
 place the points yes I am very 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.480
 necessary to do our 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.480
 configurations 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.190
 in what are our systems 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.190
 three-phase 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.590
 so let's see how the 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.800
 test we take an exit phase and a 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.800
 of entry 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.129
 the input coil we are going to 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:38.920
 feed here with alternating voltage 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.040
 we're going to short-circuit both the output 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.560
 as our entrance 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.350
 and we will place a multimeter 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.739
 in the part 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.630
 lower of the coils then if this 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.210
 voltage would come to be 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.440
 greater than the voltage that we are feeding 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.840
 the first coil if the primary coil 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.270
 then it means that this voltage is 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.800
 has added up with the output voltage is 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.800
 say we are in this mesh no 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.110
 then we would have here less more and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.220
 so that he would join us here we would have 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.930
 - more than what we have here in 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.130
 correct additive polarity this tie is 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.340
 sum 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.850
 then place the points in the sign 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.909
 positive 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.010
 Right 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.710
 now if the multimeter tells you what 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.320
 the voltage is lower than you are 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.780
 feeding the primary then 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.450
 means that it has been subtracted in the 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.240
 secondary 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.240
 and you receive to have less more and here 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.729
 you would have more less to be of the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.679
 subtraction in this tie is what you have 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.740
 here no less more and more less so that 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.750
 give the subtraction and also place the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 points in the signs 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.230
 positives 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.970
 this would be a way to place then 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.650
 let's see how this affects our 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.700
 3-phase configurations 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.700
 as with this 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.060
 with the right law here we have a law 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.370
 it's zero we're not going to see how we can see 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.730
 we have less more 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.730
 and here too - more that is to say that we have 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.790
 the most at the exit and the most at the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.140
 correct entry then they would be in 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.580
 phase 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.430
 have then here we have 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.120
 in the primary and secondary they give 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 anthony 0 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.440
 now 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.380
 here we have 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.880
 and if we are going to change 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.370
 of the polarity its tractive if still 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.150
 additive as we can see here in the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.020
 first we have the points in it 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.920
 site 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.520
 that comes to be its tractiva we do not take out 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.910
 the 70 now if we do it with the 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.620
 additive polarity then we will have to change 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.620
 the secondary point 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.810
 as we can see here are both up 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.190
 here we are going to change the secondary one what 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.190
 let's locate below 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.050
 then here we are going to have 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:49.890
 - more than here we are going to have 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.330
 - more that is, this voltage will give us 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.380
 negative 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:59.870
 if with a phase shift of 180 with respect 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:03.470
 to here and here we have down 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.379
 then from here we have traveled six 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.680
 times the 30 degrees until you get to this 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.680
 position 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:17.950
 that's why here we have the breast 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.070
 is going to give a arrive 6 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.460
 correct and so you can do with all 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.130
 the configurations 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.130
 that is, we can do it 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.750
 assuming a polarity its tractiva 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.920
 we can take out 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.920
 what are certain configurations 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.740
 yes and to find the others 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:48.659
 configurations because you change it to 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.900
 secondary what would come to be the 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:54.949
 polarization to get all the 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.949
 possible configurations
