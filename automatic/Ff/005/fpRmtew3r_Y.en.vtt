00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.090
 of what Uruguayan made the next rival 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 of the Argentine team on Tuesday very 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.450
 well to play in the serene is going to be 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.880
 also transition of the public tv more 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.880
 late from 8:30 pm from jamaica 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.880
 Jamaican 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.880
 well OK 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.560
 not that sure away is that four 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.560
 years was considered 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.280
 Uruguay as always very well 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.750
 in the configuration 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:18.369
 javier earlier and the worst thing that you 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:21.880
 it can be good that the worst thing that has 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:26.310
 problems in attack with the output of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.310
 suárez does not have 5 suárez manos 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.540
 earning 15 worried ways 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.340
 no longer has that Uruguay that stood out 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.369
 in South Africa is a rich is not formed 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.110
 Our Suarez has been changing no no no 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.560
 is the mad abreu or in the bank as 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.880
 other times it has an important spare part 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.970
 the flexion in the essence in the essence 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.940
 soccer fan of them what they tell you 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.590
 basically all the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.000
 spiritual strengths if we talk in 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.209
 some time there was talk of character to 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.880
 who programs if going to play a game 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.480
 match against uruguay on stay is 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.480
 it is 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.610
 politically I think someone has 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.100
 more but to an area to bolivia the character 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.230
 and bolivia the smart game you 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.090
 fed up with what you feel that Paraguay was 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.640
 a smart game so that it could 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:40.770
 observe 5-1 the smart backpack in 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:49.160
 the 21 56 but the Paraguayan said it 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.160
 I refer to Paraguay and Uruguay 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.970
 the story I liked the comparison 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.570
 makes the jocón of the grain a local team 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.620
 that is a difficult team but never and 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.900
 Uruguay Bazaars of Belgrano de Córdoba 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.270
 water I do not know crosier going through is not going to 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.440
 fight like crazy like lions every ball 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:18.290
 as standing 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.940
 and feel inferior by saying I have less 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.390
 then I play the smart match the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.390
 tie 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.370
 how to say mario is smart or not 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.640
 that a coach has the ability 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.170
 to make a change that leads to 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.480
 tracing the score I think 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.860
 smart on your part and I think 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.600
 smart on behalf of the players of 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.430
 know how to drive but that's an analysis 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.350
 football we can analyze and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.970
 say ramón díaz hit when he put 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.640
 the two centers and it complicated Argentina 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.780
 martino was wrong when he put that on 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.780
 It is an intelligent analysis 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.680
 because you look four parts are missing 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.680
 four days for the match 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.160
 and now 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.780
 we give a big kiss to uruguay because 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.910
 they see us live 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.420
 uruguay brothers we want many more 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.420
 we 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.219
 and we reached the end we found the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.539
 next day Saturday us in terms 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:49.150
 of the match between Argentina and Jamaica 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.680
 there today's special simile we're going to be 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.680
 whole have allowed thanks to all
