00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
something wrong with you maybe I'm

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.070 
something wrong with you maybe I'm
socially<00:07:28.960> something<00:07:30.660> so<00:07:31.660> that<00:07:31.690> makes<00:07:31.960> you

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
socially something so that makes you

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.480 
socially something so that makes you
less<00:07:32.230> human<00:07:32.620> in<00:07:32.710> your<00:07:32.860> opinion<00:07:33.220> I<00:07:33.310> guess

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490 
less human in your opinion I guess

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.340 
less human in your opinion I guess
because<00:07:34.180> you're<00:07:34.360> not<00:07:34.480> as<00:07:34.630> developed<00:07:34.810> as<00:07:35.200> the

because you're not as developed as the

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.880 
because you're not as developed as the
next<00:07:35.590> guy<00:07:35.770> but<00:07:37.110> you<00:07:38.110> already<00:07:38.230> realized<00:07:38.710> that's

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:38.890 
next guy but you already realized that's

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.550 
next guy but you already realized that's
a<00:07:38.980> bad<00:07:39.130> argument<00:07:39.340> I<00:07:40.240> bet<00:07:40.810> you<00:07:40.960> keep<00:07:41.140> using<00:07:41.350> it

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 
a bad argument I bet you keep using it

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.350
