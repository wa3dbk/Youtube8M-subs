00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
but it is quite complicated so if that

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.599 
but it is quite complicated so if that
doesn't<00:00:42.469> work<00:00:42.530> out<00:00:42.739> I<00:00:42.890> might<00:00:43.100> as<00:00:43.249> well<00:00:43.399> just

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609

doesn't work out I might as well just

we're<00:01:01.339> going<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.489> create<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.940> triangular<00:01:02.629> shape

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
we're going to create a triangular shape

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.350 
we're going to create a triangular shape
and<00:01:03.109> it's<00:01:03.499> going<00:01:03.679> to<00:01:03.739> be<00:01:03.859> 1<00:01:04.489> 2<00:01:05.390> 3<00:01:05.690> &amp;<00:01:06.680> 4<00:01:07.370> then<00:01:08.150> the

and it's going to be 1 2 3 &amp; 4 then the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.010 
and it's going to be 1 2 3 &amp; 4 then the
exact<00:01:08.630> same<00:01:08.810> thing<00:01:09.080> just<00:01:09.650> going<00:01:10.010> down<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.869> I'm

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.969 

so<00:01:34.390> make<00:01:34.570> sure<00:01:34.600> you've<00:01:34.900> copied<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.770> build

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
so make sure you've copied the build

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.910 
so make sure you've copied the build
just<00:01:36.520> as<00:01:36.670> you<00:01:36.940> see<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.409> now<00:01:41.590> we're<00:01:41.710> going<00:01:41.830> to

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
just as you see it so now we're going to

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
grab some cobblestone and build the

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.990 
grab some cobblestone and build the
inner<00:01:43.990> wall<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:45.340> do<00:01:45.460> this<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:45.759> want<00:01:45.880> to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
inner wall and to do this you want to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.649 
inner wall and to do this you want to
leave<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.330> two-block<00:01:46.840> gap<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.590> front<00:01:51.659> we're

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
leave a two-block gap of the front we're

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.270 
leave a two-block gap of the front we're
also<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.080> grab<00:01:53.259> some<00:01:53.470> oak<00:01:53.619> wood<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.100> add

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
also going to grab some oak wood and add

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.430 
also going to grab some oak wood and add
some<00:01:54.549> extra<00:01:54.700> detail<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.930> remove<00:01:56.170> these

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
some extra detail so just remove these

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.560 
some extra detail so just remove these
blocks<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.399> that's<00:01:57.640> exactly<00:01:58.180> what<00:01:58.509> you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
blocks and that's exactly what you

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.779 
blocks and that's exactly what you
should<00:01:58.720> end<00:01:58.869> up<00:01:59.080> with<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.740> again<00:02:00.039> two<00:02:00.520> blocks

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
should end up with so again two blocks

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.060 
should end up with so again two blocks
off<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.030> front<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:02.050> exact<00:02:02.410> same<00:02:02.619> thing<00:02:02.890> goes

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
off the front the exact same thing goes

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.490 
off the front the exact same thing goes
for<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.399> other<00:02:03.429> side<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.360> let's<00:02:04.899> go<00:02:05.140> ahead<00:02:05.259> and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
for the other side so let's go ahead and

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:19.130 
for the other side so let's go ahead and
do<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.770> now

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.970 

so<00:02:20.140> we're<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> remove<00:02:20.560> these<00:02:20.920> two

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
so we're going to remove these two

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.160 
so we're going to remove these two
blocks<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.700> place<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.330> door<00:02:22.660> then<00:02:22.930> grab<00:02:23.140> some

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
blocks and place a door then grab some

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.560 
blocks and place a door then grab some
fence<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.830> fill<00:02:24.010> up<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.280> sidewall<00:02:24.850> ignoring

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
fence to fill up the sidewall ignoring

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.110 
fence to fill up the sidewall ignoring
the<00:02:25.660> two<00:02:25.870> blocks<00:02:26.140> right<00:02:26.350> here<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.640> exact<00:02:27.940> same

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the two blocks right here the exact same

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.820 
the two blocks right here the exact same
thing<00:02:28.360> goes<00:02:28.570> for<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.870> other<00:02:28.900> side<00:02:29.350> but<00:02:29.650> of

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
thing goes for the other side but of

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.560 
thing goes for the other side but of
course<00:02:30.220> instead<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.610> adding<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.940> door<00:02:31.120> we're

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
course instead of adding a door we're

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.690

go for a half slab floor or a full block
floor<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.150> half<00:03:43.480> staff<00:03:43.720> version<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.100 
you get a lot more space but I haven't
really<00:03:48.760> bothered<00:03:49.060> too<00:03:49.300> much<00:03:49.480> as<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:49.930> see

really bothered too much as you can see
now<00:03:50.800> for<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:51.220> full<00:03:52.030> block<00:03:52.239> version<00:03:52.599> exact

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
now for the full block version exact

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.540 
now for the full block version exact
same<00:03:53.319> thing<00:03:53.590> I'll<00:03:53.739> try<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.010> make<00:03:54.160> things<00:03:54.400> look

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550

same thing I'll try to make things look
a<00:03:54.730> lot<00:03:54.940> more<00:03:55.060> interesting<00:03:55.599> in<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.840> new

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
a lot more interesting in this new

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.050 
a lot more interesting in this new
version<00:03:56.319> but<00:03:57.099> this<00:03:57.190> is<00:03:57.340> just<00:03:57.489> roughly<00:03:57.880> what

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
version but this is just roughly what

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.759 
version but this is just roughly what
it's<00:03:58.180> going<00:03:58.299> to<00:03:58.420> look<00:03:58.510> like<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.739> first
