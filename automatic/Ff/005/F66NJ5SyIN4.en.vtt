00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
the last post here or this one but I

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.940 
the last post here or this one but I
didn't<00:03:30.680> want<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:31.480> start<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.900> cut<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.739> cage

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
didn't want to start to cut the cage

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.830 
didn't want to start to cut the cage
because<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.459> thing<00:03:34.670> is<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.060> cage<00:03:35.299> was<00:03:35.569> made

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
because the thing is the cage was made

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.059 
because the thing is the cage was made
that<00:03:36.109> way<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.190> rigid<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.819> tough<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.620> I've

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
that way so it's rigid and tough so I've

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.640 
that way so it's rigid and tough so I've
