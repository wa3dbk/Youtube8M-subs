when<00:00:00.840> you<00:00:00.960> drop<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.230> stitch<00:00:01.589> while<00:00:01.770> you're

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
when you drop a stitch while you're

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.430 
when you drop a stitch while you're
knitting<00:00:02.129> this<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.120> what<00:00:03.270> it<00:00:03.389> looks<00:00:03.570> like<00:00:03.720> so

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
knitting this is what it looks like so

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
knitting this is what it looks like so
accidentally<00:00:04.859> it<00:00:04.980> falls<00:00:05.250> off<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.660> pulls

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
accidentally it falls off and it pulls

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.190 
accidentally it falls off and it pulls
and<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:09.090> creates<00:00:09.389> these<00:00:09.480> little<00:00:09.540> ladders<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
and it creates these little ladders and

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.299 
and it creates these little ladders and
you've<00:00:10.320> got<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> stitch<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.740> looks<00:00:10.860> like<00:00:11.099> that

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
you've got a stitch that looks like that

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.600 
you've got a stitch that looks like that
so<00:00:11.940> first<00:00:12.509> what<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.170> would<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.889> take<00:00:14.370> some

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
so first what I would do is take some

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.240 
so first what I would do is take some
sort<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> marker<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.619> grab<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.890> stitch

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
sort of a marker and grab that stitch

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.630 
sort of a marker and grab that stitch
just<00:00:17.869> put<00:00:18.869> something<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.680> there<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
just put something in there so that it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.279 
just put something in there so that it
doesn't<00:00:20.850> keep<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.869> now<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> can't

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
doesn't keep going so now it can't

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130 
doesn't keep going so now it can't
continue<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.859> fall<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.750> just<00:00:24.750> grab<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
continue to fall out so just grab the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.570 
continue to fall out so just grab the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
all right so take this stitch and put

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600 
all right so take this stitch and put
your<00:00:52.020> left<00:00:52.260> hand<00:00:52.469> needle<00:00:52.559> through<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.980> just

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
your left hand needle through it just

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.939 
your left hand needle through it just
anyway<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.649> turn<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
anyway just to get it and then turn it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
anyway just to get it and then turn it
so<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.489> facing<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.910> right<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.440> like

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
so that it's facing the right way like

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
so that it's facing the right way like
this<00:00:58.649> where<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> left<00:00:59.399> needle<00:00:59.579> goes<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.940> from

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
this where the left needle goes in from

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
this where the left needle goes in from
the<00:01:00.239> front<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.809> back<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> stitch<00:01:01.609> so

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the front to the back of the stitch so

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.860 
the front to the back of the stitch so
now<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.149> needle<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.660> way

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
now it's on your needle the right way

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.050 
now it's on your needle the right way
