00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.570
 my name is christian eugster i am 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.599
 diploma engineer and at vkw the father 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.359
 power plants project manager for smart city 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.119
 Rheintal The Rhine Valley is dense 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.490
 populated region vorarlberg and smart 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.410
 City of Rheintal has several focal points 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 and a focus of smart city 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.019
 finally this virtual power plant is there 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.090
 It's about generating energy 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.739
 and energy requirements that are the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.059
 Consumers in the electric power nothing 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.550
 that we get the best possible each other 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.100
 we started with the vote 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.379
 Electric vehicles we operate one of the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.710
 biggest electric vehicle kloten in europe 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.890
 and the idea is together with bosch 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.320
 these batteries of these vehicles as 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.289
 to use energy storage for electricity 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.160
 the vehicles learn the user behavior 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.660
 know 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.239
 that means the vehicles or the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.039
 algorithm in the background the vpp knows 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.619
 when will the vehicles usually be 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.270
 used and in those times in those 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.680
 the vehicle is not used and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.850
 the vehicle at the power grid 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.460
 it can be loaded 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.030
 smart city rheintal applications in 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.130
 living area when smart home smart 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.470
 client so we turn here for 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.119
 heat pumps boiler that is distant 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.530
 Pumps are electrically operated and 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.490
 hot water boiler the electric 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.040
 operate 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.440
 They can be just like car batteries too 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.119
 or shut off one of the whole 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.920
 important things in this project is 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.640
 bosch bosch will be together with us in the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.229
 project all this electrical 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.569
 consumers over a vp with each other 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.850
 connect the regenerative 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.280
 Production plants are in such a way 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.490
 bundled-called virtual power plant 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.020
 we sum up all generation data and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.509
 all newspaper services 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.759
 It happens then practically together 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.520
 and about the software then becomes 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.740
 Check out how the questions look 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.810
 if there is too little demand 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.500
 consumers additionally in the net 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.590
 switched 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 that's mainly in our case 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.360
 vehicle battery in ours 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.549
 electric vehicles 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.130
 but we also have an external one 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.680
 Battery storage from already used 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.460
 We also built vehicle batteries 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.260
 integrated into the virtual power plant with 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.020
 in a further consequence we want that 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.720
 virtual power plant in a regular 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.570
 start operation that is to say begin 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.880
 here with the vkw in the location bregenz the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.790
 Vehicles controlled to load 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.210
 about the offer of the photovoltaic system 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.190
 together with the software ag then you 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.600
 offer and demand 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.910
 for me personally are the 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.400
 developments around this virtual 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.810
 Power plant systems a very very 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.480
 important step towards energy 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.950
 autonomy in the direction of energy transition 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.350
 is important to be in the future 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.270
 to store electrical energy 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.250
 at the time it is generated 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.930
 we are a very big vehicle batteries 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.760
 important building block in the future 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.040
 energy networks when it comes to 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.090
 Energy storage in batteries 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.090
 for example, go
