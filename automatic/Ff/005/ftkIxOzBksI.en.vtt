00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.510
 how are we friends with the pilot 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.940
 mexican gustavo vildósola gustavo 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.509
 start is an excellent second year to 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.520
 the pair that we had always been able to 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.170
 advance that is a career that has 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.320
 a little bit everything has streams has 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
 fast sections and two bad sections 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.289
 it's a good test especially when 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.840
 beginning of the year for a pilot to 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.359
 vehicle then this one does not have a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.369
 opportunity to go back there successful guy 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 from the second place they beat us by 10 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.290
 seconds and we know we have to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.479
 improve and that we apply and now 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.629
 we come on film we see a new 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:44.790
 design today in your car if we did 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.000
 a negotiation with red bull where I 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.920
 I'm still a red bull athlete 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.690
 but we no longer bring red bull logos 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 in the vehicle which allows us 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.850
 sell the rest of the vehicle to others 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.949
 sponsors to the Christ point this 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.839
 year we're going to run seven races from 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.920
 the 2007 I want with the piece and never 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.350
 we had run in seven races 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.240
 then it was something positive for the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.740
 bulls and formed for infinity to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.240
 me and for all 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.950
 what do you think about the changes that are 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.229
 doing in the last hour of the route 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.630
 for charging today 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.430
 while they are stopped for all 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.560
 no no it's not a very big effect what 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 only thing that will not hurt is that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 is stronger to the track they are going to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.530
 remove miles by ripping cleaned 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 we are clear we need to be able 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.600
 recovering places is the only thing that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 get is it also did not show a little 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.710
 annoying we can understand if you can not 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.369
 upload exam can not be used 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 they had to know what they had to 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.619
 do a few moments ago practicing with 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.030
 robby gordon of him pressed that the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.399
 problem that there was not a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.069
 classification and unfortunately the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.580
 faster sometimes it starts further back and 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.500
 they put many novice pilots in front 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.590
 what do you think about it where they made them 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 little disappointed with that here in 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.490
 choose because we started and we said that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.899
 We were going to have a qualification in all 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.539
 squad races suddenly say 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.860
 that the san felipe 250 do not put us in 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.060
 clear when we know we can 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.429
 start the first 3 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.410
 for the very bad position as the fifth 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.440
 for putting our big teams and not 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.660
 came alone because it was not the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.319
 possibility of winning reduces us the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.870
 pressures very much to give but 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.230
 it's something he explained to me one explained 34 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.230
 times 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.719
 not for this business it qualifies all 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:34.859
 race one but and 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.689
 good organizations that excess is you 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.389
 reflects how consistent they are and score 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.099
 here he taught that they are not very consistent 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.989
 regarding that strategy change 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.659
 we are implementing then pal 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.730
 today looking from the beginning only 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.760
 we have to be very aggressive because 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.590
 our starting position right now with 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.139
 the shortest track thanks to the use of a 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.299
 little bit larger which will reduce the 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.889
 dust then this one hosted the same no 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.919
 is to try to advance as soon as 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:04.560
 possible we bring to approximately 19 of 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.000
 cars in front of us right now 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.939
 let's move on from happening to the most 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.379
 possible as soon as possible also 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.209
 chatting with gaby 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.219
 we talk about racing today very 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.629
 famous stadium and mentioned that it is 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.780
 the future of the web 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.970
 when we will see to look for in a case by 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.540
 example decisions 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.540
 stadiums 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.360
 we have always seen as an avenue 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.590
 to get sponsorships because because 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.870
 has good television crops 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.330
 good stands have everything that was 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.180
 involved in business the family and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.730
 this year I got a lot more involved 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.970
 contest with an organization change 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.680
 that we had, I do not have time to do 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.330
 time for seven races a year as 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.430
 this year I'm finding it very 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.080
 difficult much less go to run stadium 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.080
 was running luca on other things 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.790
 unfortunately and to the heights not of 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.670
 our origin and in my age and my career 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.040
 and since this is no longer possible very well 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.100
 year we saw a team from los cabos mexico 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.720
 canadian putting the dakar family 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.910
 mendoza would one day be interested in 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.950
 Running the Dakar is one of the challenges that 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.140
 We can give following for 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.989
 vildósola zinc as possible if you 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.150
 affects a sponsor is required 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.830
 it requires several little things that we 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.169
 We wanted to run the letter does not 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.620
 tomorrow has happened to me maybe entered into a 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.850
