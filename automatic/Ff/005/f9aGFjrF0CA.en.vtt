atcs 840 now this case is enormous you
might<00:00:08.849> think<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.090> picture<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.840> looks<00:00:10.019> tiny

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
might think the picture it looks tiny

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.640 
might think the picture it looks tiny
but<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.849> seen<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.540> video<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:12.960> quite<00:00:13.349> big

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
but I seen it in a video it's quite big

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.560 
but I seen it in a video it's quite big
and<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.549> could<00:00:14.670> be<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.790> downside<00:00:14.969> or<00:00:15.420> there

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
and it could be a downside or there

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.890 
and it could be a downside or there
could<00:00:15.660> be<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.809> pro<00:00:16.230> now<00:00:17.240> these<00:00:18.240> little<00:00:18.690> drive

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
could be a pro now these little drive

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.099 
could be a pro now these little drive
base<00:00:19.170> or<00:00:19.800> hard<00:00:20.460> drive<00:00:20.520> bays<00:00:20.930> there<00:00:21.930> are<00:00:21.990> two

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
base or hard drive bays there are two

base or hard drive bays there are two
lists<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.949> take<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.850> swing<00:00:24.269> it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
lists all you do is take it out swing it

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630 
lists all you do is take it out swing it
out<00:00:24.510> put<00:00:25.320> your<00:00:25.350> hard<00:00:25.590> drive<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> slide<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
out put your hard drive in and slide it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.000 
out put your hard drive in and slide it
back<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.660> that's<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.990> you're<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.289> set<00:00:28.650> you

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
back in and that's it you're all set you

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.690 
back in and that's it you're all set you
just<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.279> connect<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.730> from<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> back

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
just got to connect it from the back

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.370 
just got to connect it from the back
this<00:00:32.700> case<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.059> also<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.570> aluminum<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this case is also all aluminum the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.069 
this case is also all aluminum the
previous<00:00:34.890> case<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> antec<00:00:35.760> 1200<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.450> all

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
previous case the antec 1200 is all

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.069 
previous case the antec 1200 is all
steel<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:38.309> plastic<00:00:38.700> parts<00:00:38.870> this<00:00:39.870> one's

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
steel and some plastic parts this one's

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
steel and some plastic parts this one's
all<00:00:40.200> aluminum<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.820> simple<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
all aluminum it's very simple and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.709 
all aluminum it's very simple and
elegant<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.680> you're<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> Mac<00:00:44.370> user<00:00:44.719> you

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
elegant I think if you're a Mac user you

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.790 
elegant I think if you're a Mac user you
would<00:00:45.840> probably<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.260> case<00:00:46.590> because

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
would probably like this case because

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
would probably like this case because
there's<00:00:47.100> nothing<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.460> too<00:00:47.700> flashy<00:00:48.000> there's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
there's nothing like too flashy there's

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.380 
there's nothing like too flashy there's
no<00:00:48.780> window<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.680> plain<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.239> because

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
no window just a plain it's because

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.430 
no window just a plain it's because
aluminum<00:00:52.230> case<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.520> black<00:00:54.110> there's<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
aluminum case and it's black there's the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.119 
aluminum case and it's black there's the
drive<00:00:55.949> bays<00:00:56.190> are<00:00:56.570> also<00:00:57.570> two<00:00:58.199> lists<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.620> just

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
drive bays are also two lists or just

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.029 
drive bays are also two lists or just
push<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> button<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.879> you're<00:01:00.180> set<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.890> see

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
push a button and you're set you can see

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.189 
push a button and you're set you can see
a<00:01:02.070> cutout<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.850> here<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.960> putting

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
a cutout right here this is just putting

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.520 
a cutout right here this is just putting
back<00:01:04.500> back<00:01:04.890> plates<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.519> CPU<00:01:06.090> coolers<00:01:06.439> so<00:01:07.439> as

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
back back plates for CPU coolers so as

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.170 
back back plates for CPU coolers so as
you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.460> case<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.909> really

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
you can see this case is really

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.990 
you can see this case is really
functional<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.670> don't<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:11.790> they<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
functional I don't think they have a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.950 
functional I don't think they have a
picture<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:14.030> noted<00:01:15.030> them<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.780> top

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
picture of it but noted them on the top

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
picture of it but noted them on the top
of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> case<00:01:16.380> there's<00:01:16.920> two<00:01:17.369> vents<00:01:17.850> which<00:01:18.540> hold

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
of the case there's two vents which hold

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.429 
of the case there's two vents which hold
2<00:01:19.350> 230<00:01:20.130> millimeters<00:01:20.460> fans<00:01:20.930> which<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.140> quite

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
2 230 millimeters fans which are quite

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.700 
2 230 millimeters fans which are quite
big<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.250> they<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> lot<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> air<00:01:25.049> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
big and they take out a lot of air so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.590 
big and they take out a lot of air so
which<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.250> nice<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.509> in

you're<00:01:44.700> probably<00:01:44.880> wondering<00:01:45.210> what<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you're probably wondering what that is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.010 
you're probably wondering what that is
that's<00:01:45.689> also<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.439> i<00:01:46.680> remove<00:01:47.340> mo

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
that's also to do i remove mo

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
that's also to do i remove mo
motherboard<00:01:49.020> tray<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> nice<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
motherboard tray which is nice and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.960 
motherboard tray which is nice and
convenient<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> yeah<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:53.759> nice

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
convenient and yeah it's a pretty nice

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.600 
convenient and yeah it's a pretty nice
case<00:01:54.240> i<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.380> calm<00:01:55.560> comparable<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
case i think is calm comparable to the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.160 
case i think is calm comparable to the
mac<00:01:56.759> pro

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
mac pro

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020

front<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.490> last<00:02:02.490> case<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:04.229> most

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
front and the last case the most

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.059 
front and the last case the most
expensive<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.720> day<00:02:07.710> only<00:02:07.799> was

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
expensive one actually the day only was

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.919 
expensive one actually the day only was
a<00:02:08.099> little<00:02:08.340> more<00:02:08.459> expensive<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.209> case<00:02:09.450> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
a little more expensive but this case is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.290 
a little more expensive but this case is
kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.830> new<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.220> market<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.700> its

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
kind of new to the market but its

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.720 
kind of new to the market but its

about a 3 3 section or through cage

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.009 
about a 3 3 section or through cage
cooling<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.630> bottom<00:03:06.900> right

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
cooling so you have the bottom right

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.740 
cooling so you have the bottom right
here<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:08.430> middle<00:03:08.730> where<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.209> motherboard<00:03:09.630> is

and the hard drives in here you're

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.500 
and the hard drives in here you're
probably<00:03:13.530> thinking<00:03:13.709> only<00:03:14.370> has<00:03:14.609> one<00:03:14.880> two<00:03:15.180> three

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
probably thinking only has one two three

four<00:03:15.780> let<00:03:16.350> me<00:03:16.410> get<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> better<00:03:16.739> picture<00:03:17.660> let's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
four let me get a better picture let's

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.340 
four let me get a better picture let's
see<00:03:19.010> if<00:03:20.010> i<00:03:20.130> could<00:03:20.190> find<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.959> but<00:03:21.959> i<00:03:22.019> think<00:03:22.230> oh

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
see if i could find it but i think oh

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.190 
see if i could find it but i think oh
there's<00:03:22.560> only<00:03:22.709> four<00:03:23.010> hard<00:03:23.370> drives<00:03:23.780> well<00:03:24.780> not

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
there's only four hard drives well not

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.140 
there's only four hard drives well not
really<00:03:25.260> these<00:03:25.769> for<00:03:26.579> hard<00:03:26.760> drives<00:03:27.000> are

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
really these for hard drives are

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.630 
really these for hard drives are
hot-swappable<00:03:27.420> which<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.560> really<00:03:28.980> sweet<00:03:29.340> I

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
hot-swappable which is really sweet I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.789 
hot-swappable which is really sweet I
wish<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.359> mac<00:03:30.540> pro<00:03:30.750> had<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.079> simple<00:03:31.620> thing<00:03:31.769> like

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
wish the mac pro had a simple thing like

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.130 
wish the mac pro had a simple thing like
that<00:03:31.920> would<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:33.090> made<00:03:33.209> even<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.660> better<00:03:33.840> case

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
that would have made even a better case

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.590 
that would have made even a better case
of<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:35.100> putting<00:03:35.340> about<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.730> even<00:03:36.150> 22

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
of it just putting about like even 22
