00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
goes by much quicker now one thing to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.219 
goes by much quicker now one thing to
take<00:01:36.030> note<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.360> while<00:01:36.689> you're<00:01:36.840> collecting

dirt is to take these ones the dirt
blocks<00:01:39.900> rather<00:01:40.710> than<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.340> grass<00:01:41.549> blocks

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
blocks rather than the grass blocks

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.969 
blocks rather than the grass blocks
because<00:01:42.180> I'm<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:43.110> sure<00:01:43.259> how<00:01:43.409> many<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.799> but

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
because I'm not sure how many it is but

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.980 
because I'm not sure how many it is but
I'm<00:01:44.070> pretty<00:01:44.549> sure<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.270> least<00:01:45.540> point

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I'm pretty sure that it's at least point

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.039 
I'm pretty sure that it's at least point
one<00:01:46.259> or<00:01:46.470> point<00:01:46.710> two<00:01:46.920> extra<00:01:47.729> seconds<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
one or point two extra seconds just to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.960 
one or point two extra seconds just to
collect<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.619> grass<00:01:49.860> blocks<00:01:50.250> over<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.759> dirt

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
collect the grass blocks over the dirt

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.230 
collect the grass blocks over the dirt
so<00:01:51.450> yeah<00:01:51.930> definitely<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:53.250> it'll<00:01:53.610> add<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.909> so

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
so yeah definitely at it'll add up so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.050 
so yeah definitely at it'll add up so
yeah

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.220 

alright<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.360> let's<00:02:01.510> get<00:02:01.690> down<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.050> whole

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
alright so let's get down to the whole

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.680 
alright so let's get down to the whole
building<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.800> this<00:02:02.920> project<00:02:03.490> as<00:02:03.610> you<00:02:04.150> can<00:02:04.330> tell

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
building of this project as you can tell

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.050 
building of this project as you can tell
you<00:02:05.320> just<00:02:05.500> want<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.740> stack<00:02:06.010> up<00:02:06.220> straight<00:02:06.910> up

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
you just want to stack up straight up

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.359 
you just want to stack up straight up
into<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.330> air<00:02:07.450> as<00:02:07.810> high<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.680> can<00:02:08.710> well<00:02:09.220> not

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
into the air as high as you can well not

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.130 
into the air as high as you can well not
as<00:02:09.520> high<00:02:09.670> as<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:10.000> can<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.420> until<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.900> reach

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
as high as you can but until you reach

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.870 
as high as you can but until you reach
the<00:02:11.170> y-coordinate<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.960> 120<00:02:13.960> so<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:15.100> have<00:02:15.610> tons

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the y-coordinate of 120 so I have tons

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.630 
the y-coordinate of 120 so I have tons
of<00:02:15.970> dirt<00:02:16.210> so<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.540> can<00:02:16.780> go<00:02:16.960> straight<00:02:17.230> up<00:02:17.640> you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
of dirt so I can go straight up you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.280 
of dirt so I can go straight up you
might<00:02:18.790> need<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> lumberjack<00:02:19.630> if<00:02:19.840> you're<00:02:19.990> rushed

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
might need a lumberjack if you're rushed

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.330 
might need a lumberjack if you're rushed
but<00:02:20.680> not<00:02:21.340> for<00:02:21.550> me<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.420> I'm<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.680> stacking<00:02:23.950> up

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
but not for me so I'm just stacking up

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.000 
but not for me so I'm just stacking up
right<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.150> once<00:02:25.870> i<00:02:25.990> get<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.260> 120<00:02:26.710> then

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
right now and once i get to 120 then

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.090 
right now and once i get to 120 then
I'll<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.340> right<00:02:27.460> back<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:32.140> as<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.500> can<00:02:32.620> tell<00:02:32.680> my

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
I'll be right back so as you can tell my

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.970 
I'll be right back so as you can tell my
y<00:02:33.310> coordinate<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.910> at<00:02:34.150> 120<00:02:35.110> right<00:02:35.410> there<00:02:35.710> and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
y coordinate is at 120 right there and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.190 
y coordinate is at 120 right there and
so<00:02:36.760> now<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.060> can<00:02:37.360> start<00:02:37.450> building<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.960> platform

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
so now I can start building a platform

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.930 
so now I can start building a platform
you're<00:02:38.860> going<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.100> want<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.310> start<00:02:39.580> off<00:02:39.670> with<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
you're going to want to start off with a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.740 
you're going to want to start off with a
crosshair<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.320> three<00:02:41.770> art<00:02:42.130> for<00:02:42.880> three

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
crosshair that is three art for three

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.660 
crosshair that is three art for three
stack<00:02:44.410> three<00:02:44.770> away<00:02:44.980> from<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> center<00:02:45.640> i

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
stack three away from the center i

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.540 
stack three away from the center i
should<00:02:46.000> say<00:02:46.270> so<00:02:46.960> as<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.620> see<00:02:47.830> one<00:02:48.100> two

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
should say so as you can see one two

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.940 
should say so as you can see one two
three<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:51.760> go<00:02:51.880> over<00:02:52.000> here<00:02:52.240> one<00:02:52.600> two<00:02:53.260> three

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
three and we go over here one two three

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.400 
three and we go over here one two three
now<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:54.550> can<00:02:54.760> fill<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.210> middle<00:02:55.510> obviously

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
now you can fill in the middle obviously

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:13.040 
now you can fill in the middle obviously
to<00:02:56.800> make<00:02:56.980> your<00:02:57.420> platform

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.720 

after<00:03:13.590> you're<00:03:13.710> all<00:03:13.800> done<00:03:14.010> building<00:03:14.490> your

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
after you're all done building your

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.060 
after you're all done building your
platform<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:15.810> start<00:03:16.230> stacking<00:03:16.740> up<00:03:16.860> into

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
platform you can start stacking up into

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.130 
platform you can start stacking up into
the<00:03:17.190> air<00:03:17.220> until<00:03:17.550> you<00:03:18.120> reach<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.330> y-coordinate

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
the air until you reach the y-coordinate

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.430 
the air until you reach the y-coordinate
of<00:03:19.820> 128<00:03:21.050> so<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.470> got<00:03:22.800> 127<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:24.000> uh<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.390> forgot<00:03:24.900> that

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
of 128 so I got 127 but uh I forgot that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
of 128 so I got 127 but uh I forgot that
it's<00:03:25.620> 8<00:03:25.800> tall<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.640> order<00:03:26.850> not<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.300> injured

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it's 8 tall in order not to be injured

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.040 
it's 8 tall in order not to be injured
by<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.990> Thor<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.310> roof<00:03:29.850> here<00:03:30.330> will<00:03:30.600> make<00:03:30.930> it

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
by a Thor so this roof here will make it

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.960 
by a Thor so this roof here will make it
so<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.260> cannot<00:03:31.530> take<00:03:31.740> any<00:03:31.980> damage<00:03:32.190> from<00:03:32.460> a

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
so you cannot take any damage from a

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.020 
so you cannot take any damage from a
Thor<00:03:33.300> strikes<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:35.280> trace<00:03:35.610> along<00:03:35.820> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
Thor strikes so just trace along the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.710 
Thor strikes so just trace along the
platform<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.140> had<00:03:37.260> made<00:03:37.470> earlier<00:03:38.070> and

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
platform that you had made earlier and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.060 
platform that you had made earlier and
you're<00:03:39.720> obviously<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.530> want<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.860> fill

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
you're obviously going to want to fill

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.030 
you're obviously going to want to fill
it<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:41.370> otherwise<00:03:41.790> you're<00:03:42.690> stupid<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:43.710> yeah

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
it in otherwise you're stupid so yeah

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:56.980 
it in otherwise you're stupid so yeah
bareback

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.080 

okay<00:03:57.590> now<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:57.860> it's<00:03:58.130> all<00:03:58.280> filled<00:03:58.520> in<00:03:58.820> go

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
okay now that it's all filled in go

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.450 
okay now that it's all filled in go
ahead<00:03:59.360> and<00:03:59.450> come<00:03:59.720> down<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.410> platform<00:04:00.920> from

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
ahead and come down to the platform from

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.160 
ahead and come down to the platform from
the<00:04:01.580> way<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:01.850> you<00:04:01.940> came<00:04:02.180> up<00:04:02.360> just<00:04:02.990> go<00:04:03.110> ahead

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
the way that you came up just go ahead

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.050 
the way that you came up just go ahead
and<00:04:03.290> dig<00:04:03.560> straight<00:04:03.890> down<00:04:04.010> from<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.910> dirt

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
and dig straight down from the dirt

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.910 
and dig straight down from the dirt
remember<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.690> place<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.140> right<00:04:06.350> there<00:04:06.650> that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
remember to place it right there that

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.530 
remember to place it right there that
way<00:04:07.070> then<00:04:07.310> you're<00:04:07.700> not<00:04:07.850> there's<00:04:08.060> not<00:04:08.210> a<00:04:08.240> little

going<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.930> want<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.110> build<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.470> streaks<00:04:12.800> in

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
going to want to build the streaks in

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.830 
going to want to build the streaks in
order<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.910> this<00:04:14.060> you're<00:04:14.390> going<00:04:14.570> to<00:04:14.630> want<00:04:14.780> to
