hi<00:00:02.179> basil<00:00:02.840> project<00:00:03.470> for<00:00:03.679> ole<00:00:03.830> bear<00:00:04.100> and<00:00:04.310> I<00:00:04.370> was

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
hi basil project for ole bear and I was

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.319 
hi basil project for ole bear and I was
to<00:00:05.299> make<00:00:05.480> some<00:00:05.839> bee<00:00:05.990> bread<00:00:06.430> now<00:00:07.430> bee<00:00:07.850> bread<00:00:08.089> is

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:08.329 
to make some bee bread now bee bread is

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.480 
to make some bee bread now bee bread is
just<00:00:08.360> basically<00:00:09.079> a<00:00:09.230> mixture<00:00:09.589> of<00:00:09.740> pollen<00:00:10.339> and

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
just basically a mixture of pollen and

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.839 
just basically a mixture of pollen and
honey<00:00:11.230> you<00:00:12.230> turn<00:00:12.559> it<00:00:12.709> frequently<00:00:13.429> because

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
honey you turn it frequently because

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.789 
honey you turn it frequently because
it's<00:00:13.969> gonna<00:00:14.089> be<00:00:14.239> a<00:00:14.480> basic<00:00:14.869> fermentation<00:00:15.650> type

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
it's gonna be a basic fermentation type

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.939 
it's gonna be a basic fermentation type
of<00:00:15.919> process<00:00:16.339> as<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.640> pollen<00:00:17.060> is<00:00:17.949> integrated

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
of process as the pollen is integrated

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.550 
of process as the pollen is integrated
into<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.460> honey<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.539> it's<00:00:20.689> gonna<00:00:20.810> turn<00:00:21.080> into

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
into the honey and it's gonna turn into

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.999 
into the honey and it's gonna turn into
kind<00:00:22.070> of<00:00:22.189> almost<00:00:22.460> like<00:00:22.669> a<00:00:23.199> frosting<00:00:24.199> type<00:00:24.830> of

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
kind of almost like a frosting type of

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.470 
kind of almost like a frosting type of
texture<00:00:25.609> very<00:00:26.390> thick<00:00:27.160> a<00:00:28.160> lot<00:00:28.669> thicker<00:00:29.119> than

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
texture very thick a lot thicker than

that pollen into the honey

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.670 
that pollen into the honey
so<00:01:53.120> again<00:01:53.660> just<00:01:53.870> turn<00:01:54.080> it<00:01:54.230> frequently

throughout the day let it sit we the the
batch<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.990> old<00:02:00.320> bear<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.530> finishing<00:02:00.980> up<00:02:01.220> it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
batch that old bear is finishing up it

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.550
