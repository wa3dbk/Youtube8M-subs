00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.210
 how 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.219
 good to everyone here arrives today I'm going to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.199
 present a list of 10 things that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.630
 maybe you did not know about yours 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.570
 citadels some of them are details 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.460
 decorative others help a lot but 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 all share in common that they do not 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 mention in any kind of tutorial 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 and they depend purely on our 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.399
 exploration driven by our 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.379
 curiosity so the top 10 things 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.510
 curious of the citadel -clearly- 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.370
 these things are from the citadel of the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.260
 horde but I imagine that all this is 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.680
 applicable to some extent to that of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.190
 alliance 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.990
 number 10 in a mine level 3 in the background 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.850
 from one of the corridors you can 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.370
 find a small side where they swim 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.160
 nothing more nothing less than a couple of 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.460
 fish extremely similar to fish 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.010
 embittered and the famous fantastic time there 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.379
 rumors that fishing here there's more 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 probability of getting them out but 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.780
 increases are just that rumors 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.070
 number 9 once we upload our 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.960
 Citadel at level 2 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.290
 we get all the new ones apart 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.060
 building gaps a must 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.610
 construction in which we use 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.890
 a beautiful achievement entitled take care of yourself 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.010
 inside and finally we alleviate our 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.740
 character that after so many years already 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.799
 is that literally shits 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.659
 number 8 I'm surprised how much 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.390
 people who ask but effectively 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.729
 at level 3 the citadel has a portal to 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 xian you just have to upload this 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.570
 equal tower 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.729
 number 7 do not know all but the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.229
 followers in 100 are much better 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.619
 working in the positions where the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.409
 let's assign is more guarantee us 100% 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.300
 of double production of resources in fact 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.490
 If the orders are completed without a 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.770
 follower working and we put it alone 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.350
 to collect the resources equal account 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.330
 this is a failure that they promise to correct 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.149
 in a future patch so take advantage 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.580
 while you can curiously that the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.770
 follower is rare or ethical does not influence 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.819
 nothing alone in uploading our already in itself 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.180
 huge euros 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.579
 number 6 the hosts of the order gordon 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.530
 they end up giving us a mole machine that 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.900
 situates outside our citadel and is a 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.819
 instant access to said area that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.349
 it comes in handy for the world boxes and 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.930
 any other mount that we want 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.230
 change 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.819
 number 5 also while we go down by 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.400
 the world we will find slopes that 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.409
 apparently they just give us our gold and 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.780
 in your case experience but in reality 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.769
 they have another interesting reward 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.989
 as useless 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.209
 it's about creatures that will finish us 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.370
 accompanying in our citadel as 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.359
 Ferns like we can trade or 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.130
 this dog and pig thing that simply 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:59.220
 they are slimy 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.650
 number 4 in the citadel and a couple of 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.060
 hidden corners for example behind 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.710
 from the level 3 barracks there are some 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.660
 stairs that lead to a sinister 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.120
 perfect prison to surround and 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.220
 hide in the pond there is a cave 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.230
 underwater with a large pile of 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.050
 resources that can be used one 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.110
 once curiously this stack does not appear in 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.750
 the treasure map of hand in august 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.180
 No. 3 in the active level of the herd 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.370
 3 there is a strange building that increases 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.320
 it's no use you can guess that 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.580
 has something to do with the kitchen and has 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.620
 led to think of a series of 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.390
 players that in future patches 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.160
 we will see buildings dedicated to 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.130
 profession which would have its logic 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.810
 number 2 following the same line there 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.760
 several clues that tell us that 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.610
 blizzard plan to include more levels of 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.260
 citadel in the future for example this 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.330
 giant mountain that the goblins carry 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.490
 months digging the outer wall 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.350
 west of the citadel of the horde has 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.030
 a somewhat illogical way and leaves 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.820
 obvious that it will be expanded outward 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.950
 and the same gas what gives you the plans 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.600
 level 3 style says it has already 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.930
 ordered the plans for a larger 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.390
 number one as another data curiously 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.120
 monkey depending on the citadel level 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.340
 that we have in one tree or another we can 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.540
 find the majestic and extremely 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.489
 baby monkey a little bird that we can carry 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.740
 as a hat and that guarantees us 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.389
 be the center of the worship of all 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.009
 who see us 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.020
 with this ends today's episode 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.680
 I hope you enjoyed it as 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.300
 forever

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.999
