00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
also picked up that I emphasized when I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260 
also picked up that I emphasized when I
was<00:00:36.410> talking<00:00:36.710> about<00:00:36.739> my<00:00:36.920> own<00:00:37.250> story<00:00:37.670> the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
was talking about my own story the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.020 
was talking about my own story the
importance<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.960> prayer<00:00:39.559> with<00:00:40.130> understanding

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
importance of prayer with understanding

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.260 
importance of prayer with understanding
and<00:00:41.090> with<00:00:41.300> kosher<00:00:41.840> right<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:43.490> emphasize

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
and with kosher right so I emphasize

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.300 
and with kosher right so I emphasize
that<00:00:44.570> because<00:00:44.810> a<00:00:45.470> prayer<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:45.829> is<00:00:46.130> without

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
that because a prayer that is without

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.819 
that because a prayer that is without
understanding<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:48.170> prayer<00:00:48.470> that<00:00:48.710> is

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
understanding and the prayer that is

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.970 
understanding and the prayer that is
without<00:00:49.180> sincerity<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.810> humility<00:00:50.870> to<00:00:51.590> Allah

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
without sincerity and humility to Allah

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.100 
without sincerity and humility to Allah
is<00:00:52.250> not<00:00:52.670> going<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.000> change<00:00:53.120> anything<00:00:53.690> about

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
your life more difficult right because

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.680

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
this and that and it does nothing what

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.889 
this and that and it does nothing what
you<00:01:01.520> don't<00:01:01.640> get<00:01:01.820> any<00:01:02.000> feedback<00:01:02.239> from<00:01:02.630> that

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
you don't get any feedback from that

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.039 
you don't get any feedback from that
right<00:01:03.560> so<00:01:04.220> yes<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.879> inner<00:01:05.089> dimension<00:01:05.869> is

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.779 
only Islam maybe there are other
religions<00:02:00.139> that<00:02:00.649> really<00:02:01.039> brings<00:02:01.310> these<00:02:01.549> two

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
religions that really brings these two

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.169 
religions that really brings these two
together<00:02:02.149> right<00:02:03.079> but<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.099> is<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.369> tendency<00:02:04.819> for

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
together right but it is a tendency for

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.770 
together right but it is a tendency for
us<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:06.469> concentrate<00:02:07.369> only<00:02:07.880> on<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.390> external

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
us to concentrate only on the external

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.589 
us to concentrate only on the external
aspects<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.619> leave<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.940> internal

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
aspects and leave the internal

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.199 
aspects and leave the internal
development<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.380> very<00:02:12.620> very<00:02:12.890> important<00:02:13.490> yeah

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
development is very very important yeah

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.509 
development is very very important yeah
but<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> would<00:02:15.230> not<00:02:15.410> say<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:15.890> think<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:16.400> a

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
but I would not say I think it's a

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.910 
but I would not say I think it's a
mistake<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.879> say<00:02:17.209> either<00:02:17.450> or<00:02:17.870> that's<00:02:18.709> a

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
mistake to say either or that's a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.180 
mistake to say either or that's a
mistake<00:02:19.360> actually<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.599> has<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.049> be

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
mistake actually it has to be

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.360 
mistake actually it has to be
both<00:02:21.570> internal<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.600> external<00:02:23.020> at<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.160> same

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
both internal and external at the same

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.280 
both internal and external at the same
time<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.880> is<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.150> right<00:02:25.300> way<00:02:25.480> Allah<00:02:26.260> knows

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
time that is the right way Allah knows

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.440 
time that is the right way Allah knows
best
