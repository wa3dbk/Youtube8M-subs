00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
one so I'm going to get a vector one

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.980 
one so I'm going to get a vector one
which<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.600> will<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:23.990> able<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.260> color<00:04:24.470> in

which I will be able to color in
so<00:04:25.560> what<00:04:25.740> he<00:04:25.860> looks<00:04:26.039> like<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.250> silhouette<00:04:26.880> form

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
so what he looks like in silhouette form

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.839 
so what he looks like in silhouette form
so<00:04:27.330> what<00:04:27.449> he<00:04:27.539> looks<00:04:27.720> like<00:04:27.780> if<00:04:28.610> he<00:04:29.610> was<00:04:29.639> the

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
so what he looks like if he was the

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.760 
so what he looks like if he was the
color<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.599> black<00:04:31.020> color<00:04:31.259> they<00:04:31.470> wasn't

shape<00:06:01.169> that<00:06:01.500> looks<00:06:01.530> very<00:06:02.159> very<00:06:02.219> similar<00:06:02.460> to

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
shape that looks very very similar to

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.399 
shape that looks very very similar to
the<00:06:02.940> one<00:06:03.060> there<00:06:03.270> as<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:03.419> can<00:06:03.539> see<00:06:03.719> his<00:06:03.930> back<00:06:04.199> is

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
the one there as you can see his back is

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.189 
the one there as you can see his back is
arched<00:06:04.830> just<00:06:05.400> like<00:06:05.520> here<00:06:05.819> and<00:06:06.060> obviously<00:06:06.780> this

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
arched just like here and obviously this

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:13.100 
arched just like here and obviously this
me<00:06:07.440> is<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.889> classic<00:06:08.430> Sony<00:06:08.699> symbol<00:06:09.979> and<00:06:12.110> the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
me is the classic Sony symbol and the

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.870 
me is the classic Sony symbol and the
arrow<00:06:13.409> underneath<00:06:14.069> it<00:06:14.280> obviously<00:06:14.789> represents

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
arrow underneath it obviously represents

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.200 
arrow underneath it obviously represents
I<00:06:15.770> mean<00:06:16.770> this<00:06:17.039> is<00:06:17.159> what<00:06:17.219> I<00:06:17.280> think<00:06:17.580> my<00:06:17.729> head<00:06:17.909> the

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
I mean this is what I think my head the

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.180 
I mean this is what I think my head the
bin<00:06:18.449> represents<00:06:19.080> you<00:06:19.169> know<00:06:19.199> crash<00:06:19.710> we<00:06:20.009> haven't

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
bin represents you know crash we haven't

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.040 
bin represents you know crash we haven't
seen<00:06:20.310> him<00:06:20.400> in<00:06:20.460> ages<00:06:20.610> he's<00:06:20.909> been<00:06:21.090> in<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.750> trash

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
seen him in ages he's been in the trash

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.790 
seen him in ages he's been in the trash
he's<00:06:22.560> gone<00:06:23.030> he's<00:06:24.030> coming<00:06:24.389> out<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:25.620> he's<00:06:25.770> back

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
he's gone he's coming out and he's back

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.670 
he's gone he's coming out and he's back
with<00:06:26.250> sony<00:06:26.520> and<00:06:26.930> that<00:06:28.310> that<00:06:29.310> that's<00:06:29.610> why

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
with sony and that that that's why

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.200 
with sony and that that that's why
that's<00:06:31.680> why<00:06:31.830> there's<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.340> arrow<00:06:32.520> pointing<00:06:33.150> to

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
that's why there's the arrow pointing to

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.360 
that's why there's the arrow pointing to
the<00:06:33.360> sony<00:06:33.599> thing<00:06:33.900> with<00:06:34.199> crash<00:06:34.469> underneath<00:06:35.130> it
