00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
works really well on the map and I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
absolutely love it now we're taking a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.700 
absolutely love it now we're taking a
look<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:12.630> Wendell's<00:01:12.990> perspective<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.680> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
look at Wendell's perspective here and I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.780 
look at Wendell's perspective here and I
want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> point<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> couple<00:01:14.250> things<00:01:14.520> now

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
want to point out a couple things now

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.070 
want to point out a couple things now
this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.119> first<00:01:15.360> room<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.780> actually

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
this is the first room that you actually

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
this is the first room that you actually
spawn<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:17.159> entire<00:01:17.400> team<00:01:17.610> will<00:01:17.759> spawn

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
spawn in your entire team will spawn

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
spawn in your entire team will spawn
here<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> last<00:01:18.750> map<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.110> featured

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
here so like the last map we featured

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.050 
here so like the last map we featured
this<00:01:20.100> one's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.610> different<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
this one's a little bit different I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
this one's a little bit different I
guess<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.840> unlike<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
guess that's not like that unlike the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
guess that's not like that unlike the
last<00:01:22.860> map<00:01:23.100> sorry<00:01:23.490> unlike<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> last<00:01:24.540> map<00:01:24.720> we

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
last map sorry unlike the last map we

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
last map sorry unlike the last map we
featured<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.890> everyone<00:01:26.159> spawns<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.729> two

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
featured you not everyone spawns in two

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100 
featured you not everyone spawns in two
different<00:01:27.000> rooms<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> map<00:01:27.780> actually

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
different rooms and this map actually

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
different rooms and this map actually
every<00:01:28.409> spawns<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> same<00:01:29.070> room<00:01:29.250> together

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
every spawns in the same room together

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.429 
every spawns in the same room together
so<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:30.960> bit<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> power

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so you do have a little bit of a power

to this area pretty well but as time

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
to this area pretty well but as time
progresses<00:01:42.119> you'll<00:01:42.390> eventually<00:01:42.899> start<00:01:43.200> to

progresses you'll eventually start to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170

then that little 360 degree area around

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
then that little 360 degree area around
you<00:01:48.930> becomes<00:01:49.170> much<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.680> dangerous<00:01:50.189> this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you becomes much more dangerous this

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.420 
you becomes much more dangerous this

footage<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.129> recorded<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:55.030> much<00:02:55.180> easier<00:02:55.480> to

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
footage was recorded it's much easier to

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.420 
footage was recorded it's much easier to
throw<00:02:55.719> grenade<00:02:56.019> into<00:02:56.199> that<00:02:56.319> hole<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.340> you

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
throw grenade into that hole so you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.349 
throw grenade into that hole so you
don't<00:02:57.579> need<00:02:57.699> to<00:02:57.790> worry<00:02:57.909> about<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.150> anymore

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
don't need to worry about that anymore

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.459 
don't need to worry about that anymore
you<00:02:58.569> can<00:02:58.659> see<00:02:58.750> here<00:02:58.959> when<00:02:59.139> it<00:02:59.230> was<00:02:59.319> actually

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469 
you can see here when it was actually

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.619 
you can see here when it was actually
taking<00:02:59.949> quite<00:03:00.159> a<00:03:00.219> bit<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.459> fire<00:03:00.639> lucky<00:03:01.389> for<00:03:01.540> him

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
taking quite a bit of fire lucky for him

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.330 
taking quite a bit of fire lucky for him
he's<00:03:01.780> still<00:03:01.870> alive<00:03:02.139> anyways<00:03:02.889> he's<00:03:03.040> gonna<00:03:03.129> call

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
he's still alive anyways he's gonna call

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.099 
he's still alive anyways he's gonna call
in<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.459> DMR<00:03:03.790> now<00:03:03.969> obviously<00:03:04.359> because<00:03:04.750> he's

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
in the DMR now obviously because he's

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.530 
in the DMR now obviously because he's
out<00:03:05.349> of<00:03:05.379> ammo<00:03:05.590> so<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.909> being<00:03:07.060> said<00:03:07.120> -<00:03:07.389> when

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
out of ammo so that being said - when

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.610 
out of ammo so that being said - when
you<00:03:07.629> kill<00:03:07.750> zombies<00:03:08.139> you<00:03:08.349> don't<00:03:08.500> necessarily

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
you kill zombies you don't necessarily

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.500 
you kill zombies you don't necessarily
have<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.129> get<00:03:09.400> grenades<00:03:09.699> if<00:03:10.090> you're<00:03:10.329> out<00:03:10.419> of

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
have to get grenades if you're out of

have to get grenades if you're out of
animal<00:03:10.810> grab<00:03:11.169> a<00:03:11.199> new<00:03:11.379> weapon<00:03:11.709> don't<00:03:11.829> don't

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.219 
animal grab a new weapon don't don't

animal grab a new weapon don't don't
bother<00:03:12.340> progressing<00:03:12.939> into<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.180> next<00:03:13.389> room

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.629 
bother progressing into the next room
use<00:03:14.349> your<00:03:14.500> money<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.739> actually<00:03:14.889> buy<00:03:15.189> a<00:03:15.219> weapon

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
use your money to actually buy a weapon

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.550 
use your money to actually buy a weapon
that<00:03:15.669> you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.969> then<00:03:16.359> use<00:03:16.719> to<00:03:16.930> make<00:03:17.139> more<00:03:17.319> money

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that you can then use to make more money

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.819 
that you can then use to make more money
so<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.669> sense<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.180> exactly<00:03:19.689> like<00:03:19.829> you

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
so in that sense it's exactly like you

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.520 
so in that sense it's exactly like you
know<00:03:20.949> how<00:03:21.159> a<00:03:21.329> zombie<00:03:22.329> should<00:03:22.569> be<00:03:22.689> or<00:03:22.840> not<00:03:23.319> these

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
know how a zombie should be or not these

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.439 
know how a zombie should be or not these
zombies<00:03:23.829> rather<00:03:24.009> it's<00:03:24.699> the<00:03:24.790> same<00:03:24.970> principle

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
zombies rather it's the same principle

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.259 
zombies rather it's the same principle
here<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:26.139> kill<00:03:26.379> zombies<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:27.040> earn<00:03:27.280> currency

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
here you kill zombies to earn currency

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.780 
here you kill zombies to earn currency
what<00:03:28.479> you<00:03:28.659> then<00:03:28.889> use<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:30.129> either<00:03:30.220> upgrade<00:03:30.489> your

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
what you then use to either upgrade your

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.729 
what you then use to either upgrade your
weapons<00:03:31.150> upgrade<00:03:31.599> your<00:03:31.780> area<00:03:32.199> upgrade<00:03:32.709> your

holdout whatever you want so as you

progress through different parts of the

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.409 
progress through different parts of the

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
map obviously there are different

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.879 
map obviously there are different
weapons<00:03:38.019> that<00:03:38.109> you<00:03:38.229> can<00:03:38.349> get<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.650> there's

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
weapons that you can get in there's

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.280 
weapons that you can get in there's
different<00:03:39.310> areas<00:03:39.639> in<00:03:40.389> those<00:03:40.780> weapons<00:03:41.019> will

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
different areas in those weapons will

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.649 
different areas in those weapons will
spawn<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.680> different<00:03:41.949> areas<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:43.299> works<00:03:43.479> by

spawn in different areas and it works by

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.330 
spawn in different areas and it works by
that<00:03:43.810> kind<00:03:44.109> of<00:03:44.229> sense<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.829> don't<00:03:45.159> know<00:03:45.220> you

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
that kind of sense I don't know you

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.949 
that kind of sense I don't know you
don't<00:03:45.459> necessarily<00:03:45.609> have<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.180> obviously<00:03:46.629> buy

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
don't necessarily have to obviously buy

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.059 
don't necessarily have to obviously buy
the<00:03:47.019> grenade<00:03:47.349> something<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.709> doors<00:03:47.829> as<00:03:47.979> I

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
the grenade something the doors as I

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.199 
the grenade something the doors as I
said<00:03:48.220> earlier<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.519> can<00:03:48.639> buy<00:03:48.759> weapons<00:03:49.090> in

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
said earlier you can buy weapons in

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.670 
said earlier you can buy weapons in
whatever<00:03:49.359> but<00:03:50.109> you<00:03:50.169> can<00:03:50.259> see<00:03:50.349> here<00:03:50.500> things

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
whatever but you can see here things

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.839 
whatever but you can see here things
start<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.889> get<00:03:50.979> a<00:03:51.040> little<00:03:51.250> bit<00:03:51.340> more<00:03:51.489> intense

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
start to get a little bit more intense

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.969 
start to get a little bit more intense
because<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.359> map<00:03:52.540> offers<00:03:52.840> again<00:03:53.259> interior

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
because this map offers again interior

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.469 
because this map offers again interior
and<00:03:54.069> exterior<00:03:54.159> play<00:03:54.549> spaces<00:03:54.790> as<00:03:55.060> long<00:03:55.269> as<00:03:55.389> I

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:55.479 
and exterior play spaces as long as I

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:56.999 
and exterior play spaces as long as I
right<00:03:55.750> now<00:03:55.900> are<00:03:56.049> spawning<00:03:56.349> in<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.620> courtyard

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:57.009 
right now are spawning in the courtyard

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:58.530 
right now are spawning in the courtyard
and<00:03:57.129> they're<00:03:57.250> climbing<00:03:57.579> up<00:03:57.819> this<00:03:58.030> wall<00:03:58.269> into

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
and they're climbing up this wall into

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.390 
and they're climbing up this wall into
the<00:03:58.810> second<00:03:59.259> level<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.799> this<00:03:59.919> building<00:04:00.250> here

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
the second level of this building here

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.039 
the second level of this building here
now<00:04:00.849> we<00:04:00.909> can<00:04:01.090> actually<00:04:01.209> go<00:04:01.389> over<00:04:01.419> to<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.840> sides

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
now we can actually go over to the sides

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.990 
now we can actually go over to the sides
and<00:04:02.259> shoot<00:04:02.409> down<00:04:02.530> at<00:04:02.739> them<00:04:02.889> however<00:04:03.340> if<00:04:03.729> we<00:04:03.879> do

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
and shoot down at them however if we do

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.580 
and shoot down at them however if we do
that<00:04:04.180> we<00:04:04.389> risk<00:04:04.689> getting<00:04:05.049> infected<00:04:05.379> from

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
that we risk getting infected from

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.259 
that we risk getting infected from
behind<00:04:05.889> so<00:04:06.159> you<00:04:06.219> can<00:04:06.549> see<00:04:06.699> there's<00:04:06.879> guys<00:04:07.030> over

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
behind so you can see there's guys over

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.999 
behind so you can see there's guys over
there<00:04:07.389> holding<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.750> doorway<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.469> Wendell's

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
there holding that doorway and Wendell's

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.619 
there holding that doorway and Wendell's
actually<00:04:09.280> covering<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.789> climbing<00:04:10.419> up<00:04:10.509> the

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
actually covering the climbing up the

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.819 
actually covering the climbing up the
zombies<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.169> are<00:04:11.229> climbing<00:04:11.560> out<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.650> side

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
zombies that are climbing out the side

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.649 
zombies that are climbing out the side
of<00:04:11.889> the<00:04:11.979> building<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.209> map<00:04:13.509> actually

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
of the building so this map actually

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:15.270 
of the building so this map actually
requires<00:04:14.079> a<00:04:14.169> lot<00:04:14.289> of<00:04:14.379> communication<00:04:14.919> and<00:04:15.039> one

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
requires a lot of communication and one

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.529 
requires a lot of communication and one
thing<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.489> this<00:04:15.639> map<00:04:15.789> offers<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.299> others

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
thing that this map offers that others

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.779 
thing that this map offers that others
don't<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.739> lot<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.070> Nazi<00:04:18.370> zombies<00:04:18.400> Maps

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
don't is that a lot of Nazi zombies Maps

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.819 
don't is that a lot of Nazi zombies Maps
actually<00:04:18.969> have<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.239> tree<00:04:19.539> design<00:04:19.870> whereby<00:04:20.169> the

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
actually have a tree design whereby the

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.350 
actually have a tree design whereby the
humans<00:04:21.130> are<00:04:21.219> all<00:04:21.310> spawning<00:04:21.609> in<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.789> trunk<00:04:22.120> and

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
humans are all spawning in the trunk and

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.610 
humans are all spawning in the trunk and
as<00:04:22.539> they<00:04:22.659> move<00:04:22.810> further<00:04:22.990> into<00:04:23.199> the<00:04:23.289> map<00:04:23.440> they

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
as they move further into the map they

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.810 
as they move further into the map they
move<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:23.889> towards<00:04:24.159> the<00:04:24.219> branches<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.729> those

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
move up towards the branches and those

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.030 
move up towards the branches and those
branches<00:04:25.029> don't<00:04:25.360> really<00:04:25.539> go<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.750> any

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
branches don't really go to any

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.980 
branches don't really go to any
so<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.640> maps<00:04:26.820> aren't<00:04:27.030> designed<00:04:27.390> properly<00:04:27.660> but

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
so the maps aren't designed properly but

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.510 
so the maps aren't designed properly but
this<00:04:28.110> map<00:04:28.290> has<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.470> fantastic<00:04:28.890> design<00:04:29.370> it

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
this map has a fantastic design it

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.550 
this map has a fantastic design it
actually<00:04:29.790> loops<00:04:30.000> back<00:04:30.300> there<00:04:31.020> are<00:04:31.110> multiple

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
actually loops back there are multiple

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.430 
actually loops back there are multiple
different<00:04:31.740> ways<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:32.160> go<00:04:32.280> around<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.610> map<00:04:33.440> so

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
different ways to go around the map so

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
different ways to go around the map so
it's<00:04:34.560> got<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> really<00:04:34.740> good<00:04:35.010> design<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:35.400> it

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
it's got a really good design so it

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.100 
it's got a really good design so it
plays<00:04:35.670> well<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.090> that's<00:04:36.810> where<00:04:36.960> we're

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
plays well and that's where we're

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.420 
plays well and that's where we're
looking<00:04:37.320> for<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.500> nazi<00:04:37.770> zombies<00:04:38.010> maps<00:04:38.220> maps
