how for this effect you're going to need
to<00:00:40.170> put<00:00:40.410> effects<00:00:40.950> slot<00:00:41.250> 1<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:42.180> advance<00:00:42.510> mode

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
to put effects slot 1 into advance mode

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.619 
to put effects slot 1 into advance mode
and<00:00:43.079> load<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> beet<00:00:44.040> slicer<00:00:44.579> effect<00:00:44.969> from<00:00:45.450> the

and load the beet slicer effect from the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.990 
and load the beet slicer effect from the
drop-down<00:00:45.870> menu<00:00:46.219> it's<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> good<00:00:47.460> idea<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.760> have

drop-down menu it's a good idea to have

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.330 
drop-down menu it's a good idea to have
all<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.510> parameter<00:00:49.020> knobs<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> left<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
all the parameter knobs to the left to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.240 
all the parameter knobs to the left to
start<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.329> 2<00:00:51.600> bar<00:00:51.899> button<00:00:52.469> selected

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
start with and the 2 bar button selected

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
start with and the 2 bar button selected
this<00:00:53.640> will<00:00:53.850> cleanly<00:00:54.360> record<00:00:54.809> an<00:00:55.020> eight-count

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this will cleanly record an eight-count

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
this will cleanly record an eight-count
loop<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> continue<00:00:57.090> playing<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.510> back<00:00:57.690> once

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
loop and continue playing it back once

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
loop and continue playing it back once
it's<00:00:58.350> done<00:00:58.500> recording<00:01:17.390> after<00:01:18.390> you're<00:01:18.479> done

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

it's done recording after you're done
playing<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> cool<00:01:19.170> pattern<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:20.820> continues

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
playing a cool pattern and it continues

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.749 
playing a cool pattern and it continues
playing<00:01:21.590> now<00:01:22.590> manipulate<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> three<00:01:23.549> knobs

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
playing now manipulate the three knobs

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.480 
playing now manipulate the three knobs
to<00:01:24.390> create<00:01:24.659> different<00:01:25.080> effects<00:01:25.350> glitches<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to create different effects glitches and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.380

effect off to resample deck a and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.210 
effect off to resample deck a and
rerecord<00:01:35.910> an<00:01:36.360> entirely<00:01:36.810> new
