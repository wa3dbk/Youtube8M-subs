00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.950

 and carpets curtains and furniture and they change 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.670
 of color along with your clothes that's a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.100
 room fashion we buy 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.470
 I do not remember the last time we decorate 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.180
 that was centuries ago 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.400
 in fact it was last Tuesday the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.860
 remodeling fascinates me to remove a 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.270
 audio system that literally 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.130
 wrap the chair of an armchair that 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.540
 turns a gym into jump ramps 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.540
 jungle like you can not see 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.890
 that's the daddy of wood 46,000 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.900
 and also from the 49 mark with touches 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.240
 of the coast of the diet 56 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.390
 delivery for Malibu Street 1959 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.390

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.110

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.890
 the trampoline were wrong order 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.520
 Of course they were wrong I wanted it pink 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.520
 sparkly 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.940
 ace 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.770
 and the lateral one goes to the center and the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.780
 returns to the clinical side point 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.180
 cause gave if you want your own business 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.080

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.080

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.460
 control 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.900
 with love 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.560

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.560

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.560
 and they took away who or the beautiful one and it seems 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.080
 that an avant-garde furniture store put its 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.300
