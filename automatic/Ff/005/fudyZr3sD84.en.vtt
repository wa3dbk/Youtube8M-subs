today I'm going to tell you how to put

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.080 
today I'm going to tell you how to put
two<00:00:08.620> computers<00:00:09.160> together<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:10.840> can<00:00:11.139> get<00:00:11.470> your

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
two computers together you can get your

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.980 
two computers together you can get your
modem<00:00:13.140> Ethernet<00:00:14.140> stuff<00:00:14.560> but<00:00:15.450> another<00:00:16.450> simple

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
modem Ethernet stuff but another simple

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.470 
modem Ethernet stuff but another simple
way<00:00:17.140> is<00:00:17.470> to<00:00:17.529> get<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:19.390> that<00:00:20.010> crossover<00:00:21.010> here<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
way is to get to that crossover here and

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.019 
way is to get to that crossover here and
I<00:00:22.599> say<00:00:22.810> about<00:00:22.900> this<00:00:23.169> is<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.800> is<00:00:24.160> if<00:00:24.669> you<00:00:24.820> don't

gateway you can pedal is the back so so

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.400 
gateway you can pedal is the back so so
the<00:01:47.130> first<00:01:47.400> step<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
depending on how you set up your network

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.960 
depending on how you set up your network
or<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> witness<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.460> know<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.729> doesn't

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
local network so where it goes to start

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.460 
local network so where it goes to start
here<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:32.519> then<00:03:32.849> you're<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.720> want<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.200> go
