00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.340
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.180
 guide video because this good I'm going to 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.180
 show here a little of the gameplay 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.610
 the quality of the image of the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.980
 capturing 3ds that Japanese comes to me 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.320
 a few days ago and the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.550
 and the mess that has brought me the truth 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.480
 It is the truth that 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.309
 cost me a lot and install it not 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.550
 install installed but do that 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.980
 my computer worked because in addition 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.079
 I have a mac device and it does not work 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.640
 at maximums without only if you make a 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.340
 partition on a roll 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.210
 and then good as you see I still have not 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.890
 managed to record the audio but the 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.780
 true that I think we better recorded it 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.199
 because I do not know if you know that youtube now 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.380
 is putting more notifications of 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.000
 copyright to the special gamers of 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.590
 nintendo and most come from the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.690
 music of the games then the best 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.729
 in this known way that they come to me 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.450
 less strike no strikes but less 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.090
 notifications and well that as it says is 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.009
 so you can see how it looks from the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.930
 comments what do you think if it looks good or 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.060
 not good to not finish this video already 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.280
 Well, I thought I can teach you 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.970

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.470

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.409
 blue bulb that I got in the method 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.479

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.119
 respective video on the channel as well 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.030

 and this one in chain fishing too 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.869
 they have their respective videos and a 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.340

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.019
 more in the boxes but they are not 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.319
 scattered these are the ones that I have 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.180
 together I do not have this if they are at level 9 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.280

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.769

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.319
 exists in the video yesterday is mona banned 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.319
 to the use of the cascarita then it 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.489
 would become a k cangas in which 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.140
 leaves much to be desired, the truth loses 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.600
 a lot and I think it's going to get the duty 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.940
 just 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.830

 for the moment this one is also trained 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.820
 it's nothing if I do not use it because 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.820
 get out of a lot of trouble and I'll take it 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.960
