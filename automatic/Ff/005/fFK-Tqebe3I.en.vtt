very impressive it literally cool I
don't<00:01:40.499> know<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.709> the<00:01:40.829> significance<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.399> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
don't know what the significance of it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.599 
don't know what the significance of it
is<00:01:41.810> there<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.959> references<00:01:43.529> 27<00:01:43.919> only<00:01:44.399> been<00:01:44.520> out

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
is there was references 27 only been out

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.359 
is there was references 27 only been out
to<00:01:44.789> kill<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.119> boss<00:01:45.329> 17<00:01:45.899> times<00:01:46.259> maybe<00:01:47.069> there's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to kill this boss 17 times maybe there's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
to kill this boss 17 times maybe there's
something<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:48.060> happens<00:01:48.209> after<00:01:48.749> the

something different happens after the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.679 
something different happens after the
five<00:01:49.859> goes<00:01:50.219> or<00:01:50.549> six<00:01:50.789> goes<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.659> a
