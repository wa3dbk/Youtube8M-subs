00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.860
 Pikal system is a set of office 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.230
 sure hinted there are such an outline 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.520
 main contour of the defining formula 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.180
 channel 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.709
 shoreline filament based 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.709
 and dot labels advertising 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.339
 You can apply other office internal 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:20.720
 contour this model of non-working lines 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.109
 single circuit 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 it is visible in the layout punctures and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.619
 cut 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.890
 in the course of work like office 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.679
 to change 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.870
 all offices are broken up 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.510
 plots organic moans 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.210
 stones 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240
 the beginning and the end of the section 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.670
 determined by traversal and contra clockwise 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.530
 arrow 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.790
 the end of the first section coincides with the beginning 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.790
 second and so on 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.290
 points are divided into two types of end it 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.140
 white border points 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.940
 and intermediate is the points on the plot color 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.850
 culture 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.120
 at the end points the contour has evil 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.140
 change point type 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.880
 contours gets either kink for 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.290
 smooth bend 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 intermediate points she shares 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.840
 checklists 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440
 this is a big point and committee members 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.330
 and simple e intermediate is 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.610
 small bird boiling point 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.200
 simple intermediate points 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.240
 automatic shift 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.620
 proportionality offset neighboring 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.660
 points 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.590
 during the work, you can change the properties of the point 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.950
 changed its parameters 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.140
 control points how economical keeps 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 curve shape during deformation 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.860
 and only changes to the nearest 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 point on the site as in these points 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 a list of increments is introduced 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.979
 Here and Rossini and technical 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.130
 supply of patterns 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.200
 performed by the size of Kazakhstan 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.299

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.659
 uneven and even mode 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.520
 breeding and breeding with 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.980
 large and abrupt 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.580
 choosing one of the gradation modes you need 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.250
 point work points 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.730
 there is the meaning of communion befell 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.230
 greece 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.629
 according to the gradation patterns and click 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.949
 button to ride 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.790
 you can come and join the group 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.819
 single dots 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.819
 for their simultaneous gravity 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.319
 forgiveness is introduced 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.579
 only in the control intermediate and 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.749
 end points in simple 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.519
 intermediate points recalculation and no no 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.029

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.029
 period of puppies of neighboring points 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.659
 for uniform wiring enough 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 one message for all sizes 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.419
 and for uneven reports you need to keep 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.419
 values ​​separately for each time of the world 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.379
 for the graduation of the search for glasses you need 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.849
 set marginal size range 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:29.919
 breeding 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.650
 and for each range 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.650
 drive risers 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:42.849
 during the work can be copied 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.019
 movement between points 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.989
 for completely for one of the coordinates 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.559
 experts of task 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:52.629
 copying increment allows 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.889
 create a directory of base models and 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.389
 guarantee new models for similar 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.389
 cooling towers us designs 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.610
 at the end of the gradation the size of the pattern 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.760
 we pass the mode of pore grading astana 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.760
 and perform the breeding process 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.009
 in addition to the gradation of drugs table 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:16.069
 relocation program works

 Automatic mode teasing wife layout 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.620
 their automatic function 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.090
 build size doomed by two 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.090
 original size 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.129
 on the screen you need to call the full 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:35.350
 Kulikov disassembly 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.599
 and disgusting amount of residue and sticks 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.219
 for removing wiring causing on screens 1 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.389
 increase 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.659
 on the bottom panel are also located 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.689
 call windows required sizes 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.689
 or alik on the screen 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.639
 modeling functions 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.470
 replenish the account after drawing on recaro 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.580

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.120
 transference arbitrary 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.909
 model lines a little bit keys struck 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.449
 after specifying the point sets 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.930
 control point two clicks of the space bar 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.930
 set the end point 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.169
 the function to assemble a piece allows 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.999
 create new medicines from 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:23.559
 various advertising sites including 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:25.229
 combined 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.789

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.379
 important condition when assembling patterns 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.239
 if the plot has a continuation beyond the point 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.439
 crossing lines you must specify 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.020
 exactly that part of the plot 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.050
 which will be part of the future 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.930
 patterns 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.810
 the system contains a set of functions 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.680
 modeling of any complexity 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.389
 operations are performed 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.349

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.939
 several places at once 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.489
 functions are conical

 creating a counter warehouse 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:17.379
 need to create on the screen in a group 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.050
 combined patterns 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.520
 with such groups it is possible to perform 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.720
 virtually any program features in 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.460
 including modeling
