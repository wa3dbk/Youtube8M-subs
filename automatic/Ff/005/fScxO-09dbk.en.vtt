00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
I am all about laying down my edges see

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.919 
I am all about laying down my edges see
how<00:00:08.069> Java<00:00:08.370> edge<00:00:08.639> control<00:00:09.000> helped<00:00:09.450> me<00:00:09.599> lay<00:00:09.900> down

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
how Java edge control helped me lay down

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.230 
how Java edge control helped me lay down
my<00:00:10.290> baby<00:00:10.469> edges<00:00:10.980> stay<00:00:11.820> tuned<00:00:13.849> I'm<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
my baby edges stay tuned I'm here to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.290 
my baby edges stay tuned I'm here to
introduce<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.809> gyro<00:00:16.379> edge<00:00:16.619> control<00:00:17.300> this

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
introduce to you gyro edge control this

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.890 
introduce to you gyro edge control this
edge<00:00:18.630> control<00:00:19.050> has<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:20.369> tacky<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.539> smooth

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
edge control has a very tacky but smooth

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.529 
edge control has a very tacky but smooth
consistency<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.070> was<00:00:23.640> able<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.300> what

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
consistency I was able to just know what

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.170 
consistency I was able to just know what
glide<00:00:24.810> that's<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.289> my<00:00:25.470> edges<00:00:25.920> with<00:00:26.279> no<00:00:26.580> problem

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
glide that's on my edges with no problem

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.929 
glide that's on my edges with no problem
as<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.439> now<00:00:28.939> typically

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
as you can see right here now typically

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.479 
as you can see right here now typically
with<00:00:30.150> clear<00:00:30.510> edge<00:00:31.109> controls<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
with clear edge controls I have a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
with clear edge controls I have a
problem<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.420> leaving<00:00:33.780> build-up<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
problem with it leaving build-up and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.190 
problem with it leaving build-up and
residue<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> wanted<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.540> how<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.930> edge

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
residue so I wanted to see how this edge

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.840 
residue so I wanted to see how this edge
control<00:00:38.090> work<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.300> my

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.020 

I<00:00:41.910> noticed<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.109> hair<00:00:43.289> was<00:00:43.320> too<00:00:43.649> wet<00:00:44.030> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I noticed that if my hair was too wet it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.000 
I noticed that if my hair was too wet it
wouldn't<00:00:45.390> lay<00:00:45.510> down<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.350> after<00:00:46.530> patting

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
wouldn't lay down right so after patting

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
wouldn't lay down right so after patting
out<00:00:47.160> some<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.699> excess<00:00:48.269> water<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.899> went

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
out some of the excess water I went

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.869 
out some of the excess water I went
ahead<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> put<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> little<00:00:50.399> bit<00:00:50.519> more<00:00:50.610> than

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
ahead and put a little bit more than

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.389 
ahead and put a little bit more than
edge<00:00:51.000> control<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.719> smooth<00:00:52.019> it<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.589> as<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
edge control and smooth it on out as you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
edge control and smooth it on out as you
can<00:00:53.519> see<00:00:53.699> right<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.300> am<00:00:54.600> creating<00:00:54.930> my<00:00:54.960> flat

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:07.100 
can see right here I am creating my flat
tools<00:00:55.589> but<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:55.920> smoothing<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.519> I<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.969> I<00:01:06.110> am

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
tools but I'm smoothing as I go I am

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.219 
tools but I'm smoothing as I go I am
creating<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.820> side<00:01:08.820> view<00:01:09.149> if<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.869> wanna<00:01:10.049> call

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
creating a side view if you wanna call

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:10.850 
creating a side view if you wanna call
it<00:01:10.289> that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it that

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
it that
so<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.399> gonna<00:01:11.610> use<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> gyruss<00:01:12.899> edge

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so I'm gonna use more of gyruss edge

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
so I'm gonna use more of gyruss edge
control<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:14.490> smooth<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:14.940> my<00:01:15.240> sides<00:01:19.190> its

brushes down and leave out the door no
it<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.500> process<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.490> for<00:02:04.700> my<00:02:04.820> for<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.540> curl

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
it is a process so for my for a curl

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.180 
it is a process so for my for a curl
pattern<00:02:06.979> slash<00:02:08.110> cotton<00:02:09.110> text<00:02:09.410> your<00:02:09.530> hair<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.770> I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
and I must say Jireh edge control did

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.550 
and I must say Jireh edge control did
that<00:02:19.430> I'm<00:02:20.360> going<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.870> add<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.290> my<00:02:21.319> list
