00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello everyone considering that this 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.339
 year will come on the 17th I bring you a theory of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.010
 how the story will continue 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.480
 main since they announced that tekken 7 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.630
 will mark the end of the saga of light 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.330
 visible will also perform an analysis of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.890
 each of the new characters 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.600
 first of all you are going to see two videos in 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.600
 which I have based to create my theory 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.929
 A) Yes 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.210
 or not 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.970
 m 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.960
 also if they leave they are ourense today 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.899
 I also 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.010
 and it's called box types a chat 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 or 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.500
 if you do not love me 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.510
 weiss 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.510
 I do not admit 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 let me know if they say the demands 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.710
 Lady 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.790
 howard 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 do not 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.550
 to be a moment in which 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.550
 you just do not stop to gh 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.010
 the truth is that I did not expect it 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.690
 they went with that I look for my theory according to my 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.250
 theory and the characters that will get 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.250
 great importance in the next game 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.530
 they are leo places we will leave kristen and steve 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.200
 especially the latter as it can 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.550
 that presents the diabolic gene these two 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.930
 characters present enough 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.730
 similarities since both are without 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.580
 vision experiments towards and basso 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.470
 without unknown as the experiment 78 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.170
 of this post while the first 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.050
 of all without presenting a tattoo on his 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.540
 left arm type 2 presented 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.980
 scars without presenting cell 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.810
 immortality and is the only one that has 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.790
 managed to survive the experiments 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.590
 so I think that steve I present to you 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.780
 agent spoke the only thing that according to 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.630
 visible reports of bach steve 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.490
 I had died as surely as 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.050
 all my doubt would be three laps and these 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.580
 two were in the next game 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.050
 taking into account that the type has 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.910
 started to remember things from his past 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.400
 and video clip you want to know who 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.110
 he murdered his mother the stage of theory 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.000
 as we did with the analysis of new 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.870
 characters of tekken 7 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.940
 first of all what cloud 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.519
 one of the most controversial characters and 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.540
 most criticized by the people since the 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.269
 people say it's another character 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.709
 only for otaku but it's 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.720
 remember that there were two other characters 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.090
 that were very criticized at the time 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.310
 lily and smoothes but now people 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.890
 appreciate the truth is that I do not imagine to 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.380
 someone like lucky club fighting but you 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.970
 will give the character a chance 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.519
 they say it's when big secret and that 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.540
 for that reason the armsmen may be 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.540
 a mutation that this saga 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.909
 the next character I do not have much 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.490
 information if massage comes from 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:33.770
 Saudi Arabia your fighting style is 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.240
 similar to that of a military man the truth is 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.889
 which is the character that interests me most 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.880
 of all but this the least 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.800
 rai information 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.890
 the next character is claudio will be 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.870
 philo is apparent Italian and will force the 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.970
 steve fox and his arm presents a tattoo 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.710
 similar to if I say that his tattoo 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.660
 appears on your arm when you use your 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.870
 power can apparently shoot arrows 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.740
 logical but that donates failures to 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.030
 constantly because if it's not going to be a 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.770
 horrible character at the time of 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.450
 confront him they also say that this 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.249
 character can be related to the 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.379
 missive family 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.379
 the next character catalina alves 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.699
 but he comes from Brazil 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.289
 this character makes fun of the rival 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.240
 during combat 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.639
 the star charges mouth talkative 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.659
 daring and brito not of the martial art that 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.659
 practice this Saturday 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:26.679
 this martial art also practiced 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.080
 another character called miguel the only 

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:31.939
 that she focuses more on kicking 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.950
 while Miguel presents a style 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:37.710
 more street fight 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.380
 first of all you have noticed the 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.210
 great resemblance that has the character of 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.240
 gray with 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.600
 the dt that this character is called me if 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.640
 rizal 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.340
 had a problem with his name maybe 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.920
 do not appear next probable game of 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.750
 philippines 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.200
 of your style of fights write it and the 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.200
 kick boxing 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.860
 the truth is that it bothers me a lot 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.300
 have eggs similar to those of 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.430
 steve os 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.810
 since what we like is that each one 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.810
 he had his own fighting style 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.229
 from what I've read because of its past 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.349
 this character tends to cry a lot 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.349
 often 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.640
 when making equipment, he always swallowed 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.080
 Eggs similar to the different now 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.080
 you are going to see rude as realistic 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.129
 good and that's all I'll take the game 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.169
 if the fidel version convinces me 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.330
 because I do not know what to expect 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.159
 because the gameplay similar to that of 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.120
 the previous deliveries so I hope 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:45.940
 I tell you good story 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.500
 I would like to know your opinion and if 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.849
 you learn about some important data 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.889
 leave comments 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:54.189
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.189
 and good bye
