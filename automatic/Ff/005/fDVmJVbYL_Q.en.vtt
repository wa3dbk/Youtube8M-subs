because everybody has their own
technique<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:04.579> my<00:03:04.790> technique<00:03:05.239> was<00:03:05.540> to

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
technique but my technique was to

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.619 
technique but my technique was to
basically<00:03:05.840> go<00:03:06.349> ahead<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.969> go<00:03:07.969> root<00:03:08.449> your

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
basically go ahead and go root your

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.909 
basically go ahead and go root your
phone<00:03:09.129> from<00:03:10.129> 1.6<00:03:10.849> you<00:03:11.060> can<00:03:11.209> root<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:11.540> phone

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
phone from 1.6 you can root the phone

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.119 
phone from 1.6 you can root the phone
the<00:03:12.919> best<00:03:13.159> way<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.400> do<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.790> i<00:03:13.849> found<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.510> to

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
the best way to do that i found is to

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.460 
the best way to do that i found is to
download<00:03:16.129> flash<00:03:16.759> tool<00:03:17.060> from<00:03:17.359> XDA<00:03:17.840> developers

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
download flash tool from XDA developers

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.909 
download flash tool from XDA developers
they<00:03:19.159> have<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> movie<00:03:19.939> actual<00:03:20.419> form<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.829> then

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
they have a movie actual form and then

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.339 
they have a movie actual form and then
at<00:03:22.099> that<00:03:22.250> point<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:23.299> can<00:03:23.840> go<00:03:23.989> ahead<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.699> and

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
at that point you can go ahead and and

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.780 
at that point you can go ahead and and
root<00:03:27.349> your<00:03:27.500> phone<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.099> install<00:03:28.579> some
