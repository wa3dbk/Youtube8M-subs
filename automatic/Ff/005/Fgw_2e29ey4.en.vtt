because<00:00:04.740> there<00:00:04.890> are<00:00:04.950> several<00:00:05.160> features<00:00:05.640> on

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
because there are several features on

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.670 
because there are several features on
here<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.029> are<00:00:06.299> very<00:00:06.480> useful<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.319> your

now what is this this is simply after it
cuts<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.849> job<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.480> advances<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.379> end<00:00:16.650> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
cuts the job it advances to the end of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.439 
cuts the job it advances to the end of
the<00:00:16.920> job<00:00:17.220> now<00:00:17.490> there's<00:00:17.699> two<00:00:17.910> things<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.240> can

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the job now there's two things you can

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.870 
the job now there's two things you can
do<00:00:18.630> from<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.080> number<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.400> send<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
do from here number one you can send a

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.509 
do from here number one you can send a
secondary<00:00:21.720> job<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.680> you're<00:00:22.920> not<00:00:22.949> cutting

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
secondary job so that you're not cutting

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.460 
secondary job so that you're not cutting
right<00:00:23.730> over<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> first<00:00:24.449> job<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
right over the first job that's the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.950 
right over the first job that's the
first<00:00:25.710> benefit<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:27.180> second<00:00:27.599> benefit

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
first benefit to it the second benefit

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
first benefit to it the second benefit
as<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.130> I've<00:00:29.310> turned<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.760> my

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
as you can see here is I've turned on my

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.139 
as you can see here is I've turned on my
cross<00:00:30.390> cut<00:00:30.779> feature<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> available

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
cross cut feature and this is available

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.510 
cross cut feature and this is available
only<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> FC<00:00:34.020> seven<00:00:34.230> thousand<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.280> c/e

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
only in the FC seven thousand the c/e

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
only in the FC seven thousand the c/e
five<00:00:35.910> thousand<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.870> still<00:00:37.140> advance

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
five thousand you can still advance

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.049 
five thousand you can still advance
after<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> plot<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.700> doing<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
after the plot but if you're doing a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.119 
after the plot but if you're doing a
crosscut<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.350> knife<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
crosscut you have to take the knife and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.729 
crosscut you have to take the knife and
cut<00:00:41.399> across<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.000> material<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> like

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
cut across the material but what I like

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.190 
cut across the material but what I like
about<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:45.420> I've<00:00:45.660> got<00:00:45.809> several

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
about this is that if I've got several

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
about this is that if I've got several
repeat<00:00:46.800> jobs<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.610> trying<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.120> out

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
repeat jobs that I'm trying to get out

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.139 
repeat jobs that I'm trying to get out
like<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.840> making<00:00:49.530> multiple<00:00:49.800> decals<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.879> can

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
like if I making multiple decals I can

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.220 
like if I making multiple decals I can
go<00:00:51.300> ahead<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.930> find<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
go ahead and have them find the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
go ahead and have them find the
registration<00:00:52.350> mark<00:00:53.010> cut<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> job<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> then

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
registration mark cut the job and then

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
registration mark cut the job and then
slice<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.660> off<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> end<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.430> kind<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
slice it off at the end which is kind of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.060 
slice it off at the end which is kind of
a<00:00:56.789> neat<00:00:57.030> feature<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.530> keep<00:00:58.739> things

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a neat feature to have to keep things

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.130 
a neat feature to have to keep things
clean<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> need<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.989> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
clean the need then you have this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.200 
clean the need then you have this
additional<00:01:01.559> advance<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.820> may<00:01:03.000> have

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
additional advance now you may have

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
additional advance now you may have
different<00:01:03.600> uses<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.559> basically

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
different uses for this it's basically

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.460 
different uses for this it's basically
what<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.700> after<00:01:06.030> advances<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> plot<00:01:06.990> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
what it is is after advances the plot it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.410 
what it is is after advances the plot it
goes<00:01:07.680> ahead<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.310> advance<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:09.000> further

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
goes ahead and advance a further

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
goes ahead and advance a further
distance<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.229> whatever<00:01:10.530> value<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
distance of whatever value is in here so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730 
distance of whatever value is in here so
in<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.939> case<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:12.810> Vance<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> end

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
in this case it would Vance to the end

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.440 
in this case it would Vance to the end
of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> plot<00:01:14.159> which<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> sea<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.270> on

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
of the plot which is where the sea is on

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.330 
of the plot which is where the sea is on
the<00:01:15.540> graph<00:01:15.720> tech<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.619> advanced<00:01:16.950> another

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the graph tech and then advanced another

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.969 
the graph tech and then advanced another
24<00:01:17.939> inches<00:01:18.330> know<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.080> case<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.680> often

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
24 inches know in my case what I often

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.130 
24 inches know in my case what I often
do<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.549> when<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> print<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.330> cut<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> job<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
do is when I print and cut a job or I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
do is when I print and cut a job or I
cut<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.470> job<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.130> taking<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.580> someplace<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
cut a job and I'm taking it someplace I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
cut a job and I'm taking it someplace I
may<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.540> want<00:01:24.900> some<00:01:25.049> extra<00:01:25.350> material<00:01:25.470> to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
may have want some extra material to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
may have want some extra material to
wrap<00:01:26.159> around<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.880> material<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.810> actual

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
wrap around the material so the actual

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.069 
wrap around the material so the actual
job<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.560> protected<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.150> I've<00:01:30.299> added<00:01:30.329> 24

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
job is protected so here I've added 24

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.740 
job is protected so here I've added 24
inches<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.829> i'll<00:01:31.920> advance<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.759> job<00:01:33.030> advance

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
inches so i'll advance the job advance

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050 
inches so i'll advance the job advance
at<00:01:33.930> 24<00:01:34.409> inches<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> cross<00:01:35.310> cut<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:35.820> i<00:01:35.909> can

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
at 24 inches do a cross cut then i can

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.640 
at 24 inches do a cross cut then i can
roll<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> job<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
roll up the job so they can have that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.190 
roll up the job so they can have that
extra<00:01:37.979> 24<00:01:38.490> inches<00:01:38.850> wrap<00:01:39.090> around<00:01:39.450> my<00:01:39.630> material

section here is the weed lines now wheat
borders<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.280> handy<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.060> instead

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
borders are very handy in that instead

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.780 
borders are very handy in that instead
of<00:01:52.110> trying<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> cut<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> weed<00:01:53.070> border<00:01:53.460> around<00:01:53.549> it

of trying to cut a weed border around it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
of trying to cut a weed border around it
it'll<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.240> automatically<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it'll do it automatically so that you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.130 
it'll do it automatically so that you
can<00:01:55.860> simply<00:01:56.579> remove<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.180> material<00:01:57.450> without

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
can simply remove the material without

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.830 
can simply remove the material without
taking<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.860> lot<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> waste<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.850> using<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.570> time

taking a lot of waste or using up time

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.480 
taking a lot of waste or using up time
cutting<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.469> weed<00:02:01.799> border<00:02:02.159> yourself

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
cutting the weed border yourself

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.240 
cutting the weed border yourself
especially<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:03.000> larger<00:02:03.360> jobs<00:02:03.890> now<00:02:04.890> we

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
especially on larger jobs now we

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.340 
especially on larger jobs now we
simplified<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.000> process<00:02:06.149> even<00:02:06.689> further<00:02:07.049> by

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
simplified the process even further by

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
simplified the process even further by
adding<00:02:07.560> horizontal<00:02:08.429> weed<00:02:08.580> lines<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
adding horizontal weed lines and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.130 
adding horizontal weed lines and
vertical<00:02:09.599> weed

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
in that if I click this on you'll notice

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
in that if I click this on you'll notice
that<00:02:12.420> all<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.870> sudden<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:14.010> these<00:02:14.220> red

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
that all of a sudden there's these red

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.490 
that all of a sudden there's these red
lines<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:15.150> appear<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.600> between<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> lines

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
lines that appear in between the lines

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.280 
lines that appear in between the lines
and<00:02:16.709> what<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.890> does<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.310> looks<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.819> gaps

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
and what it does is it looks for gaps

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.010 
and what it does is it looks for gaps
within<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.530> weed<00:02:19.770> border<00:02:20.220> where<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.300> pass

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
within the weed border where it can pass

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.440 
within the weed border where it can pass
a<00:02:22.080> line<00:02:22.530> through<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.430> keeps<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.120> weeding

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
a line through so it keeps the weeding

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.150 
a line through so it keeps the weeding
simple<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.290> case<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:25.740> i<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.130> is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
simple so in this case what i can do is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.310 
simple so in this case what i can do is
i<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.459> weed<00:02:26.790> out<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.120> g<00:02:27.360> buy<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.600> sell<00:02:27.990> weed

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
i can weed out the g buy it sell weed

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.230 
i can weed out the g buy it sell weed
out<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> r<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> rather<00:02:29.670> than<00:02:29.910> trying

out the r and the a rather than trying

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.120 
out the r and the a rather than trying

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
to take the whole job and weed at all at

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.000 
to take the whole job and weed at all at
once<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:32.670> i<00:02:33.510> have<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> larger<00:02:34.260> job<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.860> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
once if i have a larger job this is a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
once if i have a larger job this is a
simplification<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:36.030> can't<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.750> missed

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
simplification that can't be missed

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.440

cutting<00:02:45.510> order<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.050> something<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.739> really<00:02:46.770> like

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
cutting order is something I really like

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
cutting order is something I really like
you<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:47.760> oftentimes<00:02:48.060> when<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> cut<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> job

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
you know oftentimes when you cut a job

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.020 
you know oftentimes when you cut a job
what<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.470> does<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:50.040> starts<00:02:50.430> at<00:02:50.550> one<00:02:50.790> letter

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
what it does it starts at one letter

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.270 
what it does it starts at one letter
goes<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.690> annex<00:02:52.019> jumps<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.709> here<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.160> then

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
goes to annex jumps up here and then

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.979 
goes to annex jumps up here and then
comes<00:02:53.459> back<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.120> goes<00:02:54.300> all<00:02:54.570> over<00:02:54.600> the

place very an inefficient way of cutting

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.199 
place very an inefficient way of cutting
in<00:02:58.110> my<00:02:58.260> eyes<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.890> what<00:02:59.400> we<00:02:59.519> added<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.030> this

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
in my eyes so what we added is this

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.960 
in my eyes so what we added is this
optimized<00:03:00.780> cutting<00:03:01.230> order<00:03:01.650> where<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.100> i<00:03:02.730> click

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
optimized cutting order where if i click

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.790 
optimized cutting order where if i click
on<00:03:03.150> speed<00:03:03.570> priority<00:03:04.080> what<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.380> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> do

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
on speed priority what it's going to do

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.949 
on speed priority what it's going to do
is<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.100> objects<00:03:05.550> will<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.850> cut<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.480> an<00:03:06.600> order

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
is the objects will be cut in an order

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.740 
is the objects will be cut in an order
that<00:03:07.110> maximizes<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.160> cutting<00:03:08.519> speed<00:03:08.970> so

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
that maximizes the cutting speed so

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.330 
that maximizes the cutting speed so
it'll<00:03:10.050> speed<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.650> process<00:03:10.830> because

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
it'll speed up the process because

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.340 
it'll speed up the process because
they'll<00:03:11.640> make<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:11.940> more<00:03:12.120> efficient<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.230> in

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350

about it this is more imperative when

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.540 
about it this is more imperative when
you're<00:04:18.769> doing<00:04:19.040> larger<00:04:19.519> jobs<00:04:20.650> now<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:22.280> number

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
you're doing larger jobs now the number

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.580 
you're doing larger jobs now the number
of<00:04:22.669> passes<00:04:23.090> kind<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.419> neat<00:04:23.900> feature<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.470> that

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
of passes kind of neat feature and that

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.189 
of passes kind of neat feature and that
if<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.280> have<00:04:25.520> like<00:04:25.970> say<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.210> thick<00:04:26.449> lamination

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
if you have like say a thick lamination

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.290 
if you have like say a thick lamination
where<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.650> need<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.010> cut<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.400> job<00:04:28.639> twice<00:04:28.970> or

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
where you need to cut the job twice or

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.750 
where you need to cut the job twice or
three<00:04:29.479> times<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:30.680> can<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.220> go<00:04:31.490> if<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.669> have

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
three times you can do that go if I have

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.370 
three times you can do that go if I have
a<00:04:31.790> lamination<00:04:32.180> here<00:04:32.540> it<00:04:32.660> will<00:04:32.780> cut<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.169> once

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
a lamination here it will cut it once

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.960 
a lamination here it will cut it once
and<00:04:33.590> then<00:04:33.710> cut<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:34.040> twice<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.520> kind<00:04:34.699> of<00:04:34.729> three

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
and then cut it twice and kind of three

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.629 
and then cut it twice and kind of three
times<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.660> like<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.470> said<00:04:36.530> it's<00:04:36.800> basically<00:04:37.310> for

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
times and like I said it's basically for

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.159 
times and like I said it's basically for
mature<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.240> that's<00:04:38.479> hard<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.930> cut

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
mature that you that's hard to cut

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.270 
mature that you that's hard to cut
through<00:04:39.199> that<00:04:39.560> where<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.770> need<00:04:39.949> a<00:04:39.979> couple

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
through that where you need a couple

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.950 
through that where you need a couple
passes<00:04:40.610> before<00:04:41.150> you<00:04:41.389> can<00:04:41.539> actually<00:04:41.690> get

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
passes before you can actually get

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.420 
passes before you can actually get
through<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.289> material<00:04:42.680> and<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.370> a

through the material and this is a

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.189 
through the material and this is a
common<00:04:43.760> practice<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:44.660> don't<00:04:44.750> be<00:04:44.900> afraid<00:04:45.169> to

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
common practice to so don't be afraid to

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.010 
common practice to so don't be afraid to
use<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:45.770> if<00:04:45.979> you<00:04:46.039> need<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.729> number<00:04:47.600> of<00:04:47.690> units

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
use this if you need to number of units

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.230 
use this if you need to number of units

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
which units you want to use after output

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.219 
which units you want to use after output
you<00:04:55.550> can<00:04:55.580> have<00:04:55.850> it<00:04:55.970> put<00:04:56.180> on<00:04:56.210> hold<00:04:56.570> or<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.110> can

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
you can have it put on hold or you can

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.719 
you can have it put on hold or you can
delete<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.710> now<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:57.919> always<00:04:58.100> like<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.400> have<00:04:58.610> it

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
delete it now I always like to have it

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.340 
delete it now I always like to have it
on<00:04:58.820> hold<00:04:59.090> just<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.539> case<00:04:59.720> if<00:04:59.900> something<00:05:00.199> goes

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.529 
on hold just in case if something goes
wrong<00:05:00.590> then<00:05:01.190> i<00:05:01.280> can<00:05:01.580> resend<00:05:01.760> the<00:05:02.060> job<00:05:02.330> without

wrong then i can resend the job without

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.450 
wrong then i can resend the job without

tunes<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:04.940> read<00:05:05.840> some<00:05:06.260> job<00:05:06.590> from<00:05:06.800> there<00:05:07.010> i<00:05:07.220> can

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
tunes and read some job from there i can

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.310 
tunes and read some job from there i can
go<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.360> queue<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.690> we<00:05:08.930> talked<00:05:09.169> about

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
go to the queue that we talked about

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.460 
go to the queue that we talked about
earlier<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:10.039> do<00:05:10.550> it<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.880> way<00:05:11.060> now<00:05:11.900> step<00:05:12.229> size

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
earlier and do it that way now step size

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.710 
earlier and do it that way now step size
is<00:05:12.650> very<00:05:12.710> important<00:05:13.460> as<00:05:13.639> i<00:05:14.210> mentioned<00:05:14.660> before

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
is very important as i mentioned before

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.890 
is very important as i mentioned before
step<00:05:15.590> size<00:05:15.860> has<00:05:16.820> to<00:05:17.030> do<00:05:17.180> with<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.479> number<00:05:17.780> of

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
step size has to do with the number of

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.810 
step size has to do with the number of
points<00:05:18.169> per<00:05:18.560> inch<00:05:18.740> so<00:05:18.889> in<00:05:19.160> this<00:05:19.280> case<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:19.729> a

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
points per inch so in this case it's a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.370 
points per inch so in this case it's a
thousand<00:05:20.240> sixteen<00:05:20.570> points<00:05:20.960> per<00:05:21.110> inch<00:05:21.289> which

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
thousand sixteen points per inch which

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.830 
thousand sixteen points per inch which
is<00:05:21.500> pretty<00:05:21.830> standard<00:05:22.190> but<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:23.060> problem<00:05:23.389> is<00:05:23.539> is

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
is pretty standard but the problem is is

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.719 
is pretty standard but the problem is is
that<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:24.169> have<00:05:24.380> four<00:05:24.740> different<00:05:24.950> resolutions

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
that you have four different resolutions

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.240 
that you have four different resolutions
so<00:05:26.479> if<00:05:26.630> my<00:05:26.810> resolution<00:05:27.470> on<00:05:27.560> my<00:05:27.680> cutter<00:05:27.979> is

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
so if my resolution on my cutter is

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.040 
so if my resolution on my cutter is
different<00:05:28.700> from<00:05:28.820> what<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.180> plotter<00:05:29.479> sent<00:05:29.900> or

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
different from what the plotter sent or

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.960 
different from what the plotter sent or
the<00:05:30.200> software<00:05:30.440> sends<00:05:31.039> then<00:05:31.580> it's<00:05:31.729> going<00:05:31.910> to

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
the software sends then it's going to

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.330 
the software sends then it's going to
cause<00:05:32.150> a<00:05:32.180> scaling<00:05:32.750> problem<00:05:33.200> so<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:34.099> always

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
cause a scaling problem so you always

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.860 
cause a scaling problem so you always
want<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.610> make<00:05:34.729> sure<00:05:34.789> your<00:05:35.150> plotter<00:05:35.419> is<00:05:35.630> set

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
want to make sure your plotter is set

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.310 
want to make sure your plotter is set
correctly<00:05:36.110> exactly<00:05:37.070> what<00:05:37.430> this<00:05:37.580> said<00:05:38.320> some

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
correctly exactly what this said some

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.000 
correctly exactly what this said some
people<00:05:39.440> ask<00:05:39.770> me<00:05:39.919> why<00:05:40.250> I<00:05:40.639> would<00:05:41.449> want<00:05:41.599> to<00:05:41.840> use

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
people ask me why I would want to use

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.850 
people ask me why I would want to use
254<00:05:43.010> points<00:05:43.460> as<00:05:43.580> opposed<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.139> 2500<00:05:45.139> 40<00:05:45.470> points

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
254 points as opposed to 2500 40 points

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920 
254 points as opposed to 2500 40 points
and<00:05:45.979> that's<00:05:46.130> just<00:05:46.400> depends<00:05:46.849> on<00:05:46.970> you<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.330> if<00:05:47.780> I'm

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
and that's just depends on you I if I'm

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.480 
and that's just depends on you I if I'm
doing<00:05:48.080> small<00:05:48.500> intricate<00:05:48.860> cutting<00:05:49.220> like

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
doing small intricate cutting like

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.140 
doing small intricate cutting like
characters<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.210> usually<00:05:50.900> use<00:05:51.699> 2540<00:05:52.699> points

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
characters I usually use 2540 points

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.120 
characters I usually use 2540 points
because<00:05:53.449> it<00:05:53.570> gets<00:05:53.690> a<00:05:53.810> smoother<00:05:54.199> edge<00:05:54.410> just

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
because it gets a smoother edge just

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.620 
because it gets a smoother edge just
means<00:05:55.310> that<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:55.880> cutting<00:05:56.180> is<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.330> little<00:05:56.539> bit

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
means that the cutting is a little bit

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.230 
means that the cutting is a little bit
slower<00:05:57.520> 254<00:05:58.520> if<00:05:58.669> you<00:05:58.760> go<00:05:58.880> to<00:05:58.940> lower

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
slower 254 if you go to lower

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.020 
slower 254 if you go to lower
resolutions<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.199> enables<00:06:01.130> you<00:06:01.250> to<00:06:01.280> actually

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
resolutions it enables you to actually

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.180 
resolutions it enables you to actually
output<00:06:02.539> faster<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.349> a<00:06:03.410> faster<00:06:03.830> throughput

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
output faster and a faster throughput

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
output faster and a faster throughput
output<00:06:05.180> if<00:06:05.360> need<00:06:05.900> be<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.830> then<00:06:07.070> what<00:06:08.060> I<00:06:08.090> like

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
output if need be and then what I like

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.210 
output if need be and then what I like
to<00:06:08.570> use<00:06:08.720> personally<00:06:09.229> is<00:06:09.320> I<00:06:09.410> just<00:06:09.620> use<00:06:09.770> choose

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
to use personally is I just use choose

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.240 
to use personally is I just use choose
1016<00:06:11.030> because<00:06:11.240> that's<00:06:11.419> basically<00:06:11.510> a<00:06:12.289> standard

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
1016 because that's basically a standard

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.200 
1016 because that's basically a standard
generic<00:06:13.760> size<00:06:14.120> that<00:06:14.960> you

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
generic size that you

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.850 
generic size that you
use<00:06:15.449> but<00:06:15.750> once<00:06:15.780> again<00:06:16.080> just<00:06:16.380> make<00:06:16.530> sure<00:06:16.680> your

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
use but once again just make sure your

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.620 
use but once again just make sure your
plotters<00:06:17.250> set<00:06:17.490> up<00:06:17.610> exactly<00:06:18.000> at<00:06:18.479> that

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
plotters set up exactly at that

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.340 
plotters set up exactly at that
resolution<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:20.340> last<00:06:20.630> section<00:06:21.630> here<00:06:21.960> has<00:06:22.199> to

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
do with using registration marks now

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:26.930 
do with using registration marks now
keep<00:06:25.530> in<00:06:25.680> mind<00:06:25.949> that<00:06:26.099> if<00:06:26.370> i<00:06:26.610> didn't<00:06:26.910> have

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
keep in mind that if i didn't have

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.689 
keep in mind that if i didn't have
registration<00:06:27.419> marks<00:06:27.900> on<00:06:28.020> my<00:06:28.110> job<00:06:28.440> then<00:06:29.310> this

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
registration marks on my job then this

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.279 
registration marks on my job then this
would<00:06:30.000> just<00:06:30.180> be<00:06:30.300> disappeared<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.110> if<00:06:31.199> you

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
would just be disappeared so if you

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.689 
would just be disappeared so if you
don't<00:06:31.410> see<00:06:31.530> it<00:06:31.800> that<00:06:31.830> means<00:06:32.130> that<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:32.430> haven't

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 
don't see it that means that you haven't

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.850 
don't see it that means that you haven't
created<00:06:32.910> your<00:06:33.090> registration<00:06:33.810> marks<00:06:34.110> or<00:06:34.289> you

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
created your registration marks or you
