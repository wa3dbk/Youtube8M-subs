00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.369
 Good afternoon, or good night, good afternoon to you. 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.340
 depending on when and when you come 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:32.109
 this video my name is Moraes and 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:35.890
 damage a video a lot of protein that goes 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:40.540
 to start my new series what has 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.270
 to win in which I'm rolling some 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.850
 attacks that there were some friends is 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.190
 for you entertainment so I hope 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.440
 that these years of life that I am going to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.870
 take and it's the second something to 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.210
 you I just woke up so the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.649
 my magic voice alone is deep and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.160
 also how he put paid for each 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.130
 music fan bitch is on is the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.029
 makes my long look is that the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.909
 names that you find in the 

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:15.729
 sweet pingo frozen shelves 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.549
 is thus any of the ways in which 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.159
 I mean, this is if I'm leaving. 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.349
 then this clause at the end of the video is the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.399
 well because I'm watching educam trike 

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:30.009
 offensive balloon or cs go as I want 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.599
 Calling is a game that anyone who leaves for the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.579
 ps never played on pc fps so it is 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.799
 It's very difficult for me to get used to this. 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.069
 I'm a great year but I think once 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:45.099
 I already killed two or three or that view. 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:47.409
 keep one or two too and I'll go 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:49.919
 try to get away with in and that is juninho 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.810
 a big one should be playing this 

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:55.929
 that those who have this pc game that was 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.799
 play with this year estimates my use x 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.529
 moraes 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.739
 I would also like to take this opportunity to suggest a 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:06.279
 Certainly I'm going to do things. 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:08.849
 funny is to check emails that you 

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:12.460
 look at my followers on twitter 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.490
 also born steve is e 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.150
 and it is in this form I will leave below one 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.040
 link so you can not follow is 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.020
 I recall that my born extreme channel 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.820
 int had to be changed for how long 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.450
 was closed 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.840
 someone did box that the channel was walking 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.040
 do things but I do not know what it is then 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.340
 I had to change my address 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.510
 so instead of moraes game now and 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.380
 morals hvm ae set china and paying the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.900
 Morales paid epa here also I suggest 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.230
 simple, want to talk to me, it's for 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.240
 besides skype, it is logical that the asc 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.410
 a question and answer platform is 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.270
 answers 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.950
 It's funny and they ask questions. 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.080
 directly to me because I answered 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.290
 when life will leave the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.510
 link if you want to be friends on facebook 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.670
 also displayed in gaza apron yet 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:12.160
 improve our who is and is thus staying 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.230
 here I found it very short as I said 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.530
 I am a big club and has also father 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.010

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.650
 I played a lot and I hope you enjoy it. 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.170
 first caught on this street is hip and me 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.470
 I was dying of takhar beak and I think it is 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.520
 a funny idea basically me 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.220
 on the south and I say look at this 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.110

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.730

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.630
 Youtube channel 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:48.330

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.330
 enjoy solo until the next 21 am wall 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:59.230

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.910
 drooled only gave me but three of those 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.650
 disks 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.410
 No, I'm not going to live the first one, talk to 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.260
 people and just wants to know something 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.940
 to see there's no team to play with me 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.780
 You 're already having to talk to me. 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:22.500
 time that I know yes and also only with 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.500
 this rain until I finish doing it 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:31.600
 because consumption was this because at last 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.940
 a dude is however due not to spend 500 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.690

 Go out I know by day this is for 504 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.169
 because he does not know that I do not 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.240

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.830
 effort 3 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.960
 I think I already knew but now I 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.990
 playing the lack of fake money when 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:02.760
