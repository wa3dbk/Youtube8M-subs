00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
it not that I like writing notes but

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.710 
it not that I like writing notes but
anyways<00:03:16.590> yeah<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.040> point<00:03:17.250> um<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.209> have<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
anyways yeah you the point um I have to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.229 
anyways yeah you the point um I have to
come<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.350> few<00:03:19.860> conclusions<00:03:19.890> they're<00:03:20.850> pretty

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
come to a few conclusions they're pretty

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.509 
come to a few conclusions they're pretty
nice<00:03:21.390> one<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.260> that<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.650> tip<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.980> pressure

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
nice one is that the tip is pressure

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.479 
nice one is that the tip is pressure
sensitive<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.049> want<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.230> write<00:03:25.489> one

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
sensitive so if you want to write one

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.539 
sensitive so if you want to write one
faint<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.660> faint<00:03:28.110> line<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.280> see<00:03:29.400> there's

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
faint one faint line you can see there's

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.759 
faint one faint line you can see there's
like<00:03:29.670> two<00:03:29.940> different<00:03:30.049> thicknesses<00:03:31.049> or<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.650> you

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
like two different thicknesses or if you

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.070 
like two different thicknesses or if you
press<00:03:32.010> harder<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:33.180> get<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.330> thicker<00:03:33.840> line

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
press harder you get a thicker line

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.229 
press harder you get a thicker line
which<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.530> nice<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.329> with<00:03:36.329> that<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:38.070> mind<00:03:38.970> if

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
which is nice and with that in mind if

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.640 
which is nice and with that in mind if
you<00:03:39.420> press<00:03:39.660> down<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.200> know<00:03:40.290> how<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.440> press
