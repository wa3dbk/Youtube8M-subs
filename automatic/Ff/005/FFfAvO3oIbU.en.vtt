install with three virtual servers on it
three<00:00:14.190> virtual<00:00:14.460> servers<00:00:14.820> will<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.000> installing

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
three virtual servers will be installing

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.570 
three virtual servers will be installing

will be small business Server 2008 and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.310 
will be small business Server 2008 and
then<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:17.970> will<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.270> two<00:00:18.480> additional<00:00:18.720> servers

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
then we will have two additional servers

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.800 
then we will have two additional servers
one<00:00:19.529> will<00:00:19.710> be<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:20.060> sequel<00:00:21.060> server<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.630> the

features and newest features of this
particular<00:01:32.130> system<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.150> believe<00:01:33.180> Dell

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
particular system and I believe Dell

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.149 
particular system and I believe Dell
servers<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> only<00:01:34.409> ones<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.950> this

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
servers are the only ones that do this

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:35.749 
servers are the only ones that do this
right<00:01:35.369> now

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
right now

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.450 
right now
