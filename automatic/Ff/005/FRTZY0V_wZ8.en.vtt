00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.460
 so hello people today i want you 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.389
 show how i equip 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.250
 one of my best fishing rods 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 this fishing rod is called fishing rod in a nod and 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.109
 Now I'll show you how I did 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 equip with some nuances 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.240
 for each criterion so for 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.279
 fishing rods, we need equipment itself 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.219
 fishing rod now I will stop in detail 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:40.190
 what properties should it have 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.190
 need braided cord reel 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.300
 you need a jigger as a rule it's white 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.770
 or 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 yellow mormyshka summer big crochet and 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.320
 Naturally he needs a nod nods are 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.630
 different and now Iâ€™ll dwell at length 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.960
 on every subject and so if we say 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.240
 about 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 fishing rod fishing rod should have such 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.250
 property like stiffness 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.650
 its that we pull out the fish from 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 reeds and usually we do not give fish 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.840
 go into the reeds, respectively, we flow 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.900
 how to be tough and we are straight 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 choose fish from reeds 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.560
 if we talk about the size of the rod 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.650
 optimal optimal length 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.430
 fishing rod should be three and a half 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.390
 dash four and a half meters 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.360
 there is one nuance and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.240
 Good luck you need to cut will 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.049
 tip ie ring from the very end 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.420
 so that you can freely 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.090
 put a nod and fasten it here on 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.360
 the end of the fishing rod is desirable of course 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.070
 if you can choose a fishing rod 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.270
 easier, otherwise it will be difficult for you 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.379
 work second moment for catching crucian 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.250
 and carp in reeds braided thread 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:20.280
 is the best case option 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 the fact that the wicker cuts very well 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.849
 reed especially when it is green and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.849
 young personally i use pond braided 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.500
 diameter 0 2 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.940
 sometimes 03 mostly i use 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.610
 diameter 0 3 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.750
 as a rule summer mormyshka begins 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.170
 from 2 3 UAH 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.370
 in my version the jig weighs only 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.390
 only 4 grams and 4 grams is for here 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.910
 Such a nod is the best option in 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.819
 this version I have a nod spring 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.629
 the type of which is the basis of which 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:01.409
 spring there are other options nod 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.650
 but I like this one a little 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.170
 I want to elaborate on 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.209
 coils coil preferably like this 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.430
 launcher is not even desirable but you can 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.590
 say necessarily with such a launcher 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.670
 device that is when the fish 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.190
 pulls we pull the line for what 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.489
 The fact that the catch and tend to 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.879
 reeds 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.049
 in the reeds and a half and a maximum of two 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:35.280
 meter if we have a fishing rod for example 4 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:38.819
 meter it turns out that when 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.670
 vyvazhivanii fish we have it high 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.060
 bully often happens so i catch 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.849
 fish a kilo and a half, respectively 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.220
 I'll just break the bait and in order to 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.800
 This did not happen here for this lever 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.280
 I press and very quickly bleed 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.250
 s-coupe thus I lead the fish straight along 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.740
 surface what nuance have similar 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:09.090
 coils desirable to look inside 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:11.580
 inside the coil what's the nuance here is not it 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.019
 is that some 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.870
 the coils here is a cog wheel 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:24.540
 is plastic and when we often 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:28.110
 Bleed fishing line here in this 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.530
 option here this stopper here it is this 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.880
 the stopper eats it very quickly 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.130
 plastic wheel 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.070
 therefore it is desirable that she be 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.240
 iron here is also not very 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.190
 a nice nuance here is this pen as a rule 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.160
 plastic there are moments like that 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.040
 fishing line flies forget that pen and if 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.330
 the fish is big and it just breaks also 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.930
 handle break even while transporting fishing rods 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.600
 I chose this coil for myself 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.020
 you are the best option 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.020
 here the handle is iron all the same 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:12.570
 present if you look inwards 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:15.120
 that we also see iron wheels 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.710
 what is most important for us but 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.710
 all now collect the bait 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:32.150
 braided fishing line we pass in the nod me 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.150
 in this case, inside the nod 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:45.689
 and so through Kiev I broke through now 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:48.899
 insert in if you tip fishing rods 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:53.259
 too thin it can be fixed 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:56.490
 again winding a piece of electrical tape here 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:06:03.550
 we had such a dream 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:05.649
 tying duckling mormyshk here he 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.809
 hook or be sure to tie it 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:15.309
 through the inside that's all after 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:16.360
 I think you need to do one more and 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.479
 he 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.979
 measures is just this nod 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:26.740
 when we fish a fish, we have a fish 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:30.069
 Here begins such movements do 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.879
 have a fishing rod end up 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:36.099
 can cut through our gum 

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:37.899
 besides we have tires will be constantly 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.969
 move i have this way 

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:44.169
 rotate under load 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:47.469
 so that it is not needed here either 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:50.469
 glue this rubber nod very 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:54.759
 rubber base forging or wind 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:56.769
 thread or tape is very tight I 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.379
 I usually make electrical tape 

00:06:56.769 --> 00:07:00.639
 in order to attach the hook somewhere I 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:04.149
 doing this way 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:07.000
 I take here primatyvaem simply 

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:08.830
 hard steam everything 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.310
 my hook is not holding well 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:30.270
 I just do not have problems with 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:33.070
 we wind fishing rods I almost forgot 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.350
 subscribe to my channel put here 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.710
 Like and go to the VKontakte group 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:41.160
 there are some articles that you still 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.160
 did not see
