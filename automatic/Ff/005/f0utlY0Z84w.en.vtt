wrong way but as you can see it fits

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.700 
wrong way but as you can see it fits
right<00:02:02.329> in<00:02:02.509> if<00:02:02.840> you<00:02:02.960> don't<00:02:03.140> know<00:02:03.200> how<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.380> do<00:02:03.560> it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
now you take the red and white that's

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.219 
now you take the red and white that's
only<00:02:08.030> needs<00:02:08.179> for<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.509> cuz<00:02:08.750> your<00:02:08.869> video<00:02:09.110> will

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229
