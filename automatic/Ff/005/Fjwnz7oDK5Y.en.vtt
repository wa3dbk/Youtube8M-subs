00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
today I was messing around and I made

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.350 
today I was messing around and I made
this<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.009> red<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:33.059> kind<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
this one which is red just kind of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.700 
this one which is red just kind of
matched<00:00:33.540> interior<00:00:34.020> better<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.500> change

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
matched interior better and just change

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.350 
matched interior better and just change
it<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.250> doesn't<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.730> look<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> same

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it up it doesn't really look the same

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.680 
it up it doesn't really look the same
shade<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:38.059> through<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> cameras<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
shade on the through the cameras it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.840 
shade on the through the cameras it
doesn't<00:00:39.960> person<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
