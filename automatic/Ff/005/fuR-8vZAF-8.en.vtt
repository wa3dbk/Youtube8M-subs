it takes pictures and both video for
video<00:01:52.680> you'd<00:01:52.890> push<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.310> down<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:56.070> stop

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
video you'd push this down and to stop

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.399 
video you'd push this down and to stop
video<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.030> push<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> down<00:01:57.540> again<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.200> take<00:01:58.350> a

just want to let you know that when you
are<00:02:04.740> doing<00:02:05.130> video<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.869> let's<00:02:06.990> say<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:07.229> push

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
are doing video so let's say I'm push

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.160 
are doing video so let's say I'm push
this<00:02:07.649> down<00:02:07.860> there'll<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:09.239> red

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
this down there'll be a little red

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.930 
this down there'll be a little red
recording<00:02:10.890> light<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.340> there

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
recording light in there

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.840 
recording light in there
and<00:02:12.090> when<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.990> turn<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.200> off<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.670> red

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
and when you turn it off the red

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.640 
and when you turn it off the red
recording<00:02:15.240> light<00:02:15.300> will<00:02:15.510> go<00:02:15.630> away<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:16.500> it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
recording light will go away now it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.530 
recording light will go away now it's
important<00:02:17.190> let's<00:02:17.520> say<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.790> you're<00:02:17.910> out<00:02:18.180> flying

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
important let's say if you're out flying

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.630 
important let's say if you're out flying
and<00:02:18.840> maybe<00:02:19.050> you're<00:02:19.230> pretty<00:02:19.500> far<00:02:19.740> away<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.280> it

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and maybe you're pretty far away and it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.540 
and maybe you're pretty far away and it
starts<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.060> die<00:02:21.270> stop<00:02:22.200> your<00:02:22.440> video<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:23.400> if

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
starts to die stop your video because if

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.730 
starts to die stop your video because if
this<00:02:23.730> quadcopter<00:02:24.030> does<00:02:24.570> die<00:02:24.810> you're<00:02:25.590> gonna

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
this quadcopter does die you're gonna

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.220 
this quadcopter does die you're gonna
lose<00:02:26.010> your<00:02:26.220> footage<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.850> I've<00:02:27.420> caught<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> lot

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
lose your footage and I've caught a lot

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.660 
lose your footage and I've caught a lot
of<00:02:28.620> footage<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:29.160> isn't<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.550> only

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
of footage this isn't the only

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.060 
of footage this isn't the only
quadcopter<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.540> does<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:31.650> what<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
quadcopter that does that but what it

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.340 
quadcopter that does that but what it
does<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.120> stops<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.750> midair<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
does is it it just stops in midair and

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.130 
does is it it just stops in midair and
the<00:02:35.130> footage<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:35.940> saved<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.660> will<00:02:36.750> come<00:02:36.960> up

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
the footage is not saved it will come up

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.600 
the footage is not saved it will come up
as<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:38.090> zero<00:02:39.090> file<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.780> just<00:02:40.140> keep<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.440> mind

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
as a zero file so just keep that in mind

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.630 
as a zero file so just keep that in mind
over<00:02:41.610> here<00:02:41.820> we<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.210> other<00:02:42.480> trims<00:02:42.930> and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
over here we have the other trims and

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.340 
over here we have the other trims and
then<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.880> top<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> trigger<00:02:45.960> on<00:02:46.200> the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
then on top we have a trigger on the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.530 
then on top we have a trigger on the
left<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.270> left

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
left and the right the one on the left

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.910 
left and the right the one on the left
will<00:02:48.780> actually<00:02:49.140> go<00:02:49.290> through<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.770> two

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
will actually go through the two

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.190 
will actually go through the two
different<00:02:50.250> modes<00:02:50.460> we<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.820> below<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:52.110> you'll

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
different modes we have below and you'll

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.750 
different modes we have below and you'll
see<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> little<00:02:52.590> L<00:02:52.860> down<00:02:53.130> there<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
see a little L down there on the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.630 
see a little L down there on the
transmitter<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.600> switch<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.350> high

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
transmitter and switch that to high

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.980 
transmitter and switch that to high
switch<00:02:56.640> between<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.150> writes<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.720> then<00:02:57.780> we

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
switch between the writes and then we

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.420 
switch between the writes and then we
have<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.560> 3d<00:02:59.780> flip<00:03:00.780> button<00:03:01.380> trigger<00:03:01.860> over<00:03:02.100> here

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
have a 3d flip button trigger over here

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.400 
have a 3d flip button trigger over here
we<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.760> push<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.120> one<00:03:03.360> time<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.020> then

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
we just push that one time and then

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.740 
we just push that one time and then
we'll<00:03:04.530> push<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:06.120> right<00:03:06.330> stick<00:03:06.600> whatever

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
we'll push this the right stick whatever

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.820 
we'll push this the right stick whatever
way<00:03:07.080> we<00:03:07.230> want<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.590> flip<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.840> see<00:03:09.840> oh<00:03:09.870> beep<00:03:10.170> tilt

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
way we want to flip and see oh beep tilt

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.240 
way we want to flip and see oh beep tilt
flips<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.730> boom<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.800> once<00:03:13.800> again<00:03:13.920> I'm<00:03:14.130> really

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
flips and boom so once again I'm really

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.310 
flips and boom so once again I'm really
diggin<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.880> design<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.390> this<00:03:15.540> thing<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:15.990> you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
diggin the design of this thing if you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.830 
diggin the design of this thing if you
look<00:03:16.500> at<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.830> contours<00:03:17.790> how<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.210> kind<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.420> arcs

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
look at the contours how it kind of arcs

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.500 
look at the contours how it kind of arcs
in<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.020> front<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:20.010> maybe<00:03:20.490> wind<00:03:20.820> dynamics<00:03:21.390> or

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
in the front for maybe wind dynamics or

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.850 
in the front for maybe wind dynamics or
anything<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.110> thing<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.620> cuts

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
anything but this thing just cuts

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.190 
anything but this thing just cuts
through<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.220> air<00:03:23.250> really<00:03:23.700> good<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.330> I'm<00:03:25.020> just

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
through the air really good and I'm just

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.710 
through the air really good and I'm just
gonna<00:03:25.320> show<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.620> me<00:03:26.130> flying<00:03:26.460> it<00:03:26.610> now<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.060> that

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
gonna show you me flying it now so that

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.890 
gonna show you me flying it now so that
