00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 teaching to load 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.140
 It's a theme 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.430
 vega has been par excellence of san bernardo 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 but sometimes its opening but not 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.140
 let's see how 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.180
 as sequels a single 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.530
 we start with the power chords an unmissable package 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.730
 in the previous processes 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.720
 the schools 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.460
 that wolf with dialogue as a simple way to do anything we support him 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 we take a turn of curve five and so we have in Chile 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.489
 we come well except those chords the three-string cd then one 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.770
 way it would be the flea - the port 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.340
 the case of the young painter 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.340
 you know what 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 and in the nike quintal agree in the next with the catchphrase caught 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.899
 ok they are blows to the air 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.959
 percent looks at the animal origin or assets but I think the disagreements 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.009
 that's why we do 1 3 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.290
 lacuerda 6 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.290
 and again 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.469
 sister companies of shortage but I'm afraid that this bet 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.189
 Although we will not be the spokesman for Harpo, we will join in sciences 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.950
 of the wine in the Umbrian accent and so you mouths yourselves 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:31.520
 the foot injury 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.640
 at 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.250
 several ways to really do it only your apple side 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.409
 from Deputy Attorney Jose or it's easier 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.069
 they went into recession 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.269
 strings 4 and 5 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.289
 and before that deficit 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:51.289
 they had done it for a town that he 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.079
 once checked the fingers but his books 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.779
 and so get dragging them and then you get very fast 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:03.779
 5 7 5% 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.469
 he is the official version to the agreement 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.459
 a way to do it 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.960
 it is colon 2 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.009
 to achieve it would be annulled 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.009
 of the 3 200 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.389
 ok and to access or we want it very much there will be a cigar 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.739
 then some way that is intermediate 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.319
 that's why thieves, rapists and abusers 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:48.729
 day to day 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.949
 but that only four are best way to establish 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.469
 the most complicated 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.279
 over time, the practice that is best for them to keep what they 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.560
 we know Valenzuela to transfer Roman 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:15.919
 the selection 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.900
 we started work perspective 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.900
 tegucigalpa after the physical journey 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.330
 we will invest entity in this sense that to not hesitate 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.300
 let's go whatever is free 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.220
 the most complex part of firefighters of course of the session 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.270
 the ice 3 meters long by 4 to 1 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.409
 but that's the thing of always burgos 4 5 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.620
 another seven and we add the rope if it comes out 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.900
 and we do it 7 7 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.900
 the population 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.770
 vargas among others 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.579
 the text that to change the '9' alonso simply by changing the dialog to 

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.579
 that raised a little crazy 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.629
 to explain the position of the hand of God the ccl 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.059
 then we move on after the closing of the agreement as before 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:30.899
 but instead of his life with the a-6 we make a 7 5 7 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.210
 after the first division we will do in this part of the body 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.210
 so let's show how it sounds 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.699
 she was kidnapped 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.699
 finally arrived efe 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.710
 we change leo trains 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.839
 by 2 

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.839
 we work a disaster 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.189
 so it would give us a chord with the number one in 3d 3d worked five 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.549
 injured while of 4 of the agreement four goals 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.369
 we go down same province 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:23.369
 valentine laboratory towers 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:30.499
 we make you look at the drawing 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.449
 said work affirmed rsf 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.169
 in that care work 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.439
 state 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.969
 we have seen the work we are going to stop seeing how this last part will be 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.919
 for what we should do is an idea is that you will see how I see 

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:04.809
 progressive of the uvi-mobile his name 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:14.059
 each
