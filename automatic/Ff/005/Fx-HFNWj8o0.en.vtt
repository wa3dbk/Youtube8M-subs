their<00:00:52.590> infinite<00:00:52.980> worlds<00:00:53.579> um<00:00:54.800> it's<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.190> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
their infinite worlds um it's kind of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.290 
their infinite worlds um it's kind of
reasonable<00:00:56.899> because<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.550> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
reasonable because you know like that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.219

there has to be a limit to some extent

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.590 
there has to be a limit to some extent
but<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.409> does<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.619> mean<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.360> still

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
