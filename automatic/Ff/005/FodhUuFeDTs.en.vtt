00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 Katie Hoff 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.190
 and 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.590
 for the delphine team we were at 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.620
 departure I think we were eight or nine 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.300
 in those waters it was really a 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.640
 small structure and so we were 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.830
 all red in the attic the old 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.030
 cliche of the group of friends who make their 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.430
 game in their cellar not this city 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.440
 who was the website director and 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.080
 see you by saying listen paul it takes 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.670
 that you are working on on a game because 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.070
 that we have the opportunity to do 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.199
 the adaptation of a film that is the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.800
 godfather I had decided to transcribe in 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.870
 does the story of michael corleone in 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.000
 the future in a future where they would be 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.430
 pursued by mafiosi we had a 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.050
 VCR an old TV and actually 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.100
 one with filming with cameras in the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.950
 hallways or outside 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.800
 some had the shame of their lives and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.690
 so we get pretty lively up there 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.229
 reproduced each hand animal a 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.399
 by one 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.720
 they were reproduced after 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.710
 the animation of La Liga since it was 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.130
 on a media who worked at 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.720
 the time 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.420
 and finally when we showed this 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.140
 mockup to the direction there was a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.850
 white silence because 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.380
 it was so different from the universe 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 of the godfather that immediately understood 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.530
 that it was not going to stick but they told me 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.460
 said here is your thing is great I think 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.680
 that we can do something about it and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.680
 this is how flash back and d 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.530
 a remake twenty years after that is some 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.490
 something that needs to mature in fact and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 finally 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.850
 after 20 years said yes because there is 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.439
 maybe something to do because 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.229
 that it has evolved so much 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.119
 changed that there is way to do whatever 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.119
 something new and interresting angry 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.370
 we have something much more 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.769
 much more fluid much more 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.290
 responsive than before as we have gone beyond 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.090
 3d we really did a lot of work 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.420
 on on life in the decor all that 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.299
 animated the vapors the fogs the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.430
 detections year I actually took over 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.560
 passages of the ancients 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.420
 of the old flashbacks and young is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.640
 incorporated into the new level design 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.590
 it was more in the desire to stay 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.209
 faithful but especially not to break this 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.489
 which was interesting about the gameplay 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.360
 he himself has changed a lot 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.210
 also because 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.440
 the 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.050
 the combat system were 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 relatively limited at the time even though 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.690
 market very well for the time when I 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.490
 think today there was my 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.710
 really need to dust off the 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.130
 difficulty I think stopped preserving 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:23.190
 in fact do not betray the original game 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.190
 and bring in all the modern comforts 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.470
 somehow to the players without that 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.780
 in fact, neither the difficulty nor the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.780
 challenge one win32
