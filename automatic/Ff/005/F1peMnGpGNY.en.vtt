00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
of the big problems I had with writing a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.000 
of the big problems I had with writing a
book<00:03:19.709> was<00:03:20.010> what<00:03:20.370> tense<00:03:20.700> should<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.299> write<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.629> in

book was what tense should I write it in

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.170 
book was what tense should I write it in
obviously<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.159> all<00:03:23.280> happened<00:03:23.760> first

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
obviously it's all happened first

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.610 
obviously it's all happened first
several<00:03:24.420> versions<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.110> book<00:03:25.319> were<00:03:25.500> all

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
several versions of the book were all

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.030 
several versions of the book were all
within<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.040> past<00:03:26.340> tense<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:28.260> dawned<00:03:28.829> on

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
within the past tense and it dawned on

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.640 
within the past tense and it dawned on
me<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.420> it's<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.720> wrong<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.349> do<00:03:31.439> it<00:03:31.560> in

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
me that it's really wrong to do it in

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.860 
me that it's really wrong to do it in
the<00:03:31.769> past<00:03:31.950> tense<00:03:32.250> because<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:33.359> is<00:03:33.569> all

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the past tense because this is all
