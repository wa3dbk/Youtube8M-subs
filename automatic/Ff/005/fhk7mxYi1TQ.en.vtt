00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:08.840 

we're<00:00:08.069> going<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.250> show<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.460> guys<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:08.670> to

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:08.850 
we're going to show you guys how to

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.300 
we're going to show you guys how to
actually<00:00:09.180> install<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.840> CPU<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.590> into<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.310 
actually install the CPU I into the

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.770 
actually install the CPU I into the
motherboard<00:00:11.520> so<00:00:11.970> there's<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.510> couple<00:00:12.600> of

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
motherboard so there's a couple of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.360 
motherboard so there's a couple of
points<00:00:13.050> of<00:00:13.140> consideration<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.340> just

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
points of consideration one you just

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.530 
points of consideration one you just
want<00:00:14.640> to<00:00:14.670> make<00:00:14.760> sure<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.000> give<00:00:15.150> yourself<00:00:15.240> an

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
want to make sure and give yourself an

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.140 
want to make sure and give yourself an
entire<00:00:15.840> amount<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.039> space<00:00:17.369> that's<00:00:17.760> needed

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
entire amount of space that's needed

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.900 
entire amount of space that's needed
it's<00:00:18.780> not<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.380> very<00:00:19.830> technical<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.460> complicated

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's not a very technical or complicated

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.760 
it's not a very technical or complicated
process<00:00:21.360> but<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.690> it<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.440> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
process but it it is going to be a

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.200 
process but it it is going to be a
little<00:00:23.100> bit<00:00:23.220> sensitive<00:00:23.610> in<00:00:23.789> terms<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> just

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
little bit sensitive in terms of just

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.880 
little bit sensitive in terms of just
having<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.869> little<00:00:24.990> bit<00:00:25.170> more<00:00:25.289> disparity<00:00:25.860> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
having a little bit more disparity a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.050 
having a little bit more disparity a
little<00:00:26.100> bit<00:00:26.220> more<00:00:26.310> control<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
little bit more control so it's just

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.220 
little bit more control so it's just
going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> make<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> easier<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.020> give<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
going to make it easier if you give it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.349 
going to make it easier if you give it
if<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.130> give<00:00:29.279> yourself<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.670> clean<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.210> easy

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
if you give yourself a clean and easy

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.899 
if you give yourself a clean and easy
and<00:00:30.630> open<00:00:30.960> work<00:00:31.140> environment<00:00:31.729> for<00:00:32.729> you<00:00:32.789> guys

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:32.909 
and open work environment for you guys

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:34.669 
and open work environment for you guys
that<00:00:32.940> maybe<00:00:33.239> don't<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.960> very<00:00:34.170> flat<00:00:34.499> or

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:34.679 
that maybe don't have a very flat or

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.860 
that maybe don't have a very flat or
even<00:00:34.920> surface<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.879> quick<00:00:36.269> tip<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.569> you<00:00:36.659> can<00:00:36.780> go

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
even surface a quick tip is you can go

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.299 
even surface a quick tip is you can go
ahead<00:00:36.929> and<00:00:37.050> take<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.319> motherboard<00:00:37.710> box<00:00:37.979> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
ahead and take the motherboard box and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.430 
ahead and take the motherboard box and
you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.789> use<00:00:38.999> the<00:00:39.179> box<00:00:39.389> as<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:39.960> surface<00:00:40.289> where

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you can use the box as the surface where

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.439 
you can use the box as the surface where
you<00:00:40.530> put<00:00:40.679> the<00:00:40.769> motherboard<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.190> top<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.639> so

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
you put the motherboard on top of so

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:43.549 
you put the motherboard on top of so
that<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.929> ahead<00:00:43.019> and<00:00:43.139> just<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.499> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that you can go ahead and just have a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.569 
that you can go ahead and just have a
little<00:00:43.679> bit<00:00:43.859> more<00:00:43.949> stability<00:00:44.129> when<00:00:44.460> we're

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
little bit more stability when we're

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.059 
little bit more stability when we're
working<00:00:44.789> through<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.059> process<00:00:45.299> so<00:00:46.079> first<00:00:46.859> up

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:47.069 
working through this process so first up

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:48.649 
working through this process so first up
we<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.519> a<00:00:47.670> course<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.299> motherboard

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
we have a course here the motherboard

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.479 
we have a course here the motherboard
out<00:00:48.839> and<00:00:49.199> you<00:00:49.769> can<00:00:49.799> see<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.219> there's<00:00:50.370> an

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
out and you can see that there's an

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.809 
out and you can see that there's an
actual<00:00:51.709> excuse<00:00:52.709> me<00:00:52.829> there's<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> socket

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:53.819 
actual excuse me there's the socket

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.789 
actual excuse me there's the socket
plate<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.209> place<00:00:54.659> so<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.379> we're<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.649> do

CPU<00:01:32.760> cover<00:01:33.510> in<00:01:33.780> place<00:01:34.320> okay<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.010> make<00:01:35.280> sure<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
CPU cover in place okay so make sure and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
CPU cover in place okay so make sure and
just<00:01:35.670> keep<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.910> hold<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.810> next<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
just keep a hold of that so next up is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
just keep a hold of that so next up is
we<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> actual<00:01:38.160> CPU<00:01:38.730> itself<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.480> this<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
we have the actual CPU itself so this is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.680 
we have the actual CPU itself so this is
our<00:01:40.050> 4770k<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:41.640> installation<00:01:41.910> process<00:01:42.300> what

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
our 4770k this installation process what

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.240 
our 4770k this installation process what
one<00:01:42.780> hundred<00:01:42.990> percent<00:01:43.020> apply<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:44.070> any

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
well as it would apply to a 4670k so you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.280 
well as it would apply to a 4670k so you
can<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:50.790> here's<00:01:51.120> our<00:01:51.300> CPU<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
can see right here here's our CPU this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.370 
can see right here here's our CPU this
is<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.560> actual<00:01:52.770> top<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.420> actual<00:01:54.570> IHS

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
is the actual top this is the actual IHS

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.320 
is the actual top this is the actual IHS
so<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.220> heat<00:01:56.729> spreader<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
so this is the heat spreader the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.480 
so this is the heat spreader the
integrated<00:01:57.780> heat<00:01:57.930> spreader<00:01:58.260> that<00:01:59.130> makes

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
integrated heat spreader that makes

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.910 
integrated heat spreader that makes

cpu<00:02:11.760> socket<00:02:12.209> okay<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:13.079> going<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.290> want<00:02:13.560> to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
cpu socket okay you're going to want to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.330 
cpu socket okay you're going to want to
make<00:02:13.799> sure

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
make sure

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.089 
make sure
and<00:02:14.459> not<00:02:14.730> put<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> CPU<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.690> backwards<00:02:16.099> now

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
and not put the CPU and backwards now

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.040 
and not put the CPU and backwards now
there<00:02:17.340> are<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.209> some<00:02:18.420> notches<00:02:18.660> right

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
there are as you see some notches right

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.050 
there are as you see some notches right
here<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.500> point<00:02:19.709> these<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.400> one

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
here if I point these out to you one

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.729 
here if I point these out to you one
notch<00:02:21.269> right<00:02:21.480> there<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.959> then<00:02:22.530> there's

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
notch right there and then there's

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.710 
notch right there and then there's
another<00:02:22.800> notch<00:02:23.489> corresponding<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.540> same

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
another notch corresponding in the same

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.199 
another notch corresponding in the same
position<00:02:25.110> underneath<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.879> those<00:02:27.030> two

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
position underneath it so those two

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.300 
position underneath it so those two
notches<00:02:27.450> aligned<00:02:27.989> with<00:02:28.200> notches<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:29.160> are

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
notches aligned with notches that are

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.460 
notches aligned with notches that are
there<00:02:29.550> inside<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.209> cpu<00:02:30.569> socket<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.349> all

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
there inside of the cpu socket so all

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.229 
there inside of the cpu socket so all
you<00:02:31.560> need<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.739> do<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:31.950> align<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.549> if<00:02:32.760> you

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
you need to do is align that if you

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.180 
you need to do is align that if you
notice<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.200> you're<00:02:34.349> not<00:02:34.590> making<00:02:34.980> them

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
notice that you're not making them

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.949 
notice that you're not making them
excuse<00:02:36.090> me<00:02:36.209> you're<00:02:36.330> not<00:02:36.420> aligning<00:02:36.780> them

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
excuse me you're not aligning them

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.030 
excuse me you're not aligning them
correctly<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:37.620> you're<00:02:37.739> not<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:37.980> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
correctly and then you're not going to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.500 
correctly and then you're not going to
be<00:02:38.129> able<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.340> install<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.670> CPU<00:02:39.000> successful

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
be able to install the CPU successful

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.900 
be able to install the CPU successful
you'll<00:02:39.720> be<00:02:39.810> forcing<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.319> inside<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.910> we're

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
you'll be forcing it inside so we're

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.670 
you'll be forcing it inside so we're
going<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.299> go<00:02:42.330> ahead<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.780> rest<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.290> into<00:02:43.500> place

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
going to go ahead and rest it into place

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.100 
going to go ahead and rest it into place
and<00:02:43.980> from<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.080> have

ahead bring the actual retention plate

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.630 
ahead bring the actual retention plate
down<00:03:03.840> you'll<00:03:04.470> see<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.950> actual<00:03:05.190> lever<00:03:05.459> is

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
down you'll see that the actual lever is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.160 
down you'll see that the actual lever is
in<00:03:05.790> an<00:03:05.910> upright<00:03:06.180> position<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.840> we're<00:03:06.989> going<00:03:07.079> to

in an upright position so we're going to
go<00:03:07.319> ahead<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.819> bring<00:03:08.819> this<00:03:09.000> down<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.750> will

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
go ahead and bring this down you will

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.869 
go ahead and bring this down you will
feel<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.590> point<00:03:10.739> some<00:03:11.610> actual

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
feel at this point some actual

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.300 
feel at this point some actual
resistance<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.900> entirely<00:03:13.260> normal<00:03:13.709> it's

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
resistance this is entirely normal it's

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.009 
resistance this is entirely normal it's
the<00:03:14.489> contact<00:03:14.940> from<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> retention<00:03:15.569> plate

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
the contact from the retention plate

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.500 
the contact from the retention plate
making<00:03:16.500> contact<00:03:17.069> with<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.250> IHS<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.000> then

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
making contact with the IHS and then

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.059 
making contact with the IHS and then
making<00:03:18.720> contact<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.560> actual<00:03:19.799> pad

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
making contact with the actual pad

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.620 
making contact with the actual pad
underneath<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.060> we're<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.389> keep

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
underneath it so we're going to keep

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.750 
underneath it so we're going to keep
coming<00:03:21.810> down<00:03:22.139> keep<00:03:22.709> feeling<00:03:23.040> resistance<00:03:23.489> key

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
coming down keep feeling resistance key

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.520 
coming down keep feeling resistance key
feeling<00:03:24.060> resistance<00:03:24.510> entirely<00:03:25.019> okay<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
feeling resistance entirely okay and

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.610 
feeling resistance entirely okay and
you're<00:03:25.950> going<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.130> want<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> swoop<00:03:26.639> out<00:03:26.880> and

plate comes up I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.020 
plate comes up I'm going to go ahead and
pull<00:03:42.359> down<00:03:42.569> once<00:03:43.109> i<00:03:43.290> get<00:03:43.500> about<00:03:43.739> midway<00:03:44.489> you're

pull down once i get about midway you're
going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> feel<00:03:45.419> some<00:03:45.750> resistance<00:03:45.959> that's

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
going to feel some resistance that's

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.559 
going to feel some resistance that's
okay<00:03:46.889> if<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.400> want<00:03:47.519> at<00:03:47.669> this<00:03:47.790> point<00:03:47.880> begin<00:03:48.419> to

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
okay if you want at this point begin to

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.199 
okay if you want at this point begin to

pull outwards and then go ahead and then
push<00:03:51.480> inwards<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.109> that<00:03:52.530> locks<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.919> into

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
push inwards and that locks it into

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.860 
push inwards and that locks it into
place<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.549> that's<00:03:54.120> how<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.329> successfully

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
place and that's how you successfully

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.820 
place and that's how you successfully
install<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.169> cpu

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830
