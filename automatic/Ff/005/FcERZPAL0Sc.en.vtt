castellani<00:04:26.760> with<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.910> fender<00:04:28.270> reverb<00:04:28.480> pedal

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
castellani with the fender reverb pedal

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.150 
castellani with the fender reverb pedal
because<00:04:29.080> it's<00:04:29.380> been<00:04:29.530> designed<00:04:29.980> in

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
because it's been designed in

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.830 
because it's been designed in
conjunction<00:04:30.520> with<00:04:30.700> fender<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.270> features<00:04:31.660> all

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
conjunction with fender it features all

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.480 
conjunction with fender it features all
the<00:04:32.050> original<00:04:32.530> controls<00:04:32.920> that<00:04:33.280> would<00:04:33.400> have

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
the original controls that would have

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.670 
the original controls that would have
been<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.820> original<00:04:34.450> fender<00:04:34.900> reverb<00:04:35.230> unit

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
been on the original fender reverb unit

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.580 
been on the original fender reverb unit
so<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.910> controls<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.360> we've<00:04:37.570> got<00:04:37.780> are<00:04:38.020> a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
so the controls that we've got are a

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.500 
so the controls that we've got are a
mixer<00:04:39.010> which<00:04:39.160> basically<00:04:39.610> blends<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.240> amount

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
mixer which basically blends the amount

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.660 
mixer which basically blends the amount
of<00:04:40.660> reverb<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.590> have<00:04:41.770> along<00:04:42.490> with<00:04:42.520> the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
of reverb that you have along with the

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.490 
of reverb that you have along with the
tone<00:04:43.000> which<00:04:43.240> obviously<00:04:43.540> adjusts<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.290> tone<00:04:44.470> of

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
tone which obviously adjusts the tone of

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.190 
tone which obviously adjusts the tone of
the<00:04:44.680> reverb<00:04:45.090> plus<00:04:46.090> it's<00:04:46.270> got<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.420> dwell<00:04:46.720> control

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
the reverb plus it's got a dwell control

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.470 
the reverb plus it's got a dwell control
which<00:04:47.590> kind<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.490> adjusts<00:04:48.880> how<00:04:49.090> long<00:04:49.330> the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
which kind of adjusts how long the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.290 
which kind of adjusts how long the
reverb<00:04:49.840> lasts<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:51.580> what<00:04:51.730> people<00:04:51.910> would<00:04:52.120> do

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
reverb lasts and so what people would do

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.750 
reverb lasts and so what people would do
is<00:04:52.420> think<00:04:52.660> as<00:04:52.810> Alex<00:04:53.260> was<00:04:53.410> saying<00:04:53.650> is<00:04:53.980> people

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
is think as Alex was saying is people

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.130 
is think as Alex was saying is people
used<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.000> use<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:55.300> in<00:04:55.390> conjunction<00:04:55.570> with<00:04:55.960> the

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
used to use it in conjunction with the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.750 
used to use it in conjunction with the
basement<00:04:56.560> pedal<00:04:56.830> so<00:04:56.980> that's<00:04:57.160> exactly<00:04:57.610> what

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
basement pedal so that's exactly what

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.160 
basement pedal so that's exactly what
I'm<00:04:57.880> doing<00:04:58.150> I'm<00:04:58.240> using<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.660> Fender<00:04:58.990> Bassman

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
I'm doing I'm using the Fender Bassman

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.530 
I'm doing I'm using the Fender Bassman
pedal<00:04:59.830> from<00:05:00.010> boss<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.580> I'm<00:05:01.240> going<00:05:01.390> to<00:05:01.420> be

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
pedal from boss and I'm going to be

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.330 
pedal from boss and I'm going to be
using<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.110> get<00:05:02.260> all<00:05:02.380> my<00:05:02.500> blues<00:05:02.710> sounds<00:05:03.190> so

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
using it to get all my blues sounds so

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.650 
using it to get all my blues sounds so
with<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.610> backing<00:05:04.030> track<00:05:04.270> I'm<00:05:04.450> going<00:05:04.510> to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
with this backing track I'm going to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.900 
with this backing track I'm going to
start<00:05:04.870> off<00:05:05.080> with<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.320> reverb<00:05:05.650> pedal<00:05:05.880> play<00:05:06.880> a

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
start off with the reverb pedal play a

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.310 
start off with the reverb pedal play a
bit<00:05:07.180> with<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.660> then<00:05:07.750> I'm<00:05:07.840> going<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.020> keep

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
bit with that and then I'm going to keep

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.190 
bit with that and then I'm going to keep
the<00:05:08.440> basement<00:05:08.620> in<00:05:09.040> so<00:05:09.700> we<00:05:10.270> can<00:05:10.420> hear<00:05:10.720> what<00:05:11.080> it

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
the basement in so we can hear what it

00:05:11.200 --> 00:06:23.420 
the basement in so we can hear what it
kind<00:05:11.500> of<00:05:11.650> does<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.100> sound<00:05:12.310> as<00:05:12.490> well

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.830 

now<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.490> great<00:06:24.729> thing<00:06:24.760> about<00:06:25.060> this<00:06:25.270> new<00:06:25.479> pedal

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
now the great thing about this new pedal

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.529 
now the great thing about this new pedal
is<00:06:26.080> that<00:06:26.320> it<00:06:26.620> works<00:06:27.010> with<00:06:27.190> any<00:06:27.580> amp<00:06:27.849> it's

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
is that it works with any amp it's

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:30.750 
is that it works with any amp it's
designed<00:06:29.320> to<00:06:29.470> emulate<00:06:29.710> all<00:06:30.159> the<00:06:30.310> old<00:06:30.460> spring

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
designed to emulate all the old spring

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.300 
designed to emulate all the old spring
reverb<00:06:31.060> so<00:06:31.599> you<00:06:32.139> can<00:06:32.320> plug<00:06:32.710> it<00:06:32.830> into<00:06:32.949> whatever

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
reverb so you can plug it into whatever

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.589 
reverb so you can plug it into whatever
amp<00:06:33.610> you've<00:06:33.729> got<00:06:33.909> as<00:06:34.030> long<00:06:34.180> as<00:06:34.300> you<00:06:34.389> turn<00:06:34.570> down

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
amp you've got as long as you turn down

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.360 
amp you've got as long as you turn down
the<00:06:34.840> reverb<00:06:35.169> you<00:06:35.320> can<00:06:35.440> get<00:06:35.590> all<00:06:35.710> these<00:06:35.800> classic

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
the reverb you can get all these classic

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.969 
the reverb you can get all these classic
warm<00:06:36.669> sounds<00:06:37.210> originally<00:06:37.690> the<00:06:38.139> fender<00:06:38.830> reverb

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
warm sounds originally the fender reverb

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.089 
warm sounds originally the fender reverb
was<00:06:39.669> valve<00:06:40.000> driven<00:06:40.539> so<00:06:41.260> that's<00:06:41.830> what<00:06:42.010> the

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
was valve driven so that's what the

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:43.770 
was valve driven so that's what the
petrol<00:06:42.430> was<00:06:42.520> designed<00:06:42.880> to<00:06:42.970> do<00:06:43.150> is<00:06:43.330> create<00:06:43.630> a

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
petrol was designed to do is create a

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.260 
petrol was designed to do is create a
really<00:06:44.320> nice<00:06:44.530> warm<00:06:44.830> tone<00:06:45.159> so<00:06:45.430> it's<00:06:45.580> a<00:06:45.639> great

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
really nice warm tone so it's a great

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.580 
really nice warm tone so it's a great
great<00:06:46.509> addition<00:06:47.199> to<00:06:47.229> your<00:06:47.409> effects<00:06:48.370> loop
