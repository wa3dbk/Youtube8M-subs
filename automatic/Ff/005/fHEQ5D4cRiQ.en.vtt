strums<00:00:51.110> internally<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.590> eventually<00:00:53.489> you'll

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
strums internally so eventually you'll

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
strums internally so eventually you'll
be<00:00:54.000> able<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> play<00:00:54.480> any<00:00:54.840> strum<00:00:55.350> pattern<00:00:55.620> just

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
be able to play any strum pattern just

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.619 
be able to play any strum pattern just
by<00:00:55.949> listening<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.940> teach<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.420> how<00:00:57.570> to

by listening to it I teach you how to
take<00:00:57.899> strum<00:00:58.289> patterns<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> break<00:00:59.670> them

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
take strum patterns how to break them

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.209 
take strum patterns how to break them
down<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> there's<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.530> much<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.829> easily

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
down so there's so much more easily

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.189 
down so there's so much more easily
digestible<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> translate<00:01:03.750> them

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
digestible and how to translate them

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.429 
digestible and how to translate them
into<00:01:04.500> making<00:01:05.430> music<00:01:05.939> rhythm<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> what

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
into making music rhythm is is what

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
into making music rhythm is is what
gives<00:01:07.680> music<00:01:08.130> its<00:01:08.310> life's<00:01:08.640> blood<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.570> know

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
gives music its life's blood you know

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.070 
gives music its life's blood you know
and<00:01:10.189> music<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> more<00:01:12.150> than<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.840> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and music is more than just about you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
and music is more than just about you
know<00:01:13.110> chords<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> no<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:14.340> about

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
know chords and no it's also about

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
know chords and no it's also about
rhythm<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.030> meter<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.750> spend<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> lot<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
rhythm and meter and we spend a lot of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.899 
rhythm and meter and we spend a lot of
time<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.189> teach<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
time on that and I teach you how to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.990 
time on that and I teach you how to
understand<00:01:18.900> strum<00:01:19.740> patterns<00:01:20.189> rhythmically

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
understand strum patterns rhythmically

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.450 
understand strum patterns rhythmically
from<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.540> rhythmic<00:01:21.810> standpoint<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> that's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
from a rhythmic standpoint and that's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
from a rhythmic standpoint and that's
something<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.000> usually<00:01:24.330> glazed<00:01:24.750> over

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
something that's usually glazed over

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
something that's usually glazed over
in<00:01:25.470> most<00:01:25.830> instructionals<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> reason<00:01:27.299> I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
in most instructionals and the reason I

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
in most instructionals and the reason I
do<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.619> want<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
do this is because I want you to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880 
do this is because I want you to
eventually<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.180> able<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> play<00:01:30.689> any<00:01:30.960> strum<00:01:31.500> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
eventually be able to play any strum you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.020 
eventually be able to play any strum you
know<00:01:32.009> most<00:01:32.189> instructional<00:01:32.640> I'll<00:01:32.820> show<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
know most instructional I'll show you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
know most instructional I'll show you
one<00:01:33.329> strum<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.020> won't<00:01:34.200> explain<00:01:34.590> those

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
one strum and they won't explain those

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.980 
one strum and they won't explain those
as<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.509> learn<00:01:36.720> one

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
as they do this and you learn one

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
as they do this and you learn one
pattern<00:01:37.439> well<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.340> teach

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
pattern well what good is that I teach

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
pattern well what good is that I teach
you<00:01:38.880> techniques<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.780> methods<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.439> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you techniques and methods so you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.319 
you techniques and methods so you
understand<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.610> incinerate<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
understand it so you can incinerate it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
understand it so you can incinerate it
into<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.810> own<00:01:43.020> internal<00:01:43.950> clock<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.549> own

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
into your own internal clock your own

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.280 
into your own internal clock your own
rhythm<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.509> make<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:46.079> an

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
rhythm and then you could make up an

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.460 
rhythm and then you could make up an

going to understand it rhythmically

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.039

notice the four

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.759 
notice the four
is<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.180> downstroke<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.469> this<00:02:14.560> particular

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
is a downstroke so in this particular

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.729 
is a downstroke so in this particular
pattern<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.549> have<00:02:15.579> a<00:02:15.790> downstroke<00:02:16.629> on<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.499> 1

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
pattern you have a downstroke on the 1

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.559 
pattern you have a downstroke on the 1
the<00:02:18.249> 2<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.269> 4<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:20.620> up<00:02:20.889> down<00:02:21.189> up<00:02:21.519> up<00:02:21.790> down

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
the 2 and the 4 down up down up up down

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.839 
the 2 and the 4 down up down up up down
up<00:02:22.629> okay<00:02:23.409> just<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.709> could<00:02:23.889> feel<00:02:24.280> these

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
up okay just so you could feel these

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:32.949 
up okay just so you could feel these
beats

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.770 

let<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.829> arm<00:02:34.159> go<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.299> notice<00:02:35.599> I'm

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
let that arm go and you notice I'm

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.990 
let that arm go and you notice I'm
bending<00:02:36.290> at<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.560> elbow<00:02:37.219> so<00:02:37.549> think<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.819> it<00:02:37.939> like

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
bending at the elbow so think of it like

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.420 
bending at the elbow so think of it like
a<00:02:38.359> hinge<00:02:38.719> like<00:02:39.379> your<00:02:39.530> elbows<00:02:39.829> on<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.189> hinge

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
a hinge like your elbows on this hinge

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.660 
a hinge like your elbows on this hinge
right<00:02:41.269> and<00:02:41.569> you're<00:02:42.439> swinging<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.159> like<00:02:43.189> that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
right and you're swinging it like that

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:54.460 
right and you're swinging it like that
that's<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.719> motion<00:02:44.959> not<00:02:45.620> too<00:02:46.459> much<00:02:46.670> risk

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.559 

you

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.770 

and<00:02:59.659> again<00:03:00.590> at<00:03:01.459> first<00:03:01.760> let's<00:03:02.060> do<00:03:02.239> two<00:03:02.480> times

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
and again at first let's do two times

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.440 
and again at first let's do two times
through<00:03:03.680> each<00:03:03.920> strum<00:03:04.519> pattern<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.420> each

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
through each strum pattern for each

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.089 
through each strum pattern for each
chord<00:03:05.930> all<00:03:06.650> right

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
chord all right

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.630 
chord all right
so<00:03:07.430> it's<00:03:07.640> going<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.819> be<00:03:08.030> d<00:03:08.269> g<00:03:09.459> e-minor

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
so it's going to be d g e-minor

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.990 
so it's going to be d g e-minor
ma<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.859> go<00:03:13.010> over<00:03:13.129> tons<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.730> tons<00:03:13.760> of

metronome before i have a lesson in what

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.080 
metronome before i have a lesson in what
to<00:03:57.709> look<00:03:57.859> for<00:03:58.099> in<00:03:58.159> a<00:03:58.220> metronome<00:03:58.519> how<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.790> buy<00:03:59.030> it

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
to look for in a metronome how to buy it

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.300 
to look for in a metronome how to buy it
the<00:03:59.389> difference<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.930> between<00:04:00.049> metronomes<00:04:00.889> the

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
the difference is between metronomes the

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.649 
the difference is between metronomes the
kinds<00:04:01.579> of<00:04:01.639> things<00:04:01.879> you<00:04:02.030> want<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.269> look<00:04:02.419> for

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
kinds of things you want to look for

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.050 
kinds of things you want to look for

where I start to teach you how to pick
off<00:04:47.000> strums<00:04:47.449> by<00:04:47.750> ear<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.110> how<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.530> start

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
off strums by ear and how to start

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.659 
off strums by ear and how to start
identifying<00:04:50.229> certain<00:04:51.229> chords<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.040> certain

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
identifying certain chords and certain

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.969

things<00:04:52.910> in<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.240> strum<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:54.199> where<00:04:54.380> eventually

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
things in a strum so where eventually

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.439 
things in a strum so where eventually
you<00:04:55.100> won't<00:04:55.280> have<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.669> write<00:04:55.880> out<00:04:56.060> strum

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
you won't have to write out strum

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.570 
you won't have to write out strum
patterns<00:04:56.930> right<00:04:57.320> you<00:04:57.740> could<00:04:58.100> take<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.370> downs

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
patterns right you could take the downs

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.860 
patterns right you could take the downs
and<00:04:58.790> ups<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.060> throw<00:04:59.300> them<00:04:59.419> out<00:04:59.479> the<00:04:59.600> window

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
and ups and throw them out the window

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.129 
and ups and throw them out the window
and<00:05:00.080> just<00:05:00.110> play<00:05:00.470> by<00:05:00.770> field<00:05:01.250> by<00:05:01.490> ear<00:05:01.820> and<00:05:02.139> that's

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
and just play by field by ear and that's

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.510 
and just play by field by ear and that's
where<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:03.470> want<00:05:03.620> to<00:05:03.680> get<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:03.979> takes<00:05:04.190> time

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
where you want to get to that takes time

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.909 
where you want to get to that takes time
to<00:05:04.729> develop<00:05:04.850> your<00:05:05.150> ear<00:05:05.540> but<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.290> kind<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.560> start

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
strum patterns out and with on-screen

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.350 
strum patterns out and with on-screen
text<00:05:18.740> because<00:05:19.010> at<00:05:19.100> first<00:05:19.280> everyone<00:05:19.790> needs<00:05:19.940> to

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
text because at first everyone needs to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.000 
text because at first everyone needs to
learn<00:05:20.540> by<00:05:20.810> writing<00:05:21.110> out<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.350> patterns<00:05:21.860> and

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
learn by writing out the patterns and

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.680 
learn by writing out the patterns and
following<00:05:22.430> along<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.760> eventually<00:05:22.940> down<00:05:23.540> the

you want to get weaned off the strum

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.070 
you want to get weaned off the strum
patterns<00:05:28.070> it<00:05:28.220> can<00:05:28.340> work<00:05:28.520> more<00:05:29.080> freewheeling

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
patterns it can work more freewheeling

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.510 
patterns it can work more freewheeling
and<00:05:30.169> that's<00:05:30.350> kind<00:05:30.620> of<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.800> direction<00:05:30.919> we<00:05:31.400> are

you're<00:06:00.530> trying<00:06:00.740> to<00:06:00.950> strum<00:06:01.340> in<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.550> pattern<00:06:02.030> and

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
you're trying to strum in a pattern and

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.629 
you're trying to strum in a pattern and
you<00:06:02.510> can't<00:06:02.870> change<00:06:03.229> chords<00:06:03.740> yet<00:06:03.979> you<00:06:04.520> know

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
you can't change chords yet you know

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.100 
you can't change chords yet you know
obviously<00:06:05.060> going<00:06:05.240> from<00:06:05.510> one<00:06:05.690> chord<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:05.960> the

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
obviously going from one chord to the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.170 
obviously going from one chord to the
next<00:06:06.410> you're<00:06:06.530> going<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.680> fall<00:06:06.979> out<00:06:07.130> of<00:06:07.160> time<00:06:07.520> so

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
next you're going to fall out of time so

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.659 
next you're going to fall out of time so
there's<00:06:08.389> a<00:06:08.450> direct<00:06:08.750> relationship<00:06:09.229> between
