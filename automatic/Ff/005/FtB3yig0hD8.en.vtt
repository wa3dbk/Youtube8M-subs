00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.670 
from 1964 it sort of had a rough life I
think<00:00:33.480> somebody<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:34.280> cutting<00:00:36.199> rocks<00:00:37.199> with<00:00:37.559> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
think somebody was cutting rocks with it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.189 
think somebody was cutting rocks with it
at<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:38.010> point<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.580> running<00:00:39.150> it<00:00:39.269> with<00:00:39.480> no<00:00:40.170> oil

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
at one point and running it with no oil

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:48.049 
at one point and running it with no oil
in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> gas<00:00:41.010> mixture<00:00:45.890> but<00:00:46.890> there's<00:00:47.640> really<00:00:47.820> no

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
in the gas mixture but there's really no

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.770 
in the gas mixture but there's really no
cracks

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
cracks

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
cracks
but<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.230> some<00:00:49.530> store<00:00:49.860> bursts<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
but there are some store bursts in the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.349 
but there are some store bursts in the
deck

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.109

purchased on eBay since then it's been

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.350 
purchased on eBay since then it's been
completely<00:01:12.409> disassembled<00:01:16.090> reused<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
completely disassembled reused the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.740 
completely disassembled reused the
crankcase<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:19.460> picked<00:01:20.210> up<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.509> good<00:01:20.689> used

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
the needle bearing at the piston pin end

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.460 
the needle bearing at the piston pin end
in<00:01:32.869> addition<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:34.179> new<00:01:35.179> liners<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.080> needle

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
in addition to new liners and needle

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.350 
in addition to new liners and needle
bearings<00:01:36.860> at<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.130> crankshaft<00:01:37.549> end<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
bearings at the crankshaft end of the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:48.270 
bearings at the crankshaft end of the
rod<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:43.729> also<00:01:44.060> now<00:01:44.270> has<00:01:44.539> a<00:01:45.130> NOS<00:01:46.130> cylinder<00:01:46.789> and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
rod it also now has a NOS cylinder and

and a new piston with the rings and a

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.070 
and a new piston with the rings and a
wrist<00:01:53.149> pin<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:56.090> original<00:01:56.509> top<00:01:56.750> plate<00:01:57.020> had<00:01:57.319> a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
wrist pin the original top plate had a

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.100 
wrist pin the original top plate had a
bronze<00:02:00.080> bushing<00:02:00.709> in<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.819> armature<00:02:02.420> bleed<00:02:05.110> but

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
bronze bushing in the armature bleed but

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.589 
bronze bushing in the armature bleed but
this<00:02:06.920> one<00:02:07.129> was<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.340> little<00:02:07.519> bit<00:02:07.789> worn<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.569> I

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
this one was a little bit worn so I

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.940 
this one was a little bit worn so I
decided<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.349> upgrade<00:02:09.860> to<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> later<00:02:10.940> model

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
decided to upgrade to a later model

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.670 
decided to upgrade to a later model
armature<00:02:12.950> plate<00:02:13.220> with<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> needle<00:02:13.819> bearing

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.320 

which<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.709> working<00:02:19.310> out<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:19.489> fine

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
which is working out just fine

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.589 
which is working out just fine
but<00:02:20.810> I'm<00:02:20.930> still<00:02:21.170> running<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.620> at<00:02:21.769> 16<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.459> 1

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.050 

probably<00:02:26.599> because<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:26.959> it<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:28.670> has<00:02:28.879> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
probably because of it this has the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.270 
probably because of it this has the
extended<00:02:29.480> crank<00:02:29.959> case<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.590> has<00:02:30.709> 2<00:02:30.950> bronze

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
extended crank case so it has 2 bronze

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.120 
extended crank case so it has 2 bronze
bushings<00:02:31.879> at<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> lower<00:02:32.390> end

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.250 

I<00:02:35.160> picked<00:02:35.850> up<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:38.570> shoot<00:02:39.570> for<00:02:39.930> it

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
I picked up a shoot for it

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.960 
I picked up a shoot for it
and<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.680> bag<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.640> original-style<00:02:42.060> rod<00:02:43.970> so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and a bag and the original-style rod so

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.630 
and a bag and the original-style rod so
I've<00:02:45.510> been<00:02:45.660> bagging<00:02:46.140> with<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:49.550> picking<00:02:50.550> up

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
I've been bagging with it picking up

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.700 
I've been bagging with it picking up
some<00:02:50.850> leaves<00:02:51.090> today<00:02:54.230> let's<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.620> can

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
some leaves today let's see if we can

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.370 
some leaves today let's see if we can
get<00:02:55.860> at<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> store
