00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.359
 good in this video we will see how 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.790
 move a three-phase motor to a physical wall 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.190
 it's very simple you are going to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.890
 find the connection of the motor with 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.680
 this born was 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.940
 for each of the phases what has 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.740
 what to do is what they are seeing 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.250
 then simply go to connect 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:32.050
 is with this serve that this unit and 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.050
 that cable directly to him takes 220 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.840
 this terminal and this order also the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.840
 unite 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.910
 and in turn 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.210
 from this terminal we take out a cable that goes to 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.829
 condenser 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.050
 and the other terminal of the capacitor enters 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.870
 the oven here that also has to 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.780
 be united up here and this cable the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.250
 medium that you have in this connection the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 medium it is having the two wires of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.120
 capacitor and the other cable goes out to 220 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.190
 for this engine that is 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.420
 about a horse and a half two 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.110
 horses I used a 30 condenser 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.320
 micro farah goodbye yes there you have it at 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 condenser and well let's just do 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.310
 the ignition test 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.450
 it is the engine working perfectly 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.360
 of a lot of power 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 and we cut it 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 but we learned 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.930
 Well this was taught to me by a friend and what 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.370
 I wanted to share 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.390
 at the same time 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.890
 Here I left a diagram 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.270
 where if we invest this connection 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.030
 we change the direction of rotation of the engine 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.979
 that is to say good here we are clear this 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.990
 would this be the entrance and 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.550
 here would be the other end of 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.580
 condenser where the two come from 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.320
 cables on this side if both at 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.390
 capacitor here and between the capacitor 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.570
 here on this side this would be the entrance 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.950
 of 220 hopefully they will enjoy it and that 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.940
 can rescue old engines 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.130
 three-phase and pass them to 220 volts if 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.440
 While the engine power is lost 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.590
 almost in the middle 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.210
 the engine is very powerful 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.280
 suppose a two horse engine can 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.110
 stay in a horse engine or a 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.270
 horse and half how is this horse 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.010
 this engine can be left in an engine 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.680
 three quarters of horses without spending anything 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.110
 because three-phase motors are not worth 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.450
 nothing they are are very low value at least 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.630
 in Argentina those that are expensive are 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.480
 the basic monos motors 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.780
 and well she was sharing it so that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.910
 how it happened to me can you to a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.650
 life to the old engines thank you for 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.070
 have seen it I hope you enjoy it and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.070
 it is useful
