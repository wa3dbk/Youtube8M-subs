00:00:00.097 --> 00:00:03.726
Our next game is "Quick Change"!

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:08.192
Andrei, Daniel and Elidio, stand up.

00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:10.472
I'll pick up a sentence.

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:12.935
Quick Change works like this:
Whenever I say 'change'

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:18.668
they'll have to change the last thing they said.
If you didn't get it, you will get it soon.

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.461
It will begin with this sentence:
'I can imagine the pain already'.

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.412
They start the scene with
'I can imagine the pain already',

00:00:27.412 --> 00:00:30.733
it's "Quick Change"
and it starts... Now!

00:00:33.343 --> 00:00:37.302
I can imagine the pain already...
Can you imagine it too?

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:38.923
- I do.
- Change!

00:00:38.923 --> 00:00:40.234
- No.
- Change!

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:43.809
Ow, I can feel it already!

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.110
Excuse me?

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.674
Change!

00:00:54.493 --> 00:00:55.302
Change!

00:00:57.014 --> 00:00:58.203
Change!

00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:03.407
Oh, my God...

00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:05.838
I was cool when it was
just some guy going to kill us,

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:08.757
now that's Michael Jackson,
I don't know...

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:10.769
We've got to get outta here, man!

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.659
Do you have a plan?

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.460
- Plan?
- Change!

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100
- Sure!
- Change!

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.760
- No!
- Change!

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.180
I'm kinda enjoying this...

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:24.062
I don't know if...

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:31.503
Damn, Michael is fuckin' mad today!

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:36.255
Michael, can I talk to you for a second?

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:42.607
- Michael, I didn't do anything,
it was all his fault! - Change!

00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:46.307
- Michael, I didn't do anything,
he's the one who fucked up! - Change!

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:48.249
Fine, just cut off my leg.

00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:58.889
Well... I can still be a pirate!

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.930
It didn't hurt, actually...

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.430
Oh, no!

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:08.913
You're getting too cruel!

00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:11.562
Cut off my leg!
Cut off my arm!

00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:15.323
- Only!
- Change!

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:18.296
- Cut off anything!
- Change!

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:20.877
Cut it off, cut it off!

00:02:20.877 --> 00:02:24.730
I don't care,
just don't wax me anymore!

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:32.164
Change!

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:36.636
Change!

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:40.256
Do you want a nail clipper?

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:42.927
I have a nail clipper here, pick it up.

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:51.201
The magnifying glass is on this side!

00:02:53.443 --> 00:02:55.352
That's it!

00:02:57.084 --> 00:02:59.874
It's pointless to search for it!

00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:02.844
He could say 'do you want
a magnifying glass?', then...

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:06.145
