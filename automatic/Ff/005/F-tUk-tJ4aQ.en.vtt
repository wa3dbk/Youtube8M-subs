00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
minestrone soup but what will women do

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.759 
minestrone soup but what will women do
to<00:02:19.190> keep<00:02:19.340> their<00:02:19.549> breasts<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.150> stay<00:02:20.360> alive

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.160 
to keep their breasts and to stay alive
women<00:02:21.769> will<00:02:22.209> check<00:02:23.209> their<00:02:23.390> breasts<00:02:23.750> every<00:02:23.870> day

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170

and<00:02:24.549> worry<00:02:25.549> about<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.940> results<00:02:26.450> when<00:02:27.110> we'll

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
and worry about the results when we'll

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.930 
and worry about the results when we'll
go<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.590> doctor<00:02:28.040> at<00:02:28.160> least<00:02:28.340> once<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.670> year<00:02:28.700> and

risk of Diana heart disease they will

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.170 
risk of Diana heart disease they will
take<00:03:00.019> anti-estrogen<00:03:00.859> drugs<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.700> they<00:03:02.060> will

up for a year but they won't eat bean

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.530 
up for a year but they won't eat bean
soup<00:03:10.670> that's<00:03:11.060> too<00:03:11.390> much<00:03:11.599> to<00:03:11.629> ask

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.610 

cancer<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.570> divided<00:03:18.410> in<00:03:18.500> two<00:03:18.680> stages<00:03:20.620> first

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
cancer is divided in two stages first

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.310 
cancer is divided in two stages first
there's<00:03:22.220> what<00:03:22.850> we<00:03:22.970> call<00:03:23.000> an<00:03:23.360> initiation<00:03:24.110> of

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
there's what we call an initiation of

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.070 
there's what we call an initiation of
that<00:03:24.550> starting<00:03:25.550> with<00:03:25.640> jeans<00:03:25.880> cancer<00:03:26.780> starts

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
that starting with jeans cancer starts

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.830 
that starting with jeans cancer starts
with<00:03:27.200> jeans<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.880> might<00:03:29.090> be<00:03:29.240> jeans<00:03:29.450> were<00:03:29.570> born

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
with jeans it might be jeans were born

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.150 
with jeans it might be jeans were born
with<00:03:30.020> it<00:03:30.170> might<00:03:30.320> be<00:03:30.470> jeans<00:03:30.710> that<00:03:30.920> are<00:03:30.950> actually

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
with it might be jeans that are actually

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.860 
with it might be jeans that are actually
changed<00:03:31.850> by<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.420> chemical<00:03:33.460> so<00:03:34.480> those<00:03:35.480> jeans

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
changed by a chemical so those jeans

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.520 
changed by a chemical so those jeans
become<00:03:37.240> capable<00:03:38.240> of<00:03:38.540> producing<00:03:38.840> cancer<00:03:39.320> cells

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
become capable of producing cancer cells

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.240 
become capable of producing cancer cells
as<00:03:39.740> they<00:03:39.800> divide<00:03:40.790> into<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.780> future<00:03:41.960> I<00:03:42.290> call

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
as they divide into the future I call

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.130 
as they divide into the future I call
that<00:03:43.400> like<00:03:43.520> a<00:03:43.580> cat<00:03:43.850> seed<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.540> we're<00:03:44.870> planting

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
that like a cat seed that we're planting

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.250 
that like a cat seed that we're planting
seeds<00:03:46.330> that's<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.540> first<00:03:47.750> stage<00:03:47.960> of<00:03:47.990> cancer

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
seeds that's the first stage of cancer

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.730 
seeds that's the first stage of cancer
can<00:03:49.250> happen<00:03:49.550> very<00:03:49.640> quickly<00:03:50.200> upon<00:03:51.200> consumption

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
can happen very quickly upon consumption

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.060 
can happen very quickly upon consumption
sub<00:03:51.890> chemicals<00:03:52.340> or<00:03:52.490> whatever<00:03:53.380> then<00:03:54.380> the<00:03:54.830> long

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
sub chemicals or whatever then the long

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.480 
sub chemicals or whatever then the long
stage<00:03:55.460> goes<00:03:55.970> from<00:03:56.180> that<00:03:56.240> point<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.620> point

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
stage goes from that point to the point

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.160 
stage goes from that point to the point
where<00:03:58.640> we<00:03:58.790> actually<00:03:59.090> see<00:03:59.360> we<00:03:59.630> have<00:03:59.810> cancer

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
where we actually see we have cancer

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.550 
where we actually see we have cancer
that<00:04:00.380> may<00:04:00.560> take<00:04:00.740> years<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:02.140> that's<00:04:03.140> growing

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
that may take years and that's growing

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.520 
that may take years and that's growing
these<00:04:03.830> seats<00:04:04.450> it's<00:04:05.450> promoting<00:04:06.110> their<00:04:06.290> growth

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
these seats it's promoting their growth

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.740 
these seats it's promoting their growth
in<00:04:06.770> fact<00:04:07.490> that<00:04:07.670> stage<00:04:07.880> is<00:04:08.030> called<00:04:08.210> promotion

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
in fact that stage is called promotion

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.630 
in fact that stage is called promotion
and<00:04:09.790> so<00:04:10.810> these<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.710> question<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.250> whether<00:04:13.400> we

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
and so these the question of whether we

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.110 
and so these the question of whether we
do<00:04:13.970> or<00:04:14.000> don't<00:04:14.210> get<00:04:14.420> cancer<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.960> turns<00:04:15.230> out<00:04:15.410> is

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
do or don't get cancer it turns out is

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.180 
do or don't get cancer it turns out is
primarily<00:04:17.120> related<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:17.720> not<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.859> amount<00:04:19.100> of

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
primarily related to not the amount of

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.920 
primarily related to not the amount of
seeds<00:04:19.489> we<00:04:19.700> may<00:04:19.880> plant<00:04:20.299> or<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.690> amount<00:04:20.810> of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
seeds we may plant or the amount of

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.230 
seeds we may plant or the amount of
genes<00:04:21.200> we<00:04:21.380> may<00:04:21.590> have<00:04:21.890> that<00:04:22.670> can<00:04:22.880> give<00:04:23.030> rise<00:04:23.210> to

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
genes we may have that can give rise to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.190 
genes we may have that can give rise to
cancer<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:25.010> more<00:04:25.610> relates<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.300> how<00:04:27.140> we

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
cancer it more relates to how we

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.080 
cancer it more relates to how we
