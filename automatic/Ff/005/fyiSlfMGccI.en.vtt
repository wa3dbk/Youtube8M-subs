00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.140
 at 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.580
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.840
 that you're fine 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.910
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.619
 new information video on gta 5 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.100
 online so in the trailer of 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.140
 robberies 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.400
 we could see we could 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.710
 attack a yacht 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.390
 so we did not know which yacht 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.010
 was going to attack and so I fell 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.930
 on a gameplay that was posted on the 13th 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.970
 December three days before rockstar 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.870
 balance the trailer of robberies and 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.680
 frankly you'll see that it's 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.480
 really interesting 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.250
 so I liked you some screens 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.379
 look here here already we can see at 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.280
 away that he managed to put a doubt 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.559
 on the online 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.180
 which is quite amazing so already 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.040
 by far if we put a screen too 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.239
 trailer robberies watch one can 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.399
 see that there is some resemblance 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.680
 with the two yachts not really for 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.610
 the moment we can not really know 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.660
 then here look I put you a 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.070
 second screen 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.809
 in the back we can see that there is a 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.370
 jacuzzi and that's something we 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.680
 could see at the trailer level of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.539
 robberies look on this screen at 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.940
 right of the robbers we can see that he 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.399
 there is a jacuzzi behind so it's already 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.410
 a little resemblance then here on 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.080
 this second screen we can see that between 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.759
 the jacuzzi and the middle of the boat we have 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.500
 a small corner with armchairs 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.179
 so that too we could find him at 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.800
 trailer level of robberies look 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.020
 it's the little chairs that 's just 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.369
 here is so here you can also see 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.289
 that on the armchairs we have blows 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.990
 it's a green and white and so look 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.030
 on this screen here in online mode we can 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.099
 see that we also have the cushions in green 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.720
 and white on the seats so thanks to these 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:37.160
 screen one can know that these thresholds 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.420
 others that we will rob in any case 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.470
 that there will be two available in the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.300
 dlc robberies 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.590
 a good little August is the yacht I 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.690
 believe there was in story mode 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.490
 so if it's really a little disappointed 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.750
 that he is not well that he has not 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.099
 recreate a yacht that we have a little 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.849
 surprised to have a new boat that 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.619
 would have been interesting 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.240
 tell us what you think all without 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.190
 comment if you too find yourself 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.080
 maybe a little pity that there is no 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.869
 a new yacht to attack them for 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.830
 say a bit of novelty 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.090

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.679

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.349

 chrome when they have as they could 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.519
