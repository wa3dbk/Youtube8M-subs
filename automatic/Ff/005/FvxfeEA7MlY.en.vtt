mechanics of it it is great I am amazed
at<00:01:47.760> this<00:01:47.940> automatic<00:01:48.540> transmission<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> was

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
at this automatic transmission that was

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
at this automatic transmission that was
my<00:01:49.710> ultimate<00:01:49.890> goal<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.550> come<00:01:50.730> here<00:01:50.910> to<00:01:51.030> drive

my ultimate goal to come here to drive
an<00:01:51.450> automatic<00:01:51.930> transmission<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.890> love<00:01:53.160> it

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.220 

it's<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.880> unique<00:01:57.210> piece<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> equipment<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:58.080> a

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
it's a unique piece of equipment on a

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.220 
it's a unique piece of equipment on a
cutting<00:01:58.590> edge<00:01:58.790> I've<00:01:59.790> been<00:01:59.970> something<00:02:00.330> great<00:02:00.540> I

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.230 

like<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.410> design<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.190> hood<00:02:05.880> design

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
like the design of it the hood design

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.449 
like the design of it the hood design
the<00:02:06.450> way<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.690> looks<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.290> bumper<00:02:07.920> design<00:02:08.250> up

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the way it looks the bumper design up

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.310 
the way it looks the bumper design up
front<00:02:08.490> they<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.510> thought<00:02:09.690> everything<00:02:10.020> out

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
front they really thought everything out

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.640 
front they really thought everything out
so<00:02:10.350> far<00:02:11.180> ingenious<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.330> guess<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.320> looks

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so far ingenious I guess really it looks

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.699 
so far ingenious I guess really it looks
like<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> cat<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.580> says<00:02:15.090> quality<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.959> me<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
like a cat that says quality to me it

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.350 
like a cat that says quality to me it
just<00:02:16.740> looks<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.310> something<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.760> would<00:02:18.060> fit

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
just looks like something that would fit

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.330 
just looks like something that would fit
in<00:02:18.570> with<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> construction<00:02:19.230> fleet<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:20.130> turns

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
in with the construction fleet it turns

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.430 
in with the construction fleet it turns
very<00:02:20.520> nice<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.150> rides<00:02:21.360> very<00:02:21.690> well<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.200> guess

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
very nice and rides very well so I guess

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.370 
very nice and rides very well so I guess
if<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.680> had<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.920> describe<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.640> say

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
if I had to describe it I just say
