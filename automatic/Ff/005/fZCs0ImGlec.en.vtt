00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.389
 launched the alexandre always the intention of 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:14.670
 bring something new 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:19.590
 I wanted to show you this is the drink here. 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:26.300
 that I have prepared to realize that she is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:31.410
 well transparent and very similar to 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:36.210
 beer and before even I wanted to comment 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.340
 that the times well on the issue of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 purity of beer from the need to 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.350
 keep the beer always with the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.770
 necessary and correct ingredients to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.320
 make beer and malt and hops and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.219
 yeast and water 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 so this is not beer but the staff 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.879
 that makes beer is up to a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.840
 good idea 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:10.700
 a yeast-based refrigerant from the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.100
 brewer is nothing more than coke 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 fermented coca cola after passing 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.430
 the fermentation process with the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.430
 yeast was always like that. 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.869
 outraged at having to keep playing 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.030
 Coca-Cola outside we buy those 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.939
 Big bottles always have a little 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.509
 of coke without gas and same thing to play 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.750
 yeast mud off it 's a day I thought 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.659
 Why not pick up and put the yeast? 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.850
 in the coke without gas that is very sweet 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.479
 and gave this liquid here 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.479
 proving 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:02.990
 of a liquid a light taste of beer 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 because of the action of the injury 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:14.810
 if I'm not mistaken ss4 is a bit of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:23.120
 champagne ado be have resembles that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:25.160
 The question of soda has been 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.230
 a little alcoholic, because coca cola 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.930
 has enough sugar and nice to drink 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:39.830
 be better than coke without gas 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:44.290
 much better then the idea is the people 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:49.040
 that you want to try is something that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:54.320
 a beer is not the best thing of the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.610
 world but you can drink well with little 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.160
 gas because I still caught it after 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.110
 implement the tool in the 22 days 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.650
 about three liters of coca cola tool 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.299
 in the remaining sludge from the fermentation of 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.220
 beer 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.709
 Then we'll have a bottle later. 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.209
 bigger mix with a little coke 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.860
 normal to make for me to give gas 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.080
 how to open the big bottle I made 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.600
 she got a little gas but she gives 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:30.470
 gas and so that lost a bit 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.530
 ball but she got very well carbonated 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.769
 I already opened the other bottle and that 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.660
 She turned out not to be so good. 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.590
 eyes the old coke that we have 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.010
 at home 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.769
 the old yeast that we have home and 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.600
 to prove a new num is not 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.590
 refrigerant is not worth giving to the 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.579
 because the thing is alcoholic but 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.950
 The idea is to approve is to open glue 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.950
 a hug to everyone's right
