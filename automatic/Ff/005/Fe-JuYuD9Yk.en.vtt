repro file this a few days ago I put a
minor<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.100> mean<00:01:02.309> minor<00:01:02.640> chip<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
minor and I do mean minor chip in the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.940 
minor and I do mean minor chip in the
30°<00:01:04.619> inclusive<00:01:04.769> edge<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.909> comes<00:01:06.150> with

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
30° inclusive edge that it comes with

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.210 
30° inclusive edge that it comes with
putting<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.159> through<00:01:08.430> some<00:01:09.210> hard<00:01:09.479> wood

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
putting it through some hard wood

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.810 
putting it through some hard wood
I<00:01:11.360> read<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:13.040> steeper<00:01:14.040> angled<00:01:14.400> edge<00:01:14.549> would

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
I read that steeper angled edge would

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.960 
I read that steeper angled edge would
eliminate<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.659> risk<00:01:15.930> plus<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.920> always<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.610> re

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
eliminate that risk plus I always do re

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
eliminate that risk plus I always do re
profile<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.930> knife<00:01:19.140> edges<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> 40-degree

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
profile my knife edges to a 40-degree

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.999 
profile my knife edges to a 40-degree
inclusive<00:01:21.299> edge<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.720> really<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
inclusive edge I really like that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.609 
inclusive edge I really like that
because<00:01:23.430> my<00:01:23.909> knives<00:01:24.500> tend<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:26.090> do<00:01:27.090> woodworking

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
because my knives tend to do woodworking

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
because my knives tend to do woodworking
more<00:01:28.619> than<00:01:28.829> any<00:01:29.159> other<00:01:29.430> task<00:01:29.759> whether<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.900> be

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
more than any other task whether it be

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.910 
more than any other task whether it be
just<00:01:31.850> debarking<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.860> hard<00:01:34.860> carvings<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:37.290> need

on the ball lock and that brings me to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.460 
on the ball lock and that brings me to
the<00:04:12.819> next<00:04:13.000> point<00:04:13.269> when<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.810> first<00:04:14.139> did<00:04:14.319> the

the next point when I first did the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.009 
the next point when I first did the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
found the ball lock stiff stiffer than I

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.950 
found the ball lock stiff stiffer than I
thought<00:04:23.789> still<00:04:24.789> not<00:04:24.970> as<00:04:25.120> stiff<00:04:25.450> as<00:04:25.690> some

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
thought still not as stiff as some

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.430 
thought still not as stiff as some
people

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
people

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.890

cleaned<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:27.040> be<00:04:27.190> but<00:04:27.910> it<00:04:28.180> did<00:04:28.390> break<00:04:28.660> in

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
cleaned it to be but it did break in

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
really nicely it's still a strong lock

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.410 
really nicely it's still a strong lock
but<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.800> doesn't<00:04:33.130> take<00:04:33.280> as<00:04:33.430> much<00:04:33.460> pressure<00:04:33.910> to

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
but it doesn't take as much pressure to

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.570 
but it doesn't take as much pressure to
release<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.140> blade<00:04:35.320> anymore<00:04:35.800> which<00:04:36.550> is

could do it with one hand easily but

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.980 
could do it with one hand easily but
that's<00:04:58.420> just<00:04:58.660> the<00:04:58.810> design<00:04:59.170> of<00:04:59.350> this<00:04:59.440> knife<00:05:00.990> I

in<00:05:58.780> woodworking<00:05:59.290> so<00:05:59.919> that's<00:06:00.580> where<00:06:00.850> I<00:06:01.120> get<00:06:01.660> my

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
in woodworking so that's where I get my

g10<00:06:06.490> selling<00:06:06.940> for<00:06:07.180> not<00:06:07.419> that<00:06:07.600> expensive<00:06:08.490> so<00:06:09.490> I

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
g10 selling for not that expensive so I

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.930 
g10 selling for not that expensive so I
might<00:06:09.910> try<00:06:10.120> that<00:06:10.210> with<00:06:10.630> my<00:06:10.810> other<00:06:10.990> one<00:06:11.110> but<00:06:11.950> if

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
might try that with my other one but if

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.970
