00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.590
 we are at smau 2013 we see the range la 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.000
 lifebook family series of what we are 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.310
 talking to the family because we see 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.570
 here we see in three models the seven between 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.759
 fresh the 7 43 and 753 see the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.039
 design is absolutely unique replicated 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.900
 despite the differences to stop it 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.330
 let's talk about an always for 3 with it 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.330
 13 inch screen 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.760
 the 7 4 3 with the screen 14 inches and 753 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.989
 15 inch screen 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.960
 the interesting thing that despite 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.089
 different formats have a whole range of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 absolutely equal components to 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.350
 example the bottom mother this means 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.719
 that for companies 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.100
 I can develop the software image 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.050
 with an update 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.610
 I spoke on windows 7 on windows 8 that 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.160
 a bit profitable 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.350
 for a model to replicate it faithfully 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.809
 on the other two models 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.770
 therefore with a significant savings in 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.470
 terms of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.510
 own operating costs in the follow 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.530
 the evolution of products in the follow 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 abodes evolution 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.130
 other common component and optical drives 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.800
 and therefore hot-swappable shield between 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.580
 the machines with possibly one 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.440
 second battery a second hard disk 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.620
 or even 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.850
 the video projector 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.850
 integrated in the mario chassis 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.170
 of course different screen means 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.620
 also different solutions because 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.440
 let's talk about 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.500
 intel core processors with video card 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.030
 intel integrated into the purchasing chipset a 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 speaking in 13 inches with resolution 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.120
 hd 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.740
 14 inches with resolution 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.899
 1 hd plus then 1600 x 900 and instead 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.220
 15 inches with full hd resolution e 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.220
 therefore 1900 20 million 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.900
 other common components are 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.940
 obviously the docking station which is one 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.640
 for all three different models e 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.860
 the power supply then I will have all the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.600
 availability of exchangeable exchanges 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.880
 the power supply with the colleague if 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.890
 remain without electricity or without 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.660
 battery 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.430
 I can easily move the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.430
 batteries I can safely move 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.700
 made of having the common components is a 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.719
 advantage especially for the company and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.659
 especially for those companies that 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:31.209
 maybe they want to equip themselves 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:33.340
 design the same tool also 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.590
 people with different functionalities ad 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.079
 example more desco for the 15th 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.230
 inches plus the moving part for 13 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.269
 then about 35 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.860
 specifically for example we have on 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.659
 all three models the reader does not 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.130
 digital this serves as in others 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.460
 models both as an authentic show product 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.160
 before the system starts my authentic 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.320
 so that I'm sure it's me 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.319
 the user the owner of the 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.819
 personal computer 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.859
 but also for 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.210
 keep passwords for access 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.620
 protected sites or have prof 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.690
 on the side we have the power supply port 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.750
 and the door reads and the 45 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.740
 the door vga the door of ep and a door 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.960
 usb 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.060
 the side we find the reader 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.060
 of sd card and smart card reader 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.710
 on the other side instead 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:36.230
 we find two other USB ports 3 0 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.230
 the audio ports 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.920
 and the optical drive 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.880
 instead the difference sees us behind 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.880
 because we find 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.570
 13 inches we have no additional door 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.060
 on the 14 inch we have another door 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.070
 usb weight 15 inches we have a door 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.510
 usb first port 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.590
 happens in mali 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:59.030
 live that three family models and 13 14 15 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.680
 inches with a whole range of 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.569
 common components 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.430
 then we also talk about the station 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.300
 docking station where we find 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.970
 power supply for laptops 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.340
 the two audio ports is a whole series of 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.470
 in particular, four rear doors 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:21.580
 usb ports 3 0 and sata ii displayport le 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.050
 regie 45 for the network the of wight and the 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.370
 classic lie 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.280
 let's see some features ad 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.410
 example in 15 inches the castellan 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.740
 dedicated numeric exactly above 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.720
 digital readers 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.680
 the metallic finish with this edge 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.590
 red and common on all three models 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.590
 three-level backlit keyboard 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.390
 and full hd resolution screen for 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.660
 the 14 inches corresponds to a hd plus 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.500
 in 1600 x 900 and that in 13 which there 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.780
 corresponds to a hd then 1366 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.490
 webcam with double integrated microphone 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.950
 for videoconferencing to be able 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.190
 connect also because thanks to him mps 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.660
 or three 3g or 4g and integrated I can do 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.630
 videoconferences wherever I am 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.810
 find 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.280
 of course 4gb applies to areas 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.760
 offered by this type of service 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.810
 series 3 models 13 14 15 inches le 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.120
 machines are completely 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.960
 configurable so let's talk about memories 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.849
 ddr3 up to 16 gb intel core processors 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.240
 of 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.860
 action and of course mixed discs t 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.190
 I used to be rather than disks 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.849
 hybrid standards with data bars from 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.020
 500gb more sketch 32 gb 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.610
 the machines are completely 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.499
 configurable so let's go around a 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.449
 price from around a thousand euros a 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.889
 depending on the configuration 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.560
 what they can have 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.310
 the integrated 3g or 4g part can have 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.200
 a wireless hands 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.630
 a whole range of a broad spectrum of 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.529
 possibility that allows flexibility 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.199
 is 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.699
 find the right machine for the right 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.269
 time I have the right user for the 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.269
 leg
