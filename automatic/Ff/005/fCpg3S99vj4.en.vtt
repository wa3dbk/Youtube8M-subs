00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello I asked many with it 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.560
 I have something for my face 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.870
 I used to think today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.970
 a top 5 face care products 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.040
 video and thus one always before what it 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.509
 It helped me a pure skin 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.809
 get it helped me 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.430
 to get a nicer plane and how 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.470
 I got my wraps off there 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 Time has been very much developed 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.470
 because I had a lot of stress without skin 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 has changed a lot and that's why 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.500
 I just thought I'd like that one now 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 products before and we catch the same 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.800
 a few more on your wash I have 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 here this is the new coach 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.759
 The tvh is postman grapefruit 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.380
 daily court two play at et 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.570
 magistra likes goldman third bottle 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 or so and really, really 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.360
 important after removing make-up easy 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.489
 I clean his face again 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.620
 bin us towels to taste and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.120
 a court water of galile but 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 after that was with a raccoon over it 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.590
 go the more importantly dampen too 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.180
 really has everything from the main round 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 but really is cleaned and for that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 I like doing that, too 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 certainly humala and everyone else 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.260
 So easy marks just wash your 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.899
 this is my favorite if that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.340
 very pleasant and also the press asks 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.830
 you do not like then as a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.240
 open lid there are very comfortable 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.270
 why because I really like that we 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.010
 but as I said what actually what 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.900
 very important to me is one 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.409
 peeling for the face and there I would have 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.810
 two alternatives and that is one of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.850
 Few want the magical super awesome 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.560
 I'm crazy about that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 We have always bought this at home 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.479
 at my doctor and it's easy 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.670
 a peeling that contains no grains 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 So a peeling that is with fruit 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.600
 acid and yes , some are not 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.159
 only the one that does not work 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.380
 I would have been in alternative and that though 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.420
 her that of altana the peeling cream the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 appointment for small fires extract this for 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
 all skin types and works on 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 super super good I really like that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.360
 I've been to it ever since 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.090
 I think he gets good and very 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.759
 on 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.070
 We are also in natural cosmetics so the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.799
 I think that's important, I think that's it 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.020
 We are also vegan and I like it too 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.039
 Super G like both are really top 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.569
 Products we come to one 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.310
 I'm already crazy 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.049
 what I have kept on every camera 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.850
 always you used up as the show and 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.950
 Although this is the one of neutrogena 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.860
 we actually know that with the best 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.599
 face water I like the post 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.610
 had a lot with but also some 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.379
 but not always so many so it has 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.930
 This is really improving 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.970
 I use like it just totally happy 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.319
 The call hold some find that he 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.360
 not so good use that has no 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.220
 products following problems but me 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.840
 think that's really good for them 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.670
 really need something against blackheads 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.870
 and against pimples we can do that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.000
 Definitely try harder 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.379
 on it and I have ever been the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.519
 best friend and poland no in the 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.930
 Write comments like that 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.329
 hindered then I have that again 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.799
 facial water which is a little more natural 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.420
 and maybe not 3 against pimples 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.519
 but also a very nice skin 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.860
 procures and what is this is that 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.379
 caro sender is roses what you think 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.879
 also with the camera and I am of it 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.709
 also insanely convinced that I believe 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.170
 this is my third or fourth plate 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.850
 or at the crazy bike 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.829
 property and I'm just up 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.139
 So I really need it 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.750
 really good makes the pon smaller 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.459
 is makes the skin just radiate and 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.250
 just really fresh looking so 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.349
 yes I 'm super g smell is not 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.700
 but that's not so bad 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.849
 because the product really would have been 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.829
 top and that in any case any 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.540
 Holidays for the people in Turkey 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.590
 fly a holiday or have friends 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.569
 turkey fly 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.819
 the city does it a lot differently 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.799
 much cheaper than in Germany the 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.209
 job in germany costs 12 euro if 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.000
 one that they ordered from others and 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.560
 so yes medium circle willing cost 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.359
 four euros or so and last but not least 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.080
 sometimes a product that specifically against pimples 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.090
 harbors 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.000
 that here are from valea anti pimple 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.210
 patches with solar and yes that is 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.990
 In each case, I believe such things three times 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.300
 contain 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.620
 that and so pack that again twelve 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.910
 So patches separate that way 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.160
 show in detail once 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.960
 there are so individual 12 patches on it 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.030
 and stuck on a pimple 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.740
 that just comes out or what you notice 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.180
 then it just makes something sticks up 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.610
 Anyone trust it for eight hours 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.750
 So it does not always work 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.940
 not everything stays on top 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.250
 and the next day you realize that 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.900
 the pimple is so easy he becomes 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.700
 not so bad or he will not come 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.800
 Only out with me and I think so 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.990
 I really really super myself 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.540
 I really care about it so we have 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.490
 now at home because that's in everyone 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.739
 Fall is worth it if you are totally total 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.090
 important day one has develop markets 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.380
 and my child out there on it 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.910
 really not the next day 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.530
 bad that I just great cover 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.120
 and that's definitely mine 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.150
 secret against pimples and I will 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.220
 again so were my top five or 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.570
 six products for pure skin and me 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.770
 hope that you like it here easily 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.060
 do not you ever have a product from 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.780
 which you can try out here in the

 Write comments 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.169
 that else can be up at night with the video 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.169
 next time
