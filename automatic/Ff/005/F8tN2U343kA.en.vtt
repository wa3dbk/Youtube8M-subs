00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
competition being pointless and goalless

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.490

and while one would like to bet on them

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.190 
and while one would like to bet on them
because<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> tempting<00:01:11.909> odds

because they have a lot of tempting odds

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.450 
because they have a lot of tempting odds
when<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> comes<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> particular<00:01:14.130> matchup

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
when it comes to this particular matchup

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.560 
when it comes to this particular matchup
as<00:01:14.820> well<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> rest<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
as well as for the rest of the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.899 
as well as for the rest of the
competition<00:01:16.070> there's<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.430> hard<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> argue

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
competition there's it's hard to argue

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
competition there's it's hard to argue
for<00:01:18.090> value<00:01:18.600> when<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:19.650> they're<00:01:19.799> at<00:01:19.890> such<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
for value when when they're at such a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.410 
for value when when they're at such a
disadvantage<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.030> an<00:01:21.119> uphill<00:01:21.240> battle

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
disadvantage and it's an uphill battle

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
disadvantage and it's an uphill battle
for<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:23.070> you're<00:01:23.220> looking

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
for them so I think if you're looking

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.920 
for them so I think if you're looking
for<00:01:23.549> value<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> look

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
for value you're going to have to look

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
for value you're going to have to look
at<00:01:25.110> Italy<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> side<00:01:26.970> markets

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 
a few I mean one thing that I have to
say<00:01:45.000> about<00:01:45.119> Italy<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.930> came<00:01:46.170> into<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
competition and I made it very clear

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
competition and I made it very clear
that<00:01:50.130> they<00:01:50.369> came<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> win<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
that they came here to win it and to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.069 
that they came here to win it and to
play<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:52.829> sure<00:01:53.659> they<00:01:54.659> certainly

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
play well and they sure they certainly

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.990 
play well and they sure they certainly
showed<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.710> their<00:01:55.860> first<00:01:56.040> first<00:01:56.759> match

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
showed that in their first first match

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.810 
showed that in their first first match
so<00:01:57.979> some<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> things<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.759> about

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
so some of the things that I like about

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.030 
so some of the things that I like about
Italy<00:02:00.420> especially<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> particular<00:02:01.619> game

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
Italy especially in this particular game

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.870 
Italy especially in this particular game
with<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:03.090> Japan<00:02:03.770> there's<00:02:04.770> markets<00:02:05.610> for

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
with with Japan there's markets for

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.089 
with with Japan there's markets for
italy<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.869> win<00:02:06.899> both<00:02:07.200> halves<00:02:07.469> i<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.950> that's

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
italy to win both halves i think that's

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.119 
italy to win both halves i think that's
a<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.250> bet<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.910> value<00:02:09.209> 1<00:02:09.330> @<00:02:09.599> +<00:02:10.379> 160<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> think

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
a good bet and a value 1 @ + 160 I think

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.460 
a good bet and a value 1 @ + 160 I think
I've<00:02:11.220> saw<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.730> bet365

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
I've saw that at bet365

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.160 
I've saw that at bet365
popular<00:02:14.280> opinion<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.910> looked<00:02:15.390> at<00:02:15.510> some<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.110> the

leaning<00:02:18.450> towards<00:02:18.840> 20<00:02:19.350> scoreline<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.730> that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
leaning towards 20 scoreline and that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.100 
leaning towards 20 scoreline and that
can<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.060> found<00:02:21.240> actually<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.660> really<00:02:21.900> tasty

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110

be a good bet here Italy certainly has

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.960 
be a good bet here Italy certainly has

their offenses is working really well

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.330 
their offenses is working really well
Pirlo<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.270> Balotelli<00:02:40.170> really<00:02:41.010> played<00:02:41.190> an

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
Pirlo and Balotelli really played an

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.420 
Pirlo and Balotelli really played an
excellent<00:02:41.640> game<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.330> were<00:02:42.390> harassing

excellent game and they were harassing
Mexico<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.520> their<00:02:44.640> first<00:02:44.790> game<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.390> I'm

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
Mexico in their first game and I'm

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.290 
Mexico in their first game and I'm
actually<00:02:46.410> surprised<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.950> match<00:02:47.820> didn't<00:02:48.180> end

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
actually surprised that match didn't end

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.630 
actually surprised that match didn't end
up<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.959> highest<00:02:49.730> goal<00:02:50.730> tally<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:52.490> so<00:02:53.490> I'd

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
up with the highest goal tally so so I'd

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.100 
up with the highest goal tally so so I'd
really<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.300> over<00:02:54.540> point<00:02:54.780> two<00:02:54.930> point

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
really like the over point two point

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.510 
really like the over point two point
five<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.590> particular<00:02:55.800> game<00:02:56.130> especially

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
five in this particular game especially

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.090 
five in this particular game especially
since<00:02:57.090> japan's<00:02:57.750> struggled<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.410> their<00:02:58.560> offense

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
since japan's struggled on their offense

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.400 
since japan's struggled on their offense
in<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.640> first<00:02:59.820> game<00:03:00.090> i<00:03:00.630> think<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.260> could

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
in the first game i think that could

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.980 
in the first game i think that could
play<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> factor<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:02.940> one<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.300> well<00:03:03.450> too<00:03:03.660> so

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
play a factor in this one as well too so

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.420 
play a factor in this one as well too so
what<00:03:04.110> particularly<00:03:04.530> bet<00:03:04.709> stand<00:03:05.070> out<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.400> you

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970

serious about winning this competition
one<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.280> things<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.640> Italy<00:03:21.239> was

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
one of the things that Italy was

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.150 
one of the things that Italy was
struggling<00:03:21.780> with<00:03:21.900> before<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.980> competition

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
struggling with before this competition

was finishing teams off or matches off

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.350 
was finishing teams off or matches off
and<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.550> this<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.820> something<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.120> they're

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
and so this is something that they're

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.759 
and so this is something that they're
looking<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.780> address<00:03:27.959> here<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.410> they<00:03:28.470> really

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769

did that against Mexico towards the the
yen<00:03:32.519> they<00:03:32.760> finished<00:03:33.090> very<00:03:33.269> strong<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:33.810> i'm

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
yen they finished very strong so i'm

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.820 
yen they finished very strong so i'm
looking<00:03:34.019> at<00:03:34.310> italy<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.489> win<00:03:36.230> both<00:03:37.230> halves<00:03:37.530> i

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
looking at italy to win both halves i

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.259 
looking at italy to win both halves i
think<00:03:38.010> especially<00:03:38.160> in<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.610> particular<00:03:38.820> game

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
think especially in this particular game

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.680 
think especially in this particular game
knowing<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.690> Japan<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:39.989> struggling<00:03:41.299> that<00:03:42.299> I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
knowing that Japan is struggling that I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.390 
knowing that Japan is struggling that I
think<00:03:43.049> it's<00:03:43.170> leaking<00:03:43.440> win<00:03:43.590> both<00:03:43.799> halves<00:03:44.070> I

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
think it's leaking win both halves I

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.949 
think it's leaking win both halves I
think<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.090> there<00:03:45.330> are<00:03:45.390> some<00:03:45.510> good<00:03:45.540> odds<00:03:45.750> in

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
think so there are some good odds in

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.699 
think so there are some good odds in
that<00:03:46.080> market<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:47.310> like<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.540> over<00:03:48.810> 2.5<00:03:49.260> goals<00:03:49.320> is

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
that market I like the over 2.5 goals is

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.070 
that market I like the over 2.5 goals is
another<00:03:49.980> market<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.900> good

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
another market that I think is a good

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.039 
another market that I think is a good
one<00:03:52.350> i'm<00:03:53.250> looking<00:03:53.519> at<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.880> higher<00:03:54.540> score<00:03:54.810> in

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
one i'm looking at a higher score in

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.840 
one i'm looking at a higher score in
this<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:55.830> match<00:03:56.040> although<00:03:56.280> i<00:03:56.400> will<00:03:56.670> tell

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
this and this match although i will tell

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.090 
this and this match although i will tell
will<00:03:57.239> say<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.630> popular<00:03:58.260> opinion<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.769> leaning

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
will say that popular opinion is leaning

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.039 
will say that popular opinion is leaning
towards<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.519> lower<00:03:59.700> scoring<00:04:00.120> affair<00:04:00.450> at<00:04:00.570> 20

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
towards the lower scoring affair at 20

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.080 
towards the lower scoring affair at 20
and<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.830> could<00:04:01.950> be<00:04:01.980> founded<00:04:02.340> attempting<00:04:02.880> a

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
and that could be founded attempting a

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.130 
and that could be founded attempting a
plastics<00:04:03.810> hundred<00:04:04.110> at<00:04:04.290> bet365<00:04:05.870> there's<00:04:06.870> gold

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
plastics hundred at bet365 there's gold

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.580 
plastics hundred at bet365 there's gold
differences<00:04:07.680> i<00:04:07.769> think<00:04:07.980> italy<00:04:08.940> will<00:04:09.480> use<00:04:10.320> this

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
differences i think italy will use this

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.330 
differences i think italy will use this
match<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.280> probably<00:04:11.640> score<00:04:12.360> more<00:04:12.870> goals<00:04:13.340> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
match to probably score more goals and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.920 
match to probably score more goals and
i'm<00:04:14.489> looking<00:04:14.700> at<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.970> bigger<00:04:15.269> goal<00:04:15.540> difference

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
i'm looking at a bigger goal difference

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.330 
i'm looking at a bigger goal difference
for<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.380> one<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.919> there's<00:04:17.100> some<00:04:17.220> good

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
for that one so and there's some good

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.729 
for that one so and there's some good
