much about the audience experience we

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.049 
much about the audience experience we
could<00:00:57.260> have<00:00:57.379> done<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.800> lot<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.129> these<00:00:58.219> stunts<00:00:58.550> CG

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
could have done a lot of these stunts CG

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.229 
could have done a lot of these stunts CG
but<00:00:59.329> we<00:00:59.930> chose<00:01:00.170> not<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.949> we<00:01:01.280> we<00:01:01.640> chose<00:01:01.879> not

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
but we chose not to and we we chose not

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.729 
but we chose not to and we we chose not
to<00:01:02.360> because<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:02.960> means<00:01:03.170> something<00:01:03.379> when<00:01:03.649> you

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
to because it means something when you

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.079 
to because it means something when you
watch<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.070> film<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.399> you<00:01:04.460> know<00:01:04.670> he<00:01:04.879> did<00:01:05.059> it

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
watch the film and you know he did it

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.120 
watch the film and you know he did it
but<00:01:05.750> there's<00:01:05.960> another<00:01:06.229> level<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.710> fear<00:01:06.950> that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
but there's another level of fear that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.850 
but there's another level of fear that
you<00:01:07.190> have<00:01:07.250> because<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.820> have<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.030> vicarious

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
you have because you have this vicarious

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.990 
you have because you have this vicarious
interaction<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:09.950> like<00:01:10.100> Jeezy<00:01:10.460> did<00:01:10.789> this

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
interaction you like Jeezy did this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.850 
interaction you like Jeezy did this
thing<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:11.390> know<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:12.140> that's<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.470> thing<00:01:12.500> even

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
thing you know and that's the thing even

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.350 
thing you know and that's the thing even
though<00:01:13.009> CG<00:01:13.399> is<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.520> wonderful<00:01:13.940> tool<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.300> I

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
though CG is a wonderful tool and I

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.700 
though CG is a wonderful tool and I
think<00:01:14.570> we<00:01:14.660> should<00:01:14.869> continue<00:01:15.289> to<00:01:15.320> use<00:01:15.410> it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
think we should continue to use it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.279 
think we should continue to use it
obviously<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.280> develop<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:16.810> sometimes<00:01:17.810> the

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
obviously and develop it sometimes the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.620 
obviously and develop it sometimes the
physical<00:01:18.770> thing<00:01:19.009> is<00:01:19.369> just<00:01:19.820> more<00:01:20.030> effective

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
physical thing is just more effective

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:33.320 
physical thing is just more effective
you<00:01:20.750> know<00:01:20.869> it<00:01:21.110> means<00:01:21.380> more
