00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.599
 p 

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.399
 we enter spicy football to talk about the sentence will be vital to 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.479
 Africa Cup there the Mexican referees 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:13.009
 those who see here the backs armando archundÃ­a and marked RodrÃ­guez 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.239
 referees who have already been World Cup 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.119
 let's talk with felipe with the table 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.380
 it deserves to once again be in the world cup are habits that keep your 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.980
 ing level the referees of the concacaf these are the ones going to South Africa the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.950
 two already mentioned of mexico carlos batres that is a habit that normally 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.780
 daycare of the concacaf the Guatemalan and return antonio aguilar p 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.440
 the Savior 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.720
 It is true that I believe that 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.630
 well the concacaf and the fifa had no more to choose from 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.850
 I believe that if the most experienced and senior referees are the 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.310
 Mexicans why it goes back to irun 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.620
 read a couple of Mexican referees to the World Cup 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.120
 Carlos Batres is one of the most laggards since it is this left behind in the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.300
 leader of batasuna 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.260
 he must walk on 41 42 there and another couple a bit for injuries et there was a 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.170
 knee problem that's why he left the germany world cup then he was returned 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.720
 of a club world cup for having knee problems but well there's no 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.260
 more the truth does not have more referees the 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.030
 that of a total of four spaces 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.220
 you have to fill us 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.620
 necessarily or not because if you give the fifa four spaces you have to fill those that 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.659
 I miss that the new zealand and mexico forum dictates 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.600
 They are the only ones 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.950
 both are spaces are the only ones that have one or two or not for example in 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.689
 Spain a German is what makes me strange for example 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.360
 the Italians could have this the two is two or three 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.109
 but it was in a tweet that deals pretty well 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.960
 but what good to me in the particular thing gives me great pleasure because Mexico returns 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.430
 to be present with two referees 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.540
 i 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.390
 each one with his style are two totally different styles the lic 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.729
 to me in the particular and I have always said the style of arming not me 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.299
 pleases 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.240
 Perez remarked if a second referee is a strong referee that respects well 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.030
 the sessions 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 and take the do well, hopefully you will do very well putting a cross is one of the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.660
 referees so he does not like the style of 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.460
 because he does not suddenly compromise we do not suddenly see matches in football 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.310
 Mexican 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.670
 that he does not want to expel we do not want to be and I think he signs it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.480
 recent is the world club where he did not want to excuse messi not then that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.959
 style I do not like arming archundia has experience but there is something of 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.430
 what there is but for example in him in the last year and in 2007 the kingdom 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.539
 Germany did not do badly 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.539
 he had five games that's why he 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.169
 I wanted to comment that with all that experience that this sea has 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.389
 he wanted it in germany he just managed the final of the club world cup 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.649
 is a strong candidate for the final of the world cup d by those of the 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:34.449
 team clarified 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.319
 and for all the experience gained and Germany did not fill it gave him 10 of the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.929
 experience of the sea Juan Pablo Rodriguez by another runner 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:41.700
 experience 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.019
 but with a 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.579
 also with very large postures of doing something important to drink 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.679
 it is the idol of the afp 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:49.969
 the two retro luxury delegations 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.120
 but here you have to leave something something is very clear n in this list 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.099
 the fifa adopts to know this list of 30 referees from 28 countries but eye this 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.750
 eye 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.220
 the fifa will decide who are central who are substitutes 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.930
 after May because in May they will have their physical evidence their tests and 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.839
 nemecio orikara goes reading amen that will be very strict with the language 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.629
 that there are some ventriloquists in the English language that is the main 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.409
 Endeavor because that clear model 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.409
 that if some loose then to intensive classes and 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.379
 which is an important part of the player's communication but 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.280
 I think also physical in current football, well, that does not happen 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.849
 if not tests 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.360
 these physical exams return you 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.780
 and now I could not speak but as a World Cup referee how long 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.159
 The remaining 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.139
 I was like 25 days at least five of the leaders yes but and in Korea 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:48.479
 but I went like three months before 15 days targeted medical physicals 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.120
 he accused him if that month so many but in which it is worth the newspaper the 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.699
 world one day marked the second past mingo 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.299
 avda did not mark us this magical route state plan navas xabi alonso 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.909
 iniesta is well the first of the hero exit as a player as the 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.149
 box of the tablada deck there are no signs you have left the vega in the end that 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.209
 are repeaters vain and at best
