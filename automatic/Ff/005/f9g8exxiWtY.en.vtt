are<00:01:51.140> five<00:01:51.380> elements<00:01:51.560> there's<00:01:51.980> five<00:01:52.220> elements

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
are five elements there's five elements

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.910 
are five elements there's five elements
so<00:01:53.000> think<00:01:53.450> about<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:54.050> is<00:01:54.230> again<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.560> perfect

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
so think about this is again the perfect

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.320 
so think about this is again the perfect
setting<00:01:55.130> about<00:01:55.340> what<00:01:55.520> we<00:01:55.640> find<00:01:55.880> out<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.180> nature

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
setting about what we find out in nature

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.320 
setting about what we find out in nature
there's<00:01:56.810> an<00:01:56.990> earth<00:01:57.400> so<00:01:58.400> earth<00:01:58.640> would<00:01:58.910> be<00:01:59.030> in

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
there's an earth so earth would be in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.970 
there's an earth so earth would be in
terms<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.900> colors<00:02:00.230> would<00:02:00.350> be<00:02:00.410> like<00:02:00.620> yellows

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
terms of colors would be like yellows

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.300 
terms of colors would be like yellows
okay<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:01.940> we<00:02:02.540> have<00:02:02.750> some<00:02:03.470> daisies<00:02:04.040> or

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
okay so we have some daisies or

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.380 
okay so we have some daisies or
sunflowers

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
sunflowers

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.200 
sunflowers
these<00:02:05.750> are<00:02:05.900> sunflowers<00:02:06.380> or<00:02:06.590> introducing

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
these are sunflowers or introducing

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.990 
these are sunflowers or introducing
a<00:02:08.300> brick<00:02:09.080> border<00:02:09.470> around<00:02:09.650> our<00:02:09.980> garden<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.460> also

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
a brick border around our garden is also

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.330 
a brick border around our garden is also
working<00:02:11.660> with<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.050> earth<00:02:12.200> element<00:02:12.740> one

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
working with the earth element one

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.430 
working with the earth element one
example<00:02:13.640> terracotta<00:02:14.300> pots<00:02:14.660> are<00:02:15.020> very<00:02:15.230> much

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
example terracotta pots are very much

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.980 
example terracotta pots are very much
introducing<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.310> earth<00:02:17.120> element<00:02:17.570> under

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
introducing the earth element under

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.460 
introducing the earth element under
walkway<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.770> brick<00:02:19.460> path<00:02:19.810> stone<00:02:20.810> crunch<00:02:21.170> path

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
walkway a brick path stone crunch path

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.560 
walkway a brick path stone crunch path
that<00:02:21.950> would<00:02:22.100> all<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.310> introducing<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.420> earth

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
that would all be introducing the earth

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.170 
that would all be introducing the earth
elements<00:02:24.140> mm-hmm<00:02:24.830> also<00:02:25.520> in<00:02:25.670> terms<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
elements mm-hmm also in terms of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.580 
elements mm-hmm also in terms of
partnership<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:26.870> want<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.260> think<00:02:27.380> about

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
partnership we want to think about

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.470 
partnership we want to think about
things<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.070> pairs<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.940> our<00:02:29.120> garden

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
things and pairs in our garden

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.750 
things and pairs in our garden
environment<00:02:30.050> okay<00:02:30.560> all<00:02:31.010> right<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.520> would

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
environment okay all right so you would

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.970 
environment okay all right so you would
have<00:02:31.880> two<00:02:32.360> pots<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.780> daisies<00:02:33.170> exactly<00:02:33.800> rather

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
have two pots of daisies exactly rather

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.340 
have two pots of daisies exactly rather
than<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.400> one<00:02:34.580> pot<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.970> exactly<00:02:35.510> if<00:02:36.050> we<00:02:36.200> go

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
than just one pot of exactly if we go

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.200 
than just one pot of exactly if we go
over<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.740> east<00:02:36.980> our<00:02:37.370> East<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.880> about<00:02:38.090> our

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
over to the east our East is about our

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.360 
over to the east our East is about our
health<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:38.930> our<00:02:38.990> longevity<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:39.950> honoring

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
our family that's very much associated

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.650 
our family that's very much associated
with<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.980> wood<00:02:43.160> elements<00:02:43.640> we<00:02:43.850> would<00:02:44.000> say<00:02:44.240> now

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
with the wood elements we would say now

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.630 
with the wood elements we would say now
what<00:02:44.930> element<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.410> itself<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:45.920> always<00:02:46.340> plant

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
what element in itself is always plant

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.820 
what element in itself is always plant
life<00:02:46.820> so<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.150> just<00:02:47.330> say<00:02:47.480> don't<00:02:47.510> weigh<00:02:47.780> anything

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
life so we just say don't weigh anything

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.290 
life so we just say don't weigh anything
plants<00:02:48.830> in<00:02:48.950> general<00:02:49.100> are<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.970> wood<00:02:50.120> element

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
plants in general are the wood element

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.440 
plants in general are the wood element
and<00:02:51.080> think<00:02:51.410> about<00:02:51.620> things<00:02:52.070> too<00:02:52.430> it's<00:02:52.880> creating

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
and think about things too it's creating

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.090 
and think about things too it's creating
a<00:02:53.510> mindfulness<00:02:54.110> for<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.350> types<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.800> plants

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
a mindfulness for the types of plants

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.530 
a mindfulness for the types of plants
that<00:02:55.400> were<00:02:55.640> we're<00:02:56.060> putting<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.420> that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
that were we're putting in that

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.510 
that were we're putting in that
environment<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.020> creating<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.500> balance<00:02:58.010> so

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
environment and creating a balance so

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.470 
environment and creating a balance so
we'd<00:02:58.640> say<00:02:58.790> another<00:02:58.940> thing<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.210> we<00:02:59.270> talk

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
we'd say another thing that we talk

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.000 
we'd say another thing that we talk
about<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.750> terms<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.050> thing<00:03:00.200> Shui<00:03:00.470> as<00:03:00.650> we<00:03:00.800> say

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
about in terms of thing Shui as we say

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.980 
about in terms of thing Shui as we say
yin<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.430> yang<00:03:01.610> right<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.480> balance<00:03:02.840> of

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
yin and yang right the balance of

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.140 
yin and yang right the balance of
masculine<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.830> feminine<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:04.970> know<00:03:05.060> when

masculine and feminine so you know when
we<00:03:05.270> look<00:03:05.420> at<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.600> astilbe<00:03:06.080> here<00:03:06.320> right<00:03:06.530> we'd

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
we look at the astilbe here right we'd

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.160 
we look at the astilbe here right we'd
say<00:03:07.040> that's<00:03:07.310> wearing<00:03:07.790> in<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.630> know<00:03:08.750> Yin<00:03:08.990> is

is very much the water element and water

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.060 
is very much the water element and water
is<00:04:02.000> associated<00:04:02.750> with<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:03.140> north<00:04:03.410> area<00:04:03.620> that's

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
the path that we're on and of course

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
the path that we're on and of course
when<00:04:08.000> we're<00:04:08.090> talking<00:04:08.210> about<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.630> water

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
when we're talking about the water

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.710 
when we're talking about the water
element<00:04:09.340> introducing<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.400> birdbath<00:04:10.790> one<00:04:11.240> final

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
element introducing a birdbath one final

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.800 
element introducing a birdbath one final
thing<00:04:11.870> let's<00:04:12.080> talk<00:04:12.170> about<00:04:12.550> curves<00:04:13.550> her<00:04:14.450> in<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
thing let's talk about curves her in the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.080 
thing let's talk about curves her in the
garden<00:04:15.140> because<00:04:15.230> yeah<00:04:15.890> her<00:04:16.100> pathways<00:04:16.820> are

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
garden because yeah her pathways are

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.229 
garden because yeah her pathways are
curved<00:04:17.419> bad<00:04:17.750> yeah<00:04:18.169> very<00:04:19.010> much<00:04:19.370> we'd<00:04:19.700> say<00:04:19.940> that

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
curved bad yeah very much we'd say that

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.740 
curved bad yeah very much we'd say that
is<00:04:20.450> creating<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:20.989> flow<00:04:21.290> through

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
is creating the flow through

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.210 
is creating the flow through
the<00:04:21.840> space<00:04:22.110> and<00:04:22.350> that<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.650> very<00:04:23.010> much

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
the space and that is very much

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.890 
the space and that is very much
introducing<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:23.970> water<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:24.660> without

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
introducing the water on it so without

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.750 
introducing the water on it so without
having<00:04:25.230> to<00:04:25.500> place<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.740> live<00:04:26.160> water<00:04:26.430> feature

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
having to place a live water feature

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.850 
having to place a live water feature
it's<00:04:27.300> creating<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:27.900> meandering<00:04:28.560> path

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
it's creating that meandering path

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
it's creating that meandering path
that's<00:04:29.430> creating<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.150> introducing<00:04:30.720> the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
that's creating and introducing the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.450 
that's creating and introducing the
water<00:04:30.990> element<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.680> flow<00:04:31.950> if<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.250> will

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
water element and that flow if you will

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.340 
water element and that flow if you will
through<00:04:32.910> our<00:04:33.180> garden<00:04:33.450> so<00:04:33.840> that's<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.290> other

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
through our garden so that's the other

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.570 
through our garden so that's the other
thing<00:04:34.440> in<00:04:34.650> terms<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.950> thanks<00:04:35.190> well<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.460> never
