00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.959 

I'm<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.019> to<00:00:55.260> talk<00:00:55.469> today<00:00:55.769> about<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.160> rhythmic

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
I'm here to talk today about a rhythmic

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
I'm here to talk today about a rhythmic
concept<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:58.109> refer<00:00:58.589> to<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.769> rhythmic

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
concept that I refer to as rhythmic

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.720 
concept that I refer to as rhythmic
calibration<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> idea<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.589> we<00:01:02.370> will

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
calibration the idea is that we will

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.560 
calibration the idea is that we will
work<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.180> learning<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.539> hear<00:01:03.780> specific<00:01:04.350> pulses

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
work on learning to hear specific pulses

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
work on learning to hear specific pulses
that<00:01:06.570> occur<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.350> specific<00:01:08.159> speeds<00:01:08.640> or

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that occur at specific speeds or

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.490 
that occur at specific speeds or
frequencies<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.810> interact<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.350> each

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
frequencies that interact with each

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.850 
frequencies that interact with each
other<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:11.009> order<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> create<00:01:11.960> patterns<00:01:12.960> for

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
other in order to create patterns for

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.380 
other in order to create patterns for
example<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.789> your<00:01:14.820> quarter<00:01:15.270> note

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
example if you have your quarter note

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.230 
example if you have your quarter note
pulse<00:01:15.590> at<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.830> speed<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.940> they<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
pulse at this speed and they have a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.660 
pulse at this speed and they have a
dotted<00:01:18.630> eighth<00:01:18.750> pulse<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.289> is

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
dotted eighth pulse which is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.440 
dotted eighth pulse which is
three-quarters<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> length<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.149> each<00:01:21.270> one

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
three-quarters of the length of each one

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.580 
three-quarters of the length of each one
of<00:01:21.509> these<00:01:21.570> pulses<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:24.330> create<00:01:24.630> composite

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
of these pulses you create composite

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
of these pulses you create composite
rhythm<00:01:26.069> different<00:01:26.520> than<00:01:26.789> then<00:01:27.270> fun<00:01:27.690> about

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
rhythm different than then fun about

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
rhythm different than then fun about
that<00:01:28.319> when<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> reality<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.399> just<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.819> pulse

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
that when in reality it's just one pulse

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.340 
that when in reality it's just one pulse
here<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.289> pulse<00:01:32.810> okay<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:34.110> just

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here and then one pulse okay there just

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
here and then one pulse okay there just
to<00:01:34.530> come<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.539> specific<00:01:36.539> speeds<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:39.210> put<00:01:39.390> them

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to come to specific speeds you put them

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.460 
to come to specific speeds you put them
together<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.960> create<00:01:40.319> harmony<00:01:42.319> the<00:01:43.319> other

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
together to create harmony the other

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
together to create harmony the other
idea<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.100> they're<00:01:44.549> sometimes<00:01:44.880> just

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
idea is that they're sometimes just

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
idea is that they're sometimes just
offset<00:01:45.899> from<00:01:46.020> each<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.649> you've<00:01:46.799> got

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
offset from each other like you've got

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.730 
offset from each other like you've got
the<00:01:47.130> same<00:01:47.399> speed<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:49.610> 40<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:51.509> 2<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> 3<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
the same speed in 40 and a 2 and a 3 and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.059 
the same speed in 40 and a 2 and a 3 and
a<00:01:53.069> 4<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.789> 1<00:01:53.909> by<00:01:54.479> 2<00:01:54.539> or<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.709> like<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> do

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
a 4 and a 1 by 2 or as we like to do

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.260 
a 4 and a 1 by 2 or as we like to do

more<00:02:04.200> clearly<00:02:04.560> defines<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.849> primary

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
more clearly defines the primary

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.380 
more clearly defines the primary
downbeat<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.759> these

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
downbeat which is what all these these

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.690 
downbeat which is what all these these
rhythms<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:12.019> subservient<00:02:13.019> to<00:02:13.700> anyway

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
rhythms have to be subservient to anyway

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.390 
rhythms have to be subservient to anyway
there's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.180> grid<00:02:15.959> or<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.260> grid<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:17.099> one

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
there's a grid or the grid that one

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.440 
there's a grid or the grid that one
learns<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:18.390> hear<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.099> it's<00:02:20.220> comprised<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.060> 12

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
learns to hear and it's comprised of 12

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.350 
learns to hear and it's comprised of 12
specific<00:02:22.080> patterns<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.580> essentially<00:02:24.300> I'm

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
specific patterns so essentially I'm

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.940 
specific patterns so essentially I'm
gonna<00:02:24.510> play<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.720> bass<00:02:24.959> drum<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.410> snare<00:02:25.680> drums

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
gonna play the bass drum and snare drums

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.059 
gonna play the bass drum and snare drums
as<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.220> foundation<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.330> time<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.989> be<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.460 

play<00:02:32.069> each<00:02:32.220> lines<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> while<00:02:33.239> on<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
play each lines for a while on the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.780 
play each lines for a while on the
hi-hat<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.099> can<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.430> how<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
hi-hat so you can see how the the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.620 
hi-hat so you can see how the the
rhythms<00:02:36.180> interact<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.840> create<00:02:36.989> patterns
