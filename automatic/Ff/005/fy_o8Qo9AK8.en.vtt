my<00:00:07.420> children

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.240 

rather<00:00:11.150> now<00:00:12.150> one<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> these

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
rather now one of these

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.110 
rather now one of these
just<00:00:13.940> to<00:00:14.060> figure<00:00:14.240> out

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
just to figure out

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.600 
just to figure out
from<00:00:15.330> silhouette<00:00:16.110> Brook<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:17.130> we're<00:00:17.340> showing

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
from silhouette Brook like we're showing

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.269 
from silhouette Brook like we're showing
here<00:00:18.320> you<00:00:19.320> don't<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.100> way

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
here you don't have to do it this way

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.800 
here you don't have to do it this way
you<00:00:20.430> can<00:00:20.580> actually<00:00:20.910> just<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.150> an<00:00:21.330> artist<00:00:21.660> or

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
you can actually just have an artist or

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.540 
you can actually just have an artist or
yourself<00:00:22.200> and<00:00:22.320> draw<00:00:22.470> an<00:00:22.619> outline<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.250> in

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
yourself and draw an outline because in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
yourself and draw an outline because in
the<00:00:23.670> end<00:00:23.820> that's<00:00:24.689> all<00:00:24.930> we're<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.200> to<00:00:25.259> be

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the end that's all we're going to be

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.400 
the end that's all we're going to be
doing<00:00:26.360> so<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.480> taraweeh<00:00:27.900> pick<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.259> we're

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
doing so the taraweeh pick out we're

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.200 
doing so the taraweeh pick out we're
just<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.770> send<00:00:29.040> through<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> scanner<00:00:29.669> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
just going to send through a scanner to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.300 
just going to send through a scanner to
this<00:00:30.330> CAD<00:00:31.290> drawing<00:00:31.619> software<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.220> the

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
this CAD drawing software on the

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.280 
this CAD drawing software on the
computer<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.910> trace<00:00:33.180> an<00:00:33.329> outline<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.960> that's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
computer and trace an outline so that's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.549 
computer and trace an outline so that's
really<00:00:35.190> why<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:35.489> looking<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:36.200> need<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> get

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
really why we're looking for need to get

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.750 
really why we're looking for need to get
the<00:00:37.680> outline<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.220> today<00:00:38.460> we're<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the outline and today we're going to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.900 
the outline and today we're going to
pick<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.090> little<00:00:39.420> fancy<00:00:39.690> figure<00:00:40.260> birth<00:00:40.910> line

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
pick this little fancy figure birth line

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.229 
pick this little fancy figure birth line
with<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:42.930> red<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.350> any<00:00:43.559> money

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.250 

alright<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:48.420> I'm<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.630> to<00:00:48.720> scan<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> image

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
alright now I'm going to scan the image

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
alright now I'm going to scan the image
on<00:00:49.560> a<00:00:49.590> scanner<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.310> just<00:00:50.579> send<00:00:50.880> it<00:00:51.030> through

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
on a scanner and just send it through

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
on a scanner and just send it through
the<00:00:51.300> drawing<00:00:51.540> program

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.160 

now<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.310> in<00:00:56.490> our

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
now we're in our

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.579 
now we're in our
let's<00:00:57.679> go<00:00:57.800> image<00:00:58.370> in<00:00:58.550> here<00:00:59.079> so<00:01:00.079> I'll<00:01:00.199> come<00:01:00.379> down

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
let's go image in here so I'll come down

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.790 
let's go image in here so I'll come down
bringing<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.129> scanning<00:01:01.460> software<00:01:02.649> it's<00:01:03.649> if

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
bringing the scanning software it's if

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.300 
bringing the scanning software it's if
the<00:01:03.949> scanner<00:01:04.280> does<00:01:04.640> skin<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.630> pick<00:01:05.869> out<00:01:06.020> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
the scanner does skin and pick out the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.690 
the scanner does skin and pick out the
line<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.640> rabbit<00:01:08.000> right<00:01:08.240> there

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.219 

the<00:01:11.700> silhouette<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.420> scanned<00:01:12.840> into<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the silhouette is now scanned into the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.080 
the silhouette is now scanned into the
CAD<00:01:13.439> program<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.280> want<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.579> get<00:01:14.700> rid<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.939> all

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
CAD program so we want to get rid of all

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.649 
CAD program so we want to get rid of all
this<00:01:15.240> excess<00:01:15.750> black<00:01:17.119> designs<00:01:18.119> around<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this excess black designs around the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.660 
this excess black designs around the
edges<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.200> keep<00:01:19.679> that<00:01:19.710> open<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.219> eraser

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
edges here keep that open and eraser

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.850 
edges here keep that open and eraser
tool

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.920 

all<00:01:28.340> right<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.700> can<00:01:28.880> see<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:29.240> that<00:01:29.480> we<00:01:29.660> have

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
all right you can see now that we have

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.360 
all right you can see now that we have
pretty<00:01:30.320> much<00:01:30.440> cleaned<00:01:30.770> up<00:01:30.890> an<00:01:31.010> image<00:01:31.220> but

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
pretty much cleaned up an image but

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.040 
pretty much cleaned up an image but
there<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.550> still<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.790> few<00:01:32.060> spots<00:01:32.360> laying<00:01:32.900> around

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
there is still a few spots laying around

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.560 
there is still a few spots laying around
so<00:01:33.440> I'm<00:01:33.530> going<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.770> do<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.130> use<00:01:34.940> our<00:01:35.060> tracing

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
so I'm going to do is use our tracing

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.240 
so I'm going to do is use our tracing
tool<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:36.230> turn<00:01:36.470> into<00:01:36.650> an<00:01:36.890> outline

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
tool to turn into an outline

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.300 
tool to turn into an outline
now<00:01:40.180> we<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.540> an<00:01:40.750> outline<00:01:41.170> now<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.710> needs

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
now we have an outline now that needs

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.130 
now we have an outline now that needs
some<00:01:42.490> little<00:01:42.730> cleaning<00:01:43.090> up<00:01:43.240> yeah<00:01:43.750> mine<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:43.990> a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
some little cleaning up yeah mine is a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.080 
some little cleaning up yeah mine is a
vector<00:01:44.590> drawing<00:01:44.770> now<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.250> not<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.400> pixel<00:01:45.820> image

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
vector drawing now and not a pixel image

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.090 
vector drawing now and not a pixel image
so<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.080> computer<00:01:47.440> understands<00:01:47.890> this

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
so the computer understands this

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.670 
so the computer understands this
mathematically<00:01:48.910> we<00:01:49.180> can<00:01:49.330> begin<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:49.840> work<00:01:50.620> with

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
mathematically we can begin to work with

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.920 
mathematically we can begin to work with
it<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.310> different<00:01:51.340> way<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.450> please<00:01:52.540> get<00:01:52.780> rid

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
it in a different way so please get rid

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.050 
it in a different way so please get rid
of<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.080> bodies<00:01:53.380> those<00:01:53.560> spots<00:01:53.980> and<00:01:54.310> lines<00:01:54.730> and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
of the bodies those spots and lines and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.330 
of the bodies those spots and lines and
dots<00:01:55.240> we<00:01:55.450> don't<00:01:55.660> want<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.870> use<00:01:56.050> some<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:57.160> in

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
dots we don't want to use some here in

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.160 
dots we don't want to use some here in
the<00:01:57.460> tail<00:01:57.700> I'm<00:01:58.420> going<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.690> get<00:01:58.780> rid<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:58.930> those

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
the tail I'm going to get rid of those

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.470 
the tail I'm going to get rid of those
and<00:01:59.560> there's<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.800> couple<00:01:59.950> more<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.520> then<00:02:01.240> want

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
and there's a couple more and then want

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.700 
and there's a couple more and then want
to<00:02:01.510> check<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.840> see<00:02:01.870> if<00:02:02.140> our<00:02:02.290> lines<00:02:02.500> are

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
to check to see if our lines are

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.250 
to check to see if our lines are
connecting<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:04.360> one<00:02:04.690> of<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.900> next

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
connecting because one of the next

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.360 
connecting because one of the next
things<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.530> have<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.650> do<00:02:05.830> is<00:02:05.920> make<00:02:06.070> sure<00:02:06.100> we

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
things you have to do is make sure we

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.130 
things you have to do is make sure we
have<00:02:06.400> one<00:02:06.700> continuous<00:02:07.300> line<00:02:07.540> going<00:02:07.900> all<00:02:08.050> the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
have one continuous line going all the

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.380 
have one continuous line going all the
way<00:02:08.170> around<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:09.280> outside<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.910> line<00:02:10.090> than

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
way around the outside of the line than

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.510 
way around the outside of the line than
the<00:02:10.420> rabbit<00:02:10.860> alright<00:02:11.860> I<00:02:11.890> have<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> spot<00:02:12.490> here

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
the rabbit alright I have a spot here

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.449 
the rabbit alright I have a spot here
that<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.390> can<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.870> broken<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:15.310> I'm

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
that just I can see is broken so I'm

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.670 
that just I can see is broken so I'm
going<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.730> cut<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.420> out<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.959> then<00:02:17.170> attach

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
going to cut that out and then attach

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.740 
going to cut that out and then attach
them<00:02:17.920> together<00:02:18.130> these<00:02:18.790> two<00:02:19.060> dots<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.600> then

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
them together these two dots and then

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.480 
them together these two dots and then
while<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> continuous<00:02:20.920> line<00:02:21.070> there<00:02:21.400> we

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
while we have a continuous line there we

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.660 
while we have a continuous line there we
go

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.760 

okay<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:27.880> I'm<00:02:28.000> gonna<00:02:28.150> scale<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.720> line<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
okay now I'm gonna scale the line to the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.010 
okay now I'm gonna scale the line to the
after<00:02:30.010> size<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.430> an<00:02:30.550> end<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.880> cutting<00:02:31.210> the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
after size with an end of cutting the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.510 
after size with an end of cutting the
first<00:02:32.170> are<00:02:32.380> grayed<00:02:32.590> out<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:32.860> we<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.400> it's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
first are grayed out so we can it's

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.360 
first are grayed out so we can it's
easier<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.590> there<00:02:35.590> nothing<00:02:36.040> I'm<00:02:36.100> going<00:02:36.250> to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
easier to see there nothing I'm going to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.280 
easier to see there nothing I'm going to
scale<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.940> up<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.020> same

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
scale it up so that it's in the same

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960 
scale it up so that it's in the same
proportion<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.010> only<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.610> much<00:02:39.760> bigger

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
proportion but only it's of much bigger

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.870 
proportion but only it's of much bigger
size<00:02:40.300> it's<00:02:41.140> still<00:02:41.380> imaginary<00:02:42.280> computer<00:02:42.760> and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
size it's still imaginary computer and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.150 
size it's still imaginary computer and
drawing<00:02:43.270> board<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.870> we'll<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.680> line<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.890> up

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
drawing board so we'll just line it up

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.680 
drawing board so we'll just line it up
and<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.730> next<00:02:45.760> step<00:02:46.090> would<00:02:46.180> be<00:02:46.240> sending

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
and then the next step would be sending

00:02:46.690 --> 00:03:00.390 
and then the next step would be sending
it<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.080> cam<00:02:47.950> program

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.679 

so<00:03:01.400> here's<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.670> little<00:03:01.970> way<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.180> use<00:03:02.510> our

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
so here's a little way to use our

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.330 
so here's a little way to use our
computer<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.439> check<00:03:03.620> for<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.920> router<00:03:04.129> bit

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
computer to check for the router bit

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.920 
computer to check for the router bit
size<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.909> see<00:03:05.060> how<00:03:05.209> well<00:03:05.390> they're<00:03:05.569> cutting

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
size and see how well they're cutting

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.199 
size and see how well they're cutting
our<00:03:06.019> long<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.739> we<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.640> drew<00:03:07.790> these<00:03:07.970> little

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
our long and we just drew these little

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.330 
our long and we just drew these little
red<00:03:08.360> dots<00:03:08.599> that<00:03:08.840> exact<00:03:09.260> proportion<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.920> our

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
red dots that exact proportion to our

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.360 
red dots that exact proportion to our
drawing<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.079> can<00:03:12.200> see<00:03:12.349> that<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.890> by

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
drawing and you can see that just by

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.949 
drawing and you can see that just by
moving<00:03:13.549> them<00:03:13.790> around<00:03:14.000> how<00:03:14.360> well<00:03:14.569> they<00:03:14.750> will

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
moving them around how well they will

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.410 
moving them around how well they will
fit<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.530> won't<00:03:15.680> fit<00:03:15.980> like<00:03:16.819> here<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.269> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
fit or it won't fit like here just a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.420 
fit or it won't fit like here just a
half<00:03:17.810> inch<00:03:17.989> size<00:03:18.170> won't<00:03:18.440> even<00:03:18.650> make<00:03:18.769> it<00:03:18.829> past

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
half inch size won't even make it past

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.089 
half inch size won't even make it past
the<00:03:19.610> rabbit's<00:03:19.970> nose<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.200> let's<00:03:21.379> go<00:03:21.560> grab<00:03:21.799> the

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
the rabbit's nose so let's go grab the

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.160 
the rabbit's nose so let's go grab the
corner<00:03:22.700> in<00:03:22.760> size<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.239> see<00:03:23.390> how<00:03:23.540> well<00:03:23.750> that<00:03:23.780> one

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
corner in size and see how well that one

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.740 
corner in size and see how well that one
would<00:03:24.319> do<00:03:24.670> now<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:25.730> move<00:03:25.939> the<00:03:26.090> corner<00:03:26.329> in<00:03:26.450> size

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
would do now we move the corner in size

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.869 
would do now we move the corner in size
you<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.799> see<00:03:27.829> that's<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.190> little<00:03:28.370> better<00:03:28.519> fit

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
you can see that's a little better fit

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.789 
you can see that's a little better fit
but<00:03:29.060> we<00:03:29.090> still<00:03:29.359> have<00:03:29.510> quite<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> few<00:03:29.959> places<00:03:30.349> in

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
but we still have quite a few places in

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.160 
but we still have quite a few places in
the<00:03:31.400> hair<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.299> rabbits<00:03:32.629> main<00:03:32.840> where<00:03:33.079> it

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
the hair on the rabbits main where it

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.649 
the hair on the rabbits main where it
won't<00:03:33.349> fit<00:03:33.560> at<00:03:33.680> all<00:03:33.909> so<00:03:34.909> we<00:03:35.269> want<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.540> do<00:03:35.629> a

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
won't fit at all so we want to do a

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.360 
won't fit at all so we want to do a
better<00:03:35.900> fit<00:03:36.170> than<00:03:36.319> that<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:36.829> let's<00:03:36.859> make<00:03:37.280> an

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
better fit than that so let's make an

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.520 
better fit than that so let's make an
even<00:03:37.609> smaller<00:03:38.090> router<00:03:38.450> bit<00:03:38.720> size<00:03:38.930> let's<00:03:39.290> try

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
even smaller router bit size let's try

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.580 
even smaller router bit size let's try
the<00:03:39.970> 1/8<00:03:40.970> inch<00:03:41.180> size<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.840> see<00:03:41.989> we<00:03:42.349> can<00:03:42.470> see

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
the 1/8 inch size and see we can see

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.770 
the 1/8 inch size and see we can see
that<00:03:42.709> fits<00:03:42.920> much<00:03:43.099> better<00:03:43.159> it's<00:03:43.639> to<00:03:43.819> us<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:44.299> few

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
that fits much better it's to us a few

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.300 
that fits much better it's to us a few
spots<00:03:45.019> we<00:03:45.170> can<00:03:45.379> get<00:03:45.590> but<00:03:45.739> let's<00:03:45.920> go<00:03:46.010> ahead<00:03:46.099> and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
spots we can get but let's go ahead and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.589 
spots we can get but let's go ahead and
use<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:51.639> all<00:03:52.639> right<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.849> last<00:03:52.970> part<00:03:53.299> here<00:03:53.480> is

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
use that all right the last part here is

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.899 
use that all right the last part here is
say<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.409> draw<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.859> send<00:03:55.159> it<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.400> their<00:03:55.549> camp

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
say the draw and send it to their camp

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:05.350 
say the draw and send it to their camp
program

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.550 

all<00:04:06.360> right<00:04:06.570> we're<00:04:06.690> now<00:04:06.780> engineering<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
all right we're now engineering to the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.500 
all right we're now engineering to the
camp<00:04:07.830> program<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.820> program<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.360> will

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
camp program this is a program that will

use capric the apps your path or the
router<00:04:12.050> pressing<00:04:13.050> on<00:04:13.170> do<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.440> set<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.770> size<00:04:14.010> to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
router pressing on do it set the size to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.560 
router pressing on do it set the size to
match<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.580> board<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.210> we're<00:04:15.330> going<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.480> be

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
match the board that we're going to be

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.210 
match the board that we're going to be
cutting<00:04:15.780> out<00:04:15.930> which<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.290> 10<00:04:16.500> inches<00:04:16.770> tall<00:04:16.950> by

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
cutting out which is 10 inches tall by

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.150 
cutting out which is 10 inches tall by
20<00:04:18.120> inches<00:04:18.420> wide<00:04:18.620> now<00:04:19.620> I'm<00:04:19.739> going<00:04:19.860> to<00:04:19.920> bring<00:04:20.010> in

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
20 inches wide now I'm going to bring in

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.010 
20 inches wide now I'm going to bring in
the<00:04:20.250> file<00:04:20.520> from<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.820> CAD<00:04:21.090> program<00:04:21.120> until<00:04:21.900> they

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
the file from the CAD program until they

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.110 
the file from the CAD program until they
are<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:23.130> first<00:04:23.340> thing<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.580> do<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:23.880> program

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
are and the first thing I do is program

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.420 
are and the first thing I do is program
the<00:04:24.480> two<00:04:24.720> small<00:04:25.350> little<00:04:25.620> inner<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.950> cuts<00:04:26.220> and

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
the two small little inner of cuts and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.910 
the two small little inner of cuts and
the<00:04:26.580> rabbit<00:04:26.940> these<00:04:27.870> are<00:04:28.020> inner<00:04:28.230> cuts<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.770> not

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
the rabbit these are inner cuts and not

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.700 
the rabbit these are inner cuts and not
exterior<00:04:29.580> cuts<00:04:29.850> like<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.210> outline<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.560> I'll

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
exterior cuts like the outline so I'll

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.130 
exterior cuts like the outline so I'll
program<00:04:31.920> these<00:04:32.310> for<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.760> router<00:04:33.030> path<00:04:33.330> and

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
program these for the router path and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.870 
program these for the router path and
then<00:04:34.290> I'll<00:04:34.410> move<00:04:34.500> on<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.010> whole<00:04:35.220> outside

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
then I'll move on to the whole outside

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.960 
then I'll move on to the whole outside
of<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.330> lion<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.870> rabbit<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.700> select<00:04:38.700> Brad

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
of the lion and the rabbit I select Brad

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.750 
of the lion and the rabbit I select Brad
out<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.360> know<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.540> program<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.050> path<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.920> then

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
out you know I program the path and then

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.130 
out you know I program the path and then
the<00:04:41.850> second<00:04:42.180> here<00:04:42.300> will<00:04:42.420> show<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:42.600> a<00:04:42.840> close-up

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
the second here will show you a close-up

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.740 
the second here will show you a close-up
of<00:04:43.470> what<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.830> path<00:04:44.040> looks<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.630> there's<00:04:45.630> a

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
of what the path looks like there's a

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.500 
of what the path looks like there's a
little<00:04:46.080> brown<00:04:46.290> line<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:47.160> that's<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.270> path

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
little brown line and that's the path

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.140 
little brown line and that's the path
you<00:04:48.750> outer<00:04:49.080> will<00:04:49.380> actually<00:04:49.770> take<00:04:50.040> with<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.640> 1/8

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
you outer will actually take with a 1/8

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.530 
you outer will actually take with a 1/8
inch<00:04:51.180> size<00:04:51.600> bit<00:04:52.610> all<00:04:53.610> right<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:53.940> let's<00:04:54.150> move<00:04:54.360> on

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
inch size bit all right so let's move on

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:03.370 
inch size bit all right so let's move on
from<00:04:54.660> there

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:13.360 

you

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.760 

right<00:05:14.000> now<00:05:14.120> here<00:05:14.330> we<00:05:14.360> are<00:05:14.450> in<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.810> ass

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
right now here we are in the ass

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.790 
right now here we are in the ass
rather<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.900> can<00:05:18.020> see<00:05:18.229> we're<00:05:18.379> starting<00:05:18.530> with

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
rather you can see we're starting with

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800 
rather you can see we're starting with
those<00:05:18.889> two<00:05:19.129> small<00:05:19.520> internal<00:05:19.970> cuts<00:05:20.300> inside<00:05:20.690> the

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
those two small internal cuts inside the

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.559 
those two small internal cuts inside the
rabbit<00:05:21.639> and<00:05:22.639> then<00:05:22.759> we're<00:05:22.910> going<00:05:23.030> to<00:05:23.090> stir<00:05:23.419> it

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:23.569 
rabbit and then we're going to stir it

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.050 
rabbit and then we're going to stir it
at<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:24.139> bottom<00:05:24.409> of<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.490> lion<00:05:27.789> so<00:05:28.789> there<00:05:28.970> we<00:05:29.030> go

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
at the bottom of the lion so there we go

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.550 
at the bottom of the lion so there we go
I<00:05:29.180> was<00:05:29.419> starting<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.810> cut<00:05:30.020> at<00:05:30.139> the<00:05:30.229> bottom<00:05:30.379> of

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
I was starting the cut at the bottom of

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.800 
I was starting the cut at the bottom of
the<00:05:30.620> lion<00:05:30.860> it'll<00:05:31.370> be<00:05:31.849> moving<00:05:32.090> on<00:05:32.360> quickly<00:05:32.690> to

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
the lion it'll be moving on quickly to

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.689 
the lion it'll be moving on quickly to
the<00:05:33.080> front<00:05:33.229> paws<00:05:33.620> odds<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.099> lion<00:05:34.310> now<00:05:34.610> we

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
the front paws odds of the lion now we

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:35.740 
the front paws odds of the lion now we
can<00:05:34.849> see<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.210> there's<00:05:35.449> a<00:05:35.539> line<00:05:35.720> already

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
can see that there's a line already

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.770 
can see that there's a line already
there<00:05:36.639> that<00:05:37.639> was<00:05:37.729> actually<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.090> fast<00:05:38.389> start

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
there that was actually a fast start

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.469 
there that was actually a fast start
because<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.319> router<00:05:39.500> bit<00:05:39.710> wasn't<00:05:40.449> low<00:05:41.449> enough

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
because the router bit wasn't low enough

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.300 
because the router bit wasn't low enough
so<00:05:42.020> I<00:05:42.409> had<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.710> store<00:05:42.949> it<00:05:43.039> over<00:05:45.099> here<00:05:46.099> we<00:05:46.190> go

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
so I had to store it over here we go

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.830 
so I had to store it over here we go
with<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.550> front<00:05:46.729> part<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:47.449> now<00:05:47.539> we're<00:05:47.690> gonna

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
with the front part and now we're gonna

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.950 
with the front part and now we're gonna
be<00:05:48.229> coming<00:05:48.680> around<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:50.240> then<00:05:50.539> we're<00:05:50.750> gonna<00:05:50.840> be

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
be coming around and then we're gonna be

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.740 
be coming around and then we're gonna be
reaching<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.380> lion's<00:05:51.770> head

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
reaching the lion's head

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.309 
reaching the lion's head
you<00:05:53.750> see<00:05:53.900> our<00:05:54.050> view<00:05:54.259> is<00:05:54.380> upside<00:05:54.740> down<00:05:56.259> so<00:05:57.259> you

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
you see our view is upside down so you

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.050 
you see our view is upside down so you
have<00:05:57.560> to<00:05:57.680> kind<00:05:58.039> of<00:05:58.099> hold<00:05:58.280> that<00:05:58.430> in<00:05:58.610> your<00:05:58.639> mind

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
have to kind of hold that in your mind

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.540 
have to kind of hold that in your mind
about<00:05:59.650> we're<00:06:00.650> now<00:06:00.740> looking<00:06:00.889> at<00:06:01.159> this<00:06:01.280> right

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
about we're now looking at this right

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.870 
about we're now looking at this right
side<00:06:01.819> up<00:06:02.060> so<00:06:02.889> here<00:06:03.889> we<00:06:03.979> are<00:06:04.009> the<00:06:04.340> lion's<00:06:04.729> head

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
side up so here we are the lion's head

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.659 
side up so here we are the lion's head
is<00:06:05.360> starting<00:06:05.840> you<00:06:06.159> know<00:06:07.159> I'm<00:06:07.280> going<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.460> come

is starting you know I'm going to come
around<00:06:07.789> to<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:09.620> lion's<00:06:10.009> mane<00:06:10.310> on<00:06:10.699> the<00:06:11.569> back<00:06:11.750> of

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
around to the lion's mane on the back of

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.619 
around to the lion's mane on the back of
the<00:06:11.990> head<00:06:12.759> this<00:06:13.759> is<00:06:13.909> the<00:06:14.000> area<00:06:14.300> we're<00:06:14.509> actually

lion's tail this is a fairly long tail
gets<00:06:42.590> a<00:06:42.680> little<00:06:42.800> thin<00:06:43.250> here<00:06:43.810> this<00:06:44.810> is<00:06:44.930> one<00:06:45.080> of

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
gets a little thin here this is one of

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.300 
gets a little thin here this is one of
the<00:06:45.229> things<00:06:45.409> you<00:06:45.500> have<00:06:45.620> to<00:06:45.650> watch<00:06:45.889> out<00:06:46.130> when

the things you have to watch out when
you<00:06:46.340> do<00:06:46.550> silhouettes<00:06:47.090> is<00:06:47.270> you<00:06:47.389> can't<00:06:47.599> get<00:06:47.810> too

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
you do silhouettes is you can't get too

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.529 
you do silhouettes is you can't get too
thin<00:06:48.550> but<00:06:49.550> this<00:06:49.699> doesn't<00:06:50.000> work<00:06:50.120> well<00:06:50.300> with

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
thin but this doesn't work well with

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:54.070 
thin but this doesn't work well with
sticks<00:06:50.930> there<00:06:51.380> are<00:06:51.529> strings<00:06:51.889> or<00:06:52.930> branches<00:06:53.930> of

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
sticks there are strings or branches of

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.850 
sticks there are strings or branches of
trees<00:06:54.110> you<00:06:55.039> really<00:06:55.250> want<00:06:55.430> you<00:06:55.490> to<00:06:55.580> have<00:06:55.699> some

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:56.860 
trees you really want you to have some

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.200 
trees you really want you to have some
certain<00:06:57.860> width<00:06:58.069> to<00:06:58.279> keep<00:06:58.490> the<00:06:58.669> strength<00:06:58.969> and

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
certain width to keep the strength and

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.709 
certain width to keep the strength and
the<00:06:59.330> word<00:06:59.479> once<00:06:59.750> it's<00:06:59.960> finished<00:07:00.139> cut<00:07:01.509> so<00:07:02.509> now

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:02.719 
the word once it's finished cut so now

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:04.809 
the word once it's finished cut so now
this<00:07:02.900> is<00:07:02.960> wrong<00:07:03.259> the<00:07:03.500> back<00:07:03.710> paw<00:07:04.039> you<00:07:04.729> know

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:04.819 
this is wrong the back paw you know

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.779 
this is wrong the back paw you know
we're<00:07:05.529> near<00:07:06.529> the<00:07:06.560> underbelly<00:07:07.159> of<00:07:07.310> the<00:07:07.580> lion

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789 
we're near the underbelly of the lion

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.059 
we're near the underbelly of the lion
and<00:07:08.240> this<00:07:08.449> is<00:07:08.569> actually<00:07:08.960> just<00:07:09.110> the<00:07:09.469> part<00:07:09.889> we're

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:10.069 
and this is actually just the part we're

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.409 
and this is actually just the part we're
almost<00:07:10.279> done<00:07:10.669> a<00:07:11.319> fairly<00:07:12.319> quick<00:07:12.560> cut<00:07:12.830> out<00:07:13.419> and

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419 
almost done a fairly quick cut out and

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:15.969 
almost done a fairly quick cut out and
some<00:07:14.690> are<00:07:14.870> simpler<00:07:15.440> and<00:07:15.590> some<00:07:15.740> are<00:07:15.889> more

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
some are simpler and some are more

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:22.129 
some are simpler and some are more
complicated

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.340 

now<00:07:22.979> you<00:07:23.039> can<00:07:23.220> see<00:07:23.340> that<00:07:23.490> there<00:07:23.639> are<00:07:23.669> fine

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.350 
now you can see that there are fine

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:33.839 
now you can see that there are fine
very<00:07:24.920> very<00:07:25.220> close<00:07:25.520> to<00:07:25.820> the<00:07:25.850> Astra<00:07:26.300> silhouette

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:33.849
