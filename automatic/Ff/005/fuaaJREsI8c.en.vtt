00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We are traveling in the footsteps

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"Of those who’ve gone before,"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
"And we’ll all be reunited,"

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
"On a new and sunlit shore,"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
"Oh, when the saints go marching in"

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
"Oh, when the saints go marching in"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I want to be in that number

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When the saints go marching in

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And when the sun begins to shine

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And when the sun begins to shine

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I want to be in that number

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
When the sun begins to shine

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We are traveling in the footsteps

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
"Of those who’ve gone before,"

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
"And we’ll all be reunited,"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
"On a new and sunlit shore,"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
"Oh, when the saints go marching in"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"Oh, when the saints go marching in"

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I want to be in that number

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
When the saints go marching in

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
"Oh, when the trumpet sounds its call"

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
"Oh, when the trumpet sounds its call"

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I want to be in that number

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
When the trumpet sounds its call

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
"Oh, when the saints go marching in"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
"Oh, when the saints go marching in"

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I want to be in that number

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
When the saints go marching in
