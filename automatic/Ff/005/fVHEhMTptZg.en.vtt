00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.349
 Very good to all kids know 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.849
 I extract a new video and already in this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.009
 case we are in a new 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.930
 curiosity with fernando or the new 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.820
 front of kids and well we're going to 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.169
 talk about a video that rose fernando 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.180
 until the days I will leave it in the 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.009
 description and I want you to see it before 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.899
 to see this video then why then 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.349
 because you are going to understand the hypothesis that 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.489
 made fernando and the new hypothesis that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.860
 we have taken more than nothing is for 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.840
 understand this video is worth then let's go 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 to talk about two clans the first one 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 I love and well I will make a brief summary 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.989
 of him and it's a clan where everyone 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.360
 the players have the same level the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 same steal of cups of resources and everything 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.899
 exactly the same even the villages and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.530
 because the hypothesis we had was that 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.720
 He had created a player and as good 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.820
 closing that explains the hypothesis that 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.190
 we have taken out afterwards well if it is 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.769
 new then new hypothesis but that is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 more truthful so to speak and we believe 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.820
 which is a village that has created supertel 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.100
 it's not a robot village that created its 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 profile when they took out the game and this is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 simply because people at the beginning 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.990
 he was bored and could not find a village because 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.060
 there were not the millions 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 players that are currently connected 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 because we have come to this conclusion 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.780
 well simply if we can see in the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.240
 stealing gold and elixir we see that they have 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.210
 stolen 65 thousand gold all over the world and not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.119
 it's enough gold to be able to create that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.310
 village not also if we realize in 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.890
 the profile does not have a dark troop and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.899
 this hypothesis what can you give us 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.909
 understand is that the dark troops 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.710
 they were an update therefore to 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.689
 be an update this was created at 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.850
 principle is worth these plans are already 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.069
 totally inactive supertel does not use them 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.659
 for nothing but in his day there were no 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.299
 dark tests and therefore it is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 a new a new hypothesis no and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.289
 principally and mainly that does not stop 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.710
 that people can find a village and not 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.740
 can be bored 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.829
 and good too 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.899
 really understand really is a clan 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.700
 of your profile if we go to a clan 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.099
 called james ward 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.560
 is a clan also created by its profile 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.730
 and before there was only one player now like this 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 that is full but they are players 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.000
 normal comes a player called ex-master 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.400
 that is requested and we visit it because we 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.890
 let's find with a rare something worth 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.739
 so much if you want to explain it you 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.810
 Well, the leader of this clan does not 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.330
 have warehouses there and it's supposed to 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.280
 when you enter the game for the first time 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.390
 The game that you think is a 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.480
 store to start improving things 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.250
 exact expert and well then this is 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.050
 because before then players 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.470
 well there were not so many players at 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.330
 beginning of the game and for the few 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.370
 players who had then took a long time 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.870
 in finding a village to attack not 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.970
 there were villages to attack and well its 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.860
 profile I think this then to fill a 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.100
 little servers more than anything 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.510
 only and for nothing this is the 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.700
 hypothesis that we have taken we have 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 found two clear of his profile no 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.440
 I know if there will be much more and then 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.440
 we wanted to put a goal of likes 430 and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.930
 the 700-800 too and we can go up 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.370
 new interesting curiosities and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.010
 that above all we are working for 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.170
 find some that are reactionary 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.660
 factor to find this curiosity already 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.280
 record this video we have tried to record 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.310
 this video like 50 times you are 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.080
 will warn if it is true and not with analysis 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.730
 plus 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.770
 I hope it's yours the video I hope 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.150
 that is entertaining and we see ourselves in a 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.150
 next video goodbye
