00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.139
 people in our domain in the middle of the year when all of us health 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.289
 Germany 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.299
 after the child's cow should not have stopped health he passes 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.659
 then to be fed by a washerwoman now a bucket 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.710
 every day the producer has to separate a quantity of milk to feed 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.149
 this unemployment at the end of 60 days which is what the survey recommends 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.909
 in what the recommended extension we spend around 200 liters of milk 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.450
 with food and leisure 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.590
 leaves around 120 to 140 reais 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 that he fails to win because he has to feed September for five 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.800
 days the cow produces from the colossus 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 school or if it has no commercial value 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.500
 we have tents and it produces around 20 to 25 liters of milk per day 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.050
 then this colossus is used to feed heifer in an amount that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.520
 ranges from four to five meters 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.150
 the colossus has a very large amount of protein 5 times better 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.780
 has a large amount of sugar episodes of mineral salts 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.250
 and all this is despised 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.900
 to put in the trash 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.570
 go in two years of 80 liters or so the producer ends up despising the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.490
 environmental contamination of the environment 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.780
 the solution was we thought 'let's go on Christmas that affects Sunday sealing 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.610
 then we developed colostrum silage 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 we put schools with pet bottles are also dispensed is a problem 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.270
 from nature 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.210
 we put this colossus into these bottles 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.810
 black river 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.549
 we fill out completely 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.570
 we leave these bottles 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.770
 let us ferment we would have tried to sell 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.730
 if the tv did not make that point 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.540
 our solution was by luísa 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.780
 then we put the same amount of water 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.410
 and we offer that trip again 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.340
 also did not want to lose 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.540
 - we started blending these people 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.720
 this polish city of lublin 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.690
 starts in snowfall by 5% 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.689
 neither has to understand and air 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:13.269
 then it is 50% and 75% representing 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.719
 who reaches 100% 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.049
 then take a taste for 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.049
 without the need for investments they like very much 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.420
 perhaps the most difficult thing to convince the producer until the funai 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.919
 goals that gave the stage 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:31.089
 it can be stored inside the bottle and a glass on a shelf without 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:32.719
 need refrigeration 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.549
 but it can be kept problem for two years at the moment he understands it 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.509
 What do we put it in? How do we do it? 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.359
 and he understands that he does not have to invest anything he does not have to buy anything 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.099
 contrary 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.099
 veitel that is discarded is property that are the bottles 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.789
 and earn more money, everything is talking 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:55.529
 leaves farm and he is the player himself technology 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:03:00.859
 is an easy way to recycle home put in pet bottles and simplify 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:01.649
 darfur 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.469
 21 days she is in fact according to thaideth duarte sá 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.349
 none of this 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.889
 to live like this if there are 80 beds that in our cows produce my thousand and 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.249
 two hundred meters in one year, right? 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:19.839
 we count in today's values ​​to study so I think that on the sixth the reals this 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.480
 would entail a milking nectar then of 3 4 thousand 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.910
 I come again minutes before the accident more than a year 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:34.090
 help me a lot the heifers 5 stronger looking healthier and I believe that 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.829
 so much love for those who have not altered protein 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.279
 these people 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.019
 the pet bottles and today 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.149
 in any case it is a very serious problem 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:48.899
 like this with that work has also been these packaging that before 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.560
 they were thrown 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.189
 still went down on foot 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.939
 maybe we did not understand anything 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.150
 can not understand what it means 600 reais per producer 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.850
 but this can be the money he spends to keep his family 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.889
 fed during the period of one year 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.289
 It's a technology that costs nothing. 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.779
 what the producer that has 1 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.779
 a flaw can use as the project adds 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.669
 she is impeccable she is universal 'I can take you anywhere and the 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.430
 more important is how much this has a social importance of the rural family
