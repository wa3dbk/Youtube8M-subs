00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello people moretti today blackrock 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.510
 or black and white deep the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.670
 boss flames tame kakas on her nhc 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.410
 You see, there are two little ones 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.450
 goals or a main post and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 a small target has this little goal 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 five million hp and should be immediately 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.260
 to be killed he sees that here now 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 left of me and these sets did not work 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 live so much annoying but where it is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.050
 jump on someone and then one 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.029
 kick makes you as second you should 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.820
 keep a distance of six meters that is from 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.050
 each of the six meters distance for it 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.030
 do you harm otherwise 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
 you can see that he has one 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 player edges one agrees and left behind 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 Leaves a lane you can see here 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 in front of me directly twice the whole 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.320
 then disappears again and you 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.899
 can jump over it easily 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.760
 it happens almost nothing but just 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.890
 as I said there should not be in there 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 stand still for the next ability 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 you look every now and then to get a player 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 such a big red radius and up 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.280
 this then flies a meteorite and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.170
 this meteorite will then do harm 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 but split on the whole player 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.540
 or on the players 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.369
 in there 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.020
 which may, for example, the Paladin with 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.960
 babbel we take here now 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 tough or just you are running to the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.939
 Melee to the most difficult skill 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.400
 to this boss and that the boss of 200 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.320
 one of them is big because others are smaller 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.080
 big can be remembered as small 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.049
 not the little one focuses a random 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.479
 player and you see that is the one 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.119
 have to run away you can also sloane it 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.570
 and he also sees that together 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.250
 Make a fire and a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.720
 this does a great deal of harm to that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.759
 means you should really stop 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560
 try to kite that way he does not 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.890
 everyone meets or the people at least 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.840
 can avoid that is yes you see 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.140
 of course these dogs kill her naturally 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.149
 Both can serve but just as I said 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.280
 if you slide then you should 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.369
 at least that's how it works 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.649
 as few dimensions as possible 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.020
 means to walk away relatively little 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.420
 to the last ability and to the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.539
 Firestorm makes this firestorm 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.030
 Extreme damage should therefore all 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.310
 then go back against being healed 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.480
 be cool down and then you can 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.400
 diverge again 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.079
 that 's all in the end let's say 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.909
 the individual skills now you see 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.099
 of course, the enemy is over again 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.969
 goes and that something in more detail than that 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.189
 also looks from time to time 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:28.349
 is it so a one ball a 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.359
 fireball on a down 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.099
 and you can see that before 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:35.760
 you have to dodge that you see now 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.799
 maybe right here again, for example 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.989
 moon symbol in front of me or respectively 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.099
 post also with me from time to time her 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.079
 Look now and then a few balls 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.849
 which one has to dodge told 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.799
 again the torrent I am running 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.659
 Just come to the melee 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.489
 Meteorite and then you can already 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.359
 run out again and that's what it was 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.730
 actually already 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.560
 In addition, there is still a weapon that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.299
 Weapons are pretty important after all 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.840
 Incidentally spread her everywhere here in 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.760
 Raum does not say that at the moment 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.829
 Anyway, that looks up here 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.659
 Just stay put , you also tell 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.280
 one beside me and now you have too 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.480
 once again saw the lava cut in 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.310
 the end effect is more or 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 less all skills have been 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.510
 in the lhc most of it is not so 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.940
 problem there has relatively little hp and the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.040
 time is extremely short you see now 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.299
 again the dogs straight to 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.290
 Example how not to do it 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.239
 should do 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.699
 because as I said by that just like that 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.049
 runs far away 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.669
 either you should go to the very back 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.859
 you can walk out of it so you can do it too 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.409
 but you have to pay otherwise 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.430
 since there was a marginal group this was 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.940
 do not stop there 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.250
 but by and large in hcc 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.139
 is currently pretty cool as I think 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.060
 By the way, you see me again 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.040
 was fixed when I stand now 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.739
 then would the minis stay 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.970
 rightly roasted therefore 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.530
 I'm almost dead now 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.750
 a bit stopped but ansich 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.019
 You should just do it the whole way 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.510
 make sure that your dogs are just as cold 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.150
 that nothing happens in the big and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.459
 all the weapons are spawning and 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.079
 stay for a while and have to 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.939
 You then stop to watch that you just 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.099
 standing still for storm is also think 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.780
 I the a and o with this boss that 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.340
 This will be healed for you see 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.009
 that really does a lot of harm 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.450
 and yes I guess that's it too 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.039
 problem is if you look at the postlers 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.870
 stuttmann remember that too little on how 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.370
 a lot is wrong or the mood is wrong 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.750
 to be grouped 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.190
 I think like that said that's why 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.639
 a retiree group of the damage was not 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.060
 so good 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.800
 and thus a good reasonably decent one 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.380
 group which also in high field something ripped 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.419
 so hci has really done here 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.010
 extremely easy for those who 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.690
 It's likely that developers have it 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.720
 Also not the problem of this bus 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.580
 because the abilities are indeed 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.780
 but many are by and large 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.570
 actually no problem 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.220
 it looks like that said the ones 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.290
 torrent have run in the 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.880
 Blend Dodge the weapons 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.430
 but they may have to think something 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.240
 Be careful and that's it, by the way 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.520
 one of the points 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.460
 polytec must be careful because 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.320
 as soon as the big dog of the bond is 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 One should think about it 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.010
 and he had jorit with it too 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.810
 actually not that much harm 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.940
 Incidentally, the whole thing could be synonymous with 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.800
 own def kulanz fend but it 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.720
 should the just not as small gesture of goodwill 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.340
 they are not enough, it is better 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.020
 just to go in just for a moment 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.400
 the weapons were not in the back one 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.960
 lhc that means even if once 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.880
 hit will it is not so bad 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.770
 We should have done the dogs now 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.599
 or if the sea had hp 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.530
 I could have made the dogs 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.479
 have to 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.490
 so now we just go on the bus 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.889
 and serve the thumb i hope it has 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.750
 I like you helped me 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.370
 of course some blackrock videos 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.099
 By the way, you see the same now 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.539
 both of them ignite my new skin 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.430
 or another videos 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.590
 they come in as soon as they are inside 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.110
 should not take long at the latest 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.090
 tonight or tomorrow are in the 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.590
 shopping then I wish you 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.590
 have fun until soon
