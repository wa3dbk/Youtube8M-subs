another video every day we throw away
millions<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.239> electronic<00:00:33.690> devices<00:00:33.719> because

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
millions of electronic devices because

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.160 
millions of electronic devices because
they<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.860> old<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.160> become<00:00:35.430> worn<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:36.170> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
they get old and become worn out it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.540 
they get old and become worn out it
usually<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.649> only<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> components

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
usually it's only one of the components

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.920 
usually it's only one of the components
that<00:00:38.879> causes<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> problem<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.540> rest<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.870> the

that causes the problem the rest of the

that causes the problem the rest of the
device<00:00:43.230> works<00:00:43.500> fine<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.190> needlessly

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
device works fine but is needlessly

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
device works fine but is needlessly
thrown<00:00:44.910> away<00:00:47.360> simply<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.510> electronic

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
thrown away simply because electronic

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.520 
thrown away simply because electronic
devices<00:00:49.649> are<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.309> designed<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> last<00:00:51.530> this

devices are not designed to last this

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
devices are not designed to last this
makes<00:00:52.800> electronic<00:00:53.160> waste<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
makes electronic waste one of the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.459 
makes electronic waste one of the
fastest<00:00:54.480> growing<00:00:54.539> waste<00:00:54.960> streams<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.440> the

fastest growing waste streams in the

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.500 
fastest growing waste streams in the
