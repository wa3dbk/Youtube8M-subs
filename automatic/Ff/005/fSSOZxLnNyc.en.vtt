00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.429 

the<00:00:00.210> role<00:00:00.390> of<00:00:00.420> thirds<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.930> probably<00:00:01.290> the

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
the role of thirds is probably the

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.260 
the role of thirds is probably the
fundamental<00:00:02.100> building<00:00:02.280> block<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.700> all<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.149> the

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
fundamental building block of all of the

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.749 
fundamental building block of all of the
rules<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.629> composition<00:00:04.100> what<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.220> do<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.640> you

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
rules of composition what you do is you

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.150 
rules of composition what you do is you
draw<00:00:05.940> two<00:00:06.080> imaginary<00:00:07.080> vertical<00:00:07.290> lines<00:00:07.890> on

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
draw two imaginary vertical lines on

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.669 
draw two imaginary vertical lines on
your<00:00:08.220> image<00:00:08.880> equally<00:00:09.360> spaced<00:00:09.630> apart<00:00:09.990> that's

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
your image equally spaced apart that's

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.620 
your image equally spaced apart that's
dividing<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.219> into<00:00:11.340> one<00:00:11.639> two<00:00:11.849> three<00:00:12.150> sections

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
dividing it into one two three sections

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.320 
dividing it into one two three sections
two<00:00:13.500> more<00:00:13.769> horizontal<00:00:14.370> lines<00:00:14.580> equally<00:00:15.059> spaced

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
two more horizontal lines equally spaced

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.760 
two more horizontal lines equally spaced
apart<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.440> two<00:00:16.740> three

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
apart and you have one two three

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.910 
apart and you have one two three
sections<00:00:17.730> by<00:00:18.600> placing<00:00:19.080> points<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.529> interest

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
sections by placing points of interest

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
sections by placing points of interest
or<00:00:20.130> your<00:00:20.250> subject<00:00:20.760> along<00:00:21.480> or<00:00:21.750> near<00:00:21.990> those

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
or your subject along or near those

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.230 
or your subject along or near those
lines<00:00:22.710> particularly<00:00:23.670> where<00:00:23.820> they<00:00:23.939> cross

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
lines particularly where they cross

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.420 
lines particularly where they cross
where<00:00:24.510> they<00:00:24.600> meet<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:25.590> will<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> much<00:00:26.189> more

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
where they meet you will get a much more

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.790 
where they meet you will get a much more
pleasing<00:00:26.670> composition<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.529> use

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
pleasing composition so how do we use

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640 
pleasing composition so how do we use
this<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.189> reality<00:00:29.810> I've<00:00:30.810> got<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> windmill<00:00:31.410> over

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
this in reality I've got a windmill over

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.620 
this in reality I've got a windmill over
here<00:00:31.830> which<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.099> prepared<00:00:32.520> earlier<00:00:34.460> now<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:36.450> we

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
here which I prepared earlier now if we

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.049 
here which I prepared earlier now if we
put<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:36.989> windmill<00:00:37.440> smack<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.670> middle<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
put this windmill smack in the middle of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.880 
put this windmill smack in the middle of
the<00:00:39.149> frame<00:00:39.420> yeah<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> kind<00:00:40.710> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the frame yeah it's a kind of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.560 
the frame yeah it's a kind of
interesting<00:00:41.460> shot<00:00:41.700> because<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.239> windmill

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
interesting shot because it's a windmill

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510 
interesting shot because it's a windmill
on<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.750> nice<00:00:42.989> day<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.770> let<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.129> step<00:00:44.309> out

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
on a nice day but let me just step out

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.569 
on a nice day but let me just step out
of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> picture<00:00:45.680> just<00:00:46.680> contemplate<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.520> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
of the picture just contemplate that for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.990 
of the picture just contemplate that for
a<00:00:47.789> moment<00:00:48.230> it's<00:00:49.230> okay<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> pleasing

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
a moment it's okay but is it a pleasing

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.580 
a moment it's okay but is it a pleasing
composition<00:00:51.360> would<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.320> great

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
composition would you think that's great

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.540 
composition would you think that's great
I<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.219> my<00:00:53.250> wall<00:00:54.260> possibly<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.550> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
I want that on my wall possibly not so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.340 
I want that on my wall possibly not so
what<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.600> need<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> move<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
what do we do we need to move the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
what do we do we need to move the
windmill<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> different<00:00:59.430> place<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
windmill to a different place in the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.490 
windmill to a different place in the
pitch<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.359> obviously<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.780> can't<00:01:01.079> pick<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
pitch and obviously I can't pick up the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
pitch and obviously I can't pick up the
windmill<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.010> move<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.000> all<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> got<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
windmill and move it so all you got to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
windmill and move it so all you got to
do<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.870> change<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> direction<00:01:04.680> your<00:01:05.129> cameras

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
do is change the direction your cameras

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.969 
do is change the direction your cameras
pointing<00:01:06.150> I've<00:01:07.080> got<00:01:07.290> an<00:01:07.350> imaginary<00:01:07.740> rope

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
pointing I've got an imaginary rope

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.170 
pointing I've got an imaginary rope
attached<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> front<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> video

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
attached to the front of the video

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
attached to the front of the video
camera<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.530> pull<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.040> camera

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
camera and I'm going to pull the camera

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.060 
camera and I'm going to pull the camera
over<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.659> place<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.439> windmill<00:01:13.950> on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
over this way to place the windmill on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
over this way to place the windmill on
the<00:01:14.159> vertical<00:01:14.729> third<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> left-hand<00:01:15.900> side

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the vertical third on the left-hand side

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.429 
the vertical third on the left-hand side
so<00:01:16.650> let's<00:01:16.799> come<00:01:17.070> over<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.430> way<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:18.439> there

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so let's come over this way a bit there

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.140 
so let's come over this way a bit there
we<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.009> ease<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> over<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.880> looking

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
we go as we ease it over it's looking

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.149 
we go as we ease it over it's looking
better<00:01:21.330> already

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
better already

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.859 
better already
right<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> windmill<00:01:24.270> sat<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
right now we got the windmill sat on the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.140 
right now we got the windmill sat on the
vertical<00:01:25.500> third<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> left-hand<00:01:26.729> side<00:01:26.850> of

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
vertical third on the left-hand side of

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.929 
vertical third on the left-hand side of
the<00:01:27.210> picture<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.049> gap<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.490> left-hand

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the picture the gap on the left-hand

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
the picture the gap on the left-hand
side<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> picture<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.409> third<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
side of the picture is a third of the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700 
side of the picture is a third of the
way<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.780> but<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.990> probably<00:01:34.229> sitting<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
way in but it's probably sitting a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
way in but it's probably sitting a
little<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.040> high<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.820> frame<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.840> we

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
little bit high in the frame so what we

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.990 
little bit high in the frame so what we
now<00:01:37.170> need<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.340> make<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> windmill

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
now need to do is to make the windmill

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.780 
now need to do is to make the windmill
go<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> bit<00:01:39.540> lower<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.829> by<00:01:41.250> tilting

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
go a bit lower and we do that by tilting

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.170 
go a bit lower and we do that by tilting
the<00:01:41.939> front<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> camera<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.619> bit<00:01:44.180> that's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the front of the camera up a bit that's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
the front of the camera up a bit that's
also<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> place<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.560> Bank<00:01:46.920> along<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
also going to place that Bank along the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.420 
also going to place that Bank along the
bottom<00:01:48.000> third<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.560> windmill<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> sitting

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
bottom third so your windmill is sitting

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.179 
bottom third so your windmill is sitting
nicely<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.659> crook<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.470> vertical<00:01:53.159> third

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
nicely in the crook of a vertical third

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
nicely in the crook of a vertical third
and<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.790> horizontal<00:01:54.149> third<00:01:54.810> let<00:01:55.259> me<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.470> out

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and a horizontal third let me get out

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.289 
and a horizontal third let me get out
the<00:01:55.649> picture<00:01:55.979> again<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> look

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.209 

that<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.420> considerably<00:02:01.049> better<00:02:01.140> than<00:02:01.469> putting

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that is considerably better than putting

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.440 
that is considerably better than putting
it<00:02:02.310> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> middle<00:02:02.640> let's<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.149> pop<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> back

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
it in the middle let's just pop it back

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.980 
it in the middle let's just pop it back
in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> middle<00:02:04.079> again<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.540> we're<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> go

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
in the middle again so we're going to go

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.949 
in the middle again so we're going to go
down<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:08.060> we're<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.330> left

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
down and we're going to go left

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.930 
down and we're going to go left
with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> camera<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:11.640> has<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
with the camera that is which has the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
with the camera that is which has the
opposite<00:02:12.360> effect<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> subject

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
opposite effect on the subject

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
opposite effect on the subject
it's<00:02:14.010> not<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.310> interesting<00:02:14.880> let's<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.180> back

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
it's not that interesting let's go back

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
it's not that interesting let's go back
to<00:02:15.480> something<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.840> bit<00:02:15.870> nicer<00:02:16.200> back<00:02:16.920> onto<00:02:17.160> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
to something a bit nicer back onto that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.250 
to something a bit nicer back onto that
rule<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.760> thirds<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:21.360> we're<00:02:21.600> doing<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:21.990> with

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
rule of thirds and we're doing this with

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.290 
rule of thirds and we're doing this with
the<00:02:22.440> video<00:02:22.740> camera<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.120> see

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
the video camera so that you can see

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.180 
the video camera so that you can see
it's<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.510> moving<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> camera<00:02:25.860> that's<00:02:26.010> all

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it's just moving the camera that's all

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.600 
it's just moving the camera that's all
you<00:02:26.460> have<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.910> do<00:02:27.740> now<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:29.010> apply<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.370> to

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
you have to do now you can apply this to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.610 
you have to do now you can apply this to
anything<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.480> doesn't<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.080> have<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.440> in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
