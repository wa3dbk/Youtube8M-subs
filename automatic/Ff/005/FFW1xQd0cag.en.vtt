00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
gesture typing keyboard which is similar

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.380 
gesture typing keyboard which is similar
to<00:02:24.829> swype<00:02:24.950> except<00:02:25.579> it's<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.849> lot<00:02:26.030> quicker<00:02:26.180> to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
to swype except it's a lot quicker to

to swype except it's a lot quicker to
type<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.709> predicts<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.970> uses<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
type and it predicts and it uses the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.089 
type and it predicts and it uses the
software<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.019> predict<00:02:30.319> exactly<00:02:30.500> waiting<00:02:31.010> on

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
software to predict exactly waiting on

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.770 
software to predict exactly waiting on
time<00:02:31.340> so<00:02:31.970> you're<00:02:32.060> basically<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.510> swipe

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
time so you're basically just swipe

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it comes up with the words based on

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.099 
it comes up with the words based on
where<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:36.890> swipe<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.540> obviously<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.810> people
