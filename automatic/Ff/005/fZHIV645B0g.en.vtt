00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.350
 ok so we'll download a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.899
 small app to see the 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:14.929
 performance called the vellamo and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:21.119
 unpaved the words vellamo so here 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:23.039
 vellamo mobile benchmark at this is it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.470
 that of qualcomm 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.180
 so we're going to install it like that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.810
 you will be able to see that one 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.559
 installs any application without problems 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.260
 possible imaginable 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.250
 so this application is a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.670
 application that test the material that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 tests the video in html and who test the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.949
 processor the memory and that gives you 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.770
 a note and who are you who you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.260
 can compare to others to find out 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.570
 a little what you 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:05.750
 2 the performance of your device 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 android that's it then I accept I accept 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 so here we are going to do a test 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.740
 test first is the html test here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.060
 that's what will allow you to see 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.149
 a little bit the the image the image on the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 tablet and and then a little his resolution 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:44.720
 what is it then I let you discover 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.720
 at the same time the test 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.649
 so I inform you that these videos 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.409
 are done with my galaxy note 2 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.270
 so do not blame me for the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.759
 resolution and the focus that is 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.640
 maybe not always very fluid and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.130
 very clear 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.890
 the sent this app does some tests of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.380
 two videos of download tests 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.180
 of internet pages reading pages of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.590
 zoom 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.440
 in fact she sends a whole bunch of 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.940
 programs for to test test the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.860
 graphics capabilities of the device 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.629
 android so it works just as well on 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.459
 phones that on tablets that 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.590
 lets you know where you are 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.629
 want our device compared to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.989
 compared to other devices from 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.819
 market so I will give you if you 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.090
 want for comparison I did the 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.800
 test on the galaxy note 2 I you 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 will give the score obtained for you 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.239
 can compare see a little the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.090
 difference and situate yourself with respect to 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:54.000
 a fairly powerful device that's you 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:00.340
 see a lot of little video tests 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.300
 it's different 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.650
 different tests but for example the du 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.520
 javascript test to see the reading 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.520
 and download 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.709
 so here I am going to stop this video 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.780
 pause and I will return when 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:31.989
 all will be finished to make you see 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:38.380
 the note so here is the result of the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:40.390
 853 tests in html5 and 299 in metal so 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.750
 that we are at the very bottom 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:49.720
 metal it is we are at 2,199 as 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.470
 comparison the samsung galaxy tab 8.9 in 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.030
 3.2 is at 306 we see is not it 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.830
 is not in the street either we are on 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.540
 is not bad so the price I you 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:05.819
 confirms 1,149 euros 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:19.289
 here on the web so concerning the html 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:21.660
 no yes no no I would say here 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.550
 very happy to be very happy with my 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.930
 purchase 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.639
 because here it is above my 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:33.570
 expectations frankly very very very very 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.889
 on top so here I show you 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.720
 quickly and I have the opportunity 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.940
 a little story game to make you 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.690
 have only a small video rather a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:52.729
 video and a little video the video is this 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.729
 that I have on board fishing video 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.770
 what is it 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:27.670
 so here are these sums 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.470
 see the video is gone pretty 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:35.110
 quickly I'm going to take my the sound 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.820
 of the video is not terrible it's the 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.130
 video itself because the sound the 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.290
 tablet otherwise but not great but hey he 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.350
 go out but here this video the lesson and 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.640
 skate but that's good 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:52.090
 resolution as all in all nice 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:54.400
 I hope you enjoyed this test 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.980
