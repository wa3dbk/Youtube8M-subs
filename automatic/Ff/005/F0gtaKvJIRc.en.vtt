that<00:00:51.859> you<00:00:52.039> actually<00:00:52.219> allow<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.730> insect<00:00:53.359> to

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
that you actually allow the insect to

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.660 
that you actually allow the insect to
actually<00:00:53.870> come<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.440> bait<00:00:54.649> pick<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.340> up<00:00:55.460> and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
actually come to the bait pick it up and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.299 
actually come to the bait pick it up and
take<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:56.000> back<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.449> nest<00:00:56.660> and<00:00:57.280> through<00:00:58.280> a

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
take it back to the nest and through a

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.470 
take it back to the nest and through a
process<00:00:58.910> of<00:01:00.699> defecating<00:01:01.699> back<00:01:01.910> inside<00:01:02.300> the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
process of defecating back inside the

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.109 
process of defecating back inside the
nest<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.079> juvenile<00:01:04.040> roaches<00:01:04.489> actually<00:01:04.850> feed

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
nest the juvenile roaches actually feed

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.749 
nest the juvenile roaches actually feed
on<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.689> adult<00:01:06.020> feces<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.549> poison

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
on the adult feces and so the poison

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.190 
on the adult feces and so the poison
actually<00:01:08.270> gets<00:01:08.450> passed<00:01:08.689> on<00:01:08.930> from<00:01:09.110> one

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
actually gets passed on from one

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.070 
actually gets passed on from one
generation<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.130> next<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:11.720> acts<00:01:11.900> as<00:01:12.049> a

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
generation to the next so it acts as a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.749 
generation to the next so it acts as a
stomach<00:01:12.500> poison<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.369> pretty<00:01:13.520> cool

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
stomach poison it's a pretty cool

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.830
