for<00:00:31.790> this<00:00:32.270> summer<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.650> I<00:00:34.570> think<00:00:35.570> it's<00:00:35.750> a

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
for this summer this is a I think it's a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.200 
for this summer this is a I think it's a
10<00:00:36.050> inch<00:00:36.260> pot<00:00:36.560> I'm<00:00:37.460> going<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.730> put<00:00:37.880> some<00:00:38.030> rocks

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
10 inch pot I'm going to put some rocks

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.450 
10 inch pot I'm going to put some rocks
I<00:00:38.660> may<00:00:39.260> put<00:00:39.440> some<00:00:39.560> rocks<00:00:39.650> at<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:39.920> bottom<00:00:39.950> of<00:00:40.310> it

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
I may put some rocks at the bottom of it

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.340 
I may put some rocks at the bottom of it
but<00:00:40.910> it's<00:00:41.060> gonna<00:00:41.150> be<00:00:41.240> a<00:00:41.329> hanging<00:00:41.600> planters<00:00:42.140> so

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
but it's gonna be a hanging planters so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.510 
but it's gonna be a hanging planters so
it<00:00:42.500> may<00:00:42.950> not<00:00:43.100> need<00:00:43.220> it<00:00:45.280> accumulates<00:00:46.280> like

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
it may not need it accumulates like

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.030 
it may not need it accumulates like
moisture<00:00:47.180> and<00:00:47.390> I<00:00:47.510> know<00:00:47.870> some<00:00:48.230> people<00:00:48.260> use

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
moisture and I know some people use

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.530 
moisture and I know some people use
spangled<00:00:50.260> moss<00:00:51.760> like<00:00:52.760> usual<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.360> they're

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
spangled moss like usual and they're

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.139 
spangled moss like usual and they're
putting<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.810> mix<00:00:53.989> it<00:00:54.110> with<00:00:54.230> their<00:00:54.440> up<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:55.910> soil

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
putting a mix it with their up that soil

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.300 
putting a mix it with their up that soil
in<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.840> previous<00:00:57.170> video<00:00:57.410> I<00:00:57.470> used<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.010> soil

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
in the previous video I used the soil

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.660 
in the previous video I used the soil
mix<00:00:58.670> that<00:00:59.030> was<00:00:59.210> about<00:00:59.960> one-third<00:01:00.670> perlite

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
mix that was about one-third perlite

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.869 
mix that was about one-third perlite
vermiculite<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.399> African<00:01:04.399> violet<00:01:04.699> mix

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
vermiculite and African violet mix

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.550 
vermiculite and African violet mix
essentially<00:01:05.389> so<00:01:05.899> what<00:01:05.990> I'm<00:01:06.079> going<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.350> is

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
essentially so what I'm going to do is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.340 
essentially so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:06.859> going<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.280> mix<00:01:07.899> and<00:01:08.899> I'm<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.170> guessing

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
I'm going to mix and I'm just guessing

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.039 
I'm going to mix and I'm just guessing
here<00:01:09.530> actually<00:01:09.939> when<00:01:10.939> it<00:01:11.060> makes<00:01:11.179> this<00:01:11.539> the

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
here actually when it makes this the

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.809 
here actually when it makes this the
spangled<00:01:12.469> moss<00:01:12.619> I'm<00:01:12.950> probably<00:01:13.249> gonna<00:01:13.429> do<00:01:13.549> half

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
spangled moss I'm probably gonna do half

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.270 
spangled moss I'm probably gonna do half
and<00:01:13.999> half<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.560> know<00:01:15.560> we're<00:01:15.889> just<00:01:15.920> figure<00:01:16.219> it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
and half you know we're just figure it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.300 
and half you know we're just figure it
out<00:01:16.369> together

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
out together

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.460 
out together
mixed<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.429> up<00:01:19.929> alright

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
mixed it up alright

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.650 
mixed it up alright
I<00:01:22.500> am<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:25.910> sometimes<00:01:26.910> with<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> acuity

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
I am going to sometimes with the acuity

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.100 
I am going to sometimes with the acuity
if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.400> blew<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.700> tip<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.510> it's<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
if you blew the tip of it it's going to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.750 
if you blew the tip of it it's going to
branch<00:01:31.320> out<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.770> cutter<00:01:31.950> planted<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.460> well

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
branch out the cutter planted as well

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.490 
branch out the cutter planted as well
it's<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.540> loaded<00:01:33.840> or<00:01:33.930> announced<00:01:34.170> remove

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

it's a one loaded or announced remove
the<00:01:34.680> tips<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.870> could<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.340> more

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the tips and that way I could have more

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.280 
the tips and that way I could have more
plants

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.050 

price<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:43.010> tennis<00:01:43.250> earlier<00:01:43.640> because<00:01:43.880> these

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
price of tennis earlier because these

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
price of tennis earlier because these
plants<00:01:44.510> are<00:01:44.630> about<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.230> go<00:01:45.350> on<00:01:45.380> TV

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
see I am taking this and I'm cutting it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.200 
see I am taking this and I'm cutting it
at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> axle

looking at it right now you see this is
the<00:02:20.900> axle<00:02:21.890> I'm<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.330> cut<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.750> right

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
the axle I'm going to cut it right

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.160

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
bit right here it's going to branch out

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.760 
bit right here it's going to branch out
so<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.800> just<00:02:33.860> cut<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.550> these<00:02:34.640> real<00:02:34.970> quick
