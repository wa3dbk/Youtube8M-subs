00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.170

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.920
 disgusted a little bit obviously we want a 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.630
 light breading 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.970
 so we do not want something very 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.040
 very thick so we will prepare a 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.630
 Forgive it's their footprint all the disk 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.110
 thin with jeans were only 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.110
 feet but I did not have them so 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.230
 quantities we are here I just have one 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.610
 part so pretty much i would not like 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.610
 to be a minute on each side 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:19.250
 format drawings came looking for a 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:22.280
 fault think of about a mother of 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.319
 every runner indeed we do to him and 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.409
 then with the national anthem 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.140
 no more it's wonderful we wait 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.959
 a little for me final result 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:38.569
 So that's the end result is the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:41.780
 rooms a certain time and then tomorrow 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.590
