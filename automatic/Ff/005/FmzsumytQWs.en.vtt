00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello people from youtube youtube janusz that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.240
 there's good things today I bring you a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.050
 video tutorial on how to install the ski 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.840
 of the special force 2 a free game 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:21.070
 I had to do the lake but because he and 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.630
 the one in x history does not capture the screen 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.150
 wallpaper desktop 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.369
 then it was my turn to do a little 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.100
 with the vÃ©lez it was studied then we are going to 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.029
 watch 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:36.010
 then we go first to page 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.010
 to download work in the inscription 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.930
 and good 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.059
 the main thing is not the first part not 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.460
 It is very important that you give an account 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.570
 it's still not important so we 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.950
 let's go to the second one that is the download 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.440
 then we will put download 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:01.020
 etcetera not this is not the one that is not the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.480
 game itself if it is an executable of 18 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.480
 megas to be installed and will go 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.440
 downloading the game 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.570
 so I have it here installed 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.070
 downloaded that I will not install it from 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.920
 download forgiveness good the girl 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.150
 after having downloaded it 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.150
 we wait a while 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.030
 well here is fundamental that is a 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 little mistake that no perez do not say a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.800
 little then let's put Spanish to 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.550
 Spain not Spanish doctor 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.720
 for we say those of South America 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.100
 Central America we are going to put you then 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.290
 us spanish people 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.430
 because here we are going to say it good 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.270
 then it is downloaded 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.070
 install folder etcetera since what 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.290
 fundamental is to open this and we will 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.690
 let's say if we put it in Spanish 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.300
 mexico will leave us only available 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.000
 that metin2 and the others that is the 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.070
 album etcetera etcetera are not going to 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.509
 leave but if we put in Spain if 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.840
 those will be available to us 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.780
 and 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.780
 and games that we want to be liked 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.040
 we want to download , but if you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.170
 We leave in Spanish, Mexico, because it's not going 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.980
 to leave so that is fundamental 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.510
 it's a part that a lot of people do not 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.959
 we do not know or say good after 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 we have the game available so we 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.650
 We are going to give you to play now here 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.660
 It's an ugly part and they do not tell us either 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.310
 it is a mistake because unfortunately 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.709
 is alpha is beta forgiveness then you have to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.270
 maybe it does not come out it ends up marching the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.450
 play something then let's go 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.530
 down where I put an end and we're going 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.530
 to open there 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.760
 the game from there we will see double 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.400
 click and we will open this little screen 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.410
 again because if we give up on the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.570
 x will not close us is better than 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.490
 let's close there there abajito and grab 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.650
 Finalize 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.260
 let's try again maybe not 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.880
 come out then let's start 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.510
 task manager and we will search 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.400
 here the processes since then there are times 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.170
 the computers close us fast 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.940
 the processes then better then 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.540
 this is what makes this process is the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.890
 that we get from that boss the client is 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.760
 this came and so on and the df 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.070
 efe is that sometimes it does not come out 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.040
 that stays there as if caught I do not know 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.640
 and it does not open then let's give suppress 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.560
 and end process like this delete 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.989
 end process or finish process 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.150
 and finalize processes and so on is this is 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:05.350
 more recommended for the game 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:10.590
 or the process closes better in order 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.629
 and we go back and then we go back 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.560
 I do not remember I was explaining what 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.560
 what I wanted to explain here 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:23.260
 well then we go again up there 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.380
 to the school skill and we press until 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.470
 leave like this always because it's I do not know 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.030
 to see what a beta is in order after 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.330
 to come out with my download of the program 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.250
 it is irrelevant to create an account 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.340
 of let's create our account and so on 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.540
 password accept and we will get a 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.790
 mail saying good to activate your account 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.980
 then let's click activate your 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.640
 account will come out a little screen and 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.820
 we are going to give him the bullet here we are going to 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.120
 put mine to start session of 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.310
 once 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.040
 etcetera etcetera 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.670
 well my account and there it is 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.620
 normal and recruit or I do not know why 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.590
 will recruit will maybe give us something 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.110
 I do not know or if we already enter a friend or 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.810
 something like that anyway after we will leave this 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.480
 mail that is verified to us that our 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.450
 mail has been our account has been 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.520
 activated et cetera and then wait for 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.330
 I downloaded myself like 15 minutes 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.439
 waiting I do not know how much more I get myself 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.879
 so no more I hope that you 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.620
 it works in any doubt they leave it to me 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.460
 in the description of the video that I will do 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.910
 everything possible to solve the and 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.410
 no more I think until the next 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.410
 wait to see them
