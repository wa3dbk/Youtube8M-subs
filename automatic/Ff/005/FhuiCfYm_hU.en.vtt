00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.260 
100 so let's go down here
these<00:01:24.950> are<00:01:25.100> some<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.460> drops<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.000> about

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
it and we use wider and to get there

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:41.110 
it and we use wider and to get there
much<00:01:34.490> faster<00:01:39.400> stupid<00:01:40.400> onion<00:01:40.670> rings<00:01:40.880> or
