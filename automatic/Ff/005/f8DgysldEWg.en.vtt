to<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> end<00:02:05.909> although<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:07.259> losses<00:02:07.500> had<00:02:07.950> not

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
to the end although my losses had not

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.650 
to the end although my losses had not
and<00:02:08.910> significant<00:02:09.910> towards<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.509> end

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
and significant towards the end

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.570 
and significant towards the end
sometimes<00:02:11.380> i<00:02:11.620> wonder<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:12.069> i<00:02:12.220> should<00:02:12.250> have

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
sometimes i wonder if i should have

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.520 
sometimes i wonder if i should have
shortened<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.150> up<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:13.630> bit<00:02:13.870> since<00:02:14.170> i<00:02:14.319> was

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
shortened it up a little bit since i was

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.309 
shortened it up a little bit since i was
hardly<00:02:14.970> losing<00:02:15.970> towards<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.450> end<00:02:16.600> my<00:02:16.870> total

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
hardly losing towards the end my total

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.830 
hardly losing towards the end my total
loss<00:02:17.500> was<00:02:18.010> 26<00:02:18.850> pounds<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:20.160> 40<00:02:21.160> days<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.810> i

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
loss was 26 pounds in 40 days and so i

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.559 
loss was 26 pounds in 40 days and so i
guess<00:02:23.110> that's<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.709> pretty<00:02:23.950> good<00:02:24.160> average<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:25.330> a

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
guess that's a pretty good average for a

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.610 
guess that's a pretty good average for a
female<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.400> i<00:02:28.120> am<00:02:28.270> happy<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:28.780> my<00:02:28.840> loss<00:02:29.200> on

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
female and i am happy with my loss on

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.870 
female and i am happy with my loss on
these<00:02:30.130> three<00:02:31.090> days<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:32.010> doing<00:02:33.010> no<00:02:33.220> starches<00:02:33.760> or

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
these three days of doing no starches or

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.979 
these three days of doing no starches or
