00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
again it's still on 4G let's see what we

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:34.760 
again it's still on 4G let's see what we
get<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.349> round<00:02:23.560> two

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.310 

okay<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.400> 3.8<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.420> time<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> download
