00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:09.550
 I am pixi 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:17.490
 Thank you for watching this video following the previous video 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:24.510
 Now it is immediately but tanks to use this time is this line metal bolts actual Bua' pent-Reger 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:31.439
 This vehicle is characterized by large firepower low speed paper armor and the engine is fragile 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.400
 However, if the judiciary is hit with 15 cm, considerable damage can be expected. 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.480
 Miri to 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:43.989
 Even if the side 10mm method is almost equal to 4 mm 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:46.150
 Even if it is a group, it will penetrate completely, so if you do not operate with caution, you will immediately detonate 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:51.370
 I will 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:55.590
 For justice is to have so much of the hit rate and good penetration 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.590
 There are not many enemies that can not penetrate 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.710
 Do you want to dispatch 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.060
 The highest tier of this room is 9 and there are many tier 8 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.060
 This is a good match 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 Let's move to your favorite reconnaissance &amp; sniper point 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:38.799
 I hope not troubled to move much because this vehicle is tentatively 30 kilometers exits 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.750
 It takes time and effort to move naturally because the speed drops naturally when it comes to hills It is sometimes frustrating that it is too late 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.280
 I also have 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.280
 I gave up in the unavoidable 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.689
 Well arrived in sniper point 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.670
 Let's strike from the enemy who can spot fire immediately 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:06.549
 A child who is not a fetish 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.549
 Advance with caution against the enemy and hide behind the scenes 8 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.780
 9 was clad in hit the shells of self-propelled artillery 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.050
 Has been taken over 900 hp 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.050
 It is a miracle that there was no damage to the module or crew 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.470
 Continue to reconnaissance and wait for shooting 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.769
 I wonder if does not come out that heavy tank 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.750
 I have trouble talking without movement and I 'm troubled 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.870
 A little change or not strike tank in that 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.200
 The ally defeated the enemy Yakutpanter 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.200
 Came out 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.970
 Oh Oh Ayoshi Let's go to continue play immediately evasive action 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.849
 Get down and escape from the lane of the self-propelled gun 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.849
 Once Tai' 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.880
 I'm just going to fast forward 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.030
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:49.569
 Well now we're back and let's continue to sniper again 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:55.710
 Allies are already moving and the front is rising, so I would like to support them 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:04:00.560
 But I do not strike and do not you stop Well I wonder strike that heavy tank 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:05.530
 Let's aim at target middle tank discovery there in the foreground 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:10.680
 Dewa not hidden ass hidden head 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.680
 Let's go on another visit to keep going unchecked 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.300
 I 'm moving because the tree fell 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.720
 Yes ah ah ah 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.720
 Fluffyed and killed all enemies' strengths 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.759
 I think I'm still aiming for self-propelled artillery because it was Barre 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.120
 I can not climb 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.930
 If I had eaten one more shot I had a burst 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.930
 Let's climb fast 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.040
 me 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.520
 Yoshi was fully climb and also the enter the sniper posture 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.550
 I wonder if there is already one in the middle 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.349
 Do you aim at that heavy tank over there? 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.100
 I ca n't hit it because I'm hiding 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.580
 Well there is a heavy tank on the west side 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:44.370
 Gonna have the same line metal and my place 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.370
 If you look at the same vehicle as yourself, you will want to defeat and defeat your rival 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.180
 Do you want to defeat it in a while? Let's support it because there is a friend's t 54 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.990
 Quickly contract 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:07.810
 Fire ah ah 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:07.810
 It seems that the East Central was confirmed, so let's go to destroy the heavy tank on the west side 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.150
 Movement start 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.000
 Hmm 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.000
 Do you aim for me because there is an enemy is 6 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.460
 How will I destroy it ? 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:45.190
 Like ally it was self-propelled artillery and Aiuchi 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:48.160
 Also find the enemy's last vehicle that could not be hit in each check 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:52.920
 Let's go for my support 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.920
 Going to end well feelings decide the final blow 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.740
 If there is no Yabe hurry , allies will destroy 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:03.689
 T 54 was killed 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.980
 Tsu'll get to go to pushy 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.849
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.479
 Ha-ha-hatsu has blown the turret to my arm 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.479
 Game over 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:25.190
 As a result of this time, it was possible to get good results as a result of putting quite damage 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:30.300
 It was good because it was possible to reach the end of the battle without getting a single shot after being hit on both sides first timely 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:36.500
 Thank you for watching my video this time too 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:40.150
 More videos I hope we When you are raised by a single pace in 1 week 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.150
 Then let's meet another opportunity
