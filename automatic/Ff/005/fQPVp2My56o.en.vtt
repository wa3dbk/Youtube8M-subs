00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello my vilsack could not refuse 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 enjoy the pleasure of comparing nexus 7 and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.710
 ipad mini in the recently released real racing 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.370
 3 it is now available vol 2 also in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.200
 google play 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 let's look at what quality of it 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.870
 graphics on which runs faster future 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.870
 go 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.900
 Apple discounts to all subscribers from 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.669
 partner and store apple jizo.ru 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.710
 devices were rebooted and on your 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.410
 eyes multitasking and nexus nothing 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.820
 no battery is fully charged 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 multitasking ipad there is something on 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 the main thing is that there is no real racing 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.670
 let's run the game see what 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 tablets will come first on nexus 7 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 installed tegra 3 on ipad mini than 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.320
 again and in my comparison ipad mini and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 nexus 7 on nexus was not in the game gta 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.180
 wai city shadows and car traces you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 terribly resented in the comments I 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.410
 preferred and learned what is really on 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 Android has graphics settings for me 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.039
 it was a terrible surprise already we 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.109
 we see that ipad mini first came to 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.820
 finish optimization optimization again 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.129
 optimization unfortunately those words android 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.780
 does not know and immediately make a reservation, I take off everything 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.750
 it live on camera just because in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.420
 Nexus does not have any hdmi out technology 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.369
 airplay 10 miracase which is not 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 works and therefore grab the screen with 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 nexus 7 today without some very 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 there is simply no specific equipment 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.590
 opportunities let's roll the cars and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.750
 let's do a couple of races see how are you 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.030
 things are there first to fight 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.039
 nexus let's take a look at the car 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.039
 what it all looks like 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.690
 works quite healthy and any 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.789
 how to say cavil to how it all 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.739
 It looks like there can be no modelka 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.500
 very clear and very cool in general 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:42.569
 work fast enough find everything 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.420
 exactly also modelka quality 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.759
 beautiful reflection at night over this 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.110
 I can’t tell the machine view 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.789
 that somewhere there is any difference at all 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.590
 everything is more or less the same 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.850
 that in the video it will probably be weak 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.960
 noticeably but 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.390
 smoothing of these sharp edges 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.580
 on ipad organized much 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.290
 better than the nexus 7 and it will 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.180
 see in the game itself let's talk about it 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.280
 a little later and yes I did a couple more 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.600
 screenshots so you can appreciate it 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.869
 directly to what it looks like 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.819
 there that video eats up part of the impression 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.260
 on how it looks well, and now 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.360
 it's time for the race let's actually 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.390
 test how it all looks like 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.910
 practice and immediately you can draw 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.410
 attention to the fact that we do not have mirrors 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.840
 Bring them there but the reflection in the mirror 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.550
 unfortunately we do not see nexus 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.010
 such is the problem of the second moment 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.500
 what do you notice with ipad mini 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.950
 the road texture is completely different 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.440
 road texture and smooth motion fps 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.050
 enough and in general models of cars 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.860
 cool problems with this no 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.510
 no friends from the wagon 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.420
 the graphics are generally quite good 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.510
 let's make a kind of reflection of the hood 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.060
 what is the same model cars 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.540
 in general, everything works very civilized 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.640
 no problems all effects on 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.570
 place 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.269
 we are driving on the grass the smoke from the pipes is reflected 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.480
 since everything works as it should 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.610
 there was to be testing now like this 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.670
 doesn’t look right on ipad mini right away 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.500
 departing from the ticket office the same check in 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.440
 the same car here has a glen 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.269
 center is another competitive advantage 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.850
 with this game center and the ability to play 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.739
 with your friends also all the 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.510
 multiplayer is on android but he 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.360
 implemented through other social networks 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.040
 and so turn on the view from the cabin is the same and 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.739
 we see that we have friends here 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.390
 mirrors and this I want to tell you in 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.489
 review on real racing I talked about 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.720
 that it changes quite seriously 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.420
 feelings from how to say feelings from the game 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.609
 probably driving like everything too 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.200
 the most but mirrors and accordingly it is not 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.359
 just mirrors in them are also cars 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.609
 reflected in general what happens but 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:01.329
 what I noticed was a car with a sax car 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:03.100
 on ipad it gets closer now you can 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.750
 pay attention to something dream machine 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.720
 which the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.580
 In the distance, she has a simpler model. 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.250
 rather than what we see to if to her 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.270
 drive up about see the focus changed 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.130
 about combat transformed on a nexus of this 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.220
 No, well , I can not say it somehow 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.170
 also affects if you ask for 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.420
 I am more important than a mirror or in such models 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.700
 then mirrors probably yes and you see that 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.290
 texture on ipad mini is much 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.720
 better this applies to asphalt and 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.180
 surroundings and everything else not yet 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.380
 I wanted to show one thing at least 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.419
 what I noticed 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.880
 reflection from the hood and generally what 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.070
 happens in front of the car on ipad too 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.880
 looks like better for me 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.980
 at least it seemed so 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.100
 maybe it's self-deception you say no 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:52.890
 I know in general, again, all the effects 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.200
 are present and by the quality of the graphics i 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.480
 I prefer ipad mini and here you are 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.120
 another proof that on 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.220
 fresh game on a chip two years ago 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.830
 It looks much better than above 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.630
 3 nexus and all the other pies game 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.400
 of course it's amazing to say it again 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.290
 of course about optimization despite being 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.750
 that the game on android came out much later 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.760
 but this is how strangely honest you are. 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.140
 I will say and now some screenshots in 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.380
 make no comments without comment 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.380
 by myself 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.430
 monopod 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.170
 that's all a short video of conclusions 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.420
 do not let us decide for me 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.910
 it remains amazing one fact like a chip 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.520
 again two years ago on equal terms 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.500
 games is lost with tegra 3 which 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.570
 synthetic test has a twofold 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.520
 advantage is amazing write to
