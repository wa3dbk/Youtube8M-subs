00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
like the old slip slop slap whenever it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.750 
like the old slip slop slap whenever it
were<00:00:40.229> exposed<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.769> the<00:00:40.920> sun's<00:00:41.129> radiation<00:00:41.399> yeah

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
were exposed to the sun's radiation yeah

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.399 
were exposed to the sun's radiation yeah
exactly<00:00:42.059> we've<00:00:42.659> learned<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.019> exercise

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
exactly we've learned to exercise

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
caution now it doesn't mean we don't go

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.389 
caution now it doesn't mean we don't go
out<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.749> the<00:00:45.989> Sun<00:00:46.199> we<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.069> do<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.280> more

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
out in the Sun we just do it more

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.799 
out in the Sun we just do it more
carefully<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.389> you're<00:00:48.510> saying<00:00:48.690> is

ninety-eight percent Wow I know there's
growing<00:01:31.230> awareness<00:01:31.440> on<00:01:31.860> radiation<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
growing awareness on radiation so I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.000 
growing awareness on radiation so I
ninety-eight<00:01:33.300> percent<00:01:33.510> reduction<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:34.410> that
