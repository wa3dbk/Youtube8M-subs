00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
the part where you didn't apply dip

unfortunately<00:00:56.839> when<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:57.470> happens<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.040> tend

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
unfortunately when this happens you tend

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.710 
unfortunately when this happens you tend
to<00:00:58.339> miss<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.699> backside<00:00:59.089> of<00:00:59.119> the<00:00:59.330> teeth<00:00:59.540> and

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
to miss the backside of the teeth and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.109 
to miss the backside of the teeth and
since<00:01:00.470> that's<00:01:00.650> the<00:01:00.739> part<00:01:00.979> you<00:01:01.070> can't<00:01:01.280> see<00:01:01.519> you

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
since that's the part you can't see you

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:03.369 
since that's the part you can't see you
probably<00:01:02.299> don't<00:01:02.570> even<00:01:02.720> realize<00:01:03.019> that<00:01:03.049> you

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
probably don't even realize that you

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.920 
probably don't even realize that you
missed<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:05.000> same<00:01:05.210> concept<00:01:05.600> applies

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
missed it and the same concept applies

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.570 
missed it and the same concept applies
if<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.229> dairy<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.590> work<00:01:06.799> at<00:01:06.950> uses<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.250> sprayer

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
if the dairy you work at uses a sprayer

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.210 
if the dairy you work at uses a sprayer
to<00:01:07.909> apply<00:01:07.939> dip<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:09.140> really<00:01:09.560> easy<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.920> miss

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
to apply dip it's really easy to miss

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.190 
to apply dip it's really easy to miss
the<00:01:10.250> entire<00:01:10.400> backside<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.390> teats<00:01:11.600> if<00:01:11.780> you

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
the entire backside of teats if you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.749 
the entire backside of teats if you
don't<00:01:12.439> hold<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.680> sprayer<00:01:12.950> directly<00:01:13.520> under

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
don't hold the sprayer directly under

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.000 
don't hold the sprayer directly under
the<00:01:13.850> utter<00:01:14.030> while<00:01:14.509> you're<00:01:14.689> spraying<00:01:15.010> although

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
the utter while you're spraying although

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.440 
the utter while you're spraying although
you'll<00:01:16.160> probably<00:01:16.460> always<00:01:16.640> be<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.030> hurry

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
you'll probably always be in a hurry

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.240 
you'll probably always be in a hurry
the<00:01:17.750> idea<00:01:17.990> is<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.200> squeeze<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.710> bottom<00:01:19.040> part

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
the idea is to squeeze the bottom part

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.100 
the idea is to squeeze the bottom part
of<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.400> dipper<00:01:19.730> so<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.480> top<00:01:20.720> part<00:01:20.930> is

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
of the dipper so that the top part is

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.290 
of the dipper so that the top part is
full<00:01:21.320> when<00:01:21.530> you're<00:01:21.680> applying<00:01:21.890> dip<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.460> no

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
full when you're applying dip and no

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.820 
full when you're applying dip and no
doing<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.840> correctly<00:01:24.050> shouldn't<00:01:24.500> take<00:01:24.650> any

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
doing it correctly shouldn't take any

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.740 
doing it correctly shouldn't take any
extra<00:01:25.040> time<00:01:25.340> you're<00:01:25.940> still<00:01:26.210> moving<00:01:26.300> your<00:01:26.570> arm

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
extra time you're still moving your arm

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.960 
extra time you're still moving your arm
from<00:01:27.020> one<00:01:27.260> team<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.770> next<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.700> only

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
from one team to the next the only

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.370 
from one team to the next the only
difference<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.480> that<00:01:29.510> now<00:01:29.780> your<00:01:30.050> hand<00:01:30.260> is

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
difference is that now your hand is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.690 
difference is that now your hand is
squeezing<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.890> bottom<00:01:31.190> part<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.520> dipper

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
squeezing the bottom part of the dipper

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.990 
squeezing the bottom part of the dipper
to<00:01:32.240> make<00:01:32.390> sure<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.750> top<00:01:32.900> part<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.320> always<00:01:33.500> full

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
to make sure the top part is always full

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.310 
to make sure the top part is always full

that pre dip stays on each tee and how

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.450 
that pre dip stays on each tee and how
much<00:01:42.110> time<00:01:42.320> do<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:42.560> think<00:01:42.590> prenup<00:01:43.070> needs<00:01:43.280> to
