my<00:02:01.719> other<00:02:01.750> videos<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:03.880> robot<00:02:04.090> designed

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
my other videos it's a robot designed

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.440 
my other videos it's a robot designed
for<00:02:04.990> children<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.500> go<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.649> school<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.159> whatnot

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
for children to go to school and whatnot

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.270 
for children to go to school and whatnot
which<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.570> a<00:02:07.600> little<00:02:07.780> weird<00:02:07.899> but<00:02:08.259> again<00:02:08.619> this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
which is a little weird but again this

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.340 
which is a little weird but again this
is<00:02:09.340> Japanese<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.060> that<00:02:10.149> explains<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.660> all<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.320> a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
is Japanese so that explains it all so a

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.480 
is Japanese so that explains it all so a
little<00:02:11.560> kid<00:02:11.710> would<00:02:11.860> go<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.130> there<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.340> guess

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
little kid would go in there I guess

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.180 
little kid would go in there I guess
parents<00:02:12.850> buy<00:02:13.120> these<00:02:13.300> things<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.690> kids<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.860> an

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
parents buy these things for kids in an

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.580 
parents buy these things for kids in an
imaginary<00:02:15.700> world<00:02:15.990> although<00:02:16.990> I'm<00:02:17.200> sure<00:02:17.260> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
imaginary world although I'm sure that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.100 
imaginary world although I'm sure that
technology<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:18.160> there<00:02:18.550> for<00:02:19.060> Japanese<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.720> one

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
technology is there for Japanese and one

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.960 
technology is there for Japanese and one
day<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.440> real<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.250> kid<00:02:21.460> would<00:02:21.580> go<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.790> there

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
day for real the kid would go in there

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.479 
day for real the kid would go in there
and<00:02:22.230> he<00:02:23.230> would<00:02:23.379> roam<00:02:23.590> about<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.160> streets

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
and he would roam about in the streets

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.610 
and he would roam about in the streets
and<00:02:24.910> hopefully<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.510> kill<00:02:25.690> anybody<00:02:25.930> with<00:02:26.290> a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
and hopefully not kill anybody with a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.130 
and hopefully not kill anybody with a
big<00:02:26.739> machine<00:02:27.580> because<00:02:27.610> these<00:02:27.879> things<00:02:28.140> again

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
big machine because these things again

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.530 
big machine because these things again
are<00:02:29.379> 135<00:02:29.920> scale<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.549> figure<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.299> kids

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
are 135 scale you figure the kids

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.390 
are 135 scale you figure the kids
standing<00:02:31.989> here<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.500> he<00:02:32.860> peeps<00:02:33.129> through<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
standing here and he peeps through the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.710 
standing here and he peeps through the
head<00:02:33.519> so<00:02:33.730> if<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:33.879> want<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.090> get<00:02:34.239> an<00:02:34.330> idea<00:02:34.420> of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
head so if you want to get an idea of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.649 
head so if you want to get an idea of
how<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:34.989> would<00:02:35.260> scale<00:02:35.620> in<00:02:36.549> real<00:02:36.819> life<00:02:37.090> watch

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
how that would scale in real life watch

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.270 
how that would scale in real life watch
the<00:02:37.870> review<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.379> orange<00:02:38.709> one<00:02:38.890> you'll<00:02:39.040> find

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
the review of the orange one you'll find

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.800 
the review of the orange one you'll find
it<00:02:39.430> elsewhere<00:02:39.580> on<00:02:39.849> a<00:02:39.879> channel<00:02:40.269> but<00:02:40.510> since<00:02:40.659> I

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
opportunity to show you how the parts

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.360 
opportunity to show you how the parts
interchange<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.200> got<00:02:47.349> your<00:02:47.440> diecast<00:02:47.920> pieces

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
interchange you got your diecast pieces

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.020 
interchange you got your diecast pieces
here<00:02:48.700> which<00:02:48.849> pop<00:02:49.180> off<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.569> plastic<00:02:50.909> just<00:02:51.909> look

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
here which pop off the plastic just look

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.449 
here which pop off the plastic just look
so<00:02:52.420> pop<00:02:52.959> these<00:02:53.140> off<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.069> next<00:02:54.099> I'm<00:02:54.340> going

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
so pop these off and the next I'm going

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.369 
so pop these off and the next I'm going

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
of them we can actually think to change

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.509 
of them we can actually think to change
even<00:02:58.120> more<00:02:58.390> colors<00:02:58.720> tada<00:02:59.230> here's<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.400> other

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
thing I'm not going to go crazy taking

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.990 
thing I'm not going to go crazy taking

everything off but just so you guys know
pretty<00:03:07.569> much<00:03:07.629> anything<00:03:08.140> that's<00:03:08.560> color<00:03:09.340> will

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
pretty much anything that's color will

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.460 
pretty much anything that's color will
come<00:03:10.060> off<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.420> be<00:03:10.930> interchangeable

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
come off and be interchangeable

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
leave the head plates the same but i

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.399 
leave the head plates the same but i
will<00:03:21.519> switch<00:03:22.180> out<00:03:22.359> certain<00:03:22.870> parts<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.319> the

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
will switch out certain parts like the

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.430 
will switch out certain parts like the
bellies<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.370> let's<00:03:24.609> take<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.200> green<00:03:26.200> guy

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
bellies so let's take this green guy

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.629 
bellies so let's take this green guy
here<00:03:27.510> right<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.690> can<00:03:28.810> see<00:03:28.959> we<00:03:29.109> can<00:03:29.230> put<00:03:29.440> the

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
here right you can see we can put the

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.479 
here right you can see we can put the
red<00:03:30.639> piece<00:03:31.269> here<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.019> let's<00:03:32.829> see<00:03:32.980> if<00:03:33.010> we<00:03:33.190> pop

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
red piece here and let's see if we pop

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.770 
red piece here and let's see if we pop
off<00:03:33.790> some<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.780> orange<00:03:35.319> here<00:03:36.630> take<00:03:37.630> off

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
off some of the orange here take off

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.890 
off some of the orange here take off
some<00:03:38.019> of<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.280> little<00:03:39.280> bits<00:03:39.579> here<00:03:39.669> put<00:03:40.630> the

of I believe a white one is coming out
and<00:06:08.819> also<00:06:09.119> a<00:06:09.749> pink<00:06:10.409> one<00:06:10.649> which<00:06:11.429> I<00:06:11.699> technically

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:12.269 
and also a pink one which I technically

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:13.879 
and also a pink one which I technically
got<00:06:12.419> from<00:06:12.569> my<00:06:12.659> wife<00:06:12.839> so<00:06:13.079> that<00:06:13.499> way<00:06:13.589> she<00:06:13.619> doesn't

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
got from my wife so that way she doesn't

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:15.589
