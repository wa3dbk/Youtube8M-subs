teach Sasha a few simple things she can
do<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.229> make<00:01:52.380> sure<00:01:52.409> whose<00:01:52.890> fires<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.700> every

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
do to make sure whose fires up every

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.719 
do to make sure whose fires up every
time<00:01:54.450> she<00:01:54.720> turns<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> ignition<00:01:55.460> first<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.610> all

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
time she turns the ignition first of all

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.539 
time she turns the ignition first of all
check<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.479> fluid<00:01:58.290> levels<00:01:58.590> inside<00:01:59.070> each<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
check the fluid levels inside each of

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.880 
check the fluid levels inside each of
the<00:01:59.670> cells<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.840> need<00:02:01.079> topping<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the cells if they need topping up you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.039 
the cells if they need topping up you
need<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.310> use<00:02:02.460> demineralized<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.479> distilled

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
need to use demineralized or distilled

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.560 
need to use demineralized or distilled
water<00:02:04.380> being<00:02:04.740> careful<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.610> overfill<00:02:06.360> them

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
water being careful not to overfill them

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
water being careful not to overfill them
so<00:02:07.140> Alan<00:02:07.409> how<00:02:07.619> often<00:02:07.920> do<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> need<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.369> look

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so Alan how often do I need to look

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.639 
so Alan how often do I need to look
under<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> bonnet<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.209> check<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.599> out<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:10.379> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
under the bonnet to check it out if you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.940 
under the bonnet to check it out if you
want<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> check<00:02:11.370> yourself

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
want to have a check yourself

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.010 
want to have a check yourself
be<00:02:13.040> three<00:02:13.190> or<00:02:13.489> six<00:02:13.670> months<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.629> a<00:02:14.660> look<00:02:14.810> under

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
be three or six months have a look under

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.780 
be three or six months have a look under
the<00:02:15.110> bonnet<00:02:15.280> when<00:02:16.280> you're<00:02:16.400> checking<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.760> oil

battery tests are normally free
typically<00:02:52.220> they'll<00:02:52.400> take<00:02:52.640> between<00:02:53.569> 30

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
typically they'll take between 30

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.020 
typically they'll take between 30
seconds<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.530> three<00:02:54.829> minutes<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.190> do<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.819> tests

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
seconds to three minutes to do the tests

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.550 
seconds to three minutes to do the tests
depending<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:56.569> which<00:02:56.720> test<00:02:56.989> we<00:02:57.140> do<00:02:57.260> there's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
depending on which test we do there's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.890 
depending on which test we do there's
two<00:02:58.099> or<00:02:58.220> three<00:02:58.370> different<00:02:58.549> tests<00:02:59.090> we've<00:02:59.690> got

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
two or three different tests we've got

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.080 
two or three different tests we've got
Alan<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.470> test<00:03:00.739> Sasha's<00:03:01.310> battery<00:03:01.700> along<00:03:01.880> with

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
Alan to test Sasha's battery along with

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.860 
Alan to test Sasha's battery along with
two<00:03:02.420> other<00:03:02.630> cars

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.470 

so<00:03:09.870> Alan<00:03:10.140> what<00:03:10.290> did<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.530> find<00:03:10.740> okay<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.940> white

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so Alan what did you find okay the white

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.430 
so Alan what did you find okay the white
starlet<00:03:13.020> it's<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.980> GT<00:03:14.760> performance<00:03:15.330> car<00:03:15.569> it's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
starlet it's a GT performance car it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.140 
starlet it's a GT performance car it's
got<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.620> relatively<00:03:17.069> small<00:03:17.190> battery<00:03:17.849> so<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
got a relatively small battery so it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.699 
got a relatively small battery so it
wasn't<00:03:18.390> surprising<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:19.020> we<00:03:19.140> found<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.560> one

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
wasn't surprising that we found that one

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.010 
wasn't surprising that we found that one

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
was about 75% probably an indicator that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.809 
was about 75% probably an indicator that
the<00:03:31.350> battery<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.709> getting<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.220> for<00:03:32.430> 18<00:03:32.520> months

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
the battery is getting on for 18 months

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.370 
the battery is getting on for 18 months
two<00:03:33.120> years<00:03:33.150> old<00:03:33.600> but<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.959> should<00:03:34.140> still<00:03:34.170> be

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
two years old but it should still be

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.460 
two years old but it should still be
good<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:34.800> another<00:03:34.950> 18<00:03:35.670> months<00:03:35.819> or<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.050> next

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
good for another 18 months or so so next

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.380 
good for another 18 months or so so next
time<00:03:37.739> you're<00:03:38.160> feeling<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.700> cold<00:03:38.910> now<00:03:39.330> you

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
time you're feeling the cold now you

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.570 
time you're feeling the cold now you
know<00:03:39.780> your<00:03:40.110> battery<00:03:40.590> hates<00:03:40.830> those<00:03:41.069> chilly

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
know your battery hates those chilly

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.270 
know your battery hates those chilly
early<00:03:42.090> starts<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.750> as<00:03:43.080> much<00:03:43.290> as<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.830> do<00:03:44.040> but

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
early starts just as much as you do but
