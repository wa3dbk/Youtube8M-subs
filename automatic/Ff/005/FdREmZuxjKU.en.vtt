00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
go I guess it's some kind of software if

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.440 
go I guess it's some kind of software if
your<00:02:56.670> computer<00:02:56.970> i'm<00:02:57.060> not<00:02:57.180> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.360> break

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
up and we've already got a orange

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.159 
up and we've already got a orange
background<00:05:40.740> on<00:05:41.419> so<00:05:42.419> there's<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:42.750> menus<00:05:43.050> and

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
background on so there's the menus and

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.570 
background on so there's the menus and
stuff<00:05:43.259> like<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.500> that's<00:05:44.070> basically<00:05:44.490> the

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
stuff like that that's basically the

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.070 
stuff like that that's basically the
unboxing<00:05:45.090> I'll<00:05:45.300> be<00:05:45.449> really<00:05:45.630> careful<00:05:45.840> with

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
unboxing I'll be really careful with

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.050 
unboxing I'll be really careful with
this<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.500> probably<00:05:47.190> would<00:05:47.430> end<00:05:47.550> up<00:05:47.639> keeping<00:05:47.820> it

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
this I probably would end up keeping it

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.899 
this I probably would end up keeping it
though<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:49.440> as<00:05:49.530> you<00:05:49.680> see<00:05:49.830> there<00:05:50.009> is<00:05:50.130> no<00:05:50.400> UMD

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
though and as you see there is no UMD

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.360 
though and as you see there is no UMD
spot<00:05:51.210> on<00:05:51.419> this<00:05:51.690> I<00:05:51.870> it's<00:05:52.289> all<00:05:52.469> downloadable<00:05:53.099> to

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
spot on this I it's all downloadable to

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.860 
spot on this I it's all downloadable to
the<00:05:53.520> device<00:05:54.020> would<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.289> see<00:05:55.409> that<00:05:56.870> that's

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
the device would you see that that's

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.450 
the device would you see that that's
pretty<00:05:57.990> cool<00:05:58.229> so<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.710> definitely<00:05:58.860> is<00:05:59.159> a<00:05:59.190> new

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
pretty cool so it definitely is a new

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.820 
pretty cool so it definitely is a new
outlook<00:05:59.759> on<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.000> PSP<00:06:00.270> different<00:06:00.840> totally

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
outlook on the PSP different totally

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.499 
outlook on the PSP different totally
different<00:06:01.889> than<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.310> last<00:06:02.340> version<00:06:02.729> are<00:06:03.330> you

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
different than the last version are you

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:04.820 
different than the last version are you
seeing<00:06:03.719> it<00:06:03.780> compared<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.199> the<00:06:04.320> iphone<00:06:04.409> about

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
seeing it compared to the iphone about

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.010 
seeing it compared to the iphone about
the<00:06:04.919> same<00:06:05.130> size<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:05.820> so<00:06:06.539> we'll<00:06:06.690> just<00:06:06.719> a<00:06:06.870> little

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
the same size I so we'll just a little

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.860 
the same size I so we'll just a little
bit<00:06:07.110> thicker<00:06:07.289> and<00:06:08.000> maybe<00:06:09.000> you<00:06:09.120> guys<00:06:09.210> will<00:06:09.449> want

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
bit thicker and maybe you guys will want

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.200 
bit thicker and maybe you guys will want
to<00:06:09.960> pick<00:06:10.139> one<00:06:10.259> of<00:06:10.349> these<00:06:10.440> up<00:06:10.650> I<00:06:10.889> does<00:06:11.340> take<00:06:11.639> SD

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
to pick one of these up I does take SD

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.180 
to pick one of these up I does take SD
cards<00:06:12.750> so<00:06:12.870> you<00:06:12.900> can<00:06:13.080> have<00:06:13.229> more<00:06:13.500> memory<00:06:13.740> for<00:06:14.099> it

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
cards so you can have more memory for it

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.249 
cards so you can have more memory for it
and<00:06:14.969> that's<00:06:15.060> basically<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.599> I<00:06:15.900> want<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.199> be

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
and that's basically it I want to be

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.510 
and that's basically it I want to be
really<00:06:16.500> careful<00:06:16.620> with<00:06:16.860> this<00:06:16.979> I<00:06:17.130> don't<00:06:17.190> want<00:06:17.400> to

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
really careful with this I don't want to

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.459 
really careful with this I don't want to
get<00:06:17.639> too<00:06:18.150> much<00:06:18.180> into<00:06:18.389> this<00:06:18.719> unboxing<00:06:19.229> in<00:06:19.320> case

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469
