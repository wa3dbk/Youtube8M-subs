do to avoid this blog it if you have one
room<00:05:38.280> because<00:05:39.280> I'd<00:05:39.400> say<00:05:39.580> for<00:05:39.790> example<00:05:39.880> that

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
room because I'd say for example that

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.310 
room because I'd say for example that
your<00:05:41.350> money<00:05:41.620> object<00:05:42.190> is<00:05:42.490> in<00:05:42.729> one<00:05:43.180> room<00:05:43.390> in<00:05:43.660> the

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
your money object is in one room in the

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.440 
your money object is in one room in the
first<00:05:44.560> room<00:05:44.770> if<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:45.729> go<00:05:45.820> to<00:05:45.880> another<00:05:46.210> room

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
first room if you go to another room

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.030 
first room if you go to another room
your<00:05:46.720> money<00:05:46.930> would<00:05:47.140> reset<00:05:47.530> back<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:47.770> its
