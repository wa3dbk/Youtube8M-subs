00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 if bischoff montreal knew wide 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.200
 than today that mediocre games he 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.790
 would seem however that word doc on the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.230
 title of ambition presented as one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.540
 first real next gen games like 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 a major competitor against gta sa 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.630
 gigantic marketing campaign and su 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.380
 to talk about him and it is surely this 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.509
 that master the best today 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.580
 ubisoft marketing 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.630
 but on the sidelines of this time the tent that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.770
 crystallized around titles and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.420
 which was maintained despite the postponement 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.100
 seven months after the scheduled release 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.000
 seems to be people of reason those 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.289
 who know the Montreal studio 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.699
 from ubisoft and those who know that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.170
 finally they are not done with it 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.939
 a great game when we were sold 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.939
 as such of huazhong as a big game 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.940
 Released May 27, 2014 by ubisoft 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.680
 Montreal on all good 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120
 watchdog platforms is a game of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.140
 matane maureen that we will have seen then 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.150
 especially the devils at blizzard 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.680
 happened by dominique gaye on a 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.780
 kevin short's scenario which also has 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.189
 writing avatar the video game all under 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.330
 a design of dany belier to whom one 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.979
 must that of the first two put off 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 everything and that bathes in music of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 brian ray as the official composer 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.670
 sofia coppola's movies is an old 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.890
 member of the band air nothing that even if 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 we wonder a little bit where he spent he 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.710
 we are here narrating the story of a hero 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.540
 banal video game whose only 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.950
 true gimme keep differentiating it from the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.570
 remain the usual protagonists of the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.979
 media and having a phone 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 Mobile allows you or what 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.700
 almost in the city and a pierce of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.350
 his name is in shabby design and 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.939
 do not see the subject too well known 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.530
 principal of a story written with the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.509
 feet not like we had 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.670
 the habit the gentleman is a hacker a 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.259
 vigilante uses his phone to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.090
 save people these people in Chicago are 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.740
 permanently monitored by the ios website 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.720
 a system that spies on everyone 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.310
 very close to our own dystopia 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.869
 Orwellian centralized power in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.520
 less the one presented to us here 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.990
 allows some people to exploit 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.130
 good or bad this system 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 through their capabilities in 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.009
 data processing 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.270
 gold one day eden worse these discoveries by 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.290
 a tracker and sees his niece get done 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.969
 kill in retaliation 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.069
 seeking to avenge his death he disturbs 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.989
 raki that must not be disturbed and he will see 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.000
 his sister get kidnapped our mission 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.070
 recover it 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
 finally normally because the stakes are 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.830
 showed very quickly the Senate round itself 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.690
 focused on a real plot 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.980
 scriptwriter is rapidly moving away in 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.510
 multiple murders always more 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.100
 arduous in hacking ever more 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.420
 fuzzy and in ever more waterfalls 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.100
 or the ones that the others in sum 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.310
 must save our sister but before her 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.690
 duty in service to the whole city 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.640
 moreover writing is prey to this 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.690
 famous dissonances ludo narrative of which 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.790
 I mentioned in my review its 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.920
 beautiful shock infinite here and cash 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.600
 without these supposed to save his sister gold 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.860
 to do this he will kill half of 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.900
 criminals of the city and some 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.800
 innocent by passing what has no 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.300
 sense and it's not the few 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.920
 replicas and crytek feet by here by 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.720
 there who will do us what the guy 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.820
 really wonders about his actions they 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.739
 selfishly slaughter what does not 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.120
 no sense from a narrative ludo point of view 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.830
 a bit like in the last tomb raider 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.959
 the massacre of the pnj is not 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.010
 justifiable scriptually speaking and 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.840
 it's a first problem 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.160
 the second problem that proves that 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.600
 finally incompetent screenwriters 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.459
 are legion at ubisoft 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.230
 is that watchdog place to question 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.480
 on Orwellian dystopia that puts into 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.160
 scene use it as a toy at 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.690
 to make a real statement about the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.610
 widespread surveillance on the ultra 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.769
 safe liberticide yet that is 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.150
 more topical than ever it is lost 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.560
 in boat gunfights where we do 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.580
 mumuse to kill bad guys by exploding 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.250
 lights and electrical networks 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.690
 while bah shit all the com around 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.820
 the title was made early his abilities to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.410
 hacking on this dystopian world but this 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.660
 hack is just a surface only serves the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.340
 gameplay and this way so skinny 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.410
 that's where a real 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.000
 watchdoc problem is just a lie 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.560
 at first he promised to be a game 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.150
 his gun but a game all the same a game 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.680
 fun all the same where he for the most 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.670
 young people in the background it is possible I 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.470
 still remember this first video 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.280
 diffuse gameplay ali 3 whose 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.140
 first four minutes were 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.060
 gunless shit it was 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.230
 cool and finally the guns are 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.600
 arrived and bullets rocketed 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.829
 and it cooled me down because it 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.470
 suddenly became classic without 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.760
 flavor already seen to fade and then these weapons 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.540
 create a narrative ludo dissonance 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.489
 maddening 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.989
 if the hac is the best idea of ​​useful 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.250
 because she offered a personality a 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.840
 real thing in addition to pedantic enghien 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.519
 about and one is also the worst 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.840
 ok it's a fresh female material 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.220
 exergue a questioning is society 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.600
 Orwellian dutra surveillance if we 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.040
 push all of them even a little bit 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.900
 reflection because we are still put 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.370
 in position of permanent voyeurism and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.170
 the more the gray hacking when he walks 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.400
 correctly but at the same time 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.290
 would content without being a simple gadget 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.700
 to assist the gunfights and does not allow 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.070
 not to have a real interaction 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.840
 with others because eventually our 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.100
 only true interaction with each other 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.050
 in 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.490
 world supposedly ultra connected it's 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
 to be able to volley or kill him with a 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.240
 gone you talk about a hyper connected world 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.380
 and then hyper connected with who I say 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.850
 King George is one of the most 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.500
 insulting a discriminatory what I 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.760
 played all the minorities are 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.380
 abused blacks are nests 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.730
 war has stumbled and women are either 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.230
 slaves are on treacherous 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.850
 incapables good at being kidnapped 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.440
 as for the little people the one who 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.180
 dot the streets he is seen with a 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.950
 slanderous eyes permanently no matter 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.960
 what life you observe by having to 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.430
 dock his camera or his phone will be 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.830
 either mediocre or ridiculous 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.760
 criminal shit that only bother me 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.440
 to have to make a title too 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.120
 insulting at all levels and then 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.590
 watchdoc is a misread title if it 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.130
 sells as an instigator of the new 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.840
 generation 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.400
 they are actually satisfied with nothing but 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.290
 repeating the elements of the previous 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.700
 graphically weak is all gray sound 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.710
 engine was unveiled only at night and 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.510
 in the rain his hero is struggling has been 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.370
 distressing like most others 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.720
 protagonists of the soft even though I did 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.620
 not a little mention to hirak all the 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.720
 stay over the already seen 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.820
 the digital triples are repomper cgt 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.990
 at 5 kills and was already transplanting centro the 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.280
 other gaming come out as for them 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.020
 other soundboxes at ubisoft 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.150
 in fact in this consanguine orgy 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.590
 of openworld bland and tasteless watchdoc 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.880
 without the last-born hemophiliacs who get 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.080
 prides itself on being the great legacy of its 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.420
 ancestors because there is a high watch 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.190
 tech while not once the 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.320
 through the past hac unveils a 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.820
 expired title a gentle recycling that 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.710
 already knew how to do it again and again south of 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.970
 Montreal and without words without finesse 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.530
 but still to four same recipes from 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.210
 blockbuster videogame that is all about 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.100
 even the fun and fun experience because these 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.450
 two birds really wheat the jean game 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.830
 matas de maureen is eaten without much 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.090
 pleasure without much memory where he 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.710
 tasted anyway between two games more 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.600
 interesting but it seems to me that he 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.920
 must also restore a truth ubisoft 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.150
 the editor who is the most climbed in 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.920
 this generation that is coming to an end 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.360
 he went from the little French studio to 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.290
 internationalized struggle that 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.090
 now compete with the biggest 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.560
 in terms of numbers he therefore occupies a 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.240
 major place is different in 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.740
 industry but where audacity 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.700
 art of yesteryear no longer feels 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.530
 that in some productions not well 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.310
 damn and where the last big games of 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.420
 the publisher are developed by a 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.010
 policeman the south of France 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.120
 it's time to question the 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.470
 bigger kids developers 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.240
 frenchy what is doing 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.530
 to undergo video games because if everyone 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.880
 headlines lucio may know it 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.710
 that a world gameplay model 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.030
 open'thur active and so on 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.230
 which we add interesting universes 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.680
 I had people or storylines 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.030
 bland 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.889
 so it may be time to 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.360
 reconsider 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.030
 studio at its fair value that of the 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.680
 mediocrity because I think that here the 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.770
 good word would be to say that when they get 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.449
 a ubisoft montreal game and everything seems 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.449
 suddenly make a lot more years
