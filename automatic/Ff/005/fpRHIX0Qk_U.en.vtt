00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.150
 the 6th send here this brings us to a 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.740
 look that I have been asked inspired actress 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.260
 eiza gonzÃ¡lez east 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.360
 let's start it's very simple the 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.460
 attack as in a novelty is the not see 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.050
 the novelty but they sent me these pictures 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.790
 which are the ones that should cover for 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.040
 that you can see is a simple look I made 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.250
 of pretty let's start with the base 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.710
 with being miss bobby brown 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.370
 and they will overcome it in all our 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.370
 registry 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.140
 since it's going to me you can seal it with my 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.540
 duty to see if they come to notice that 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.770
 they need a little more in some area 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.850
 and consecrate a bit of it 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.920
 correct base in this area 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.689
 here it looks like a very makeup 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.150
 natural in fact no rain and contour 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.090
 animated your feet actively the great 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 thing after was wasilla directly with my 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.840
 michael forever 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.270
 for the eyes you can use this paintball 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.410
 which is my marc ticket is a basis for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.970
 our shadows 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.970
 we are going to apply throughout our section 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.580
 Well, how is it sold as in all the 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.580
 eyelid mobile brings this gold that is 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.760
 goldmine or any golden shadow that 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.570
 have we are not going to apply all of our 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.570
 mobile body 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.000
 small tapped by 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.010
 pressing for a lot 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.010
 amount of pigment in our section 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.060
 and that applied is only on the eyelid 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.060
 mobile 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.310
 afterwards as in some photos it is reached 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.240
 to see how there is a touch of orange 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.470
 tropical marc me to the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.430
 apply in all our client 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.430
 all veal 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.030
 not only looks like a little touch of this 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.480
 orange then we will cover it with 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.480
 another tone 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.170
 now let's put a coffee 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.090
 so strong is personally what is 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.090
 express 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.810
 we go a little more to the same brush that 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.180
 I know the orange does not matter and it's going to be 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.189
 only on the shore 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.220
 what is on top of this orange in 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.170
 Zorrilla and we started to blur 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.280
 without reaching the beginning that is left 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.280
 as in the little hill 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.210
 there it is and finally we are going to add a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.230
 Natural tone for this area can 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.230
 use this that sainz and there 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.460
 only for this area 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.210
 let's delineate the 7 delineated as 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.210
 all the eye then let's line up 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.210
 completely 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.210
 to our plan 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.780
 we have our whole party 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.560
 come out a little bit more 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.439
 and also from the bottom 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.770
 and very pegadito to very soft tabs 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.350
 now I think that as it looks like other 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.690
 then false people will add 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.170
 a few false eyelashes I will put my 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.810
 eyebrows and in this comeback and ready I put 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.430
 my eyelashes industrial design and 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.430
 line also this part below 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.499
 online the bottom part with the same 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.749
 coffee we use up and girl's eye 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:39.349
 inside but with a brown pencil 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:42.139
 that for it was not this hard as 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:44.479
 a black nothing else looks like it brings a 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.120
 little touch of light then let's 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:51.479
 add some 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.479
 Laila only at the beginning 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.820
 and we are going to have a little love very 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.620
 natural 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.620
 pinging we add 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.820
 but with this palladium stein the tone 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.310
 is 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.310
 we have everything 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.379
 maybe it's 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:29.379
 this club is from erc in vic sen 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.660
 this is the determined gonzÃ¡lez state 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.040
 I hope you like it I tell you it 's very 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.520
 nice I think you know it perfectly 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.990
 to leave and it does not look so overloaded 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.090
 but I'm not that heavy with a 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.790
 purism that breaks with natural water 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.770
 It is again because they can bring back 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.570
 to see the eyes in golden coffee and a 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.230
 touch of orange our touch of light and 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.540
 delineated 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.690
 and I hope you have liked to 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.690
 then
