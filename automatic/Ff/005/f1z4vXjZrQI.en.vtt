00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
can get it to work with this year I also

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.680 
can get it to work with this year I also
added<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.390> constraint<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.739> yeah<00:03:58.690> you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
added a constraint to that so yeah you

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.580 
added a constraint to that so yeah you
have<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.900> live<00:04:00.290> with<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:02.260> actually<00:04:03.260> you<00:04:03.410> can

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
have to live with it actually you can

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.449 
have to live with it actually you can
just<00:04:03.739> tried<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.510> year<00:04:05.829> so<00:04:06.829> just<00:04:07.100> add<00:04:07.400> it
