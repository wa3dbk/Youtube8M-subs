body and that's one of the big reasons

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.879 
body and that's one of the big reasons
that<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.909> like<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.389> do<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.629> now<00:02:52.079> extend<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.620> fast

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
that I like to do it now extend it fast

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.839 
that I like to do it now extend it fast
over<00:02:53.519> 36<00:02:53.939> hours<00:02:54.060> are<00:02:54.389> best<00:02:54.599> for<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.870> kind<00:02:55.169> of

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
over 36 hours are best for that kind of

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.339 
over 36 hours are best for that kind of
result<00:02:56.849> but<00:02:57.540> we're<00:02:57.659> gonna<00:02:57.750> get<00:02:57.930> more<00:02:58.139> into

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
result but we're gonna get more into

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.190 
result but we're gonna get more into
that<00:02:58.439> in<00:02:58.500> part<00:02:59.010> 3<00:02:59.340> now<00:02:59.609> the<00:03:00.150> last<00:03:00.569> big<00:03:00.810> reason

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that in part 3 now the last big reason

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.599 
that in part 3 now the last big reason
and<00:03:01.409> this<00:03:01.530> isn't<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.889> biggest<00:03:02.069> one<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.489> lot

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
and this isn't the biggest one for a lot

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.190 
and this isn't the biggest one for a lot
of<00:03:02.730> people<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.329> big<00:03:03.510> benefit<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.019> me

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
of people but it's a big benefit to me
