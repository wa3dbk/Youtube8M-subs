00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.510
 friends and I say will not pass 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.410
 record to record 221 today and 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.250
 the plane goes away 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 okay 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 and that's the one that has left 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.970
 very good the sky is absolutely 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.970
 toxic today 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.390
 I'm going to make a time 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.600
 I do not know how to say it in English in the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.070
 time is worth it and I'm going to record like that 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.710
 it's going to open up and it's going to turn 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.100
 in this for the subnormal the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.580
 assholes and the magicians who say that 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.340
 that's plane smoke ok we're going to 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 check how it starts to spoil and to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.030
 leave it with soft patina we return in 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.870
 a few minutes to see how it is 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:03.329
 and well now, no cheating or cardboard 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 to leave and let's see how it is 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.690
 the wake 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.450
 I think it has come quite obvious and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.390
 evident 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.509
 that that's not airplane smoke and that it's a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.979
 Moisture binder that is well 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.710
 mix well with moisture well the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.990
 pollutes well they create false clouds that 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.030
 when the morning dew falls and the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.670
 humidity close to us 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.770
 will fall mixed with that shit that shit 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.079
 will fall on plants on the same clothes 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.460
 that we tend on the fields that 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.219
 we grow and on the water that we 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.530
 we drink and they will pass to your body worth in your 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.479
 The vast majority are heavy metals or 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.390
 nanotechnological compounds manufactured 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.250
 in laboratories ok for what purpose this 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.590
 we have said a thousand times and they are a plan 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.880
 multidisciplinary that multidisciplinary 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.619
 forgiveness that pursues many purposes all and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.170
 each one goes through the submission and the 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.189
 control of the population in general 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.799
 climate control etc etc etc ok 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.709
 just look at the nuclear color 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.590
 too white a white that dazzles 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:12.890
 when looking in some cases they create and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.230
 Rainbow multiple leaderships ok 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.510
 and it is a white due to the particles 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.430
 metallic 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.430
 some metallic particles that shine 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.680
 greatly compared to the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.720
 normal water particles and project 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.500
 much more light we give accounts also that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.540
 it does not travel will have spent about ten minutes 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.760
 we have left the desserts that are the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.909
 real smoke or real water vapor that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.920
 leave the plane when passing against and 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:46.220
 disappear at 23 minutes and this 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.190
 stay hours right now is taking 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.910
 a grayish hue as you can see 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.840
 and nothing amazing we're going to come out inside 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.840
 a few minutes and let's see how is that 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.200
 plane smoke in quotation marks 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.030
 we continue 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.670
 and good 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.670
 let's see again how it continues 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.140
 cry 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.249
 moore 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.940
 absolutely extended 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.940
 mixed 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.830
 and we can already presuppose perfectly 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.080
 that assimilated with all this that everything 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.319
 this cord and we have the same clouds 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:53.079
 from before as you can see all this 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.079
 and all this cord that was formed 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.000
 it's amazing how it has been absorbed 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.390
 over there maybe this is a rest has 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.390
 I spent a lot more time because she 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.180
 threw and sitting can this be the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.310
 result to notice the tearing is that is 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.410
 that 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.019
 ok to notice the tearing that is being 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.150
 detaching is that to look at what 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.580
 it has become impressive 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.280
 here in some things as if there 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.960
 absorbed truth and there begins a 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.699
 tearing that is starting right now 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.699
 We will be here in a little while 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.349
 it's awesome sir like the 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.780
 geoengineering a term that you can 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:44.100
 search google in dictionaries the 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.780
 geoengineering 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.780
 they load the weather 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.009
 to manipulate everything is disgustingly 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.349
 perverse is shameful 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.229
 we ask who taught the 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.960
 human being the wonderful technique of 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.199
 pulverize heavy metals in the 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.029
 atmosphere will be removed with a 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.520
 truth as the tablets tell 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:15.080
 sumeria gross david parcerisas by 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.080
 example you can not search it on youtube 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.680
 Jose Luis from the unknown world himself 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.180
 rafa for the luis carlos fields where 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.750
 Alberto Canosa 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.970
 you have a crowd 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.849
 of people preparing information fixes 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.349
 how the tearing is increasing 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.750
 look at what antinatura you see that is 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.320
 brutal 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.320
 okay 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.500
 to tell me how many clouds you see that 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.660
 behave like that is the behavior 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.940
 from a cloud truth look at how it is 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.940
 creating above 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.640
 it's like you notice that it's a product 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.729
 that does not make a normal cloud the clouds 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.009
 normal do not act like this 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:04.550
 and what mixes with that product 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:08.830
 remains with this sickly grayish tone 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.200
 ok with a white sometimes off sometimes 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:16.430
 obscured other times a nuclear target 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.780
 super bright Notice that grossed as 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.240
 continues to water and open 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.520
 okay 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.259
 Well here I leave it and now that it comes 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.819
 any denial is bastard any 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.770
 stupid twister or whatever 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.210
 follower of 'fourth millennium' to tell you 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.389
 that all this is a mystery that is not 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.639
 know why it happens according to signal 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:38.639
 of this video one are leaving and we do not trust to 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.970
 mate subscribe ramones we follow 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.970
