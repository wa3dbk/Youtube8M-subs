00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I'm talking about because there's a jump

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.179 
I'm talking about because there's a jump
there<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> jump<00:01:43.500> challenge<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
there is a jump challenge in the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.060 
there is a jump challenge in the
Mitsubishi<00:01:44.579> Evo<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.110> golf<00:01:46.320> course<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
Mitsubishi Evo at the golf course in the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.280 
Mitsubishi Evo at the golf course in the
video<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.689> gives<00:01:48.869> me<00:01:48.960> an<00:01:49.110> idea

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
video so that kind of gives me an idea

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
video so that kind of gives me an idea
of<00:01:49.560> what<00:01:50.100> these<00:01:50.399> challenges<00:01:50.939> are<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
of what these challenges are gonna be I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.630 
of what these challenges are gonna be I
think<00:01:52.470> they're<00:01:52.649> basically<00:01:52.860> gonna<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.399> based

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
think they're basically gonna be based

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.800 
think they're basically gonna be based
on<00:01:53.790> things<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.299> jump<00:01:55.020> distance<00:01:55.670> speed

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
on things like jump distance speed

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.609 
on things like jump distance speed
drifting<00:01:58.159> just<00:01:59.159> basically<00:01:59.579> skills<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.619> it's
