they have lost a few but the problem
they<00:00:27.320> were<00:00:27.439> having<00:00:27.470> with<00:00:27.800> this<00:00:28.010> tree<00:00:28.279> was<00:00:29.800> I'll

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
they were having with this tree was I'll

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.870 
they were having with this tree was I'll
just<00:00:30.949> get<00:00:31.130> a<00:00:31.160> leaf<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:33.520> see<00:00:34.520> that<00:00:34.670> little

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
just get a leaf that see that little

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.440 
just get a leaf that see that little
brown<00:00:35.740> scaling<00:00:36.740> makes<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.820> leaf<00:00:38.030> pretty<00:00:38.300> much

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
brown scaling makes the leaf pretty much

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.110 
brown scaling makes the leaf pretty much
transparent<00:00:39.380> that's<00:00:39.920> pear<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.460> cherry<00:00:40.760> slug

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
transparent that's pear and cherry slug

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.870 
transparent that's pear and cherry slug
now<00:00:41.810> they're<00:00:42.260> tiny<00:00:42.620> little<00:00:42.800> black<00:00:43.130> slugs<00:00:43.520> they

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
now they're tiny little black slugs they

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.400 
now they're tiny little black slugs they
get<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.060> good<00:00:44.270> size<00:00:44.510> if<00:00:44.840> they're<00:00:44.990> in<00:00:45.080> a<00:00:45.110> spot

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
get a good size if they're in a spot

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.170 
get a good size if they're in a spot
where<00:00:45.560> they<00:00:45.650> like<00:00:45.890> what<00:00:46.070> they're<00:00:46.250> reading<00:00:46.400> but

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
where they like what they're reading but

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.520 
where they like what they're reading but
that's<00:00:47.330> what<00:00:47.510> it<00:00:47.600> does<00:00:47.780> they<00:00:48.200> pretty<00:00:48.410> much

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
that's what it does they pretty much

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.830 
that's what it does they pretty much
just<00:00:48.590> eat<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.100> surface<00:00:49.490> area<00:00:49.940> of<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.480> actual

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
just eat the surface area of the actual

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.360 
just eat the surface area of the actual
leave<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.440> you're<00:00:51.800> just<00:00:51.950> left<00:00:52.160> with<00:00:52.280> that

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
leave and you're just left with that

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.500 
leave and you're just left with that
transparent<00:00:53.300> vein<00:00:54.250> left<00:00:55.250> on<00:00:55.460> there<00:00:55.700> so<00:00:56.120> that's

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
transparent vein left on there so that's

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.270 
transparent vein left on there so that's
what<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.410> can<00:00:57.650> get<00:00:57.920> rid<00:00:58.040> of<00:00:58.070> them

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
what that is you can get rid of them

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.710 
what that is you can get rid of them
with<00:00:58.430> some<00:00:58.640> sprays<00:00:58.970> there's<00:00:59.360> different

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
with some sprays there's different

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.320 
with some sprays there's different
sprays<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.110> can<00:01:00.230> get<00:01:01.000> eco-friendly<00:01:02.000> sprays

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
sprays you can get eco-friendly sprays

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.020 
sprays you can get eco-friendly sprays
non<00:01:03.170> eco-friendly<00:01:03.950> sprays<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:04.489> some

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
non eco-friendly sprays and some

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.610 
non eco-friendly sprays and some
pesticides<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.930> can<00:01:06.140> make<00:01:06.350> up<00:01:06.530> yourself

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
pesticides that you can make up yourself

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.260 
pesticides that you can make up yourself
like<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.130> one<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.280> did<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.700> video<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:08.000> while

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
like the one I did in a video a while

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.760 
like the one I did in a video a while
ago<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.960> just<00:01:09.140> spray<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.470> tree<00:01:09.650> it's<00:01:09.740> a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
ago you can just spray the tree it's a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.130 
ago you can just spray the tree it's a
bit<00:01:09.890> hard<00:01:10.100> with<00:01:10.280> such<00:01:10.460> a<00:01:10.490> big<00:01:10.760> tree<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.870> spray

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
bit hard with such a big tree just spray

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.080 
bit hard with such a big tree just spray
the<00:01:12.290> whole<00:01:12.500> thing<00:01:12.770> I<00:01:12.890> know<00:01:12.950> especially<00:01:13.730> when

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
the whole thing I know especially when

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.800 
the whole thing I know especially when
it's<00:01:14.240> windy<00:01:14.450> like<00:01:14.780> today<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:16.480> if<00:01:17.480> you<00:01:17.570> can<00:01:17.690> do

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
your best you can pretty much eradicate

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.120 
your best you can pretty much eradicate
them<00:01:19.670> from<00:01:20.060> most<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.600> tree<00:01:20.810> anyway<00:01:21.200> that's

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
them from most of the tree anyway that's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.810 
them from most of the tree anyway that's
what<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.460> is

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
what that is
