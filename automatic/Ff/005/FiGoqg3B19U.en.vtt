trail<00:02:20.990> have<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.560> they<00:02:22.370> are<00:02:23.170> gastropod<00:02:24.170> which

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
trail have and they are gastropod which

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.280 
trail have and they are gastropod which
means<00:02:25.010> they<00:02:25.250> have<00:02:25.459> to<00:02:25.640> move<00:02:25.970> on<00:02:26.300> their<00:02:26.720> stomach

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
means they have to move on their stomach

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.860 
means they have to move on their stomach
so<00:02:27.590> they

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
so they

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:36.440 
so they
need<00:02:28.140> lubrication<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:30.000> do<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.629> oh<00:02:35.450> now

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
need lubrication so then do that oh now

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.080 
need lubrication so then do that oh now
that's<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.930> garden<00:02:37.530> snail<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.549> you've<00:02:38.670> gone<00:02:38.879> to

that's a garden snail and you've gone to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.570

all of our winter plants as well at the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.569 
all of our winter plants as well at the
moment<00:03:37.139> we're<00:03:37.290> seeing<00:03:37.560> obviously<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.980> great

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
moment we're seeing obviously a great

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.339 
amount of slugs and snails in the garden
and<00:03:40.790> generally<00:03:41.790> because<00:03:42.120> we've<00:03:42.900> had<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.079> lot<00:03:43.319> of

and generally because we've had a lot of

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.460 
and generally because we've had a lot of
mild<00:03:43.650> winters<00:03:44.180> although<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.329> had<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.810> cold

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
mild winters although we had the cold

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.470 
mild winters although we had the cold
snaps<00:03:46.980> they've<00:03:47.250> not<00:03:47.400> been<00:03:47.430> long<00:03:48.060> enough<00:03:48.299> to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
snaps they've not been long enough to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.780 
snaps they've not been long enough to
kill<00:03:48.660> off<00:03:48.810> any<00:03:49.220> slugs<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.340> snails<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.639> have

kill off any slugs and snails that have

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.369 
kill off any slugs and snails that have
been<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> garden<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.049> they're<00:03:52.230> having

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
been in the garden so they're having

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.280 
been in the garden so they're having
perfect<00:03:52.950> breeding<00:03:53.129> grounds<00:03:53.959> we've<00:03:54.959> been<00:03:55.139> in

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
perfect breeding grounds we've been in

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.850 
perfect breeding grounds we've been in
the<00:03:55.379> situation<00:03:55.590> where<00:03:56.069> she<00:03:56.250> has

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
the situation where she has

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.120 
the situation where she has
Eitan<00:03:58.860> or<00:03:59.280> we<00:03:59.460> thought<00:03:59.700> was<00:03:59.820> she<00:03:59.970> at<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.130> snail

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
Eitan or we thought was she at a snail

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.190 
Eitan or we thought was she at a snail
and<00:04:02.400> she<00:04:03.180> doubt<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.480> point<00:04:03.690> been<00:04:03.810> treated

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
and she doubt that point been treated

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.430 
and she doubt that point been treated
for<00:04:04.380> long<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.740> so<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:06.180> vet<00:04:06.330> just<00:04:06.360> told<00:04:07.260> us<00:04:07.380> to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
for long one so the vet just told us to

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.610 
for long one so the vet just told us to
look<00:04:07.650> out<00:04:07.830> for<00:04:07.980> any<00:04:08.130> kind<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.430> symptoms<00:04:09.620> there

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
look out for any kind of symptoms there

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.020 
look out for any kind of symptoms there
were<00:04:10.710> unusual<00:04:10.860> kind<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.370> behavior<00:04:11.730> from<00:04:11.850> her

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
were unusual kind of behavior from her

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.590 
were unusual kind of behavior from her
that<00:04:12.180> she<00:04:12.360> might<00:04:12.480> seem<00:04:12.750> fun

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
that she might seem fun

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.660 
that she might seem fun
I<00:04:13.660> think<00:04:14.380> it's<00:04:14.560> something<00:04:14.800> that<00:04:14.950> every<00:04:15.310> panda

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
I think it's something that every panda

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.760 
I think it's something that every panda
regardless<00:04:16.540> of<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.750> pet<00:04:16.959> should<00:04:17.560> take

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
regardless of the pet should take

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.490 
regardless of the pet should take
notices<00:04:18.400> obviously<00:04:19.390> their<00:04:19.540> pets<00:04:19.750> health<00:04:19.990> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
notices obviously their pets health and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.660 
notices obviously their pets health and
they're<00:04:20.590> gonna<00:04:20.680> be<00:04:20.830> happier<00:04:21.130> pets<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.580> you're

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
they're gonna be happier pets and you're

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.130 
they're gonna be happier pets and you're
gonna<00:04:21.790> get<00:04:21.970> more<00:04:22.150> enjoyment<00:04:22.270> out<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.750> them<00:04:22.930> so

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
gonna get more enjoyment out of them so

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.260 
gonna get more enjoyment out of them so
I<00:04:23.170> think<00:04:23.260> it's<00:04:23.530> something<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.580> owners

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
I think it's something that the owners

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.480 
I think it's something that the owners
should<00:04:25.510> be<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.840> lot<00:04:26.110> more<00:04:26.260> aware<00:04:26.500> of<00:04:29.370> there<00:04:30.370> are

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
should be a lot more aware of there are

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.790 
should be a lot more aware of there are
many<00:04:30.790> species<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.450> lungworm<00:04:31.930> but<00:04:32.410> angyeo
