left my ends we want to do it all over

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.140 
left my ends we want to do it all over
the<00:03:50.390> place<00:03:50.510> so<00:03:50.750> it's<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.989> little<00:03:51.170> bit<00:03:51.410> more

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
the place so it's a little bit more

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.780 
the place so it's a little bit more
sporadic<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.360> not<00:03:53.930> going<00:03:54.709> in<00:03:55.100> all<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.340> same

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
sporadic and not going in all the same

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.930 
sporadic and not going in all the same
directions<00:03:56.300> or<00:03:57.020> curled<00:03:57.830> at<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.190> same<00:03:58.430> spots

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
directions or curled at the same spots

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.140 
directions or curled at the same spots
because<00:03:59.300> we<00:03:59.450> want<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.170> be<00:04:00.350> very<00:04:00.709> like<00:04:01.150> messy

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
because we want it to be very like messy

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.890 
because we want it to be very like messy
and<00:04:02.920> grunge

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.270 

then<00:04:11.900> we're<00:04:12.020> going<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.170> let<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.440> top<00:04:12.680> part<00:04:13.130> of

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
then we're going to let the top part of

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.940 
then we're going to let the top part of
our<00:04:13.460> hair<00:04:13.640> come<00:04:14.180> down<00:04:14.480> I'm<00:04:14.870> going<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.530> split<00:04:15.800> it

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
our hair come down I'm going to split it

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.620 
our hair come down I'm going to split it
right<00:04:16.130> in<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.370> back<00:04:16.640> and<00:04:16.970> bring<00:04:17.180> everything

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
right in the back and bring everything

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.040 
right in the back and bring everything
to<00:04:18.020> the<00:04:18.050> front<00:04:18.440> that<00:04:18.650> way<00:04:18.800> I<00:04:18.830> could<00:04:19.130> see<00:04:19.520> it

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.050 
to the front that way I could see it

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.470 
to the front that way I could see it
spray<00:04:21.050> it<00:04:21.080> and<00:04:21.560> then<00:04:22.060> continue<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.120> do<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
spray it and then continue to do the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.960 
spray it and then continue to do the
same<00:04:23.870> thing<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.710> I'm<00:04:25.130> not<00:04:25.220> going<00:04:25.700> to<00:04:25.790> really

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
same thing and I'm not going to really

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.000 
same thing and I'm not going to really
be<00:04:26.060> brushing<00:04:26.420> anything<00:04:27.110> out<00:04:27.260> because<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:27.710> won't

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
be brushing anything out because I won't

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.360 
be brushing anything out because I won't
stay<00:04:28.750> really<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.930> messy<00:04:30.440> I'm<00:04:30.980> going<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.220> take

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
stay really a messy I'm going to take

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.520 
stay really a messy I'm going to take
smaller<00:04:31.820> sections<00:04:32.360> at<00:04:32.480> the<00:04:32.510> top<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.020> focus

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
smaller sections at the top and focus

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.690 
smaller sections at the top and focus
the<00:04:34.400> curling<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:36.290> my<00:04:36.590> flat<00:04:36.830> iron<00:04:36.980> at<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.310> top

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
the curling of my flat iron at the top

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.940 
the curling of my flat iron at the top
so<00:04:37.970> I'm<00:04:38.060> just<00:04:38.270> going<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.770> bring<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:40.040> down<00:04:40.550> and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
so I'm just going to bring it down and

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.250 
so I'm just going to bring it down and
then<00:04:42.950> twist<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.360> in<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.630> direction<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.200> I

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
then twist it in the direction that I

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.680 
then twist it in the direction that I
curled<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.980> twisting<00:04:46.910> it<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.180> letting<00:04:47.420> it

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
curled it twisting it and letting it

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.170 
curled it twisting it and letting it
hang<00:04:47.990> out<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.440> sit<00:04:48.770> for<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.040> second<00:04:49.430> allows

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
hang out and sit for a second allows

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.260 
hang out and sit for a second allows
your<00:04:50.540> curl<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.230> set<00:04:51.590> into<00:04:51.950> place<00:04:52.280> which<00:04:52.970> means

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
your curl to set into place which means

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.990 
your curl to set into place which means
that<00:04:53.540> it's<00:04:53.660> going<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.050> last<00:04:54.470> longer<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.910> I'm

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
that it's going to last longer so I'm

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.940 
that it's going to last longer so I'm
just<00:04:56.180> going<00:04:56.390> to<00:04:56.450> continue<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.410> do<00:04:57.680> that

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
just going to continue to do that

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.460 
just going to continue to do that
all<00:04:58.190> over<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.030> top<00:04:59.300> taking<00:05:00.230> different

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
all over to the top taking different

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.340 
all over to the top taking different
sized<00:05:00.920> sections<00:05:01.580> going<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.630> different<00:05:03.140> ways

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
sized sections going in different ways

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.010 
sized sections going in different ways
so<00:05:03.980> that<00:05:04.010> I<00:05:04.220> can<00:05:04.580> create<00:05:04.910> something<00:05:05.750> that

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
so that I can create something that

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:41.200 
so that I can create something that
looks<00:05:06.890> very<00:05:07.300> undone<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.780> really<00:05:09.230> fun

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.670 

so<00:05:41.780> once<00:05:41.990> you<00:05:42.080> feel<00:05:42.229> like<00:05:42.259> you<00:05:42.470> have

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
so once you feel like you have

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.010 
so once you feel like you have
everything<00:05:43.130> nice<00:05:43.789> and<00:05:43.820> curl<00:05:44.300> spray<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.870> again

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
everything nice and curl spray it again

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.540 
everything nice and curl spray it again
with<00:05:45.259> hairspray<00:05:45.590> because<00:05:45.860> hairspray<00:05:46.430> is

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
with hairspray because hairspray is

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.270 
with hairspray because hairspray is
going<00:05:46.729> to<00:05:46.789> be<00:05:46.880> our<00:05:47.030> best<00:05:47.530> texture<00:05:48.530> dur<00:05:49.039> your

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
that great texture going through it you

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.219 
that great texture going through it you
see<00:06:01.820> how<00:06:02.000> like<00:06:02.240> some<00:06:02.539> pieces<00:06:02.840> are<00:06:03.080> a<00:06:03.139> little

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
see how like some pieces are a little

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.810 
see how like some pieces are a little
bit<00:06:03.410> straighter<00:06:03.710> where<00:06:03.949> some<00:06:04.220> have<00:06:04.400> a<00:06:04.430> bend

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
bit straighter where some have a bend

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.240 
bit straighter where some have a bend
you<00:06:05.419> can<00:06:05.570> kind<00:06:05.780> of<00:06:05.870> see<00:06:06.020> some<00:06:06.050> curled<00:06:06.620> ends<00:06:07.100> and

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
you can kind of see some curled ends and

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.070 
you can kind of see some curled ends and
then<00:06:07.370> some<00:06:07.639> straightens<00:06:08.180> that<00:06:08.720> gives<00:06:08.960> you

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080
