00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.810 

pour<00:00:43.980> some

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.580 

once<00:00:48.480> you've<00:00:48.600> done<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.990> our<00:00:49.020> most<00:00:49.230> efficient

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
once you've done for our most efficient

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.069 
once you've done for our most efficient
milk<00:00:50.030> can<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.180> ahead<00:00:51.330> and<00:00:51.600> color<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.990> blue

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
milk can go ahead and color it blue

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.550 
milk can go ahead and color it blue
just<00:00:55.079> add<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> few<00:00:55.320> drops

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.670 

shake<00:01:00.310> it<00:01:00.340> around<00:01:03.630> so<00:01:04.630> now<00:01:04.780> you<00:01:05.170> can<00:01:05.350> see<00:01:05.500> it's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
shake it around so now you can see it's

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.900 
shake it around so now you can see it's
almost<00:01:06.040> like<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.430> big<00:01:06.580> loop<00:01:08.160> so<00:01:09.160> now<00:01:09.640> what<00:01:09.820> you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
almost like a big loop so now what you

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.170 
almost like a big loop so now what you
want<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.150> do<00:01:10.680> let's<00:01:11.680> take<00:01:11.860> your<00:01:12.180> gasoline

after about that make sure you put the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.490 
after about that make sure you put the
gasoline<00:01:33.790> there<00:01:35.050> after<00:01:36.050> you're<00:01:36.170> done<00:01:36.260> putting

gasoline there after you're done putting
it<00:01:36.650> into<00:01:36.800> container<00:01:37.190> make<00:01:37.910> sure<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.240> screw<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
it into container make sure to screw the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.800 
it into container make sure to screw the
gasoline<00:01:39.050> cap<00:01:39.260> on<00:01:39.410> tightly<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.540> make<00:01:41.690> sure

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
gasoline cap on tightly and to make sure

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.060 
gasoline cap on tightly and to make sure
it's<00:01:41.960> not<00:01:42.050> leaking<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.530> put<00:01:42.650> it<00:01:42.770> away<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:43.010> a

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
it's not leaking and put it away in a

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.030 
it's not leaking and put it away in a
safe<00:01:43.220> place<00:01:43.370> especially<00:01:43.730> for<00:01:44.000> time<00:01:44.410> so<00:01:45.410> what

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
safe place especially for time so what

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.650 
safe place especially for time so what
you<00:01:46.160> want<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.370> do<00:01:46.490> now<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.880> can<00:01:46.910> take<00:01:47.210> your

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
you want to do now is you can take your

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.930 
you want to do now is you can take your
other<00:01:47.810> shader<00:01:48.440> food<00:01:48.680> coloring<00:01:49.010> which<00:01:49.760> is

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
other shader food coloring which is

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.090 
other shader food coloring which is
yellow<00:01:50.150> for<00:01:50.420> us<00:01:50.480> and<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.500> could<00:01:51.650> put<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:51.980> into

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
yellow for us and you could put it into

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:02.290 
yellow for us and you could put it into
the<00:01:52.310> gasoline<00:01:52.730> so<00:01:59.800> yeah<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:01.790> can<00:02:01.940> put<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.120> few

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the gasoline so yeah you can put a few

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.600 
the gasoline so yeah you can put a few
drops

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.460 

and<00:02:06.090> that'll<00:02:06.360> become<00:02:06.480> just<00:02:06.840> more<00:02:06.930> yellow<00:02:07.230> than

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
and that'll become just more yellow than

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.240 
and that'll become just more yellow than
it<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.680> right<00:02:07.830> now

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.580 

so<00:02:13.250> once<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.150> your<00:02:14.360> colored<00:02:15.110> gasoline

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
so once you have your colored gasoline

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.950 
so once you have your colored gasoline
and<00:02:16.280> your<00:02:16.430> water<00:02:16.580> oh<00:02:19.360> sorry<00:02:20.360> about<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.600> it's

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
and your water oh sorry about that it's

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.420 
and your water oh sorry about that it's
fixing<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.380> what<00:02:21.830> you<00:02:21.950> want<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.190> do<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.370> you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
fixing it what you want to do is you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.360 
fixing it what you want to do is you
want<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.610> pour<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.910> gasoline<00:02:23.120> into<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.840> water

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.670 

so<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:29.390> colors<00:02:29.690> will<00:02:29.900> combine<00:02:30.230> because<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
so the colors will combine because the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.020 
so the colors will combine because the
density<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.340> food<00:02:31.520> coloring<00:02:31.700> is

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
density of the food coloring is

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.280 
density of the food coloring is
different<00:02:32.390> than<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.600> density<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.170> water

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
different than the density of the water

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.010 
different than the density of the water
and<00:02:33.530> gasoline<00:02:33.980> what<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.270> as<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.720> final

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
and gasoline what you have as the final

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.700 
and gasoline what you have as the final
product<00:02:36.700> you'll<00:02:37.700> have<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:41.320> darker<00:02:42.320> layer<00:02:42.500> of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
product you'll have a darker layer of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.620 
product you'll have a darker layer of
something<00:02:43.070> under<00:02:43.400> which<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.450> it's

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
something under which is this and it's

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.540 
something under which is this and it's
water<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.320> then<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> lighter<00:02:45.800> shade<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.370> on

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
water and then a lighter shade of it on

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.340 
water and then a lighter shade of it on
top<00:02:46.760> this<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.330> gasoline<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:49.990> yeah<00:02:50.990> so

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
top this is the gasoline so yeah so

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.750 
top this is the gasoline so yeah so
that's<00:02:51.500> because<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.010> extreme<00:02:52.340> density

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
that's because of the extreme density

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.280 
that's because of the extreme density
difference<00:02:53.090> between<00:02:53.360> water<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.660> gasoline

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
difference between water and gasoline

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.570 
difference between water and gasoline
what<00:02:54.620> happens<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.280> gasoline

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
what happens is that the gasoline

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.780 
what happens is that the gasoline
actually<00:02:55.790> floats<00:02:56.210> on<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.450> water<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.670> what<00:02:58.670> you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
actually floats on the water so what you

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.140 
actually floats on the water so what you
wanna<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.090> now<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.370> want<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.610> take<00:03:01.760> your

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
wanna do now is you want to take your

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.920 
wanna do now is you want to take your
matches<00:03:02.570> or<00:03:03.610> lighter<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:05.750> don't

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
matches or lighter and you don't

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.220 
matches or lighter and you don't
actually<00:03:06.110> need<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.530> touch<00:03:06.740> the<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:07.870> fire<00:03:08.870> to

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
actually need to touch the the fire to

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.920 
actually need to touch the the fire to
the<00:03:09.410> gasoline<00:03:10.120> gasoline<00:03:11.120> produces<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.720> lot<00:03:11.900> of

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
the gasoline gasoline produces a lot of

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.410 
the gasoline gasoline produces a lot of
food<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.470> can<00:03:12.620> just<00:03:12.740> bring<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.040> close<00:03:13.420> so

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
food so you can just bring it close so

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.520 
food so you can just bring it close so
then<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.780> just<00:03:14.810> light<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.110> up

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
then you can just light it up

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.550 
then you can just light it up
um<00:03:16.360> I'm<00:03:17.360> gonna<00:03:17.540> pause<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.810> here<00:03:17.990> just<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.440> tell

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
um I'm gonna pause it here just to tell

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.630 
um I'm gonna pause it here just to tell
you<00:03:18.680> guys<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.160> is<00:03:19.280> pretty<00:03:19.430> dangerous

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
you guys that this is pretty dangerous

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.490 
you guys that this is pretty dangerous
and<00:03:20.060> always<00:03:20.270> have<00:03:20.450> some<00:03:20.660> water<00:03:20.870> beside<00:03:21.140> you

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
and always have some water beside you

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.560 
and always have some water beside you
and<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:22.280> should<00:03:22.459> have<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.790> lid<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.209> close<00:03:23.420> it

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
and you should have the lid to close it

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.199 
and you should have the lid to close it
off<00:03:23.690> in<00:03:23.870> case<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.200> gets<00:03:24.320> dangerous<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.850> I'm<00:03:26.060> not

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
off in case it gets dangerous so I'm not

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.790 
off in case it gets dangerous so I'm not
responsible<00:03:26.480> for<00:03:26.900> any<00:03:27.020> injury<00:03:27.320> or<00:03:27.470> something

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
responsible for any injury or something

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.360 
responsible for any injury or something
so<00:03:28.160> let's<00:03:28.310> get<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.610> it

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.660 

so<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.610> that's<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.300> water<00:03:34.570> on<00:03:34.750> fire<00:03:34.960> guys<00:03:35.670> hope

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
so on that's the water on fire guys hope

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.180 
so on that's the water on fire guys hope
you<00:03:36.820> enjoy<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.270> video<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:39.010> is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
you enjoy this video and this is

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.550 
you enjoy this video and this is
actually<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.700> fumes<00:03:40.000> on<00:03:40.150> fire<00:03:40.390> as<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:41.410> can

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
actually the fumes on fire as you can

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.930 
actually the fumes on fire as you can
see<00:03:41.740> if<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.920> actually<00:03:42.010> look<00:03:42.310> at<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.550> gasoline

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
see if you actually look at the gasoline

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.240 
see if you actually look at the gasoline
it<00:03:43.630> is<00:03:43.780> burning<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.200> bit<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:44.800> mostly<00:03:45.070> what's

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
it is burning a bit but mostly what's

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.370 
it is burning a bit but mostly what's
burning<00:03:45.580> is<00:03:45.670> these<00:03:45.850> teams<00:03:46.270> over<00:03:46.510> here<00:03:46.720> and

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
burning is these teams over here and

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.280 
burning is these teams over here and
it's<00:03:47.530> producing<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.040> nice<00:03:48.250> attack<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.690> you

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
it's producing this nice attack so you

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.410 
it's producing this nice attack so you
can<00:03:50.590> actually<00:03:50.830> you<00:03:51.130> can<00:03:51.370> drown<00:03:52.210> them<00:03:52.390> with

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
can actually you can drown them with

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.760 
can actually you can drown them with
water<00:03:52.720> but<00:03:52.960> you'll<00:03:53.110> need<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.260> fill<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.590> jar

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
water but you'll need to fill the jar

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.440 
water but you'll need to fill the jar
completely<00:03:54.190> what<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:54.910> need<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.120> do<00:03:55.240> is<00:03:55.390> you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
completely what you need to do is you

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.760 
completely what you need to do is you
need<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.630> take<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.990> lid<00:03:56.140> like<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.410> said<00:03:56.620> and

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
need to take the lid like I said and

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.030 
need to take the lid like I said and
just<00:03:56.920> pop<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:57.820> over<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.920> yeah<00:03:59.920> that's<00:04:00.430> it

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
just pop it over and yeah that's it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.260 
just pop it over and yeah that's it
just<00:04:03.040> make<00:04:03.190> sure<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.460> wash<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.790> container<00:04:03.880> if

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
just make sure you wash the container if

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.550 
just make sure you wash the container if
you're<00:04:04.390> going<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.630> be<00:04:04.690> using<00:04:04.840> something<00:04:05.320> else

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
you're going to be using something else

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.740 
you're going to be using something else
here<00:04:06.310> as<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.580> as<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.880> told<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:07.240> there<00:04:07.420> are<00:04:07.540> two

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
here as the as I told you there are two

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.830 
here as the as I told you there are two
layers<00:04:07.960> of<00:04:08.140> different<00:04:09.150> substances<00:04:10.150> over<00:04:10.660> here

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
layers of different substances over here

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.930 
layers of different substances over here
and<00:04:11.220> that's<00:04:12.220> because<00:04:12.460> of<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.670> density

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
and that's because of the density

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.670 
and that's because of the density
difference<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:13.840> hope<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.170> guys<00:04:14.290> enjoyed

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
difference so I hope you guys enjoyed

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.490 
difference so I hope you guys enjoyed
