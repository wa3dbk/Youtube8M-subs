00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
fact pretty much I use like two of these

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.820 
fact pretty much I use like two of these
two<00:06:26.889> of<00:06:27.100> these<00:06:27.310> together<00:06:28.240> they<00:06:29.080> come<00:06:29.350> tightly

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
two of these together they come tightly

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.310 
two of these together they come tightly
wound<00:06:30.070> so<00:06:30.550> you<00:06:30.610> have<00:06:30.820> to<00:06:30.970> kind<00:06:31.120> of<00:06:31.320> separate

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
wound so you have to kind of separate

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.089 
wound so you have to kind of separate
them<00:06:32.590> out<00:06:32.710> like<00:06:32.889> this<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:34.139> do<00:06:35.139> like<00:06:35.320> that<00:06:35.620> you

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
them out like this and do like that you

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:37.500 
them out like this and do like that you
know<00:06:36.130> just<00:06:36.490> to<00:06:36.580> get<00:06:36.760> it<00:06:36.880> to<00:06:37.000> look<00:06:37.180> more<00:06:37.240> like

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
know just to get it to look more like

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.600 
know just to get it to look more like
hair<00:06:37.990> instead<00:06:38.320> of<00:06:38.470> a<00:06:38.560> tightly<00:06:38.979> wound<00:06:39.190> thing

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
hair instead of a tightly wound thing

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.879 
hair instead of a tightly wound thing
similar<00:06:39.880> to<00:06:40.210> this<00:06:40.410> you<00:06:41.410> know<00:06:41.530> you<00:06:41.590> want<00:06:41.860> to

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
similar to this you know you want to

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.740 
similar to this you know you want to
separate<00:06:42.310> this<00:06:42.520> out<00:06:42.760> so<00:06:43.000> I<00:06:43.030> can<00:06:43.150> look<00:06:43.389> more

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
separate this out so I can look more

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.320 
separate this out so I can look more
like<00:06:43.900> hair<00:06:44.200> make<00:06:44.440> it<00:06:44.530> easier<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:45.039> work<00:06:45.220> with<00:06:45.330> so

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330
