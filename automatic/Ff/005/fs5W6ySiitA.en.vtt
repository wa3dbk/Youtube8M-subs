minutes<00:03:34.739> we<00:03:34.950> sitting<00:03:35.459> through<00:03:35.670> this<00:03:35.959> they

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
minutes we sitting through this they

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.449 
minutes we sitting through this they
should<00:03:37.230> man<00:03:37.830> they<00:03:38.010> could<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.280> made<00:03:38.430> it

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
should man they could have made it

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.370 
should man they could have made it
better<00:03:38.730> by<00:03:39.000> actually<00:03:39.360> taking<00:03:39.540> both<00:03:40.019> of<00:03:40.049> that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
better by actually taking both of that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.650 
better by actually taking both of that
on<00:03:40.590> my<00:03:40.890> other<00:03:40.950> chapters<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.730> putting<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.540> into

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
on my other chapters and putting it into

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.470 
on my other chapters and putting it into
one<00:03:43.170> episode<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.430> think<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.180> would<00:03:45.269> have<00:03:45.390> been

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
one episode I think that would have been

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.229 
one episode I think that would have been
better<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:45.959> mean<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.620> was<00:03:46.680> up<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.209> was

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
better I mean this was up I think it was
