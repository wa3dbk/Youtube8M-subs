00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.230
 Hi guys all good 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.289
 Today I'll show you how to apply 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.869
 the self-adhesive lessons of beauty are the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.510
 which have already been tried and December 4 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.699
 need to use glue is easy to apply and I 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.380
 I filmed the entire step-by-step drawing with 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.240
 you all the details 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.490
 That's what you have to pay attention to. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 time to apply and this judge that I 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.300
 receive target file fees along with 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.309
 a kit of other products will power 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.739
 to know and I was crazy to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.399
 experience leprosy tell you 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.899
 also 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.110
 I hope you like the video. 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 So a kiss, bye, these are the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.660
 self-adhesive bunk nails 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.690
 here is saying no dispensing the use of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.690
 easy to apply adhesive to a tough and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.090
 week and more sizes that contains 24 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.239
 units and have different sizes so 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.760
 11 models are my 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.339
 thinner and has all the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.930
 types in here is my business but 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.780
 there so let's see if we can find 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.600
 here is some fingernails that 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.299
 well back here has a manual of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 application throughout the region explaining how 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.200
 what happens the removal has everything 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.040
 explained here the first thing to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 to do is take these furniture off my fingernail 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.420
 because I need to have a clean fingernail 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.610
 to apply and the glue knows 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.400
 when I make my nails 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.579
 I like to handle hands and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 cuticles in the hall they those gloves 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.840
 which already comes with moisturizer inside when 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.399
 I do at home, it's harder for me. 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.530
 I do - at home I use a moisturizer has 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.530
 used if I won I have liked 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.689
 enough of mary kay and use bass too 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.869
 that I leave here on my bench and 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.060
 He addressed the Italians of Phebo but this 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.670
 if I am not going to apply here because 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.360
 I've never used it, I think the moisturizer 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.430
 can interfere with nail fixation 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.860
 so I will not use it any afternoon 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.119
 now I'm going to shoot this enamel that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.560
 this one 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:21.849
 and it looks like I already took the nail polish 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.290
 I'll use a toothpick to get the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.290
 Corner glaze 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.150
 I see that the team sometimes even 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.370
 so they're great, you could just paint 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.090
 all but I'll use your nails 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.040
 first because I'm in a hurry and I 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.010
 It 's night time, I do not want to do the fingernail. 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.579
 to arrive tomorrow it's all wrong and I 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.400
 I have appointment tomorrow belt second 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.019
 that even those who cry out, I do not 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.260
 I got in the hall away. 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:58.120
 every time I shoot the glaze I like 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.220
 to look a little further away from the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.109
 I'm going to throw some hot water 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.180
 take the opportunity to hydrate the lula boy 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.540
 because this way I did not take with you from this 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.150
 week, right? 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.220
 so take off that speck is that 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.650
 usually because of acetone the 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.290
 I already picked the nails, these are 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.459
 here they fit together and I'm going to start 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.810
 to roll 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.180
 op this part here but round the dinha 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.560
 It's the part that you have to glue anal 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:36.459
 of the nail fits first underneath 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:39.519
 dog squeezes and keeps squeezing 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:43.959
 Let's talk according to the same thing. 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:47.579
 first lap this part of the box is 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:51.090
 tightly screwed around here goes 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.090
 finding r 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.680
 and they will leave even the last one is just one 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.780
 which lastly if not you have no basis 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.780
 so you can start the deviation 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.680
 In this hand, it looks beautiful. 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.470
 now I'll finish another show you 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.080
 result we finished applying 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:46.550
 They will vote more closely here for you. 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:48.650
 can see knot of the packaging says that 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.590
 now from the moment I already 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.080
 complete the application, I also 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.880
 do not put your hand and water this 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.640
 you may know 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.960
 the glue they see on it that comes back here 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.419
 o is a gel only a gel then looks like 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.540
 that does not hurt the nail so I guess 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.000
 which is much healthier than the crust 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.370
 is that you use glue and the glue is gone 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.440
 scattering a little in the corners 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.570
 depending you have to stop 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.290
 nail if your last great as the 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.750
 my 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.410
 to fit in, but I think 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.169
 I was really cool, I liked watching this 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.500
 color nude so it's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's beautiful 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.760
 in the middle of the afternoon it's not quite close 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.760
 so there is the result 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.979
 Good people, be there. 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.919
 step-by-step all the details of the 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.759
 of these beauty laws and what 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.340
 I thought 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.729
 I really liked it, it's the only thing that I 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.539
 I found it more or less because it 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.969
 stands up because of the gel in the 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.550
 actually the glue that came high silva 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:17.599
 still a shell and fixed very well 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.360
 I already slept that night. 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:23.150
 left quiet called you always left 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.680
 closely you see these personnel there 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:32.990
 I 've never been much of leandro enamel 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:36.889
 just like elegant carrier and I 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:39.439
 I said look here and it's not a pull the other 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.589
 baby relaxed max 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:45.080
 so what I think is good about health 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:47.750
 I think it's cool to whoever is with the 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.360
 small nail with a broken nail or 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.210
 lime and personal credit, and then 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.029
 at a wedding party or did not go to the 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.219
 which is my case or who 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:00.469
 It has a wedding party in a local 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:02.629
 Calm day, you're going to rock the party. 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:04.879
 with the beautiful woman she has other 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:08.419
 advantages under the false nail she 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:11.240
 false glue stick has a very right 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.310
 and there it becomes more adherent to the nail 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.250
 so only she does a damned bad thing to 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.110
 urine she leaves a weak as she 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.029
 piece at the time you take it 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.860
 So I do not think it's cool, I think it's cool because 

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.539
 out that she's already been tempted 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.800
 very easy I know I have to 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:26.539
 justice 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.900
 I know I have a prostitute who 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:30.990
 also 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.180
 careful but I think the nail glue 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.290
 This is not nice, this one is 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.350
 very easy going 

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.210
 so it's proven 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.289
 moments like this you need to make 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.419
 nail quickly 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.160
 I hope I downloaded the rock video if 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:48.229
 Did you like it? What's important to me? 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.229
 A kiss, God bless you.
