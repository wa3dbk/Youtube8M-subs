00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
this is like it's like a puzzle like

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.910 
this is like it's like a puzzle like
before<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.840> open<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.170> box<00:02:33.200> I'm<00:02:33.530> like<00:02:33.710> hey

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
before you open the box I'm like hey

before you open the box I'm like hey
we're<00:02:34.400> gonna<00:02:34.520> mess<00:02:34.730> with<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:34.970> before<00:02:35.450> you

we're gonna mess with you before you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:03:04.030 
we're gonna mess with you before you
open<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.640> all<00:02:37.640> right<00:03:01.300> there<00:03:02.300> we<00:03:02.330> go<00:03:02.960> all<00:03:03.770> right

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
open it all right there we go all right

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.840 
open it all right there we go all right
so<00:03:04.400> there<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.480> is<00:03:05.570> put<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.620> side<00:03:06.860> I'm

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
so there it is put that on the side I'm

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.640 
so there it is put that on the side I'm
guessing<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.630> is<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> big<00:03:09.230> word<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.530> says
