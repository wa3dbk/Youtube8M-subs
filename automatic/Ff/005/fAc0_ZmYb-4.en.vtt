00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
changed that on my other camera body and

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.720 
changed that on my other camera body and
then<00:00:26.349> I<00:00:26.380> also<00:00:26.529> did<00:00:26.800> it<00:00:26.830> on<00:00:27.010> this<00:00:27.189> camera<00:00:27.429> body

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
then I also did it on this camera body

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.200 
then I also did it on this camera body
too

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
too

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.609

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
the other camera body that's because

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.259 
the other camera body that's because
that<00:00:40.780> other<00:00:40.930> camera<00:00:41.379> body<00:00:41.589> was<00:00:41.890> used<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.670> I

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
that other camera body was used and I

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.840 
that other camera body was used and I
bought<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:43.900> used<00:00:44.080> from<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.379> guy<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:44.769> it<00:00:45.699> looks

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
bought it used from a guy and it looks

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.700 
bought it used from a guy and it looks
like<00:00:45.909> he<00:00:46.210> had<00:00:46.299> applied<00:00:46.570> superglue<00:00:47.379> and<00:00:47.650> a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
like he had applied superglue and a

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.369 
like he had applied superglue and a
bunch<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.010> crap<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.640> was<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:49.629> other<00:00:49.780> the

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
bunch of crap so it was the other the

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.700 
bunch of crap so it was the other the
other<00:00:50.500> body<00:00:50.769> took<00:00:51.100> me<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.780> 20<00:00:53.140> minutes<00:00:53.500> to

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
other body took me like 20 minutes to

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.369 
other body took me like 20 minutes to
clean<00:00:54.040> all<00:00:54.250> that<00:00:54.519> off<00:00:54.699> and<00:00:55.000> get<00:00:55.119> it<00:00:55.239> all<00:00:55.390> nice

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
clean all that off and get it all nice

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.799 
clean all that off and get it all nice
and<00:00:56.440> smooth<00:00:56.769> this<00:00:56.979> one<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:58.390> bought<00:00:58.540> this<00:00:58.659> one

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
and smooth this one my bought this one

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.450 
and smooth this one my bought this one
brand-new<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.439> so<00:00:59.860> I<00:00:59.890> never<00:01:00.159> applied

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
brand-new and so I never applied

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.009 
brand-new and so I never applied
superglue<00:01:00.939> to<00:01:01.059> this<00:01:01.180> I<00:01:01.390> just<00:01:01.570> taped<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:01.930> up

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
superglue to this I just taped it up

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.570 
superglue to this I just taped it up
when<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.350> started<00:01:02.619> coming<00:01:02.799> off<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:03.189> put<00:01:03.339> a<00:01:03.430> piece

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
when it started coming off I put a piece

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.330 
when it started coming off I put a piece
of<00:01:03.610> tape<00:01:03.850> over<00:01:03.970> this<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.420> this<00:01:05.199> one<00:01:05.439> basically

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
of tape over this and this one basically

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.030 
of tape over this and this one basically
just<00:01:06.549> pulled<00:01:06.820> right<00:01:06.909> off<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.570> hand<00:01:08.040> there

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
just pulled right off the hand there

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.249 
just pulled right off the hand there
wasn't<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.400> lot<00:01:09.549> of<00:01:09.670> glue<00:01:10.330> or<00:01:10.479> residue<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:11.020> it

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
wasn't a lot of glue or residue so it

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.859 
wasn't a lot of glue or residue so it
took<00:01:11.500> me<00:01:11.619> like<00:01:11.789> three<00:01:12.789> minutes<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.570> replace

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
took me like three minutes to replace

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.929 
took me like three minutes to replace
this<00:01:14.109> and<00:01:14.829> it's<00:01:14.979> a<00:01:15.039> five-dollar<00:01:15.429> part<00:01:15.700> so

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
this and it's a five-dollar part so

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.179 
this and it's a five-dollar part so
don't<00:01:16.149> super<00:01:17.109> but<00:01:17.289> again<00:01:17.710> I'll<00:01:17.890> say<00:01:18.009> that

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
don't super but again I'll say that

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.630 
don't super but again I'll say that
again<00:01:18.280> don't<00:01:18.549> super<00:01:18.909> fit<00:01:19.090> just<00:01:19.210> by<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.539> part

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
again don't super fit just by the part

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.340 
again don't super fit just by the part
um<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.200> now<00:01:23.439> working<00:01:24.159> back<00:01:24.429> on<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.960> front

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
um so now working back on this front

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.160 
um so now working back on this front
piece<00:01:26.649> here<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.820> was<00:01:34.119> I<00:01:34.570> thought<00:01:34.929> it<00:01:35.079> was

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
piece here and it was I thought it was

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.639 
piece here and it was I thought it was
going<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.499> be<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.810> difficult<00:01:38.020> when<00:01:38.350> I<00:01:38.409> first

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
going to be more difficult when I first

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.889 
going to be more difficult when I first
pulled<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:38.920> off<00:01:39.039> last<00:01:39.520> night<00:01:39.819> I<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:40.630> kind<00:01:40.780> of

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
pulled it off last night I just kind of

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.469 
pulled it off last night I just kind of
pulled<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.289> off<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.619> see<00:01:42.149> how<00:01:43.149> bad<00:01:43.329> it<00:01:43.359> was

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
pulled it off to see how bad it was

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.239 
pulled it off to see how bad it was
going<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.689> be<00:01:43.780> most<00:01:44.079> most<00:01:44.289> glue<00:01:44.499> came<00:01:44.679> off<00:01:44.859> at

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
going to be most most glue came off at

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:46.770 
going to be most most glue came off at
first<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.609> thought<00:01:45.729> all<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:45.939> white<00:01:46.179> stuff<00:01:46.539> in

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
first I thought all this white stuff in

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.989 
first I thought all this white stuff in
here<00:01:46.899> was<00:01:47.020> glue<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.530> it's<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.700> color<00:01:48.909> of

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
here was glue but it's just the color of

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.779 
here was glue but it's just the color of
the<00:01:49.240> body<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.799> didn't<00:01:51.069> get<00:01:51.159> sprayed<00:01:51.609> with

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
the body that didn't get sprayed with

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.410 
the body that didn't get sprayed with
paint<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:52.299> you<00:01:52.389> can<00:01:52.479> see<00:01:52.719> that<00:01:52.899> there's<00:01:53.319> a

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
paint so you can see that there's a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.639 
paint so you can see that there's a
where<00:01:55.420> they<00:01:55.539> sprayed<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.899> body<00:01:56.200> they<00:01:56.619> just

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
where they sprayed the body they just

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.940 
where they sprayed the body they just
overspray<00:01:57.429> so<00:01:58.299> there's<00:01:58.689> a<00:01:58.810> few<00:01:59.350> little<00:01:59.530> areas

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
overspray so there's a few little areas

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.120 
overspray so there's a few little areas
in<00:02:00.100> here<00:02:00.219> that<00:02:00.369> I<00:02:00.429> had<00:02:00.549> to<00:02:00.639> use<00:02:00.729> tweezers<00:02:05.130> back

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
in here that I had to use tweezers back

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.590 
in here that I had to use tweezers back
up<00:02:06.459> in<00:02:06.759> there<00:02:07.329> I<00:02:07.569> had<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.470> use<00:02:08.560> some<00:02:08.740> tweezers

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
up in there I had to use some tweezers

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.390 
up in there I had to use some tweezers
to<00:02:10.600> get<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.810> glue<00:02:11.050> out

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.170 

and<00:02:16.830> up<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:18.040> there<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.460> had<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.820> use<00:02:18.940> some

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
and up in there I had to use some

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.800 
and up in there I had to use some
tweezers<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:21.520> Michigan<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.330> little<00:02:22.600> blue

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
tweezers so just Michigan a little blue

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.290 
tweezers so just Michigan a little blue
residue<00:02:23.260> out<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:25.080> once<00:02:26.080> again<00:02:26.380> using<00:02:27.300> alcohol

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
residue out and once again using alcohol

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.160 
residue out and once again using alcohol
on<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.930> q-tip<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:33.130> yeah<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.570> was<00:02:34.690> fairly

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
on the q-tip so yeah so it was fairly

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.960 
on the q-tip so yeah so it was fairly
easy<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.560> clean<00:02:35.800> sizes<00:02:36.250> little<00:02:36.490> cracks<00:02:36.790> in

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
easy to clean sizes little cracks in

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.300 
easy to clean sizes little cracks in
there<00:02:37.290> it's<00:02:38.290> fairly<00:02:38.470> easy<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.830> clean<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.160> glue

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
there it's fairly easy to clean the glue

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.880 
there it's fairly easy to clean the glue
out<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.820> then<00:02:40.450> I'll<00:02:40.570> just<00:02:40.780> throw<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.200> throw

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
out and then I'll just throw the throw

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.790 
out and then I'll just throw the throw
the<00:02:42.010> new<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.280> on<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:43.410> it'll<00:02:44.410> be<00:02:44.500> good<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.650> go

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
the new one on and it'll be good to go

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.230 
the new one on and it'll be good to go
and<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:44.980> found<00:02:45.190> out<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> reason<00:02:45.580> why<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.940> one

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
and I found out the reason why this one

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.610 
and I found out the reason why this one
was<00:02:46.360> coming<00:02:46.540> off<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:47.500> because<00:02:48.000> if<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.120> can<00:02:49.240> see

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
was coming off is because if you can see

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.199 
was coming off is because if you can see
right<00:02:50.620> there<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:51.100> looks<00:02:51.130> like<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.490> got<00:02:51.640> hit<00:02:51.940> I

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
right there it looks like I got hit I

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.620 
right there it looks like I got hit I
musta<00:02:52.959> hit<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.680> something<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:55.510> it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
musta hit it on something and so it

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.530 
musta hit it on something and so it
actually<00:02:56.700> found<00:02:57.700> this<00:02:57.880> area<00:02:58.209> where<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.450> was

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
actually found this area where it was

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.000 
actually found this area where it was
peeling<00:02:58.780> right<00:02:59.050> here<00:02:59.550> it<00:03:00.550> um<00:03:01.800> it's<00:03:02.800> not

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
peeling right here it um it's not

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.920 
peeling right here it um it's not
completely<00:03:03.490> flat<00:03:03.790> there's<00:03:04.270> like<00:03:04.390> bumps<00:03:04.810> in

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
completely flat there's like bumps in

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.320 
completely flat there's like bumps in
here<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.260> can<00:03:05.380> see<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.970> that's<00:03:07.030> why<00:03:07.240> it

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
here that you can see so that's why it

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.670 
here that you can see so that's why it
started<00:03:07.690> breaking<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.110> glue<00:03:08.260> off<00:03:08.440> I'd

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
started breaking the glue off I'd

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.960 
started breaking the glue off I'd
probably<00:03:08.890> hit<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.250> pretty<00:03:09.340> good<00:03:09.490> on<00:03:09.760> something

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
probably hit it pretty good on something

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.580 
probably hit it pretty good on something
going<00:03:10.300> around<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.540> corner<00:03:10.750> when<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.260> was<00:03:11.350> on<00:03:11.470> my

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
going around a corner when it was on my

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:26.330 
going around a corner when it was on my
shoulder<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.090> um<00:03:15.240> yeah<00:03:16.530> put<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.620> new<00:03:17.709> one<00:03:17.830> on

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.920 

all<00:03:26.849> right<00:03:27.000> well<00:03:27.180> there<00:03:27.510> she<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.610> done

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
all right well there she is done

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.870 
all right well there she is done
and<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:33.780> was<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.110> little<00:03:34.470> bit<00:03:35.040> difficult<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.700> get

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
and it was a little bit difficult to get

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.370 
and it was a little bit difficult to get
on<00:03:36.349> first<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.440> all<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> backing<00:03:39.170> use<00:03:40.170> some

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
on first of all the backing use some

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.229 
on first of all the backing use some
tweezers<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:41.069> kind<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.280> pull<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.640> backing<00:03:41.880> off

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
tweezers to kind of pull the backing off

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.410 
tweezers to kind of pull the backing off
I'm<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.380> we<00:03:43.530> don't<00:03:43.709> get<00:03:43.800> any<00:03:44.040> trace<00:03:45.030> amount<00:03:45.300> of

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
I'm so we don't get any trace amount of

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.570 
I'm so we don't get any trace amount of
finger<00:03:45.810> residue<00:03:46.349> on<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.360> glue<00:03:48.360> surface<00:03:49.099> I<00:03:50.099> was

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
finger residue on the glue surface I was

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.130 
finger residue on the glue surface I was
a<00:03:50.640> little<00:03:50.880> bit<00:03:50.970> difficult<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.480> fit<00:03:51.750> up<00:03:51.870> around

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
a little bit difficult to fit up around

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.170 
a little bit difficult to fit up around
this<00:03:52.410> right<00:03:52.769> here<00:03:53.900> um<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.069> was<00:03:56.069> I<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.790> worried

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
this right here um I was I was worried

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.040 
this right here um I was I was worried
for<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.330> second<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.599> was<00:03:57.660> going<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.870> lose<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
for a second I was going to lose the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.420 
for a second I was going to lose the
whole<00:03:58.260> piece<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.920> couldn't<00:03:59.160> fit<00:03:59.340> it

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
whole piece because I couldn't fit it

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.630 
whole piece because I couldn't fit it
around<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.790> edge<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.540> down<00:04:00.660> into<00:04:00.840> here<00:04:01.640> but

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
around this edge and down into here but

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.090 
around this edge and down into here but
I<00:04:02.700> just<00:04:03.030> I<00:04:03.239> put<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:03.989> down<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.230> there<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:05.069> used

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
I just I put it down in there and I used

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.340 
I just I put it down in there and I used
my<00:04:05.310> tweezers<00:04:05.430> again<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:09.049> push<00:04:10.049> this<00:04:10.290> down

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
my tweezers again to push this down

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.890 
my tweezers again to push this down
along<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.130> here<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.549> it<00:04:11.760> actually<00:04:12.299> slid<00:04:12.780> in

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
along in here and it actually slid in

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.660 
along in here and it actually slid in
well<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.590> pushed<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.040> around<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:14.549> and

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
well and I pushed it around here and

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.020 
well and I pushed it around here and
then<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:15.450> just<00:04:15.480> went<00:04:15.750> around<00:04:15.840> all<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.260> edges

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
then I just went around all the edges

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.569 
then I just went around all the edges
and<00:04:18.030> all<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.329> areas<00:04:18.690> with<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.079> tweezer

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
and all the areas with the tweezer

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.099 
and all the areas with the tweezer
tweezer<00:04:20.579> in<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.030> sort<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.299> push<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:21.720> down<00:04:21.930> in

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
tweezer in to sort of push it down in

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.450 
tweezer in to sort of push it down in
there<00:04:22.139> make<00:04:22.440> sure<00:04:22.470> it's<00:04:22.590> seated<00:04:22.860> well<00:04:23.190> really

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
there make sure it's seated well really

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.409 
there make sure it's seated well really
well<00:04:24.110> um<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:27.450> yeah<00:04:27.630> looks<00:04:28.970> looks<00:04:29.970> good<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.330> can

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
well um so yeah looks looks good you can

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.760 
well um so yeah looks looks good you can
see<00:04:30.539> that<00:04:30.690> was<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> damaged<00:04:31.169> side<00:04:31.350> there<00:04:31.590> so

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
see that was the damaged side there so

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.440 
see that was the damaged side there so
it<00:04:31.830> was<00:04:31.919> lifting<00:04:32.280> up<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.610> lot<00:04:33.570> right<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:34.080> like

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
it was lifting up a lot right here like
