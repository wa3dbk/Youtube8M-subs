00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
what the colors are in this collection

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.080 
what the colors are in this collection
and<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.380> types<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.709> patterns<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.280> really<00:01:10.909> love

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
and the types of patterns I really love

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.999 
and the types of patterns I really love
this<00:01:11.240> one<00:01:11.479> it's<00:01:11.810> one<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.289> my<00:01:12.350> favorite<00:01:12.709> and<00:01:12.889> a

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
this one it's one of my favorite and a

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.989 
this one it's one of my favorite and a
lot<00:01:13.219> of<00:01:13.369> them<00:01:13.490> have<00:01:13.729> like<00:01:14.479> both<00:01:14.780> sides<00:01:15.999> which

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
lot of them have like both sides which

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.819 
lot of them have like both sides which
is<00:01:17.119> not<00:01:17.270> all<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:17.539> common<00:01:17.929> for<00:01:18.259> me<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:18.619> this

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
is not all that common for me so this

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.199 
is not all that common for me so this
would<00:01:19.009> be<00:01:19.039> one<00:01:19.310> where<00:01:19.490> I<00:01:19.520> would<00:01:19.700> probably<00:01:20.090> want

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:20.209 
would be one where I would probably want

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:22.510 
would be one where I would probably want
to<00:01:20.299> get<00:01:20.420> at<00:01:20.509> least<00:01:20.539> two<00:01:20.929> of<00:01:21.139> most<00:01:22.069> if<00:01:22.310> not<00:01:22.340> all

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
to get at least two of most if not all

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.519 
to get at least two of most if not all
of<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.909> patterns<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.569> then<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:24.350> this

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:24.529 
of the patterns and then so for this

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:27.639 
of the patterns and then so for this
collection<00:01:25.240> let<00:01:26.240> me<00:01:26.389> just<00:01:26.630> show<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:27.560> I'm

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
collection let me just show you what I'm

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.230 
collection let me just show you what I'm
