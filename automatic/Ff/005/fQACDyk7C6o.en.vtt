00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
know here's here's a little bit of an

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.990 
know here's here's a little bit of an
economics<00:03:39.760> very<00:03:40.150> basic<00:03:40.630> lesson<00:03:41.970> supply<00:03:42.970> and

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
economics very basic lesson supply and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.800 
economics very basic lesson supply and
demand<00:03:43.180> economics<00:03:43.690> okay<00:03:44.440> things<00:03:45.100> are<00:03:45.280> valued

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
demand economics okay things are valued

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.690 
demand economics okay things are valued
higher<00:03:46.810> obviously<00:03:47.590> when<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.950> demand<00:03:48.100> goes<00:03:48.459> up

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
higher obviously when the demand goes up

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.030 
higher obviously when the demand goes up
or<00:03:48.910> supply<00:03:49.239> goes<00:03:49.450> down<00:03:49.720> well<00:03:49.989> with<00:03:50.260> silver<00:03:50.920> in

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
or supply goes down well with silver in

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.979 
or supply goes down well with silver in
particular<00:03:51.609> we've<00:03:52.480> got<00:03:52.600> some<00:03:52.780> really

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
particular we've got some really

get<00:04:06.519> into<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.180> even<00:04:07.450> twenty<00:04:07.780> dollars

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
get into this that even twenty dollars

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.690 
get into this that even twenty dollars
an<00:04:08.200> ounce<00:04:08.320> is<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.799> place<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.070> get<00:04:09.400> in<00:04:09.549> because

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
an ounce is the place to get in because

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.660 
an ounce is the place to get in because

demand for it is going up is not only

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.830 
demand for it is going up is not only
because<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.290> its<00:04:41.470> applications<00:04:42.750> for<00:04:43.750> the

because of its applications for the
industrial<00:04:44.500> type<00:04:45.000> applications<00:04:46.000> but<00:04:46.180> also

technologically advanced the demand for

technologically advanced the demand for
this<00:04:57.550> metal<00:04:58.380> not<00:04:59.380> just<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.860> our<00:05:00.270> country<00:05:01.270> but

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
this metal not just in our country but

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.080 
this metal not just in our country but
over<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.840> world<00:05:02.020> goes<00:05:02.320> up<00:05:02.530> okay<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:03.640> there's

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
over the world goes up okay so there's

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.730 
over the world goes up okay so there's
your<00:05:04.180> demand<00:05:04.630> going<00:05:04.960> up<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:05.350> at<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.530> same

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
your demand going up and at the same

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.980 
your demand going up and at the same
time<00:05:05.800> what's<00:05:06.250> interesting<00:05:06.550> is<00:05:06.970> that<00:05:07.000> the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
time what's interesting is that the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.710 
time what's interesting is that the
supply<00:05:08.830> for<00:05:09.640> silver<00:05:10.180> is<00:05:10.390> going<00:05:10.780> down<00:05:11.160> meaning

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
supply for silver is going down meaning

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560 
supply for silver is going down meaning
the<00:05:13.720> you<00:05:14.080> oh<00:05:14.430> this<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.610> precious<00:05:15.910> because<00:05:16.210> it

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
the you oh this is precious because it

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.830 
the you oh this is precious because it
right<00:05:16.780> it<00:05:16.930> takes<00:05:17.110> effort<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.950> labor<00:05:18.570> to<00:05:19.570> mine

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
right it takes effort and labor to mine

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.420 
right it takes effort and labor to mine
it<00:05:20.080> from<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.590> earth<00:05:20.770> you<00:05:21.550> can't<00:05:21.850> just<00:05:23.190> make<00:05:24.190> it

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
it from the earth you can't just make it

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.710 
it from the earth you can't just make it
out<00:05:24.610> of<00:05:24.640> thin<00:05:24.970> air<00:05:26.910> okay<00:05:27.910> but<00:05:27.970> not<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.390> get<00:05:28.510> into

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
out of thin air okay but not to get into

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.000 
out of thin air okay but not to get into
a<00:05:28.780> spiritual<00:05:29.410> aspect<00:05:29.950> but<00:05:31.350> man<00:05:32.350> can't<00:05:32.710> make

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
a spiritual aspect but man can't make

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.380 
a spiritual aspect but man can't make
this<00:05:33.250> okay<00:05:34.180> so<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.890> will<00:05:36.070> hold<00:05:36.250> its<00:05:36.490> value<00:05:36.550> well

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
this okay so it will hold its value well

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.140 
this okay so it will hold its value well
what's<00:05:37.690> happening<00:05:38.200> is<00:05:38.320> that<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.710> supply<00:05:39.550> the

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
what's happening is that the supply the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.570 
what's happening is that the supply the
silver<00:05:40.540> mines<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:41.740> supplies<00:05:42.070> going<00:05:42.370> down

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
silver mines the supplies going down

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.510 
silver mines the supplies going down
because<00:05:43.240> this<00:05:43.540> metal<00:05:43.960> is<00:05:44.050> used<00:05:44.410> so<00:05:45.160> much<00:05:45.280> more

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
because this metal is used so much more

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.730 
because this metal is used so much more

little bit of knowledge behind this

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.380 
little bit of knowledge behind this
metal<00:05:58.900> right<00:05:59.170> now<00:05:59.790> currently<00:06:00.790> you<00:06:01.000> will<00:06:01.150> see

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
metal right now currently you will see

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.250 
metal right now currently you will see
that<00:06:01.630> even<00:06:02.320> with<00:06:02.740> supply<00:06:03.070> and<00:06:03.280> demand<00:06:03.430> in

talking about silver excuse me that

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.280 
talking about silver excuse me that
silver<00:06:08.500> has<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.680> huge<00:06:09.100> way<00:06:09.340> to<00:06:09.400> go<00:06:09.640> even<00:06:10.290> from

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
silver has a huge way to go even from

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.450 
silver has a huge way to go even from
twenty<00:06:11.620> dollars<00:06:11.860> an<00:06:12.010> ounce<00:06:12.130> that<00:06:12.250> it's

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
twenty dollars an ounce that it's

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.140 
twenty dollars an ounce that it's
currently<00:06:12.850> hovering<00:06:13.630> around<00:06:14.880> so<00:06:15.880> it's<00:06:16.000> not

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
currently hovering around so it's not

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.850
