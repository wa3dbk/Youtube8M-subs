commentary<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.099> all<00:03:23.759> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> above<00:03:24.449> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
commentary in all of the above the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.960 
commentary in all of the above the
gameplay<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.129> everything<00:03:26.609> has<00:03:26.790> to

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
gameplay you know everything has to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.259 
gameplay you know everything has to
replicate<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.720> real<00:03:27.959> life<00:03:28.290> world<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.269> that's

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
replicate the real life world and that's

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.080 
replicate the real life world and that's
why<00:03:30.509> I<00:03:30.540> think<00:03:30.689> visuals<00:03:31.500> are<00:03:31.680> as<00:03:32.009> important<00:03:32.939> as

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
why I think visuals are as important as

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.830 
why I think visuals are as important as
anything<00:03:33.900> else<00:03:34.370> now<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.549> terms<00:03:35.759> of<00:03:35.970> madden<00:03:36.449> we

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
anything else now in terms of madden we

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.409 
anything else now in terms of madden we
all<00:03:37.019> understand<00:03:37.530> magnas<00:03:38.009> not<00:03:38.220> quite<00:03:38.549> in<00:03:38.849> on

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
all understand magnas not quite in on

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.809 
all understand magnas not quite in on
the<00:03:39.659> gameplay<00:03:40.109> up<00:03:40.349> level<00:03:40.769> yet<00:03:40.949> but<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.549> expect

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
the gameplay up level yet but I expect

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.839 
the gameplay up level yet but I expect
on<00:03:42.329> this<00:03:42.540> console<00:03:43.189> you<00:03:44.189> know<00:03:44.280> we've<00:03:44.459> said<00:03:44.729> it

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
on this console you know we've said it

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.110 
on this console you know we've said it
before<00:03:44.879> you've<00:03:45.750> heard<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.109> sand<00:03:46.379> before<00:03:46.560> I

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
before you've heard of sand before I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.969 
before you've heard of sand before I
think<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.299> all<00:03:48.540> areas<00:03:49.109> of<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.349> game<00:03:49.620> should

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
think that all areas of the game should

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.920 
think that all areas of the game should
be<00:03:50.009> worked<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.609> at<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.909> same<00:03:51.150> time<00:03:51.419> with<00:03:51.720> all
