00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.889 

sure<00:00:55.510> there<00:00:55.660> are<00:00:55.780> huge<00:00:56.079> losses<00:00:56.320> here<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:58.570> I

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.500 

I<00:03:12.590> found<00:03:13.160> his<00:03:13.310> choice<00:03:13.490> of<00:03:13.610> dragoons<00:03:14.060> quite<00:03:14.300> odd

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
I found his choice of dragoons quite odd

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.960 
I found his choice of dragoons quite odd
since<00:03:14.870> light<00:03:15.319> dragoons<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.860> better<00:03:16.610> when<00:03:16.880> it

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
since light dragoons a better when it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.930 
since light dragoons a better when it
comes<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.180> stats<00:03:17.420> as<00:03:17.660> well<00:03:17.900> as<00:03:17.990> cheaper<00:03:18.380> I

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
comes to stats as well as cheaper I

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.340 
comes to stats as well as cheaper I
think<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.030> father<00:03:20.240> as<00:03:20.450> well<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.840> dragoons

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
think that father as well and dragoons

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.000 
think that father as well and dragoons
can't<00:03:21.650> even<00:03:21.830> shoot<00:03:22.630> think<00:03:23.709> then<00:03:24.709> hold<00:03:24.890> me

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
can't even shoot think then hold me

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.830 
can't even shoot think then hold me
again<00:03:25.190> sir<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:25.819> think<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.510> I'd<00:03:26.660> shoot

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
again sir but I think that I'd shoot

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.830 
again sir but I think that I'd shoot
water<00:03:27.020> in<00:03:27.200> horse<00:03:29.170> now<00:03:30.170> try<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.500> do<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> clean<00:03:30.890> up

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
water in horse now try and do a clean up

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
to the box formation which is headed to

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.070 
to the box formation which is headed to
mostly<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.790> now<00:04:22.790> he's<00:04:22.940> almost<00:04:23.120> completely<00:04:24.020> in

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
mostly to now he's almost completely in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.610 
mostly to now he's almost completely in
a<00:04:24.140> box<00:04:24.380> formation<00:04:25.300> entire<00:04:26.300> army<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:27.320> makes<00:04:27.470> it

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
a box formation entire army and makes it

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.290 
a box formation entire army and makes it
hard<00:04:28.100> for<00:04:28.160> me<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:29.410> charge<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:31.090> mean<00:04:32.090> he<00:04:32.180> has

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
hard for me to charge I mean he has

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.969 
hard for me to charge I mean he has
every<00:04:32.539> reason<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.960> go<00:04:33.110> into<00:04:33.229> boxes<00:04:33.620> but<00:04:33.770> not

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
every reason to go into boxes but not

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.180 
every reason to go into boxes but not
all<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.400> his<00:04:34.700> units<00:04:35.060> it's<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.200> bit<00:04:36.320> overkill<00:04:36.710> and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
all of his units it's a bit overkill and

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.700 
all of his units it's a bit overkill and
gives<00:04:37.490> me<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:38.060> opportunity<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.750> take

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
gives me the opportunity to take

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.120 
gives me the opportunity to take
advantage<00:04:39.740> now<00:04:41.680> I'm<00:04:42.680> pretty<00:04:42.800> sure<00:04:42.979> I'm<00:04:43.070> gonna

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
advantage now I'm pretty sure I'm gonna

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.340 
advantage now I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
move<00:04:43.280> these<00:04:43.460> guys<00:04:43.760> up<00:04:43.910> soon<00:04:44.210> yep<00:04:44.479> now

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350
