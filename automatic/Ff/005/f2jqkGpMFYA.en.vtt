how most people play because I really

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
how most people play because I really
don't<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.079> how<00:00:49.260> many<00:00:49.320> people<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.180> had

this game with them I'm almost certain

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.799 
this game with them I'm almost certain
since<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> time<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.489> game<00:00:59.699> came<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.210> not

since the time this game came out not

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.009 
since the time this game came out not
more<00:01:01.199> than<00:01:01.609> 500<00:01:02.609> people<00:01:02.940> actually<00:01:03.180> played

this game with the two players on their
32x<00:01:07.770> console<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.700> game<00:01:08.880> story<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
32x console the game story has you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
32x console the game story has you
flying<00:01:10.140> around<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.650> space<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.310> first-person

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
flying around in space in a first-person

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.960 
flying around in space in a first-person
3d<00:01:12.750> view<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> shooting<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> bunch<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.670> enemies

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
3d view and shooting a bunch of enemies

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.240 
3d view and shooting a bunch of enemies
star<00:01:15.600> fighters<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.680> controls<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.220> pretty

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
star fighters the controls are pretty

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
star fighters the controls are pretty
smooth<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.540> game<00:01:18.720> did<00:01:18.990> come<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
smooth but the game did come with the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.520 
smooth but the game did come with the
original<00:01:20.070> arcade<00:01:20.580> version<00:01:21.140> inside<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
original arcade version inside of the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.530 
original arcade version inside of the
game<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.130> basically<00:01:23.520> two<00:01:23.909> games<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.330> one

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
game so it's basically two games in one

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
game so it's basically two games in one
although<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.350> games<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.830> more<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.189> less

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
although the games are more or less

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
although the games are more or less
identical<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:27.270> did<00:01:27.570> notice<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.080> thing<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
identical I did notice one thing the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.819 
identical I did notice one thing the
arcade<00:01:29.579> version<00:01:29.610> maybe<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> just<00:01:30.960> me<00:01:31.560> not

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
arcade version maybe this is just me not

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
arcade version maybe this is just me not
having<00:01:32.070> enough<00:01:32.400> coffee<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> morning<00:01:33.270> but

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
having enough coffee in the morning but

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.230 
having enough coffee in the morning but
I<00:01:33.600> did<00:01:34.140> feel<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.799> arcade<00:01:35.070> version

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
I did feel like the arcade version

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.539 
I did feel like the arcade version
handled<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:37.049> better<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:38.040> was

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
handled a little better like it was

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
handled a little better like it was
slightly<00:01:39.060> smaller<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.920> not<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> say

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
slightly smaller and that's not to say

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.580 
slightly smaller and that's not to say
the<00:01:41.700> actual<00:01:41.939> console<00:01:42.420> version<00:01:42.810> handled

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the actual console version handled

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.399 
the actual console version handled
poorly<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.399> handles<00:01:44.850> pretty<00:01:45.060> good<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> game

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
poorly it handles pretty good for a game

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.819 
poorly it handles pretty good for a game
of<00:01:46.799> its<00:01:47.009> time<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.149> its<00:01:48.299> genre<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:49.380> still

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
of its time and of its genre but still

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.490 
of its time and of its genre but still
the<00:01:49.979> arcade<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.640> felt<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.210> bit<00:01:52.049> better

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the arcade just felt a little bit better

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.740 
the arcade just felt a little bit better
it's<00:01:53.100> barely<00:01:53.399> noticeable<00:01:53.700> though<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> aside

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it's barely noticeable though and aside

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.319 
it's barely noticeable though and aside
from<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.110> few<00:01:55.140> aesthetic<00:01:56.130> differences<00:01:56.369> the

your radar to track enemy ships you can

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.720 
your radar to track enemy ships you can
slow<00:02:15.720> down<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.020> speed<00:02:16.530> up<00:02:16.740> with<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> a<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.580> B

slow down and speed up with the a and B
buttons<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.330> shoot<00:02:18.570> with<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.230> C<00:02:19.470> button

why<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.070> you<00:02:20.250> need<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.490> slow<00:02:20.760> down<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.210> speed

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
why do you need to slow down and speed
up<00:02:21.540> well<00:02:21.900> that's<00:02:22.380> where<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> game<00:02:22.830> strategy

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
up well that's where the game strategy

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
up well that's where the game strategy
comes<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:24.030> sometimes<00:02:24.600> there<00:02:25.230> are<00:02:25.290> enemies

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
comes in sometimes there are enemies

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.290 
comes in sometimes there are enemies
behind<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.340> slow<00:02:26.670> down<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.910> little<00:02:27.120> bit

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
behind you so you slow down a little bit

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.030 
behind you so you slow down a little bit
and<00:02:27.420> let<00:02:27.570> them<00:02:27.720> pass<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.260> shoot<00:02:28.500> them<00:02:28.770> from

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and let them pass and shoot them from

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.550 
and let them pass and shoot them from
the<00:02:29.220> back<00:02:29.460> sometimes<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.200> Me's<00:02:31.350> are

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the back sometimes and the Me's are

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
the back sometimes and the Me's are
ahead<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.370> try<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.610> catch<00:02:32.880> up

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
ahead of you and you try to catch up

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.390 
ahead of you and you try to catch up
with<00:02:33.330> them<00:02:33.540> by<00:02:34.080> actually<00:02:34.530> speeding<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.100> but

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
with them by actually speeding up but

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.130 
with them by actually speeding up but
that's<00:02:35.580> more<00:02:35.850> or<00:02:35.910> less<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.150> lost<00:02:36.510> cause<00:02:36.840> because

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
that's more or less a lost cause because

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.260 
that's more or less a lost cause because
it<00:02:37.590> seems<00:02:38.100> like<00:02:38.220> most<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.520> enemy<00:02:38.820> ships<00:02:39.060> are<00:02:39.209> a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
it seems like most the enemy ships are a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.750 
it seems like most the enemy ships are a
lot<00:02:39.690> faster<00:02:40.230> than<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.220> might<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.580> able

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
lot faster than you so you might be able

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.610 
lot faster than you so you might be able
to<00:02:41.820> catch<00:02:42.030> up<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.390> little<00:02:42.750> bit<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.470> you'll

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
to catch up a little bit but you'll

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.770 
to catch up a little bit but you'll
never<00:02:43.830> really<00:02:44.130> catch<00:02:44.520> an<00:02:44.670> enemy<00:02:44.970> ship<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.450> I'm

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
never really catch an enemy ship and I'm

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.000 
never really catch an enemy ship and I'm
not<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.050> talking<00:02:46.110> about<00:02:46.290> speed<00:02:46.709> I'm<00:02:46.860> also

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
not just talking about speed I'm also

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
not just talking about speed I'm also
talking<00:02:47.250> about<00:02:47.420> maneuverability<00:02:48.420> your<00:02:48.600> ship

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
talking about maneuverability your ship

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.470 
talking about maneuverability your ship
it's<00:02:49.440> more<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.130> big<00:02:50.640> cumbersome

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
it's more like this big cumbersome

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.310 
it's more like this big cumbersome

call<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> good<00:03:08.640> game<00:03:08.910> because<00:03:09.269> honestly

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
call this a good game because honestly

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.840 
call this a good game because honestly
and<00:03:10.050> realistically<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:10.950> not<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.550> good<00:03:11.820> game

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
and realistically it's not a good game

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.380 
and realistically it's not a good game
but<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.720> definitely<00:03:12.989> better<00:03:13.650> than<00:03:13.830> okay<00:03:14.670> so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
but it's definitely better than okay so

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.900 
but it's definitely better than okay so
my<00:03:15.840> score<00:03:16.170> for<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.470> game<00:03:16.709> would<00:03:16.950> probably<00:03:17.670> be

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
my score for this game would probably be

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.690 
my score for this game would probably be
in<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.150> six<00:03:18.930> point<00:03:19.380> nine<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.920> seven<00:03:20.400> point

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
in the six point nine to seven point

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.720 
in the six point nine to seven point
three<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.480> ten<00:03:22.080> range<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.920> maybe<00:03:23.459> that's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
three out of ten range and maybe that's

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.490 
three out of ten range and maybe that's
being<00:03:23.940> a<00:03:24.060> little<00:03:24.090> too<00:03:24.450> analytical<00:03:24.870> with<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
being a little too analytical with the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.080 
being a little too analytical with the
score<00:03:25.830> but<00:03:26.010> that's<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.549> way<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.700> feel

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
score but that's just the way I feel

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.940 
score but that's just the way I feel
about<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.510> game<00:03:27.690> like<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.260> said<00:03:28.470> it's<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:28.830> of

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
about the game like I said it's one of

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.460 
about the game like I said it's one of
the<00:03:29.100> better<00:03:29.489> 32x<00:03:30.480> games<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.170> that's<00:03:31.230> not

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
the better 32x games and that's not

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.320 
the better 32x games and that's not
saying<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.980> lot<00:03:32.160> because<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.730> think<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.299> are

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
saying a lot because I think there are

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.220 
saying a lot because I think there are
just<00:03:33.780> under<00:03:34.230> 40<00:03:34.920> 32x<00:03:35.790> games<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.720> lot<00:03:37.200> of

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
just under 40 32x games and a lot of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.229 
just under 40 32x games and a lot of
them<00:03:37.530> simply<00:03:37.830> weren't<00:03:38.340> good<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.820> those<00:03:39.030> that

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
them simply weren't good and those that

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.820 
them simply weren't good and those that
could<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.660> been<00:03:39.840> good<00:03:40.049> didn't<00:03:40.410> work<00:03:40.799> very

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
could have been good didn't work very

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.420 
could have been good didn't work very
well

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
well

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.970 
well
because<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> 32x<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:42.989> wasn't<00:03:43.380> just<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
because the 32x you see wasn't just the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.180 
because the 32x you see wasn't just the
console<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.970> was<00:03:45.090> an<00:03:45.209> add-on<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:46.170> an<00:03:46.410> older

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
console it was an add-on to an older

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.789 
console it was an add-on to an older
generation<00:03:47.660> console<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:49.019> basically<00:03:49.500> have

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
generation console you basically have

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.890 
generation console you basically have
this<00:03:49.980> big<00:03:50.459> thing<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.239> just<00:03:51.299> stick<00:03:51.720> it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
this big thing and you just stick it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.750 
this big thing and you just stick it
into<00:03:52.019> your<00:03:52.230> Sega<00:03:52.560> Genesis<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.640> now

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
into your Sega Genesis and and now

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.570 
into your Sega Genesis and and now
you're<00:03:53.970> able<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.269> play<00:03:54.600> these<00:03:54.870> 32x<00:03:55.830> games<00:03:56.010> I

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
you're able to play these 32x games I

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.979 
you're able to play these 32x games I
think<00:03:56.940> that's<00:03:57.239> actually<00:03:57.420> one<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> reasons

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
think that's actually one of the reasons

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.220 
think that's actually one of the reasons
the<00:03:58.380> 32x<00:03:59.100> failed<00:03:59.940> well<00:04:00.600> there's<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.170> many

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
the 32x failed well there's so many

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.560 
the 32x failed well there's so many
reasons<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:02.010> mean<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.400> could<00:04:02.970> go<00:04:03.120> off<00:04:03.299> on<00:04:03.540> a

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
reasons I mean I could go off on a

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.560 
reasons I mean I could go off on a
separate<00:04:04.230> video<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.650> its<00:04:05.010> own<00:04:05.250> but<00:04:06.000> one<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.390> the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
separate video on its own but one of the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.240 
separate video on its own but one of the
reasons<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:07.110> simply<00:04:07.530> because<00:04:07.860> there<00:04:08.040> weren't

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
reasons is simply because there weren't

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.009 
reasons is simply because there weren't
a<00:04:08.310> lot<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.459> games<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:08.820> again<00:04:09.209> that's<00:04:09.600> just<00:04:09.840> a

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
a lot of games but again that's just a

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.259 
a lot of games but again that's just a
reaction<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.250> fact<00:04:11.549> that<00:04:11.700> there<00:04:12.090> weren't

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
reaction to the fact that there weren't

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.819 
reaction to the fact that there weren't
a<00:04:12.389> lot<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.570> games<00:04:12.840> because<00:04:13.109> people<00:04:13.650> weren't

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
a lot of games because people weren't

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.920 
a lot of games because people weren't
buying<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.250> console<00:04:14.760> developers<00:04:15.630> didn't

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
buying the console developers didn't

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.849 
buying the console developers didn't
want<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.230> put

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
want to put

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.710 
want to put
time<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.400> effort<00:04:17.669> into<00:04:17.759> making<00:04:17.849> games<00:04:18.509> for

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
time and effort into making games for

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.809 
time and effort into making games for
the<00:04:19.019> console<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.039> also<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.370> believe<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:20.819 
the console and also I believe the

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.450 
the console and also I believe the
actual<00:04:21.209> console<00:04:21.870> console<00:04:22.439> in<00:04:22.710> like<00:04:22.979> four

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
feel like even the developers didn't

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.080
