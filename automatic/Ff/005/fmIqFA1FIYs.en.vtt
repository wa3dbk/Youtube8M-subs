brought to you by mercury so one of the
hottest<00:00:26.970> tactics<00:00:27.599> has<00:00:27.779> come<00:00:27.990> on<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.230> wall<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
hottest tactics has come on the wall I

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.260 
hottest tactics has come on the wall I
see<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> last<00:00:29.130> couple<00:00:29.490> years<00:00:29.520> of<00:00:29.790> slow

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
see in the last couple years of slow

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.450 
see in the last couple years of slow
death<00:00:30.570> basically<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.739> take<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:31.980> weighting

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
death basically you take a weighting

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
death basically you take a weighting
system<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> bottom<00:00:33.630> bouncer<00:00:34.079> run<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
system like a bottom bouncer run about a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.310 
system like a bottom bouncer run about a
4-foot<00:00:35.430> liter<00:00:35.670> behind<00:00:36.060> it<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:36.989> put<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
4-foot liter behind it and then put on a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
4-foot liter behind it and then put on a
slow<00:00:37.680> death<00:00:37.920> hook<00:00:38.250> now<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.120> hook<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
slow death hook now this hook is kind of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
slow death hook now this hook is kind of
a<00:00:40.290> funky<00:00:40.680> shaped<00:00:40.980> hook<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> big<00:00:42.390> old

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
a funky shaped hook it's got a big old

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.930 
a funky shaped hook it's got a big old
bend<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.489> hook<00:00:44.670> does

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
bend to it like that what that hook does

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.820 
bend to it like that what that hook does
is<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.480> imparts<00:00:46.110> an<00:00:46.260> action<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
is actually imparts an action on a

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.250 
is actually imparts an action on a
crawler<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.460> spinning<00:00:47.970> action<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.930> entices

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
crawler a spinning action that entices

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.470 
crawler a spinning action that entices
the<00:00:49.590> fish<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> bite<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:50.880> there<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.150> times

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the fish to bite now there are times

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.210 
the fish to bite now there are times
though<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.020> maybe<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.380> can't<00:00:52.650> find<00:00:52.740> real

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
though that maybe you can't find real

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.920 
though that maybe you can't find real
night<00:00:53.430> crawlers<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:54.720> situations

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
night crawlers or there's situations

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.570 
night crawlers or there's situations
where<00:00:55.470> you<00:00:55.560> don't<00:00:55.710> want<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> use<00:00:56.160> real<00:00:56.370> night

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
where you don't want to use real night

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.610 
where you don't want to use real night
crawlers<00:00:57.050> instances<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:58.380> there's<00:00:58.560> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
crawlers instances like when there's a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
crawlers instances like when there's a
lot<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.950> pesky<00:00:59.670> fish<00:00:59.910> around<00:01:00.180> pecking<00:01:00.630> at<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
lot of pesky fish around pecking at the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.870 
lot of pesky fish around pecking at the
crawler<00:01:01.140> or<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:02.070> fish<00:01:02.220> are<00:01:02.400> very<00:01:02.610> aggressive

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
crawler or the fish are very aggressive

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.369 
crawler or the fish are very aggressive
and<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.300> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> quickly<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:04.019> your<00:01:04.199> bait

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and you want to quickly get your bait

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.499 
and you want to quickly get your bait
down<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> water<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.610> those<00:01:05.820> cases<00:01:06.360> what

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
down in the water in those cases what

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.270 
down in the water in those cases what
you<00:01:06.630> should<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.110> using<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.590> artificial

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you should look at using this artificial

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
you should look at using this artificial
baits<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.750> can't<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.259> use<00:01:10.380> any<00:01:10.650> one

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
baits now you can't just use any one

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.140 
baits now you can't just use any one
because<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> still<00:01:11.579> got<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
because you still got to have that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
because you still got to have that

that it's a very limber tail and you
need<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.750> nice<00:01:24.960> flipping

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
need that to get that nice flipping

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
need that to get that nice flipping
action<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.190> back<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.760> when<00:01:27.540> you're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
action on the back of this when you're

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.030 
action on the back of this when you're
stringing<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.380> you're<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> string

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
stringing this up you're going to string

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.190 
stringing this up you're going to string
it<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.580> always<00:01:29.909> right<00:01:30.840> through<00:01:31.080> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it up just like always right through the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.010 
it up just like always right through the
nose<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> fry<00:01:32.270> string<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.750> far

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
nose of the fry string it on just far

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.149 
nose of the fry string it on just far
enough<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.830> go<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
enough so that you can go over the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
enough so that you can go over the
eyelet<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.030> you'll<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.290> hook

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
eyelet and you'll see that that hook

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.010 
eyelet and you'll see that that hook
still<00:01:37.860> puts<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.370> bend<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:39.120> that<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.900> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
still puts that bend in that in that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.990 
still puts that bend in that in that
little<00:01:40.320> gulp<00:01:40.680> fry<00:01:41.010> and<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:41.670> what's<00:01:41.850> going

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
little gulp fry and that's what's going

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.399 
little gulp fry and that's what's going
to<00:01:42.060> give<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.420> spin<00:01:42.750> under<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.080> water

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to give you that spin under the water

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.500 
to give you that spin under the water
yet<00:01:43.950> you've<00:01:44.070> got<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.220> nice<00:01:44.460> flexible<00:01:45.000> tail<00:01:45.270> back

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
yet you've got a nice flexible tail back

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.450 
yet you've got a nice flexible tail back
here<00:01:45.960> it'll<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.409> flipping<00:01:46.830> in<00:01:46.979> behind<00:01:47.280> this

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
here it'll be flipping in behind this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.580 
here it'll be flipping in behind this
still<00:01:48.240> want<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.510> pinch<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> off<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.440> only

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
still want to pinch it off so that only

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
still want to pinch it off so that only

about a 1/2 or 3/4 of an inch is back

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.630 
about a 1/2 or 3/4 of an inch is back
there<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.430> good

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

that<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> look<00:01:57.360> at<00:01:57.510> using<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.530> actually

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
that I like to look at using is actually

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.880 
that I like to look at using is actually
in<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.100> gulp<00:01:59.310> Alive<00:02:00.320> series<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.530> called<00:02:01.770> a

in the gulp Alive series it's called a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.830 
in the gulp Alive series it's called a
sand<00:02:02.220> worm<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.909> sand<00:02:03.180> worm<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.479> kind<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
sand worm the sand worm is kind of a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560 
sand worm the sand worm is kind of a
cool-looking<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.680> deal<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.090> real

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
cool-looking little deal it's a real

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.490 
cool-looking little deal it's a real
limber<00:02:07.049> tail<00:02:07.500> again<00:02:07.950> let<00:02:08.399> me<00:02:08.489> set<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.849> down

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500
