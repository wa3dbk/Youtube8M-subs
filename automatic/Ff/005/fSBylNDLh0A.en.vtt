00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 well we are building here a 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:12.130
 a sawdust burner as you can see 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:17.619
 has an entry below 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:20.320
 this is going to be air intake and a 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.340
 entrance here above with two tubes of 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.340
 approximately 3 inches 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 this means has to fall 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.080
 they were going to be found then let's go 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.080
 to fill it up 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.930
 that sawdust that should be dry hopefully 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.550
 be dry, let's fill with sawdust 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.550
 while we hold the tube 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.360
 l 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.100
 I'm going to let you go face is holding 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.910
 so you can flip the bag if at 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.910
 reverse 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.910
 active 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.799
 here the only problem would be that the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.640
 series is not wet because it was 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.640
 raining a little bit 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.630
 around 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.990
 now let's plant how well who has 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.490
 borrowed these states well 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.490
 compact how well compacted 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.520
 there they are going to apologize that I get out of 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.700
 suddenly of focus but good is part 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.140
 of is part of the problem live that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.259
 sometimes the camera moves and there's 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.259
 way 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.409
 being first of all up 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.950
 compactors and even with and chemical 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.710
 open well compacted just like that with the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.660
 fist what happens is that the ornaments the 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.240
 adobes and the block are not attached 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.670
 So if we put strength in 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.590
 they are going to open out but as 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.269
 want to allow true 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.269
 some compaction by hand 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.120
 but 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.870
 to see if the wall does not fall how is 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.510
 dry and it's not well compacted having 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.519
 remove that as first dance 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.519
 but if it does not fall on the little gem 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.170
 Slowly pull it out 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.170
 and if it's going to fall 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.390
 if it's going to fall 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:07.380
 You do not have to be well compacted because 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.380
 so we can sugar 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160
 above 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.440
 up to see if I do not know there's everything 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.300
 okay 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.870
 good if you notice there is a 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.450
 communication 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.799
 from this hole with the other one of such 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.170
 way 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.250
 this is an air intake 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.980
 this mere air meeting can not be seen because 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.730
 also dark but right now good 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.780
 this is the part of the first 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.780
 end of the first part
