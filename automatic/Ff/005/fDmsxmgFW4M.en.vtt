you're changing the aperture how big the
viewfinder<00:00:46.910> is<00:00:46.940> well<00:00:47.810> so<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:48.170> got<00:00:48.320> well<00:00:48.530> it's

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
viewfinder is well so it got well it's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.530 
viewfinder is well so it got well it's
got<00:00:48.860> lots<00:00:49.220> of<00:00:49.400> different<00:00:49.760> team<00:00:49.940> modes<00:00:50.210> if<00:00:50.450> I

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540
