not<00:02:19.510> be<00:02:19.540> not<00:02:20.500> be<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.890> tough<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:21.340> feel<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
not be not be that tough I just feel the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.910 
not be not be that tough I just feel the
need<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:22.060> show<00:02:22.209> everybody<00:02:22.390> they're<00:02:22.660> tough

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
need to show everybody they're tough

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.290 
need to show everybody they're tough
anyway<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> think<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.610> one's<00:02:25.819> probably<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
anyway I think this one's probably the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.280 
anyway I think this one's probably the
same<00:02:26.540> way<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:28.310> just<00:02:29.030> all<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:29.360> general

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
same way and just all this general

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.540 
same way and just all this general
handling<00:02:30.620> we're<00:02:30.709> going<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.890> do<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.190> how<00:02:31.280> we<00:02:31.340> do

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
handling we're going to do and how we do

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.000 
handling we're going to do and how we do
it<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:31.790> probably<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.800> change<00:02:33.800> all

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
it it's probably going to change all

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.559 
it it's probably going to change all
that<00:02:34.129> but<00:02:34.250> anyway<00:02:34.459> right<00:02:34.700> here<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.090> I<00:02:35.120> haven't

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.479 
that but anyway right here so I haven't

on your horse it's not about just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.759 
on your horse it's not about just
micromanaging<00:03:11.180> them<00:03:11.299> micromanaging<00:03:12.260> horses

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
micromanaging them micromanaging horses

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.410 
micromanaging them micromanaging horses
