possible and there's a few reasons for

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.230 
possible and there's a few reasons for
that

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
that
one<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.200> if<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.590> writing<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.920> very

word<00:01:27.869> limit<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> person's<00:01:29.009> essay

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

word limit I think this person's essay
was<00:01:29.460> maybe<00:01:30.020> 253<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.170> 254<00:01:31.890> words<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.270> number

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
was maybe 253 or 254 words so the number

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.469 
was maybe 253 or 254 words so the number
of<00:01:33.540> words<00:01:33.720> was<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.439> pretty<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.390> okay<00:01:36.390> now

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
of words was was pretty good okay now

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.210 
of words was was pretty good okay now
let's<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.890> problems

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
let's go over some of the the problems

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.780 
let's go over some of the the problems
so<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.640> first<00:01:41.850> big<00:01:42.060> problem<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.079> thesis

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
so the first big problem was the thesis

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
so the first big problem was the thesis
so<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.540> black<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.140> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.610 
effect on society is asking about the
trend<00:02:11.849> of

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
trend of

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.170 
trend of
old<00:02:13.769> people<00:02:14.720> old<00:02:15.720> person<00:02:16.140> numbers<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.489> society

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
old people old person numbers in society

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.030 
old people old person numbers in society
growing<00:02:18.599> does<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> negative<00:02:19.560> effect

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
growing does this have a negative effect

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.869 
growing does this have a negative effect
or<00:02:20.190> not<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.159> student<00:02:23.430> unfortunately

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
or not so so the student unfortunately

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.369 
or not so so the student unfortunately
made<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.090> mistake<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.599> saying<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.049> you<00:02:25.290> know

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
made the mistake of saying that you know

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.449 
made the mistake of saying that you know
it's<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.650> talking<00:02:26.159> about<00:02:26.220> old<00:02:26.340> people

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
it's just talking about old people

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.979 
it's just talking about old people
that's<00:02:27.060> not<00:02:27.209> entirely<00:02:27.450> true

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
that's not entirely true

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.440 
that's not entirely true
so<00:02:28.769> what<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.099> write<00:02:29.250> here<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> thesis<00:02:30.150> does

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
so what I write here is this thesis does

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.110 
so what I write here is this thesis does
not<00:02:30.659> answer<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.470> essay<00:02:31.920> question<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.879> essay

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
not answer the essay question the essay

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.940 
not answer the essay question the essay
question<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.510> asking<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.079> comment<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.799> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
question is asking you to comment on the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.970

rise<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.849> aged<00:02:36.420> people<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.500> aged<00:02:37.769> people

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
rise of aged people not on aged people

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.490 
rise of aged people not on aged people
themselves<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.329> thesis<00:02:39.510> should<00:02:39.959> be

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
themselves so the thesis should be

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.569 
themselves so the thesis should be
it<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.640> believed<00:02:43.099> sorry<00:02:44.099> I'll<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.280> put<00:02:44.519> it

it is believed sorry I'll just put it

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:45.920 
it is believed sorry I'll just put it

the increase of aged people in many
countries<00:02:50.069> has<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.640> negative<00:02:50.940> effect<00:02:51.209> on

we're<00:02:55.079> pinpointing<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.829> idea<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.340> trend<00:02:56.849> that

we're pinpointing the idea of trend that

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.020 
we're pinpointing the idea of trend that
this<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.200> growing<00:02:58.680> thing<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.159> that<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.730> that

this is a growing thing and that in that

this is a growing thing and that in that
in<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.569> students<00:03:00.959> opinion<00:03:01.409> that<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.310> growth

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
in the students opinion that the growth

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.309 
in the students opinion that the growth

of old people in society is negative
okay<00:03:07.319> I'll<00:03:07.829> take<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.069> moment<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:09.390> talk

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
okay I'll take a moment just to to talk

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.130 
okay I'll take a moment just to to talk
about<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:10.019> thing<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:11.510> sometimes<00:03:12.510> when<00:03:13.019> you're

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
about one thing so sometimes when you're

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.659 
about one thing so sometimes when you're
writing<00:03:13.349> an<00:03:13.769> essay<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.340> don't<00:03:17.519> have<00:03:17.639> a

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
writing an essay and you don't have a

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.920 
writing an essay and you don't have a
lot<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.940> time<00:03:18.919> it's<00:03:19.919> sometimes<00:03:20.790> best<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.599> try

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
lot of time it's sometimes best to try

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.440 
lot of time it's sometimes best to try
and<00:03:22.230> think<00:03:22.680> about<00:03:22.889> what<00:03:23.340> what<00:03:23.609> what<00:03:24.150> essay

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
and think about what what what essay

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.740 
and think about what what what essay
would<00:03:24.720> be<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.019> easiest<00:03:25.530> essay<00:03:26.099> to<00:03:26.160> write<00:03:26.750> what

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
would be the easiest essay to write what

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.569 
would be the easiest essay to write what
point<00:03:28.139> of<00:03:28.230> view<00:03:28.410> would<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.829> easiest<00:03:29.250> point

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
point of view would be the easiest point

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.610 
point of view would be the easiest point
of<00:03:29.669> view<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:30.090> prove<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:33.180> think<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.959> my

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
of view to prove and I think in my

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.800 
of view to prove and I think in my
opinion<00:03:34.769> perhaps<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.730> disagree<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.359> me<00:03:36.510> but

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
opinion perhaps you disagree with me but

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.890 
opinion perhaps you disagree with me but
I<00:03:36.930> think<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:38.040> opposite<00:03:38.790> would<00:03:39.239> be<00:03:39.299> an<00:03:39.510> easier

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
I think the opposite would be an easier

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.860 
I think the opposite would be an easier
essay<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.260> write<00:03:40.530> because<00:03:41.160> here<00:03:41.609> were<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.720> have

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
essay to write because here were we have

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.140 
essay to write because here were we have
to<00:03:42.989> argue<00:03:43.169> that<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.859> know<00:03:43.980> old<00:03:44.340> people<00:03:44.459> and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
to argue that you know old people and

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.720 
to argue that you know old people and
their<00:03:45.660> growing<00:03:46.079> numbers<00:03:46.470> has<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.129> negative

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
their growing numbers has a negative

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.939 
their growing numbers has a negative
effect<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.180> society<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:52.680> think<00:03:52.829> that

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
effect on society and I just think that

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.009 
effect on society and I just think that
it<00:03:53.129> would<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.340> easier<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.790> write<00:03:54.419> that<00:03:54.599> the

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
it would be easier to write that the

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.879 
it would be easier to write that the
growth<00:03:55.319> of<00:03:55.349> old<00:03:55.680> people<00:03:56.329> maybe<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:58.650> does

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
growth of old people maybe is it does

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.500 
growth of old people maybe is it does
provide<00:03:59.190> society<00:03:59.669> with<00:03:59.819> some<00:04:00.000> positive

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
provide society with some positive

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.509 
provide society with some positive
things<00:04:02.269> maybe<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.810> mean<00:04:04.169> I<00:04:04.500> suppose<00:04:04.709> either<00:04:05.160> you

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
things maybe I mean I suppose either you

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.400 
things maybe I mean I suppose either you
could<00:04:05.669> write<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:05.910> either<00:04:06.299> is<00:04:06.540> fine<00:04:06.780> but<00:04:07.019> in<00:04:07.260> my

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
could write on either is fine but in my

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.539 
could write on either is fine but in my
opinion<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.799> think<00:04:07.829> that<00:04:08.099> it<00:04:08.220> would<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.430> be

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
opinion I think that it would just be

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.220 
opinion I think that it would just be
easier<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.120> write<00:04:09.299> about<00:04:09.449> the<00:04:09.720> positive

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
easier to write about the positive

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.839 
easier to write about the positive
effects<00:04:10.949> that<00:04:11.129> old<00:04:11.250> people<00:04:11.400> have<00:04:11.609> on<00:04:11.730> society

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
effects that old people have on society

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.610 
effects that old people have on society
anyways<00:04:12.629> it<00:04:12.750> doesn't<00:04:12.989> matter<00:04:13.109> because<00:04:13.470> the

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
anyways it doesn't matter because the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.890 
anyways it doesn't matter because the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
the supporting paragraphs because when I

they're talking about so my comment to
them<00:05:16.350> was<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.830> think<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.910> understand<00:05:18.419> your<00:05:18.510> two

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
them was I think I understand your two

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.150 
them was I think I understand your two
points<00:05:19.020> but<00:05:19.169> they're<00:05:19.320> not<00:05:19.440> very<00:05:19.500> clear<00:05:19.980> I

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
points but they're not very clear I

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.640 
points but they're not very clear I
think<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:20.970> mean<00:05:21.210> number<00:05:21.870> one<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.500> old

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
think you mean number one that old

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.680 
think you mean number one that old
people<00:05:23.010> have<00:05:23.220> a<00:05:23.400> negative<00:05:23.850> effect<00:05:24.390> on<00:05:24.480> society

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
people have a negative effect on society

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.290 
people have a negative effect on society
because<00:05:25.380> they<00:05:25.560> spend<00:05:25.950> money<00:05:26.400> in<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.820> wasteful

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
because they spend money in a wasteful

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.030 
because they spend money in a wasteful
manner<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:31.770> idea<00:05:32.150> being<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.270> old<00:05:33.540> people

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
manner so the idea being that old people

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.940 
manner so the idea being that old people
use<00:05:35.040> their<00:05:35.340> money<00:05:35.870> in<00:05:36.950> ways<00:05:37.950> that<00:05:38.340> are<00:05:38.610> not

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
use their money in ways that are not

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.080 
use their money in ways that are not
very<00:05:40.950> useful<00:05:41.450> and<00:05:43.310> then<00:05:44.310> the<00:05:44.430> second<00:05:44.850> idea

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
very useful and then the second idea

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.820 
very useful and then the second idea
that<00:05:45.510> I<00:05:45.600> think<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.080> student<00:05:46.410> is<00:05:46.500> trying<00:05:46.650> to

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
that I think the student is trying to

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.590 
that I think the student is trying to
say<00:05:47.010> is<00:05:47.040> that<00:05:47.400> old<00:05:47.970> people<00:05:48.240> have<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.419> negative

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
say is that old people have a negative

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.840 
say is that old people have a negative
effect<00:05:48.990> on<00:05:49.080> society<00:05:49.290> because<00:05:50.100> they<00:05:50.310> cost<00:05:50.550> a

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
effect on society because they cost a

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.950 
effect on society because they cost a
country's<00:05:51.240> government<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:52.020> lot<00:05:52.320> of<00:05:52.470> money<00:05:53.960> back

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
country's government a lot of money back

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.690 
country's government a lot of money back
to<00:05:55.140> the<00:05:55.229> outline<00:05:55.350> sense<00:05:55.680> they're<00:05:56.070> more<00:05:56.460> likely

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
to the outline sense they're more likely

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.110 
to the outline sense they're more likely
to<00:05:56.880> be<00:05:57.510> providing<00:05:58.580> unpaid<00:05:59.580> care<00:06:01.250> and<00:06:02.250> now<00:06:02.880> when

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
to be providing unpaid care and now when

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.580 
to be providing unpaid care and now when
this<00:06:03.270> when<00:06:03.600> it's<00:06:03.690> worded<00:06:03.930> this<00:06:04.020> way<00:06:04.229> it<00:06:04.350> sounds

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
this when it's worded this way it sounds

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.610 
this when it's worded this way it sounds
like<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.800> old<00:06:05.010> people<00:06:05.310> are<00:06:06.410> providing<00:06:07.410> are

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
like the old people are providing are

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.240 
like the old people are providing are
giving<00:06:08.130> someone<00:06:08.370> unpaid<00:06:09.090> care<00:06:09.419> I<00:06:10.040> don't<00:06:11.040> think

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
giving someone unpaid care I don't think

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.120 
giving someone unpaid care I don't think
the<00:06:11.310> old<00:06:11.400> people<00:06:11.669> are<00:06:11.760> giving<00:06:12.180> people<00:06:13.130> care

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
the old people are giving people care

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.520 
the old people are giving people care
whether<00:06:14.520> paid<00:06:14.820> or<00:06:15.090> unpaid<00:06:15.290> but<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.410> old

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
whether paid or unpaid but the old

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.500 
whether paid or unpaid but the old
people<00:06:16.800> are<00:06:16.890> ones<00:06:17.040> receiving<00:06:17.430> care<00:06:17.790> so<00:06:18.479> I

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
people are ones receiving care so I

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.150 
people are ones receiving care so I
think<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.990> meaning<00:06:19.200> is<00:06:19.380> also<00:06:19.710> a<00:06:19.740> little<00:06:19.979> bit

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
think the meaning is also a little bit

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.020 
think the meaning is also a little bit
messed<00:06:20.669> up<00:06:22.250> anyways<00:06:23.250> I<00:06:23.490> think<00:06:23.610> that's<00:06:23.880> what

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
messed up anyways I think that's what

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.450 
messed up anyways I think that's what
offended<00:06:24.210> number<00:06:24.419> two<00:06:25.250> unfortunately<00:06:26.250> your

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.870

them in this way you should write them
very<00:06:32.280> clearly<00:06:32.669> like<00:06:33.300> this<00:06:33.539> so

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
very clearly like this so

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.450 
very clearly like this so
I've<00:06:34.380> rewritten<00:06:34.890> the<00:06:36.020> outline<00:06:37.020> sentence<00:06:37.530> now

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
I've rewritten the outline sentence now

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.480 
I've rewritten the outline sentence now
I<00:06:38.490> just<00:06:38.850> used<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.590> the<00:06:40.590> two<00:06:40.830> ideas<00:06:41.220> that<00:06:41.250> I

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
I just used the the two ideas that I

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.480 
I just used the the two ideas that I
think<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:41.970> student<00:06:42.270> is<00:06:42.360> trying<00:06:42.660> to<00:06:42.810> say<00:06:43.490> this

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
think the student is trying to say this

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.540 
think the student is trying to say this
will<00:06:44.730> be<00:06:44.760> proven<00:06:45.240> by<00:06:45.990> analyzing<00:06:46.770> the<00:06:47.010> wasteful

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
will be proven by analyzing the wasteful

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.780 
will be proven by analyzing the wasteful
manner<00:06:47.820> in<00:06:48.120> which<00:06:48.500> elderly<00:06:49.500> people<00:06:49.890> spend

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
manner in which elderly people spend

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.930 
manner in which elderly people spend
money<00:06:51.120> as<00:06:51.710> well<00:06:52.710> as<00:06:52.770> the<00:06:52.920> striking<00:06:53.460> care<00:06:53.820> of

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
money as well as the striking care of

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.150 
money as well as the striking care of
the<00:06:54.030> elderly<00:06:54.440> puts<00:06:55.440> on<00:06:55.650> a<00:06:55.680> country's

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
the elderly puts on a country's

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.330 
the elderly puts on a country's
government<00:06:56.550> economically<00:07:00.020> so<00:07:01.020> if<00:07:01.980> you<00:07:02.160> look

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
government economically so if you look

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.190 
government economically so if you look
at<00:07:02.460> this<00:07:03.270> now<00:07:03.810> it's<00:07:04.230> it's<00:07:04.770> much<00:07:04.950> clearer<00:07:06.200> so

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
at this now it's it's much clearer so

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.080 
at this now it's it's much clearer so
the<00:07:07.320> first<00:07:07.530> idea<00:07:07.680> is<00:07:08.130> that<00:07:08.640> we're<00:07:08.880> going<00:07:09.000> to

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
the first idea is that we're going to

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.870 
the first idea is that we're going to
look<00:07:09.300> at<00:07:09.480> how<00:07:09.810> old<00:07:10.500> people<00:07:10.830> spend<00:07:11.370> money<00:07:11.550> in<00:07:11.790> a

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
look at how old people spend money in a

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.300 
look at how old people spend money in a
wasteful<00:07:12.240> manner<00:07:12.510> and<00:07:12.840> then<00:07:13.380> connect<00:07:13.740> that<00:07:13.920> to

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
wasteful manner and then connect that to

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.260 
wasteful manner and then connect that to
how<00:07:14.610> this<00:07:16.100> overall<00:07:17.100> makes<00:07:17.400> the<00:07:17.640> growth<00:07:17.970> of<00:07:18.150> old

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
how this overall makes the growth of old

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.200 
how this overall makes the growth of old
people<00:07:18.420> in<00:07:18.690> society<00:07:19.320> a<00:07:19.500> negative<00:07:20.400> trend<00:07:20.820> and

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
people in society a negative trend and

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.950 
people in society a negative trend and
then<00:07:21.840> the<00:07:21.990> second<00:07:22.380> idea<00:07:22.620> is<00:07:23.420> the<00:07:24.420> strain

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
then the second idea is the strain

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.180 
then the second idea is the strain
that's<00:07:26.930> that<00:07:27.930> the<00:07:28.080> government<00:07:28.530> has<00:07:28.920> to

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:29.190 
that's that the government has to

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.930 
that's that the government has to
undertake<00:07:30.110> to<00:07:31.110> look<00:07:31.350> after<00:07:31.800> old<00:07:32.040> people<00:07:32.700> and

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
undertake to look after old people and

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.920 
undertake to look after old people and
again<00:07:33.780> we're<00:07:33.930> gonna<00:07:33.990> connect<00:07:34.440> that<00:07:34.620> idea<00:07:34.890> to

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
again we're gonna connect that idea to

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.050 
again we're gonna connect that idea to
how<00:07:36.930> the<00:07:36.990> growth<00:07:37.500> in<00:07:37.860> numbers<00:07:38.640> of<00:07:38.760> old<00:07:38.910> people

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
how the growth in numbers of old people

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.400 
how the growth in numbers of old people
in<00:07:39.390> society<00:07:40.080> is<00:07:40.260> negative<00:07:41.900> okay<00:07:42.900> I<00:07:43.110> hope<00:07:43.260> you

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.410 
in society is negative okay I hope you

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.900 
in society is negative okay I hope you
follow<00:07:43.680> me<00:07:43.890> on<00:07:44.010> that<00:07:46.400> okay<00:07:47.400> now<00:07:47.550> let's<00:07:47.730> read

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:47.910 
follow me on that okay now let's read

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.450 
follow me on that okay now let's read
the<00:07:48.030> blue<00:07:48.270> these<00:07:48.570> are<00:07:48.750> my<00:07:48.840> comments<00:07:49.220> these<00:07:50.220> two

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 
the blue these are my comments these two

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.090 
the blue these are my comments these two
supporting<00:07:50.910> topics<00:07:51.360> topics<00:07:52.320> are<00:07:52.740> probably

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.100 
supporting topics topics are probably

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.630 
supporting topics topics are probably
not<00:07:53.340> the<00:07:53.670> best<00:07:54.620> arguments<00:07:55.620> you<00:07:55.800> can<00:07:55.980> make<00:07:56.250> to

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:56.640 
not the best arguments you can make to

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.410 
not the best arguments you can make to
prove<00:07:56.940> this<00:07:57.150> thesis<00:07:58.940> personally<00:07:59.940> I<00:08:00.150> would

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:00.420 
prove this thesis personally I would

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.580 
prove this thesis personally I would
have<00:08:00.870> written<00:08:01.110> about<00:08:01.470> one<00:08:01.680> of<00:08:01.800> these<00:08:01.950> topics
