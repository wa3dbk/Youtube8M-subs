 I participated in the launch there in itu 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.950
 I participated in the launch of the party too 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.299
 10 years in Blumenau and the launch 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.540
 here in curitiba 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.540
 good ten years Taliban beer 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:33.569
 oops good problem of course but boc boc 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.300
 are box with more body more intensity 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.180
 but it occurs normally they are dark 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.760
 but in the style guides they enable 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.060
 that they also have a clear color 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.459
 boxing is very rare. 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.920
 we realize it's great great 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.140
 Foaming more creamy 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.880
 heart is slightly blurred is partially 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.840
 Filtered in wood on oak chips 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.150
 French 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.420
 which also happens to have waste 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.380
 these guys from that oak in beer 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.470
 especially on the bottom of the bottle people 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.140
 last glass we realize these 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.140
 waste wood in the nose 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.440
 it was very funny 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.380
 we realize the coconut water is clear 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.540
 that comes from the French oak is typical 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.820
 to be the map when you have this chip or 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.350
 even when it is natural in barrels 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.940
 of oak in one more detail she has to 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.270
 clothes in what is that an extra edition 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.760
 of a diplomat in one of the stages of 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.330
 stage of maturation we also feel 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.380
 This citrus from the dragon group 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.390
 so we have a complexity here 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:59.910
 aromatic we have since this body 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:04:03.840
 even those citrus scents a beer 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.720
 extremely balanced with dry finish 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.600
 that bitterness that has beers 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.760
 work at the end of boxing usually they 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.800
 have too much residual sugar in beer 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.270
 is very well balanced but it has the 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.590
 especially at the entrance when 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.640
 who drinks beer 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.650
 it has a bitterness that is in the end the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.190
 bitterness accentuated dry taste at the end 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.169
 is dry has no sweetness and persistence 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.340
 of these aromas 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.840
 mainly coconut 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.030
 if you let it heat up a bit more 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.070
 cup is even more noticeable this coconut is 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.430
 very clear galley 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.650
 it's well worth sampling the bands years 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.180
 have to rush to buy the beer is 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.430
 a beer that can also take a little 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.660
 guard or maybe a lot of guard is worth 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.840
 Worth buying some bottles for 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.760
 leave there and we all the guests 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.280

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.440
 an exclusive gift from the brewery 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.330

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:07.580
 Hand-painted golden 10 assemblage 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.960

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.070
 units that have been distributed to 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.040
