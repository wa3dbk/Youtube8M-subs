first service this is extremely
important<00:00:36.859> because<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.699> bikes<00:00:37.910> are

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
important because the bikes are

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.259 
important because the bikes are
generally<00:00:38.570> delivered<00:00:39.109> with<00:00:39.289> a<00:00:39.320> run<00:00:39.680> in<00:00:39.710> oil<00:00:40.340> so

generally delivered with a run in oil so

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.389 
generally delivered with a run in oil so
it's<00:00:41.420> a<00:00:41.449> very<00:00:41.660> basic<00:00:41.989> oil<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.769> allow<00:00:43.100> all<00:00:43.280> the

components<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.239> bed<00:00:44.480> in<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:44.929> this<00:00:45.590> needs<00:00:45.890> to

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
components to bed in and this needs to

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.459 
components to bed in and this needs to
be<00:00:46.039> changed<00:00:46.370> within<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.879> first<00:00:47.269> hour<00:00:47.629> or<00:00:48.289> at

you know warranty implications on some

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.990 
you know warranty implications on some
of<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:53.870> bikes<00:00:54.109> if<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:54.679> isn't<00:00:54.890> done<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:55.789> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
of the bikes if this isn't done if the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.270 
of the bikes if this isn't done if the
first<00:00:56.210> service<00:00:56.600> isn't<00:00:56.780> done<00:00:57.050> correctly<00:00:57.500> so

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
first service isn't done correctly so

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.770 
first service isn't done correctly so
the<00:00:58.370> important<00:00:58.789> things<00:00:58.999> are<00:00:59.210> in<00:00:59.300> oil<00:00:59.480> and

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
clearances need to be checked and really

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.890 
clearances need to be checked and really
this<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.490> only<00:01:13.670> confirming<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:14.479> they<00:01:14.840> were

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
this is only confirming that they were

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.280 
this is only confirming that they were
set<00:01:15.680> correctly<00:01:16.220> from<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.850> factory<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:17.630> that

set correctly from the factory and that

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.380 
set correctly from the factory and that
sets<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.890> bike<00:01:19.130> up<00:01:19.369> for<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.700> really<00:01:20.180> good

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
sets the bike up for a really good

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.020 
sets the bike up for a really good
trouble<00:01:20.899> free<00:01:21.170> reliable<00:01:21.560> life<00:01:22.040> in<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.820> future

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
trouble free reliable life in the future

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.420 
trouble free reliable life in the future
the<00:01:23.960> other<00:01:23.990> important<00:01:24.619> things<00:01:24.860> are<00:01:25.159> your

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
normal day to day things so all the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.190 
normal day to day things so all the
controls<00:01:27.799> need<00:01:28.189> to<00:01:28.310> be<00:01:28.430> checked<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.659> steering

very<00:01:55.219> important<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.000> then<00:01:56.750> also<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.680> the

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
very important and then also the the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.789 
very important and then also the the
chain<00:01:58.340> tension<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.960> very<00:02:00.229> important<00:02:00.680> the

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
chain tension so very important the

that first initial ride the first one to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.810 
that first initial ride the first one to
three<00:02:05.810> hours<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.380> all<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.009> components<00:02:07.670> are

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
three hours is all the components are

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.240 
three hours is all the components are
bedding<00:02:08.179> in<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.830> gives<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.160> an

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
bedding in and this gives you an

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.020 
bedding in and this gives you an
opportunity<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.879> check<00:02:11.269> that<00:02:11.480> everything

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
opportunity to check that everything

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.870 
opportunity to check that everything
is<00:02:12.180> set<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.290> tight<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.459> will<00:02:14.580> make<00:02:14.700> the
