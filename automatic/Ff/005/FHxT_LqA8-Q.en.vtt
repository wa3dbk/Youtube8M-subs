00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
favorite scenes from The Simpsons but

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
favorite scenes from The Simpsons but
the<00:00:54.000> reason<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> bring<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the reason I want to bring this to you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.709 
the reason I want to bring this to you
wasn't<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.190> free<00:00:56.430> game<00:00:56.719> but

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
wasn't because it's a free game but

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.200 
wasn't because it's a free game but
because<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.289> has<00:00:58.469> full<00:00:59.280> button<00:00:59.820> remapping

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
because it has full button remapping

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.510 
because it has full button remapping
well<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> want<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.020> say<00:01:01.140> full<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.219> remap

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
well I want to say full you can remap

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.700 
well I want to say full you can remap
pretty<00:01:02.879> much<00:01:03.030> any<00:01:03.270> button<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.110> want<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
pretty much any button that you want you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.760 
pretty much any button that you want you
can't<00:01:05.040> assign<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.610> button<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.270> be<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> l3<00:01:07.530> or

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
can't assign a button to be the l3 or

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.910 
can't assign a button to be the l3 or
are<00:01:08.760> three<00:01:09.600> buttons<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.530> ones<00:01:10.710> where<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
are three buttons the ones where you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
are three buttons the ones where you
push<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> analog<00:01:11.850> sticks<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> can't<00:01:12.450> do

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
push down the analog sticks you can't do

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.320 
push down the analog sticks you can't do
those<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.760> can't<00:01:14.939> switch<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
those but and you can't switch the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.520 
those but and you can't switch the
analog<00:01:15.720> sticks<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
analog sticks which is kind of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.469 
analog sticks which is kind of
unfortunate<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.369> set<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.180> all<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
unfortunate because I set it all up to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.030 
unfortunate because I set it all up to
play<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> left<00:01:19.500> hand<00:01:19.650> side<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
play on the left hand side of the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.890 
play on the left hand side of the
controller<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.540> seems<00:01:21.750> easier

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
controller because it just seems easier

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.800 
controller because it just seems easier
but<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.380> could<00:01:22.640> move<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> analog<00:01:24.509> move

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
but if I could move the analog move

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.380 
but if I could move the analog move
stick<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> left<00:01:26.100> analog<00:01:26.400> stick<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
stick which is the left analog stick to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.940 
stick which is the left analog stick to
the<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.290> switch<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the right one I would switch that and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.310 
the right one I would switch that and
then<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.369> stuff<00:01:29.610> over<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.869> anyway

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
then do this stuff over there but anyway

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.719 
then do this stuff over there but anyway
this<00:01:31.530> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> works<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.400> you'll<00:01:32.520> see

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
this kind of works for me you'll see

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.840 
this kind of works for me you'll see
that<00:01:33.329> I'm<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.869> great<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.320> game<00:01:34.380> but

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
that I'm not that great at this game but

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
that I'm not that great at this game but
yeah<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:36.630> read<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:36.930> glad<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> has<00:01:37.350> remapping
