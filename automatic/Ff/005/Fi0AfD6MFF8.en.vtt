00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.260 
covergirl I believe and I got an
waterproof<00:01:47.430> because<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.119> my

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
waterproof because it was going to be my

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.710 
waterproof because it was going to be my
new<00:01:48.450> first<00:01:48.869> coat<00:01:49.170> mascara<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.540> made

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
new first coat mascara and it just made

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.990 
new first coat mascara and it just made
them<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.409> totally<00:01:53.159> down<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> guess<00:01:53.850> it's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
them go to totally down so I guess it's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300 
them go to totally down so I guess it's
like<00:01:54.119> too<00:01:54.329> heavy<00:01:54.630> or<00:01:54.960> too<00:01:54.990> watery<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:55.680> not

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like too heavy or too watery or not

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
like too heavy or too watery or not
