defending<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> four<00:00:58.199> words<00:00:58.320> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
defending because all the four words I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
defending because all the four words I
seem<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.829> obviously<00:00:59.460> give<00:00:59.730> 50<00:01:00.120> defending

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
seem to obviously give 50 defending

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.819 
seem to obviously give 50 defending
because<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.170> don't<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.559> don't<00:01:01.590> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
because they don't they don't really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.219 
because they don't they don't really
defend<00:01:02.160> much<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.480> point<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
defend much so I don't see the point of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.800 
defend much so I don't see the point of
giving<00:01:04.350> him<00:01:04.559> anything<00:01:04.769> less<00:01:05.100> or<00:01:05.250> higher<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
giving him anything less or higher and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.969 
giving him anything less or higher and
53<00:01:06.810> heading<00:01:07.049> because<00:01:07.200> he's<00:01:07.290> not<00:01:07.530> exactly<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
53 heading because he's not exactly the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and stuff so a lot of talk has been for

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.830 
and stuff so a lot of talk has been for
him<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.470> Barcelona<00:01:41.180> but<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.270> my<00:01:42.299> opinion

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
him to go to Barcelona but in my opinion

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
him to go to Barcelona but in my opinion
I<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.040> would<00:01:44.159> ruin<00:01:44.399> him<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:45.119> if

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
I think that would ruin him I think if

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
I think that would ruin him I think if
he<00:01:45.360> goes<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> real<00:01:45.780> madrid<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.710> saying

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
he goes to real madrid not saying

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.910 
he goes to real madrid not saying
they're<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> better<00:01:47.340> team<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
they're a better team then not I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.590 
they're a better team then not I
definitely<00:01:49.920> definitely<00:01:50.369> say<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.880> Barcelona

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
definitely definitely say that Barcelona

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600 
definitely definitely say that Barcelona
the<00:01:51.750> best<00:01:51.930> thing<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> world<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.619> because

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the best thing in the world but because

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.749 
the best thing in the world but because
Neymar<00:01:54.509> doesn't<00:01:55.110> exactly<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.159> pass<00:01:56.520> as

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
Neymar doesn't exactly like to pass as

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.429 
Neymar doesn't exactly like to pass as
much<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.509> kind<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.869> all<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> Barcelona

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
much as and kind of all the Barcelona

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350 
much as and kind of all the Barcelona
players<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.549> that<00:02:00.030> would<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
players I don't think that would be the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.179 
players I don't think that would be the
right<00:02:00.600> choice<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> look<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.680> people<00:02:02.130> like

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
right choice if you look at people like

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.880 
right choice if you look at people like
Ronaldo<00:02:02.820> dimaria<00:02:03.420> they're<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.560> exactly

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
Ronaldo dimaria they're not exactly

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.200 
Ronaldo dimaria they're not exactly
people<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> pass<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
people they like to pass they like to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.600 
people they like to pass they like to
run<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:07.140> some<00:02:07.320> skill<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.740> stuff<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.069> so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
run do some skill and stuff like that so

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.160 
run do some skill and stuff like that so
I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.700> Neymar<00:02:09.030> would<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> very<00:02:09.690> very<00:02:09.959> good

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
I think Neymar would be a very very good

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.190 
I think Neymar would be a very very good
choice<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.649> granted<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.459> not<00:02:11.730> Barcelona<00:02:12.239> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
choice for granted and not Barcelona so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.940 
choice for granted and not Barcelona so
next<00:02:13.620> we<00:02:13.800> can

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
next we can

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.309 
next we can
to<00:02:13.980> come<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> Chamberlain<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.200> think<00:02:16.200> he

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
to come on to Chamberlain I think he

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.210 
to come on to Chamberlain I think he
could<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.620> 74<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.310> 91<00:02:17.670> pace<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.900> his

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
could be a 74 with 91 pace I think his

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.720 
could be a 74 with 91 pace I think his
informed<00:02:20.220> stats<00:02:20.700> was<00:02:21.269> 93<00:02:21.930> pace<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> 74<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
informed stats was 93 pace but a 74 so I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.250 
informed stats was 93 pace but a 74 so I
don't<00:02:23.819> think<00:02:24.030> he<00:02:24.150> could<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.420> gold<00:02:24.599> as<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.050> yet

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
don't think he could be a gold as of yet

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.350 
don't think he could be a gold as of yet
because<00:02:25.470> doesn't<00:02:25.739> play<00:02:25.830> too<00:02:25.890> much<00:02:26.269> but<00:02:27.269> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
because doesn't play too much but it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.509 
because doesn't play too much but it
shouldn't<00:02:27.599> have<00:02:27.690> 72<00:02:28.200> his<00:02:28.769> weak<00:02:29.040> foot<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:29.489> be

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
shouldn't have 72 his weak foot would be

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.460 
shouldn't have 72 his weak foot would be
around<00:02:29.819> four<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.150> five<00:02:30.630> because<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.260> weak

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
around four or five because it's weak

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.250 
around four or five because it's weak
fries<00:02:31.790> unbelievable<00:02:32.790> passed<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.660> 74

i guess when you just coming into a new

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.500 
i guess when you just coming into a new
team<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.370> don't<00:03:05.519> know<00:03:05.610> how<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> play<00:03:06.000> you're

team you don't know how to play you're

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.900 
team you don't know how to play you're
trying<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.930> impress<00:03:07.200> people<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:08.489> hasn't

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
trying to impress people and it hasn't

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.699
