00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it down by your eye because you're

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710

putting carbon on the bottom lash line
as<00:02:16.080> well<00:02:17.570> so<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.840> basically<00:02:18.990> blend<00:02:19.470> that

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
as well so you just basically blend that

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
as well so you just basically blend that
out<00:02:19.620> with<00:02:19.890> your<00:02:20.010> pencil<00:02:20.220> brush<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.940> this

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
out with your pencil brush and this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030 
out with your pencil brush and this
takes<00:02:21.390> some<00:02:21.630> time<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.230> don't<00:02:22.560> try<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.800> rush

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
takes some time so don't try to rush

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.460 
takes some time so don't try to rush
through<00:02:23.220> this

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.230 

just<00:02:34.400> basically<00:02:34.960> perfected<00:02:35.960> a<00:02:36.050> little<00:02:36.320> bit

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.610 

and<00:02:41.240> now<00:02:41.450> I'm<00:02:41.600> taking<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.960> same<00:02:42.290> pencil
