00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.990
 I have to talk about my name for the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.550
 who have not understood well is not a nickname 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.279
 I did not invent it in the stage name 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.779
 my name is a cloud michelle the most 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.339
 simple that I found when I 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.380
 I present with someone so they understand 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.509
 my name is to tell you that it's like raÃºl 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.980
 but also the upo la but every time 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.980
 I tell you this, people stay like 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 until they change the u for the and I already 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.420
 they say rural 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.790
 my name according to the dictionary means 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.280
 endowed with great grandiose beauty 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.079
 gentle clear being that is the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.430
 definition of beautiful 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.410
 I really do not know what my name means 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.050

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.790
