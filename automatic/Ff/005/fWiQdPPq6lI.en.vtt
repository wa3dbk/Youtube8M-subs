comments about often but it's usually

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.890 
comments about often but it's usually
just<00:00:15.389> their<00:00:15.929> assumptions<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.750> this<00:00:18.750> will

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
hey guys I'm going to talk today about

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.339

three<00:00:26.529> Mac<00:00:27.130> products<00:00:27.849> 6<00:00:28.090> plus<00:00:28.329> charged<00:00:29.050> water

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.130 
three Mac products 6 plus charged water
and<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:30.070> lightful<00:00:30.880> softening<00:00:31.509> lotion

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
and the lightful softening lotion

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.960 
and the lightful softening lotion
the<00:00:32.230> reason<00:00:32.590> I'm<00:00:32.769> lumping<00:00:33.280> all<00:00:33.519> of<00:00:33.760> these

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
the reason I'm lumping all of these

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.119 
the reason I'm lumping all of these
products<00:00:34.510> together<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.440> because<00:00:35.739> they<00:00:36.010> all

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
products together is because they all

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.119 
products together is because they all
fall<00:00:36.430> under<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.850> same<00:00:37.090> skin<00:00:37.899> care<00:00:38.320> category

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
fall under the same skin care category

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.670 
fall under the same skin care category

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
which is toners so start things off by

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.160
