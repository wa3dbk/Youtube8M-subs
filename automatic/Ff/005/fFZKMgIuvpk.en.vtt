00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 Dear colleagues 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.890
 channel guests followers to the pros in this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.789
 I present some my videos to you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.750
 new inventions namely want to show 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.840
 you here is such a new similar pattern 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.219
 describe and show the principle works 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 in the pattern down there 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.410
 those who are familiar with my channel and familiar 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 their inventions recognize how he 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.000
 works for beginners 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.149
 recommend visiting my site 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 don profile . address in the description under the video 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.480
 or view my previous videos 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 briefly show the advantage of this new 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.199
 pattern first means that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.879
 how accurate fittings are achieved 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.449
 by this movement 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
 acrylic 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.810
 It's called acrylic base. 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.170
 movement here therefore 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.720
 expose fasten and you get 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.789
 exactly shine the second advantage of this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.940
 quick insert inserts are not needed 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:22.080
 nothing to screw this otvetochka 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.110
 this is our loop very easily inserted 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.970
 do not stagger for visual 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.590
 of an example here and so shake you 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 saw that she was sitting tight 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.860
 when suddenly on a case somewhere that is not 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.550
 will pass slightly nestykovochka 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.220
 sandpaper they will all be numbered so 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.060
 here are numbered if visible show here 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.700
 so here so numbered and in 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.600
 letter to those who will purchase templates 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.409
 will be 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.259
 and sizes and numbers so one more 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.450
 its advantage is that it is calculated 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:03.119
 on canvas from 30 to 45 millimeters 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.909
 ruler nakleechki and here are here 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.810
 risks such risks will be exhibited 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.739
 centered 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.299
 he became smaller as i said before 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.350
 Regarding the assembly of the template it will be 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.260
 separate video 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.799
 as regards the layout of the templates under 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.709
 accessories also made a separate video 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:29.700
 clear my channel and you'll be aware 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.609
 all changes here as for the order 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.859
 templates will also be a separate detailed 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:38.840
 video how to order templates 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:42.540
 where to write what to do here 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.859
 there is a large template for ordering 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.600
 double pattern 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.680
 he 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.260
 designed to cut 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.030
 just two loops on top and bottom 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.330
 he meter method length of 2 pieces take 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.740
 two such patterns 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.140
 interconnect there is a special 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.090
 ruler on sizes meant to 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.900
 boards on 2 meters 210 222 30 and so on 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.620
 insert two loops 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.580
 measure and cut two loops at once and 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.240
 on the canvas 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.180
 and on the box so who needs a big 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.920
 template for large volumes write to 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.690
 mail 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.880
 I also want to introduce here is 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.960
 here's a device called you suspect 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.860
 holders 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.860
 doors like this it unfolds 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.640
 huge video about this suspect will 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.180
 also separate and still will be separate 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.170
 video on order copying sleeves for 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.299
 Tips for these templates 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.480
 but on this I have everything for those who want 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.330
 keep up to date on the updates of my inventions 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.239
 visit my channel come to me on 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.840
 site with you was farid good luck to you and yours 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.840
