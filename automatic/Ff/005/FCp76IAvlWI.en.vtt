morning on a parade lap I was just kind
of<00:00:28.150> an<00:00:28.270> association<00:00:28.900> lap<00:00:29.200> but<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.439> wasn't

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
of an association lap but I wasn't

of an association lap but I wasn't
driving<00:00:29.949> there<00:00:30.279> was<00:00:30.400> a<00:00:30.460> guy<00:00:30.610> that<00:00:30.789> was<00:00:30.880> driving

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
driving there was a guy that was driving

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.229 
driving there was a guy that was driving
it<00:00:31.559> and<00:00:32.559> I<00:00:32.649> was<00:00:32.770> in<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:32.920> backseat<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.489> you

it and I was in the backseat and you
could<00:00:34.390> tell<00:00:34.510> he<00:00:34.570> was<00:00:34.840> afraid<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.200> it<00:00:35.410> a<00:00:35.500> little

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
could tell he was afraid of it a little

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.979 
could tell he was afraid of it a little
bit<00:00:35.890> just<00:00:36.360> respected<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.480> because<00:00:37.750> of<00:00:37.870> its

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
bit just respected it because of its

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.930 
bit just respected it because of its
horsepower<00:00:38.290> level<00:00:38.829> so<00:00:39.010> with<00:00:39.129> 700<00:00:39.670> horsepower

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
horsepower level so with 700 horsepower

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.850 
horsepower level so with 700 horsepower
you<00:00:40.239> don't<00:00:40.360> want<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.540> be<00:00:40.629> screwing<00:00:40.960> around<00:00:41.110> so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
you don't want to be screwing around so

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
let's just take a look at the lap now it

00:00:45.309 --> 00:03:40.899 
let's just take a look at the lap now it
is

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.550 

thank<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.900> when<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.049> got<00:03:46.230> out<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.499> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
thank you so when I got out of the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.470 
thank you so when I got out of the
Hellcat<00:03:47.010> there<00:03:47.760> was<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:47.879> driving<00:03:48.269> instructor

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
Hellcat there was a driving instructor

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.309 
Hellcat there was a driving instructor
in<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.019> car<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.290> was<00:03:49.379> required<00:03:49.769> by<00:03:50.010> Chrysler

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
in the car that was required by Chrysler

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.660 
in the car that was required by Chrysler
one<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.530> first<00:03:52.769> things<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.159> thought<00:03:53.370> was

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
one of the first things I thought was

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.140 
one of the first things I thought was
man<00:03:54.599> this<00:03:54.900> car<00:03:55.139> is<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.319> overkill<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.250> it's

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
man this car is just overkill I it's

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.940 
man this car is just overkill I it's
it's<00:03:57.510> not<00:03:57.689> a<00:03:57.750> track<00:03:58.200> car<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:59.310> felt<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.420> lot<00:04:00.840> of

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
it's not a track car I felt a lot of

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.589 
it's not a track car I felt a lot of
instability<00:04:01.950> at<00:04:02.069> high<00:04:02.250> speed<00:04:02.639> this<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.329> car

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
instability at high speed this is a car

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.080 
instability at high speed this is a car
that<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.840> got<00:04:04.079> in<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.530> wasn't<00:04:04.799> afraid<00:04:05.159> of<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.549> but

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
that I got in I wasn't afraid of it but

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.899 
that I got in I wasn't afraid of it but
I<00:04:06.150> felt<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.689> become<00:04:07.049> very<00:04:07.469> unstable<00:04:07.980> over<00:04:08.340> 130

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
I felt it become very unstable over 130

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.440 
I felt it become very unstable over 130
miles<00:04:09.150> an<00:04:09.329> hour<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:10.909> it<00:04:11.909> killed<00:04:12.269> my

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
miles an hour and it killed my

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.149 
miles an hour and it killed my
confidence<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.260> pushing<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.889> back

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
confidence and pushing it and that back

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.189 
confidence and pushing it and that back
straight<00:04:14.489> there<00:04:14.879> where<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.150> think<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.480> hit<00:04:15.629> 130

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
straight there where I think I hit 130

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.949 
straight there where I think I hit 130
you<00:04:16.349> can<00:04:16.470> start<00:04:16.709> to<00:04:16.829> see<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.099> camera<00:04:17.340> shake<00:04:17.959> on

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
you can start to see the camera shake on

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.749 
you can start to see the camera shake on
the<00:04:19.500> window<00:04:19.889> where<00:04:20.099> it<00:04:20.190> was<00:04:20.280> facing<00:04:20.669> the

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
the window where it was facing the

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.039 
the window where it was facing the
speedometer<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.479> that's<00:04:21.630> kind<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.870> what<00:04:21.989> you

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
speedometer and that's kind of what you

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.540 
speedometer and that's kind of what you
felt<00:04:22.380> through<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.680> cabin<00:04:23.099> of<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.250> car<00:04:23.490> just

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
felt through the cabin of the car just

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.870 
felt through the cabin of the car just
this<00:04:24.060> kind<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.930> underlying<00:04:25.759> instability<00:04:26.759> at

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
this kind of underlying instability at

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.430 
this kind of underlying instability at
high<00:04:27.000> speed<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.599> that<00:04:27.690> kind<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:27.990> freaked<00:04:28.320> me

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
high speed and that kind of freaked me

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.189 
high speed and that kind of freaked me
out<00:04:29.000> in<00:04:30.000> terms<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.449> handling<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.930> everything

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
out in terms of handling and everything

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.570 
out in terms of handling and everything
you<00:04:31.470> know<00:04:31.560> they<00:04:31.710> forced<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.190> have<00:04:32.310> stability

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
you know they forced you have stability

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.460 
you know they forced you have stability
controlling<00:04:33.360> all<00:04:33.479> that<00:04:33.660> stuff<00:04:33.960> so<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.139> really

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
controlling all that stuff so you really

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.439 
controlling all that stuff so you really
you<00:04:34.680> couldn't<00:04:35.250> get<00:04:35.400> too<00:04:35.580> crazy<00:04:35.880> with<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.360> it

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
you couldn't get too crazy with it it

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.700 
you couldn't get too crazy with it it
would<00:04:36.509> cut<00:04:36.750> power<00:04:36.960> really<00:04:37.320> easily

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
would cut power really easily

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.430 
would cut power really easily
straight-line<00:04:38.669> speed<00:04:38.849> is<00:04:39.180> amazing<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:40.169> course

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
straight-line speed is amazing of course

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.909 
straight-line speed is amazing of course
but<00:04:41.159> you'll<00:04:41.610> look<00:04:41.789> at<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:43.080> pop<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.560> punch

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
but you'll look at it you pop you punch

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.279 
but you'll look at it you pop you punch
the<00:04:44.130> gas<00:04:44.310> if<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:45.150> can<00:04:45.330> get<00:04:45.479> traction<00:04:45.810> and

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
the gas if you can get traction and

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.640 
the gas if you can get traction and
you're<00:04:46.740> already<00:04:47.039> at<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:48.240> know<00:04:48.360> 60<00:04:48.900> 70<00:04:48.930> miles

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
you're already at you know 60 70 miles

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.430 
you're already at you know 60 70 miles
an<00:04:49.919> hour<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.400> you<00:04:50.759> know<00:04:50.849> lit<00:04:51.599> legitimately

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
an hour and you know lit legitimately

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.310 
an hour and you know lit legitimately
four<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.009> a<00:04:53.039> half<00:04:53.099> seconds<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:53.909> it's<00:04:54.030> I<00:04:54.330> can't

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
four and a half seconds and it's I can't

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.839 
four and a half seconds and it's I can't
