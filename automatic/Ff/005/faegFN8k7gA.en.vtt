00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.420 
then I'm scrolling past I'm even
thinking<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.799> know<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.070> Aaron

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
thinking about you know what Aaron

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.920 
thinking about you know what Aaron
Rodgers<00:01:44.759> best<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> both<00:01:45.299> worlds<00:01:45.689> he<00:01:45.780> can

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
Rodgers best of both worlds he can

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
Rodgers best of both worlds he can
scramble<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.590> he<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.890> throw<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> decide

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
scramble and he can throw but I decide

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.940 
scramble and he can throw but I decide
to<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.479> go<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.780> Tom<00:01:49.140> Brady<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.619> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to just go with Tom Brady because it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.460 
to just go with Tom Brady because it's
Tom<00:01:50.189> Brady<00:01:50.460> he's<00:01:50.899> possibly<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.290> best

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
Tom Brady he's possibly the best

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.139 
Tom Brady he's possibly the best
quarterback<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> ever<00:01:53.250> play<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.700> game<00:01:53.729> guys

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
quarterback to ever play the game guys

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.929 
quarterback to ever play the game guys
so<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.649> decide<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:56.700> my

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
so I just want I decide to go with my

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.249 
so I just want I decide to go with my

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the reason I did not go for shaman cord

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270 
the reason I did not go for shaman cord
because<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.990> did<00:02:04.200> pre-order<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.829> game<00:02:05.040> at

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
because I did pre-order this game at

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.679 
because I did pre-order this game at
gamestop<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.030> knew<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.600> get

gamestop so I knew I was going to get

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.820 
gamestop so I knew I was going to get
the<00:02:06.810> bear<00:02:06.990> sandwich<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.829> legendary<00:02:08.700> card<00:02:09.060> so
