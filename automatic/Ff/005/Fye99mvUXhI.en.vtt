00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.429
 my little test in absolute terms in the room 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.679
 that or my so-called k3 test and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 Although just to look like the canon 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.630
 Legria reacts to extremely little light 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:27.570
 how to find a canon legria hfm 46 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:31.320
 I have a lighter here and I have one 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.270
 two tealights background of course 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 again my usual objects the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 figures 1 5 d mark bill and a kind 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 small terrarium with a few figurines 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 We do not win the second one 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 And in any case falls on 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.829
 You can definitely see the characters 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.090
 Really good 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.090
 I look for a bit pure 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.369
 only stroke comes so that is now the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.159
 figure and 5d mark sparkle bit 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.340
 announced when I sum out again 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.720
 It looks like this and yes I can 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 Of course, with the lighter still 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 We also donate additional light 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.600
 does not think so much every time 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.600
 a bit of a third light source 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.119
 Well, that is definitely yes because as well 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.130
 the colors are as I said it is here 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:54.220
 an absolute dream I even illuminate 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:58.149
 only with these two tealights and of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.610
 So I have to say that's it 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.220
 but quite a good one 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.289
 quality 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.110
 the figures so far image noise what 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.959
 but I am nevertheless normal 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.180
 actually with this result, at least 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.620
 what I clean up here on the display 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.459
 the canon legria hf 46 sat down 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:29.730
 times papa smurf that sees everything 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:29.730
 sensationally good from 5 loris just goes 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.790
 In the background I can do that tomorrow 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.379
 I usually do not like that one 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.230
 So the terrarium really is 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.430
 also figurine in it all men third 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.519
 light source you can see all a 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.560
 bit better now comes from below yes 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:03:03.030
 that's what it looks like this is my song 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.859
 light candlelight test and so who with 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.590
 little light may want something film that can 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.700
 I like to do it completely now 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.079
 automatic mode filmed I guess 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.750
 that one over the reminder one 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.689
 manual adjustment a lot more 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.069
 out of this camera out there and can 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.150
 and yes that should first to this test 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.560
