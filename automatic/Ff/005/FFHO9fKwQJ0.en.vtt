full and then it will send back to your
base<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.540> could<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.869> all<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.110> chickens

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
base so you could have all the chickens

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
base so you could have all the chickens
above<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.920> lay<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.399> eggs<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.790> full<00:01:48.090> down

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
above that lay the eggs in full down

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.719 
above that lay the eggs in full down
into<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> item<00:01:48.810> hopper<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.470> oh<00:01:49.950> yeah<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
into the item hopper and oh yeah so a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.719 
into the item hopper and oh yeah so a
way<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.990> item<00:01:52.229> hop<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.159> hit

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
way to use this item hop it is to hit

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.200

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
then you just threw the block underneath

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
then you just threw the block underneath
and<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.219> place<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> chest<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> can

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
see the item hopper runs into the chest

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.330 
see the item hopper runs into the chest
and<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.540> will<00:02:03.810> put<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> items<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.770> so

we got four and as you can see if we go

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.000 
we got four and as you can see if we go
and<00:02:44.120> we<00:02:44.180> search<00:02:44.450> for<00:02:44.480> eggs<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.530> chickens

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
and we search for eggs the chickens

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.030 
and we search for eggs the chickens
could<00:02:46.400> lay<00:02:46.580> an<00:02:46.850> egg<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.650> what<00:02:48.650> came<00:02:48.830> first

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
could lay an egg and what came first

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.640 
could lay an egg and what came first
that<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.370> go<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:49.700> egg<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.140> eggs<00:02:51.410> would

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
that you go the egg and the eggs would

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.160 
that you go the egg and the eggs would
just<00:02:51.830> fall<00:02:52.010> down<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.580> into<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.210> so<00:02:53.450> also

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
just fall down and into here so also

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.200 
just fall down and into here so also
they<00:02:54.440> can<00:02:54.620> be<00:02:54.740> stored<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.490> item<00:02:55.790> hopper<00:02:56.090> as

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
they can be stored in the item hopper as

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.330 
they can be stored in the item hopper as
well<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.720> if<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.020> inventory<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.740> full<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.160> will

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
well so if the inventory is full it will

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.880 
well so if the inventory is full it will
it's<00:02:59.000> kind<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.360> like<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.600> chest<00:02:59.930> as<00:03:00.080> well<00:03:00.260> so

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
it's kind of like a chest as well so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.500 
it's kind of like a chest as well so
yeah<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.160> pretty<00:03:01.280> much<00:03:01.400> sums<00:03:01.820> up<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.150> video

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
yeah that pretty much sums up this video

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.780 
yeah that pretty much sums up this video
