00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.510
 the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.160
 welcome and clamping without the chin 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.800
 play mercury 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.079
 edited by white goblin games it 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.779
 is for 2 to 5 players in which one 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.699
 fifteen up with fresh bed and 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.370
 this game is rolled with dice 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.559
 and everyone is busy at the same time 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.269
 get the maximum score out of it 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.610
 it's not your turn either 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.440
 and at someone else's throw there is 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.149
 always a combination that also for you 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.010
 applies where you again 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.600
 can put crosses and therefore more points 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.600
 can score towards the end of the game 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.430
 a little insight a little luck and 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.210
 that ultimately makes you beat 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.949
 quiz 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 let's go see what in one 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.100
 box 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.390
 the game was invented by solid pine 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.689
 burg and we get the rules for this 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.100
 Dutch and not very common 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.200
 nice and clear until 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.689
 examples we get 6 dice 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.380
 in the five different colors and we 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.540
 actually 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.270
 notepad notepad why for 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.799
 our scores 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.640
 that's all we get right 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.640
 but is playing a game 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.980
 goal of the game is as much as possible 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.890
 score points and you score points 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.790
 by displaying a list away from you 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.230
 crosses 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.600
 here then each row consists of 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.150
 numbers 12 to 2 or two to 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.800
 with 12 in the four colors of the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.270
 special de or steal 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.010
 and in addition there are two more white ones 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 dice that can be used 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.750
 for bonus numbers 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.400
 as you put more crosses in a row 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.050
 you can see that at the bottom of this table 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.060
 worth more points, for example 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.240
 the blue empire five crosses then sickness 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.070
 a row that is too blue is worth 15 points 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.370
 and that point count at the end on and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.330
 who deliver my final score goes the game 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.730
 in his work 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.960
 the starting player who picks up all six 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.710
 dice 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.230
 it works this then follow two steps 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.790
 the first step is for all players there 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.220
 we become the eyes of the two white ones 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.070
 dice added together and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.120
 anyone can mark that number out 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.310
 his card 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.380
 in this case we are talking about 10 me 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.660
 I have all ten still available 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.500
 could choose in which row I am 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.200
 the 10 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.280
 cross off and grab other players 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.459
 also on their card 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.239
 you don't have 10 or you want 10 in a team 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.430
 don't strip away 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.980
 then you don't have to do that you are not 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.360
 required the second step is only for 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.840
 the player who has the dice 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.260
 thrown 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.780
 he may have one of the white dice 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.900
 combine with a pair of the colored ones 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.850
 dice and that determines the number and 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.830
 also of course right in which reiki that 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.150
 number should streak 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.310
 for example, choose the yellow one 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.610
 die and combine with the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.769
 white 4 and comes in total eight and 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.120
 will therefore be the yellow 8-way 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.260
 stripes is also this second step 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.760
 optional 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.780
 however, we should pay attention to putting 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.090
 of crosses 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.610
 is that all the crosses are always from the left 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.350
 to the right to be placed 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.930
 so if you put a cross at 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.080
 for example the 8 and you choose that 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.360
 to do in the blue row then 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.870
 that automatically you get the numbers 12 11 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.720
 10 9 in the blue row will never leave 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.880
 being able 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.440
 them because you started here think that 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.970
 that's just because you are heading this way 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.770
 may put crosses 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.960
 of course you can if you roll the 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.550
 next time the sixes that are just here 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.140
 drop you but of course goes then 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.600
 skip it but keep that in mind 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.120
 the next cross you put so again 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.470
 to the right of this cross 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.960
 so that means only four more 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.120
 Numbers his order in this row off 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.370
 cross and that is also the reason that the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.590
 two rows start at 12 and end and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.500
 a2 and the top two rows of course 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.030
 start with two and go up to 12 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.140
 That is an important aspect where you 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.310
 should keep in mind 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.020
 should it be that the player turns it on 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.170
 so it is the turn of the post one 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.630
 thrown both the number of white 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.000
 double cities as a combination of one 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.340
 white boxes and hair color the dice 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.890
 not wanting to cross off so he would be two 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.020
 numbers can cross my cross 0 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.030
 numbers away then he must have failed 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.290
 tick the throw then you will see these four 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.940
 pockets for 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.900
 you can just cross numbers off then 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.720
 of course you do that but it is possible 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.480
 of course so that you have no numbers 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.400
 can or should make crosses and then the 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.320
 failed board points and that is on 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.810
 the end of the game 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.340
 5 penalty can of course there are a few 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.340
 game rules 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.150
 you see that every last number in the 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.940
 queue 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.479
 is connected with a clasp and if you 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.690
 cross this number off then you decide the 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.610
 row and that color is also equal 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.130
 the game achieved that may then no longer 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.140
 being used 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.960
 that may of course not be just like you 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.630
 cross off that last number zero 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.210
 you must already have at least five in that row 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.580
 so have the crosses that last 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.500
 number would be a sixth cross 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.240
 are associations which excludes travel 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.880
 then you put a cross through that 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.940
 last number and at the same time you put 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.530
 a cross through the clasp and as one 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.360
 bonus tick what you get for it 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.490
 closing a row 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.540
 after that , for example, the red prize 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.970
 Close 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.160
 get the red dice out of it 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.870
 game and then give these dice 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.419
 to your neighbor 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.090
 that means nobody crosses anymore 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.380
 may put in the red row that is from 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.479
 now closed 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.150
 the game is over once there are two 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.100
 rows closed 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.250
 and then everyone just goes his points 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.680
 Count the game are also going to be finished 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.880
 if someone has the fourth failed throw 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.060
 check 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.380
 then the game is also over immediately and 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.940
 let's do the scoring 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.440
 but if that is not the case then the 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.300
 turn left to lose that throws 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.980
 the dice everyone picks up white and he 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.570
 may again be a color with a white 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.210
 combine to put a cross 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.560
 so the game continues eventually 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.480
 the one with the most points is the 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.290
 winner of mercury and so this game becomes 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.290
 played 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.400
 Kliks is super simple and fast 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.960
 dice game 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.490
 you set it up like this you lay it out 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.320
 out in no time and then it's normal 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.300
 nice and double and see if you have a bit 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.220
 can score nice points 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.050
 is a little bit tactic in you because 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.600
 it you try to cross as much as possible 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.160
 in certain rows because how 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.530
 more crosses in a row the more points 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.380
 that goes in proportion 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.910
 quickly up and when you know the line closes 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.510
 maybe you have that bonus cross 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.040
 and that is worth extra points 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.830
 on the other hand, it remains one 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.570
 doubles so you depend on 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.810
 the dice and where they land on 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.130
 but it is my true the game runs 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.190
 yes it just works well it 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.410
 plays symbols and plays it easily 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.390
 is nice to do in between 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.250
 Shining excellence did not expect gold 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.690
 mountains or depth and for me 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.680
 personally it's just not a game 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.110
 i will play a lot 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.700
 it's just not in my street and 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.180
 it is for that reason that i go then i go 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.180
 have driven 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.170
 mila an attic
