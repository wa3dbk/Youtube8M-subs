00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
that with a crease brush I'm using one

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.330 
that with a crease brush I'm using one
from<00:01:55.329> Sedona<00:01:55.750> lace<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:56.409> I<00:01:56.770> love<00:01:57.009> this<00:01:57.159> brush

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
from Sedona lace and I love this brush

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.670 
from Sedona lace and I love this brush
so<00:01:57.700> much<00:01:57.939> because<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.450> helps<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.869> apply<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
so much because it helps to apply the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.410 
so much because it helps to apply the
eyeshadow<00:02:00.009> right<00:02:00.549> on<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.789> crease<00:02:00.969> and<00:02:01.359> then

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
eyeshadow right on the crease and then

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.170 
eyeshadow right on the crease and then
it<00:02:01.659> helps<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.200> blend<00:02:02.409> at<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.829> same<00:02:03.130> time<00:02:03.430> so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
it helps to blend at the same time so

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.209 
it helps to blend at the same time so
these<00:02:04.359> two<00:02:04.539> colors<00:02:04.750> turn<00:02:05.200> into<00:02:05.439> like<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.619> little

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
these two colors turn into like a little

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.260 
these two colors turn into like a little
pale<00:02:07.149> grayish<00:02:07.899> color<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.640> i'm<00:02:09.640> going<00:02:10.149> to

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
pale grayish color and i'm going to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.150 
pale grayish color and i'm going to
apply<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.539> right<00:02:10.869> onto<00:02:11.350> my<00:02:11.590> crease<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.100> then

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
apply this right onto my crease and then

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.370 
apply this right onto my crease and then
