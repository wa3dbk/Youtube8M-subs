00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.230
 birds that do not migrate can 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.959
 being in trouble in the winter in 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.059
 find the right amount of food 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.460
 especially when the terrain is 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.250
 covered in snow and falling down 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.580
 of temperature because their 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.289
 Food requirements increase considerably 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.179
 to properly maintain theirs 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.039
 body temperature 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:34.570
 flying is an activity that requires 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:38.890
 lots of energy so lots of food that 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 weights a compact fuel a little 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.270
 energetic 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.490
 i mark these features as 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.880
 also some of the forwards and ours 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.610
 kitchens like fats and some 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.360
 carbohydrates like sweets in winter and in 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.500
 Autumn 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.900
 we can help our feathered friends 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 preparing feeders in the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:06.790
 our gardens terraces terraces with 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.609
 of the characteristics appropriate to 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.369
 different species and with specific foods 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.439
 for the birds of our environment 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.399
 in addition to helping the species in 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.810
 difficulties in an environment strongly 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.850
 man-made and hostile 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.069
 bird watching yes 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.590
 gradually approach over time a 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.319
 these mangers is an activity 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 strongly educational especially for i 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:36.189
 children the birds are divided 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.579
 insectivores and granivores to understand the 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:43.060
 difference is sufficient to observe the 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:46.840
 morphology of the shorter bill e 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.590
 compact and robust for most granivores 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.350
 sharp for flying insects 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.639
 an outstanding example of work grains is 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.499
 the frosone has a musculature 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:02.130
 particularly developed that yes 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:05.259
 develops around the skull up to the beak 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.090
 the back of the frosone is able to 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:12.819
 break the cherry pit 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.099
 developing a force of 35 kg others 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.270
 examples of granivores are the finch 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.940
 the card 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.910
 linen the greenfinch and the common sparrow 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.290
 we can feed them with seed mixtures 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.870
 such as wheat, the corn broken into 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.480
 vein and millet 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.710
 then we have insectivores like the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.170
 blackbird the robin and the blackcap these 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.160
 we can feed them with crumbs of 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.420
 desserts of dry biscuits and fruit 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.240
 fresh 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.300
 then we have other insectivores like the 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.270
 great tit the blue tit the woodpecker 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.950
 bricklayer that we can feed with 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:01.960
 unsalted peanuts of dried fruit 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:06.490
 shredded like walnut hazelnut seeds 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:08.380
 sunflower shelled pine nuts a cute 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.800
 example of how to feed our own 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.700
 little birds is to prepare the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.720
 so-called fat ball or shovel or 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:24.459
 babalÃ¹ ball is obtained by mixing 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:28.600
 100 g of margarine with 70 80 g of flour 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:32.820
 00 or a mixture of corn flour 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.910
 of seeds, dried fruit and sultanas 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.459
 the preparation is placed in the fridge and one 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.620
 once hardened we could wait for the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.970
 our ball to a branch of ours 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.980
 garden foods instead they don't go 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.090
 fed to the birds of our own 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.490
 environment are for example the bread in 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.490
 especially the crumb because it is a 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.280
 low energy food and that 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.820
 during digestion it draws liquids 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.640
 that in the coldest temperatures they can 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.680
 also lead to intestinal blockages and ad 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.340
 frostbite 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.520
 dairy milk must also be excluded 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.100
 because they lead to intestinal dysbiosis e 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.880
 therefore infections is important to remember 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.010
 that once we have recalled the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.790
 birds of our environment and yes they will be 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.129
 accustomed to this food source of 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.699
 let him always find 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:34.709
 3 especially throughout the period of 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.469
 difficulty then autumn winter 

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:39.929
 if you screw the food source and 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:42.830
 body can not find it can have the 

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:42.830
 major difficulties
