00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello very good and welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.990
 from ovi sescam 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.269
 first of all I have to ask for forgiveness 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.190
 to the walk frank channel is because he 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.260
 I had asked about a month ago since 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.080
 I made a video about the cards 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.820
 graphs on what steps to take to 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.120
 keep in mind what graphics card is 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.170
 better than another and what is the really in 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.030
 the graphic card that we 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.910
 we need and not only could do 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.029
 because between one thing and the other that yes 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.190
 the classes that are in the end can 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.539
 to be gone and well I'm going to do it 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.820
 now so from here I send you a 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.860
 apologize to wolfram and good I'll try 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.930
 make the video the best possible for 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.540
 start in the video that I'm going to make them 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.600
 I'm going to show you a few steps on which 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.550
 are the necessary requirements for 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.550
 graphic card that we need 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.230
 so first let's think about the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.989
 idea of what use we are going to give us 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.329
 to our graphics card if we are going 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.430
 to think if it's the kind of user that 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.200
 we are then if we are gamers after 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.049
 we're going to make you need a card 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.909
 graphic obviously 150 250 euros for 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.479
 up if maybe 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.700
 for programming use or to edit 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.869
 with programs that require another 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.060
 performance well we are also going to 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.390
 need some graphic cards from that 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.939
 price of about 100 up to 150 education 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.579
 euros up if we are users 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.709
 normal that all we do is 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.140
 watch videos go online and other 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:31.299
 with a graph of 50 euros or less 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.729
 even we will not be the function that 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.490
 we need good then after this 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.569
 understand in the names and nomenclature 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.390
 when we see on a card 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.909
 graphic for example 760 as the first 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.950
 number the 7 wants us to say the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.349
 generation of the graphics card the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.659
 second number the 6 will not mean the 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:51.520
 range within the generation of the 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.289
 graphic card is to say the higher 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.599
 be the second number better because 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.819
 we understand that within that series is 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.280
 highest range and the last number that is 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.560
 the zero indicates that it occupies that I have 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.509
 position occupies within that range that 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.769
 it can be a 5 for example according to the 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.270
 key to understanding this is that if the 

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:08.860
 second figure is 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.959
 quite low as we understand that a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.650
 low quality graphics card other 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.239
 step would be the subject of brands 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.610
 in the case of the graphic card 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.939
 we find nvidia or the medium that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.650
 better there is everything there is fire in what 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.989
 general the game that are at best 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.370
 we optimized for nvidia or then 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.680
 we found other games that are 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.989
 optimized but average but overall 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.510
 comes to the same thing as if 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.370
 let's put two graphic cards 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.159
 exactly the same and from the same range to 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.870
 such as the best and all that 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.760
 prefer one that they prefer there is like 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.750
 prefer life as this is always 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.569
 good brand thing a very common mistake 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.819
 is to think that the more and spend errant 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.769
 on the graphics card better is going to be the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.930
 quality of the graphics card but not 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.579
 you have to look only at the capacity of 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.250
 ram but the memory bus in the 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.500
 Textured units many more things 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.239
 so a key to understanding this is 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.239
 if we met as we had already 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:11.319
 said before is if we have a card 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.060
 graphic gtx 650 with 2 gigas of ram and 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.939
 then we have on the other hand a 7 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.069
 660 with a giga ram to 660 having 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.769
 a gig of ram will go much better 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.170
 that the 650 because because as I already 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.829
 we had mentioned before in the second 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.170
 6 in the case of 656 in 260 the second 6 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.879
 is not going to indicate that the range forward in 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.859
 the graphics card is much higher and 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.230
 so much as we had mentioned before 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.819
 the units of this textured and the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.650
 bus of the graphics card it will be 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.260
 greater than the bus which is what we are 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.969
 speaking the presence of the bus indicates the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.500
 range of the graphics card and we 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.530
 we found with a graphic card that 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.659
 it has 64 bits because that graphics card 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.239
 we will be practically null to the 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.189
 time to play that we meet 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.950
 a graphic card with 124 bits that 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.599
 Mounts the gddr5 memory because yes that 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.639
 we understand that this is already a card 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.090
 pretty acceptable graphics and so it mounts 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.919
 from 245 bits up then 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.530
 we understand that it is a one card 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.389
 quite pretty graphics already good for 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.909
 be able to play in the case of in the case of 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:18.900
 bus more if it is indicated better good in the 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:23.280
 In the case of memory, we find 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.250
 the types gddr3 is the previous one and gddr5 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.720
 that we say is newer then yes we 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:35.970
 we found with a hd graphics card 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.889
 7.770 with a gb of ram gddr5 and we 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.550
 we find then with another graph equal 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.400
 an h of 7,760 70 with 2 gigas of ram 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.169
 but gddr3 which is going to be more 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.780
 beneficial in the case of the 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.610
 memory you have to understand that the gdr 5 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.380
 making new obviously is going to be higher 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.919
 of higher quality for the graphic card 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.530
 so in this case we did have 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.210
 to be more for that of for that of a 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.820
 giga of gddr5 in this case and still being 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.520
 lower the figure of gddr5 is better this 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.070
 that the ddr3 axis though also 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.639
 we understand that currently 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.580
 moment the games to 1080 does not reach us 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.990
 reach a gig of ram memory 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.750
 but good that in this case yes that is 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.669
 true that the amount is not better than 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.030
 the quality good, in general, if we 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.750
 we found a card 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.330
 to the best of 2 gb for a low price 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.060
 that you see it and say it can not cost 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.010
 they are not linking us in principle 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.470
 a graphics card if following everything 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.980
 all the planning that I have delivered 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.750
 has and always agrees with a price 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.220
 more or less standard last say 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.600
 well what that performance and 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.600
 power will always pay what 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.270
 we can find these comfortable if we 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.360
 They give some bargain, well, it's strange 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.320
 although we can find the best 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.090
 price differences between pages and 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.590
 pages but normally but 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.920
 normally what costs little then 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:05.410
 will end up yielding little so a 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.330
 greeting and like if you liked the video 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.980
 subscribe if you are not up to date 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.800
 of the videos that go up and 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.180
 I try to make videos about what the 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.270
 people ask me so they write in the 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.540
 comments that if you have doubts that 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.020
 I could talk so a greeting no how 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.020
 it feels
