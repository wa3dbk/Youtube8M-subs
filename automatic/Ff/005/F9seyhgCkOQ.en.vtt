were your but you know talk about the

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.050 
were your but you know talk about the
second<00:07:23.340> half<00:07:23.430> we<00:07:23.610> should<00:07:23.760> have<00:07:23.850> been<00:07:23.940> better

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
second half we should have been better

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.550 
second half we should have been better
defensively<00:07:24.540> I<00:07:24.810> thought<00:07:25.110> we<00:07:25.260> were<00:07:25.320> just<00:07:25.410> a

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 
defensively I thought we were just a

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.530 
defensively I thought we were just a
little<00:07:25.590> bit<00:07:26.040> too<00:07:26.280> sluggish<00:07:26.700> to<00:07:27.060> 15

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
little bit too sluggish to 15

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.270 
little bit too sluggish to 15
defensively<00:07:28.110> and<00:07:28.470> really<00:07:28.710> closing<00:07:28.950> the<00:07:29.130> right

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
defensively and really closing the right

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.190 
defensively and really closing the right
gaps<00:07:29.520> a<00:07:29.820> midway<00:07:30.510> through<00:07:30.690> the<00:07:30.720> second<00:07:31.050> half

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
gaps a midway through the second half

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.960 
gaps a midway through the second half
and<00:07:31.440> we<00:07:31.860> just<00:07:32.010> couldn't<00:07:32.070> get<00:07:32.280> a<00:07:32.340> third<00:07:32.520> goal<00:07:32.700> so

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
and we just couldn't get a third goal so

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.820 
and we just couldn't get a third goal so
but<00:07:33.150> at<00:07:33.480> the<00:07:33.600> other<00:07:33.630> day<00:07:33.870> I<00:07:33.900> think<00:07:34.200> the<00:07:34.560> process

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
but at the other day I think the process

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.730 
but at the other day I think the process
of<00:07:35.870> recognizing<00:07:36.870> that<00:07:37.230> and<00:07:37.380> getting<00:07:37.500> better

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
of recognizing that and getting better

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.320 
of recognizing that and getting better
and<00:07:37.950> dealing<00:07:38.340> with<00:07:38.430> an<00:07:38.520> oddity<00:07:38.850> now<00:07:38.970> fried<00:07:39.210> it
