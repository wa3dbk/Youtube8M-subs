level cap is going to raise from 31 to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.730 
level cap is going to raise from 31 to
36<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.310> i<00:02:11.340> can't<00:02:11.700> wait<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
36 so i can't wait for that

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.730 
36 so i can't wait for that
so<00:02:13.520> now<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:14.150> go<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.390> back<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.170> reggie<00:02:15.290> village

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
really hard to level up if you don't

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.810 
really hard to level up if you don't
have<00:03:24.410> high<00:03:24.650> level<00:03:24.950> equipment<00:03:25.400> or<00:03:25.550> a<00:03:25.580> good

have high level equipment or a good

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.410 
have high level equipment or a good
weapon<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:28.130> now<00:03:28.310> we're<00:03:28.490> on<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.670> last<00:03:28.850> level<00:03:29.120> of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
weapon so now we're on the last level of

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.320 
weapon so now we're on the last level of
beck<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.990> ridge<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.890> called<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.670> gold

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
beck and ridge it is called the gold

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.920 
beck and ridge it is called the gold
mine<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.130> if<00:03:34.130> you're<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> low<00:03:34.520> level<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:35.390> boss

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
mine and if you're a low level the boss

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.200 
mine and if you're a low level the boss
on<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.650> actually<00:03:37.100> pretty<00:03:37.370> hard<00:03:37.700> even<00:03:38.120> if

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
on this is actually pretty hard even if

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.870 
on this is actually pretty hard even if
you're<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.390> high<00:03:38.690> level<00:03:39.170> which<00:03:39.980> doesn't<00:03:40.760> really

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
you're a high level which doesn't really

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.090 
you're a high level which doesn't really
make<00:03:41.180> any<00:03:41.240> sense<00:03:41.750> but<00:03:41.960> I<00:03:42.020> guess<00:03:42.230> it's<00:03:42.530> an

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
make any sense but I guess it's an

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.850 
make any sense but I guess it's an
