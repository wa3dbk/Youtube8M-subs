00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 and that's so good July the first 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.490
 time maybe you left you went to the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.929
 wardrobe a little bit hot 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.400
 for the two goals in less than one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.250
 minute and a half but this second time 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 it played better than me I think they were 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 Our mistakes, most of all, not 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.609
 all ways a second time and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.890
 clearly favorable pain then I do not 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.570
 happy in a goal that gives us the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.430
 possibility of dreaming in Cochabamba and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.849
 can win and do the next 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.500
 instance 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.119
 good this team internationally 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.160
 begins to show yours 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.550
 and obviously we know the little to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.989
 little with what face and you think they're going to 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
 face the second leg with what 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.530
 team we are going to we are going to find 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.270
 as in the second half a team with 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 very hungry with great enthusiasm with desire 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.260
 do things well we have faced a 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 big the equator save is a team 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.980
 that is being formed is a team that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.110
 He has a lot of youth as he could see from 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.629
 every way I think a great second 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.309
 time then I think that people 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.809
 delights the tapes heard of all 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.359
 ways to keep working until that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 day I go a second of this cup 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.140
 south american bridgestone because you were 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.760
 for many Bolivian journalists the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.720
 candidate to take the selection of your 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.190
 country 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.050
 to ask why now the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.000
 duel between the box and Bolivia as you see 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.880
 the party of September 7 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 Well , what I've done has been technical 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.360
 The Bolivian team are the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.370
 leaders to those who have not wanted but 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.890
 the country wanted to be worthy to be of 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.780
 all ways I think the important thing is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.480
 that bolivia comes from here to a couple of 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.710
 days and make a great game I think what 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.630
 that you know what the part of the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.830
 attention that there is not a single player 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.300
 of this equipment that you are seeing 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.100
 that is taking off for my country in the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.870
 Bolivian selection because there was 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.729
 ask the technician I do not imagine that 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.960
 he is the one who surely does the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.220
 call the players of all 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.710
 Ways Ecuador has a great team 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.300
 is having a nice time I think that in 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 the last three world or four is 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.810
 fills the world has a barcelona 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.150
 have me taking it out will a fall 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 sporty quito then I think it goes 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.180
 to be a nice match the one that is going to 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.350
 play here and how they came back obviously 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.550
 I will always want him to do well 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.830
 my country anyway I want 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.330
 thank the Ecuadorian people for the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.460
 honey, because I have always been dispensed 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.900

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.970
 nice to dress that house that a great 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.470
 I greet my family in Bolivia to the fans 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.630
 pain to all the people the president to the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.070
 republic that trusts us all 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.190

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.570

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.680
 thank you very much because it is rare that you get 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.290
 coverage to a Bolivian of all 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.610
 ways I think the fire is changing 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.290
 the hemisphere of football is changing 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.600
