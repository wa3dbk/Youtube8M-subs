material bookmark and the strap to keep

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.400 
material bookmark and the strap to keep
it<00:00:38.680> all<00:00:38.800> nice<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.070> together<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:41.200> when

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
it all nice and together and but when

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.600 
it all nice and together and but when
you<00:00:41.530> look<00:00:41.680> at<00:00:41.710> them<00:00:41.890> from<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.100> top<00:00:42.370> you<00:00:42.580> can

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
you look at them from the top you can

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.270 
you look at them from the top you can
see<00:00:42.760> that<00:00:42.940> obviously<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.350> classic<00:00:44.530> one<00:00:44.950> is<00:00:45.130> a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
see that obviously the classic one is a

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.370 
see that obviously the classic one is a
much<00:00:45.850> bigger<00:00:46.150> thicker<00:00:46.540> book<00:00:46.870> with<00:00:47.110> far<00:00:47.350> more

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
much bigger thicker book with far more

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.270 
much bigger thicker book with far more
pages<00:00:48.540> these<00:00:49.540> however<00:00:49.870> even<00:00:50.860> as<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.010> set<00:00:51.250> of

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
pages these however even as a set of

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.660 
pages these however even as a set of
three<00:00:51.610> are<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:51.970> cheaper<00:00:52.570> alternative<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.670> I've

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
three are a cheaper alternative and I've

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.520 
three are a cheaper alternative and I've
got<00:00:54.880> to<00:00:54.970> say<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:55.120> really<00:00:55.180> do<00:00:55.630> like<00:00:55.930> these<00:00:56.140> I'm<00:00:56.470> a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
got to say I really do like these I'm a

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.590 
got to say I really do like these I'm a
big<00:00:56.770> families<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:58.000> know<00:00:58.030> this<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:58.450> gonna

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
big families you know this is gonna

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.590 
big families you know this is gonna
sound<00:00:58.870> very<00:00:59.230> sort<00:01:00.100> of<00:01:00.130> pamper<00:01:00.730> than<00:01:00.910> that<00:01:01.060> but

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
sound very sort of pamper than that but

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840 
sound very sort of pamper than that but
basically<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.440> like<00:01:02.920> these<00:01:03.190> better<00:01:03.460> than<00:01:03.730> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
basically I like these better than the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.120 
basically I like these better than the
other<00:01:04.000> one<00:01:04.210> because<00:01:04.570> these<00:01:04.780> are<00:01:05.170> much<00:01:05.740> slimmer

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
other one because these are much slimmer

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.910 
other one because these are much slimmer
and<00:01:06.430> just<00:01:07.090> about<00:01:07.330> fit<00:01:07.720> into<00:01:07.960> me<00:01:08.200> from<00:01:08.409> pocket<00:01:08.860> a

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
and just about fit into me from pocket a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.760 
and just about fit into me from pocket a
me<00:01:09.280> hey<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:11.110> moving<00:01:11.409> swiftly<00:01:11.530> on<00:01:11.830> hey<00:01:13.770> viv

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
me hey it moving swiftly on hey viv

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.860 
me hey it moving swiftly on hey viv
and<00:01:14.979> being<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.400> cheaper<00:01:15.880> alternative<00:01:15.940> that's

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
and being a cheaper alternative that's

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.570 
and being a cheaper alternative that's
something<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.860> can<00:01:18.010> see<00:01:18.220> straight<00:01:18.460> away

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
something that you can see straight away

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.820 
something that you can see straight away
by<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.420> fact<00:01:19.690> that<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.049> covers<00:01:20.409> are<00:01:20.650> all

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
by the fact that the covers are all

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.850 
by the fact that the covers are all
cardboard<00:01:21.549> although<00:01:22.330> even<00:01:23.170> with<00:01:23.500> them<00:01:23.680> being

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
cardboard although even with them being

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.370 
cardboard although even with them being
cardboard<00:01:24.430> there's<00:01:24.700> still<00:01:25.030> some<00:01:25.780> extent<00:01:26.200> a

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
cardboard there's still some extent a

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.399 
cardboard there's still some extent a
pocket<00:01:27.010> being<00:01:27.220> kept<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.940> back<00:01:28.270> they<00:01:28.720> cover

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
pocket being kept in the back they cover

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.960 
pocket being kept in the back they cover
so<00:01:30.040> that's<00:01:30.220> always<00:01:30.400> useful<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:31.120> have<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so that's always useful to have a and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.550 
so that's always useful to have a and
another<00:01:33.970> thing<00:01:34.240> I've<00:01:34.780> obviously<00:01:34.990> got<00:01:35.260> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
another thing I've obviously got the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.469 
another thing I've obviously got the
plane<00:01:36.159> paged<00:01:36.490> ones<00:01:36.940> here

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
plane paged ones here

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.690 
plane paged ones here
so<00:01:37.750> I'm<00:01:37.810> obsessed<00:01:38.260> with<00:01:38.500> writing<00:01:39.190> on<00:01:39.460> plain

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
so I'm obsessed with writing on plain

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.550 
so I'm obsessed with writing on plain
paper<00:01:39.970> whenever<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.510> can<00:01:40.810> instead<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.320> lined

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
paper whenever I can instead of lined

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.000 
paper whenever I can instead of lined
but<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.880> front<00:01:43.119> pages<00:01:43.630> I'm<00:01:44.080> not<00:01:44.470> sure<00:01:44.680> how

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
but the front pages I'm not sure how

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.340 
but the front pages I'm not sure how
many<00:01:45.070> pages<00:01:45.520> there<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:45.909> think<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:46.330> about<00:01:46.450> 64

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
many pages there I think it's about 64

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.460 
many pages there I think it's about 64
or<00:01:47.470> something<00:01:47.799> like<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:50.049> Front's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
or something like that and the Front's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.310 
or something like that and the Front's
are<00:01:50.590> all<00:01:50.830> just<00:01:51.100> normal<00:01:51.310> pages<00:01:51.880> whereas<00:01:52.869> the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
are all just normal pages whereas the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.740 
are all just normal pages whereas the
set<00:01:53.710> at<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.979> back<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.970> once<00:01:55.270> again<00:01:55.420> I'm<00:01:55.630> not

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
set at the back and once again I'm not

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.469 
set at the back and once again I'm not
sure<00:01:55.990> how<00:01:56.320> many<00:01:56.380> there<00:01:56.890> are<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.070> each<00:01:57.400> but<00:01:58.330> you

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
sure how many there are of each but you

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.940 
sure how many there are of each but you
may<00:01:58.659> or<00:01:58.750> may<00:01:58.869> not<00:01:58.900> be<00:01:59.140> able<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.380> see<00:01:59.560> but<00:01:59.770> these

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
may or may not be able to see but these

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.999 
may or may not be able to see but these
are<00:02:00.159> all<00:02:00.280> already<00:02:01.090> pre<00:02:01.420> perforated<00:02:02.170> which<00:02:02.799> is

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
are all already pre perforated which is

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.620 
are all already pre perforated which is
definitely<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.549> handy<00:02:03.909> thing<00:02:03.939> for<00:02:04.360> being<00:02:04.509> able

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
definitely a handy thing for being able

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.260 
definitely a handy thing for being able
to<00:02:04.840> quickly<00:02:05.020> tear<00:02:05.439> right<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:05.979> especially<00:02:06.970> on

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
to quickly tear right and especially on

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.300 
to quickly tear right and especially on
notebooks<00:02:08.019> like<00:02:08.140> this<00:02:08.470> that<00:02:08.739> after<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.159> Year

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
sewn in pages and so it's much better to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.720 
sewn in pages and so it's much better to
have<00:02:13.569> them<00:02:13.900> prepare<00:02:14.439> for<00:02:14.469> ated<00:02:14.980> instead
