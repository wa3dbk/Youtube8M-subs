00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.700
 yes always loses the overview 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.550
 if you have any with world hit 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 com always puts com positions at the end 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.970
 any funny educated ones out 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.710
 or you can not see where he is anymore 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.450
 is the first or maybe the second 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.460
 position was then this is 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.880
 modifications just right for 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 you 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.950
 because the world in the theory addon 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 help you with the selected area 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.649
 make world visible 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.089
 I can also do that as art 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.769
 demonstrate that here it is the evil 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.499
 not you wanted to say we click 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.050
 left click and there is a position 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.699
 one we are now just here 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.399
 a right click and it arises 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.170
 a position two you see 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.179
 starting point so where we put it 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 All you have to do is turn green 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:58.859
 marked and the endpoint turns blue 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 marked you see so this area 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.620
 is now selected and if you always 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.809
 somehow it runs out of something 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 right click makes you know then you have to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.690
 Now I have the area wrong 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 now we will choose one 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.830
 right area from we look if that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.300
 addon works well at all and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.060
 Just set it for example 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.400
 Here is a blog so once the material 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.190
 1 the whole thing works 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.290
 Great the whole one can also with the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.050
 ecspand order super benefits so to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.450
 example expand 10 when we go up 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.520
 the grid 10 will look upwards 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 extended where we move that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 it is still correct upward arc 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.240
 then do / lep's pen right 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.760
 written with shift 10 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.050
 and already the whole first one was going to tell 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.330
 blocks in the air 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.300
 So here's the whole thing is relative 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.340
 practically the grid is very good and 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.840
 be nice if it somehow 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.760
 sometime it bothers him when he comes to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.410
 example ready or any exception 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.180
 and there is always a red box 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.740
 you can drag it all over 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.090
 Just remove again we have to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.000
 do not install it for this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.470
 it is sufficient to enter the command / cell 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.040
 so written 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.900
 cel and then the position is the same 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.760
 still selected away selection 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.460
 Polished that is already everything 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.990
 what is the addon world does the whole 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.180
 works in singleplayer if you 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.490
 singleplayer commons with extension 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.470
 install as much multiplayer if 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.390
 the plug-in world is installed 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.900
 now it was finally the mod 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.040
 installation on the desktop at so and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.860
 there we are already at the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.700
 installation that will be more of the cdu 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.700
 addons arrived 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.070
 you need the same for the model 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.650
 with math lola in this case for the 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.300
 version 1.4 point 2 or just yours 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.180
 version because this is here and you 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.410
 needs the courage directly so we invite 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.060
 The whole time down here 's here 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.700
 just a few no download problems 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.670
 So let's take this dropbox 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.680
 download link click as it once 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.450
 and we once gave her the mod 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.940
 down and then we still need that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.010
 like even - model or we find 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.140
 here and live the download direct 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.430
 so we do not have any advertising 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.610
 so we have to skip that 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.489
 Whole and then we have already 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.580
 these two files with winrar 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.440
 open in front of us and now 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.700
 Press the windows button and the r 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.380
 Taste or come in somehow 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.989
 and also in this version field 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.930
 Then we give percent abb data percent 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.820
 a click on the ok button scroll 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.330
 down or maybe you too 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.820
 go up endpoint minecraft on served 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.040
 am folder and find a folder here 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.019
 minecraft or minecraft points now 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.620
 is it important to disable minecraft 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.849
 or turn off minecraft 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.709
 Of course not the isolate clock 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.019
 turn off you open the minecraft 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.900
 even with windmill 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.269
 here , if everything is normal, it should be normal 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.680
 find a folder in kates flight 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.590
 is written so only with pretense 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.209
 marked bull died and in meta 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.129
 and press on the farthest and 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.260
 then the way is because this folder is 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.909
 as often said, very angry blocks 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:12.010
 all monsters so now we have the 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:13.720
 world ccw tron ​​1.4.2011 talla zions 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.940
 instructions and these files are coming now 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.699
 here in the minecraft pick up on 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.209
 pull over the dot folder and ok 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.850
 click 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.130
 that was really easy and that's why 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.289
 also install the same model or 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.510
 this is the motto or is for that 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.310
 responsible for this engine as the name 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.500
 already says loading is so pull 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.780
 but what about p 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.050
 and then we have the whole house already 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.970
 and that's what it was 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.860
 Video I wish you much fun like that 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.490
 this works fine in the game part 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.030
 Seen so until the next video from 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.030
