good in my hands the Nikon is really
small<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.420> light<00:00:33.660> weighted<00:00:34.219> but<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.670> me

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820

although<00:00:40.379> I'm<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> tanning<00:00:41.010> shooter<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> am

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
although I'm a tanning shooter so I am

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
although I'm a tanning shooter so I am
always<00:00:42.210> biased<00:00:42.750> towards<00:00:43.050> them<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
always biased towards them so the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.540 
always biased towards them so the
autofocus<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> Nikon<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:45.030> spot-on<00:00:45.440> 39

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
autofocus for the Nikon was spot-on 39

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.889 
autofocus for the Nikon was spot-on 39
autofocus<00:00:47.550> points<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> nine<00:00:48.300> cross-type

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
autofocus points with a nine cross-type

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.900 
autofocus points with a nine cross-type
it<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.260> amazing<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.010> got<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> subject

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it was amazing it got the subject

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.360 
it was amazing it got the subject
perfect<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.899> point<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> Canon<00:00:52.770> wasn't<00:00:53.100> bad<00:00:53.219> at

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
perfect on point the Canon wasn't bad at

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.400 
perfect on point the Canon wasn't bad at
all<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.699> got<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> shot

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
all I got the shot

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
all I got the shot
the<00:00:55.410> autofocus<00:00:55.800> definitely<00:00:56.460> goes<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the autofocus definitely goes to the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
the autofocus definitely goes to the
Nikon<00:00:57.449> hands<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:59.160> just

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Nikon hands down because it's just

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
Nikon hands down because it's just
awesome<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.940> don't<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.660> much<00:01:00.870> thoughts<00:01:01.140> on

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
awesome I don't have much thoughts on

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.689 
awesome I don't have much thoughts on
the<00:01:01.379> brush<00:01:01.559> shooting<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.070> both<00:01:02.280> cameras

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the brush shooting for both cameras

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
the brush shooting for both cameras
because<00:01:03.000> they<00:01:03.180> both<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.600> 5<00:01:03.840> frames<00:01:04.140> per

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
because they both have 5 frames per

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.590 
because they both have 5 frames per
second<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.460> only<00:01:05.700> thing<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.090> has<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
second the only thing that has the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.080 
second the only thing that has the
advantage<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.590> Nikon<00:01:07.979> autofocus<00:01:08.970> system

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
advantage is the Nikon autofocus system

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
advantage is the Nikon autofocus system
so<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> ISO<00:01:10.290> Nikon<00:01:10.710> wins<00:01:10.979> once<00:01:11.340> again

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so with the ISO Nikon wins once again

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.830 
so with the ISO Nikon wins once again
because<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> goes<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.479> twenty<00:01:12.689> five

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
because it goes up to twenty five

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
because it goes up to twenty five
thousand<00:01:13.200> six<00:01:13.320> hundred<00:01:13.549> Canon<00:01:14.549> doesn't<00:01:14.729> fall

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
thousand six hundred Canon doesn't fall

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
thousand six hundred Canon doesn't fall
short<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.610> 12,500<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
short of that with the 12,500 but the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
short of that with the 12,500 but the
grain<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> very<00:01:19.650> noticeable<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.700> video

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
grain is very noticeable for this video

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.399 
grain is very noticeable for this video
shooting<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> Nikon<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:22.140> really

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
shooting with the Nikon was really

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.130 
shooting with the Nikon was really
smooth<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> 60<00:01:23.700> frames<00:01:23.850> per<00:01:24.119> second<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
smooth with the 60 frames per second the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.859 
smooth with the 60 frames per second the
Canon<00:01:25.439> was<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:26.009> point<00:01:26.549> also<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> has<00:01:27.540> 30

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
Canon was on point also but it has 30

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
Canon was on point also but it has 30
frames<00:01:28.170> per<00:01:28.259> second<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.220> smooth

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
frames per second so it's not as smooth

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
frames per second so it's not as smooth
so<00:01:30.299> let's<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.600> downstairs<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.229> these

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so let's go downstairs and get these

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.859 
so let's go downstairs and get these
pictures<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.250> video<00:01:32.579> together<00:01:32.850> alright<00:01:33.270> so

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
pictures and video together alright so

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.749 
pictures and video together alright so
the<00:01:33.960> similarities<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.159> first<00:01:35.430> shooting

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the similarities are the first shooting

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.179 
the similarities are the first shooting
the<00:01:36.119> very<00:01:36.390> angled<00:01:36.810> LCD<00:01:37.259> screen<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the very angled LCD screen and the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.890 
the very angled LCD screen and the
special<00:01:38.670> effects<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.600> difference

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
special effects now for the difference

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.289 
special effects now for the difference
is<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> image<00:01:40.439> quality<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.250> autofocus<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
is the image quality the autofocus the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
is the image quality the autofocus the
ISO<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.200> video<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.920> shooter<00:01:44.189> with

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
ISO and the video at the shooter with

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.359 
ISO and the video at the shooter with
the<00:01:44.399> d50<00:01:44.790> 500<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> t5i<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.590> Nikon<00:01:47.100> wins

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the d50 500 in the t5i the Nikon wins

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.969 
the d50 500 in the t5i the Nikon wins
and<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:49.350> again<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.799> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and down but then again you have to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.010 
and down but then again you have to
remember<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.430> t5i<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.360> three<00:01:51.750> year<00:01:51.780> old

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
remember the t5i is a three year old

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.170 
remember the t5i is a three year old
camera<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.340> relieves<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.820> future

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
camera and it just relieves the future
