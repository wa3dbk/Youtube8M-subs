00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.649
 character as invoker many consider 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.150
 this character elite because he 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.670
 requires good skill faster 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 respond presses the necessary buttons on 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.940
 Actually the hardest in the game 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.740
 invoker this is just remember how 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.750
 remain the spell the easiest 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 fill spells like sanstrayk 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.640
 it is made of three spheres koldsnep fire 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.099
 consisting of three spheres of ice and ampy 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.689
 consisting of three spheres you x and the rest 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.269
 you will be remembered for five or six 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.769
 game with bots yes yes with bots like 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.870
 once there you can practice everything 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.880
 skills invoker without reproaches comrades on 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.260
 team to ska get up wrong 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 skin that was needed in one way or another 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.129
 situations now I will tell you 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.250
 relatively simple but my favorite 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.750
 assembly kvass exort did not play about 80 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.110
 games and I can recognize her very much 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.149
 effective cues cues cues 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 cold snaps this skill is the basis 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.539
 kvass exort nokero with this 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.219
 skill you will put mini mills 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.829
 additional damage to the enemy of each 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.219
 your average attack is enough for 4 5 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.469
 beats 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.090
 a small skill amendment does not work 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.460
 only from your blows but also from blows 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.170
 allies therefore if the enemy is beaten by creeps 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.090
 or allies then throwing it Cold 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.040
 snep you make it very unpleasant 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.310
 use fire to inflict on him 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.740
 as much damage as possible . 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.360
 forge in front if i have one cake in front 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.189
 leaves the enemy in trouble 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.530
 good damage and reduced armor with 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.720
 each attack then 2 forge in front of which 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.850
 appears after pumping kvass and exort 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.700
 she 4 just won't let her get out 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.310
 cool on the enemy also having level 10 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.229
 you can hardly pick up 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 first roshana tanking one for job 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.070
 then to others as soon as they die 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.430
 call the second headlights dj and finish 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.430
 Roshana 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.759
 ee sanstrayk though this skill and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.920
 requires the player to direct hands and skill 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.860
 you can master it in an average of 10 15 games 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.960
 for the invoker a lot and what did you want for that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.700
 This is an Invoker, even in the beginning of this skill and not 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.920
 does damage to him and you can calmly 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.869
 finish off the fleeing enemy think 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.490
 that it is too difficult to practice 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.319
 or in extreme cases ask your 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.270
 forgot to play a friend ax or b.h. 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.159
 thanks and fornication and track gander you 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.420
 you can calmly aim and hit 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.580
 target its fiery ray 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.170
 do not forget that the crowd rushes to the track 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.269
 can not be because the damage is distributed 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.220
 equally at all to get into it 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.080
 mushrooms use a small chip 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.880
 look at your half of my card 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.860
 look where the creeps go 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.230
 as the card is symmetrical where 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.299
 creeps go with us in the same place but mirror 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.069
 reflection will go creeps from opponents 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.580
 Now I will show you an example kill for 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.920
 invoker 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.780
 I asked a friend to run at low hp on 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.310
 base and he tried to get with strike 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.310
 that's how he trains 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.850
 Do not forget that a cunning opponent can 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.520
 man poke from sanstrayk but in my 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.650
 case it did not help him to throw 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.130
 Sunstrike or deceleration also 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.130
 very good 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.180
 do not forget that you do not always 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.870
 it will turn out well to throw sanstrayk without 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.190
 lumen key 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.190
 here is an example from my personal experience 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.930
 I wish you all a good game for 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.670
 invoker if you liked the video 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.500
 Like and write a comment 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.580
 it will help me a lot 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.580
 thanks for watching everyone
