00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:21.250
 the box is assembled and installed in the opening 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:21.250
 so we already have all these sizes on top 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.820
 one of the subtleties and necessary 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.800
 preferably have tinctures 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.949
 so that when we pump up 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.159
 sexy-r'n'b 100 we have no light rings 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:42.379
 with transverse internal breaks in 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:44.809
 cross sleep when mounting door 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.960
 we need a lot of boxes for clinics 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.659
 wedges can even last for installation 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.760
 in special packaging stores for 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.489
 10 pieces of letters for some specific 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.920
 goals but we need a lot and 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.370
 need different sizes ie 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.019
 initially what we do expose 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.089
 miter saw about two s 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.270
 half three degrees not ninety two 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.540
 and a half three degrees and beyond 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.300
 I personally do to the world of sawing 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.350
 and turn over the workpiece after each 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.660
 open clinic Julia immediately a lot for everything 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.660
 dimensions so that later uniqueness 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:52.140
 next moment problems 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:02:01.670
 corrected the first thing who like 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:17.280
 I personally expose to do it with a little 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:18.660
 literally canvas we stretched 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.790
 little door box 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.790
 from the vertical we move to filled 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:34.280
 loops on the top millimeter shift between 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:42.480
 houses vertical we insert the edges of the loop 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:45.900
 here we have just finished stretching 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 to samovar canvas from the village strictly 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.880
 vertically hole under the loop and we 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.420
 let's forget some vertica im not 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:01.170
 there is a little bit of us so that 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.720
 us load fell on the twisted 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.600
 screw that will not let 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.340
 move to keep us fresh 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.250
 need to make the door you will 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.450
 sit pressure on the bottom itself not death for 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.610
 mares she will blow 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.709
 if through a white jacket will she 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.860
 crushes 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.879
 therefore, it’s not easy 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.150
 preferably got to 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.150
 wooden wedge 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:47.210
 first took this does not 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.510
 figured on the screws we laid 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.550
 wedges on the inside can be lining 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.040
 can we show 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.680
 you can become pulled set door 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.970
 box so mate 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.860
 what is she on a horse 5 floor where spend 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.740
 foam in our case will not be 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.910
 the fastening element and a component 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.810
 for filling the next one such 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:17.989
 small we are quite an important point 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.109
 if you install the door the 1st is necessary 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.980
 weighed 200 one man the door 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.730
 quite complicated almost always 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.730
 remains 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.080
 first tilted so spun upper 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.080
 and lower 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:15.490
 landing nests under moved 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.360
 remains 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:39.050
 follows so much 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:42.650
 Why do we immediately exhibit different 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:50.690
 different geometry and the answer is already 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:53.659
 set by the next mounting step 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.180
 door frame we will fasten close here 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:58.190
 this part of the drill in response to the response 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.110
 parts that is literally here in that 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.779
 the place where we enter is drilled 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.430
 zink hole it twist screw 

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.719
 install lining 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.719
 we expose the gaper 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:18.289
 the door leaf of this plane 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:20.990
 must be fully adjacent granddaughter 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:23.919
 open push it itself we don’t 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.349
 drawn and neatly let see 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:30.440
 that's where you can adjust 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:34.940
 Everything is fine now exposed in 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:38.569
 In our case, the door works once 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:43.509
 closed without any slamming twitching 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:43.509
 and in the closed state, it does not play
