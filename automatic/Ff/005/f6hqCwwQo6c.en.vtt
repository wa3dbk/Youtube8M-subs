00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.040
 so apparently that's it we were in 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.680
 moving forward on implements 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.360
 side by side and I knocked on the door 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.630
 passenger with our points 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:20.089
 so well it's not he maybe 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:24.079
 I may have ruined his car or and he 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:27.620
 hurled me on a truck he hurt me 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:31.330
 what and suddenly if he was accused of 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.330
 aggression with a weapon 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.940
 it happened it was a trauma 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.580
 cranial and then he made me I had some 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.270
 scars and a broken head in 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.250
 done on facial and after I was put 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.130
 in artificial coma to relieve the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.240
 pain actually to the hospital and then 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.670
 of that, it has been 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.890
 rehabilitation 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.809
 even knew how to stay in the hospital for two 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.370
 month I believe and then I had to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.320
 re-learn to speak I re-learn from 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.680
 basic things that I take my life in 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.689
 did not almost it was just at the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.689
 brain case that had pain 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.380
 I am done 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.770
 finally it's not so much anymore 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.480
 is called I lost my words but it's 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.520
 endurance I have a lot less 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.800
 in ten years ago then before 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.960
 we're going to go like the day I got my 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.760
 crash I'm going to make my day in 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.100
 as for his and I could hold 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.350
 a sum a day in order to ride on 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.340
 my bike and everything is now I would have 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 much trouble 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.160
 recently I went around the island and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.470
 well yeah I held two hours 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.470
 maybe but this offer 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.810
 at the health level see this as going 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.320
 continue what I'm doing for here 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.200
 a year and a half almost relearn what 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.840
 what must be done to be 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130
 independent in quotation marks 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.740
 even if I'm not totally 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.789
 independent but that's what it takes 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:16.240
 so I'd like to maybe do some 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.020
 studies for a job or between friends 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.020
 I do not know we'll see
