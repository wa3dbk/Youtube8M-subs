could<00:00:00.210> be<00:00:00.329> added<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> premium<00:00:01.979> premium<00:00:02.669> only

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
could be added to a premium premium only

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.230 
could be added to a premium premium only
2012<00:00:03.929> TV<00:00:04.609> and<00:00:05.609> it<00:00:06.180> basically<00:00:07.370> takes<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.670> dual

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
2012 TV and it basically takes the dual

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.180 
2012 TV and it basically takes the dual
core<00:00:09.510> processor<00:00:10.110> that's<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.440> last<00:00:10.679> year's<00:00:10.889> TV

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
core processor that's in last year's TV

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.100 
core processor that's in last year's TV
makes<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.700> 1.3<00:00:12.240> gigahertz<00:00:12.630> quad-core

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
makes that a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.039 
makes that a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core
processor<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.400> improves<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> GPU<00:00:15.420> gives<00:00:15.900> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
processor it improves the GPU gives a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.760 
processor it improves the GPU gives a
more<00:00:16.230> system<00:00:16.740> memory<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.720> makes<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
more system memory so that it makes you

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.160 
more system memory so that it makes you
know<00:00:19.859> last<00:00:20.250> year's<00:00:20.580> TV<00:00:20.939> perform<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> 2013

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
know last year's TV perform like a 2013

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.310 
know last year's TV perform like a 2013
plus<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.220> gain<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> new<00:00:24.320> smart

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
plus you gain all of the new smart

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.890 
plus you gain all of the new smart
interface<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> increases<00:00:27.779> of

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
interface and all the increases of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.660 
interface and all the increases of
functionality<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.680> only<00:00:28.859> even<00:00:29.340> make<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
functionality it only even make the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.980 
functionality it only even make the
picture<00:00:29.880> look<00:00:30.000> better<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.810> had<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
picture look better so if you had to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.569 
picture look better so if you had to
guess<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.470> evolution<00:00:31.890> kit<00:00:32.040> how<00:00:32.309> long<00:00:32.460> would

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
guess with evolution kit how long would

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.190 
guess with evolution kit how long would
you<00:00:32.640> expect<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.239> be<00:00:33.570> supported

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you expect this to actually be supported

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:48.310 
you expect this to actually be supported
so<00:00:34.230> if<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.500> thought<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> reason<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> go

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.020 

about<00:00:49.320> seven<00:00:49.590> years<00:00:49.800> used<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.250> 10<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.910> it's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
about seven years used to be 10 but it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.319 
about seven years used to be 10 but it's
now<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.300> 7<00:00:51.719> years<00:00:51.890> we<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.039> support<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
now about 7 years we will support the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.369 
now about 7 years we will support the
2012<00:00:54.899> TV<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.289> 2016<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.750> four<00:00:58.109> year

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
2012 TV in 2016 you will see a four year

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.650 
2012 TV in 2016 you will see a four year
supporting<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.460> will<00:00:59.730> drag<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.149> TV<00:01:00.449> along

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
supporting you will drag your TV along

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.860 
supporting you will drag your TV along
four<00:01:00.989> years<00:01:01.199> that's<00:01:02.190> pretty<00:01:02.370> good<00:01:02.750> like<00:01:03.750> you

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
four years that's pretty good like you

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.660 
four years that's pretty good like you
said<00:01:04.049> consumers<00:01:04.680> upgrade<00:01:05.010> once<00:01:05.309> every<00:01:05.519> like

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
said consumers upgrade once every like

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.719 
said consumers upgrade once every like
seven<00:01:06.030> years<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> mean<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> how

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
seven years so I mean what is that how

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.039 
seven years so I mean what is that how
can<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.030> say<00:01:09.210> oh<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.659> gonna<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.930> more

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
can you say oh you're gonna get more

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.359 
can you say oh you're gonna get more
system<00:01:10.439> memory<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> maybe<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.130> gonna<00:01:11.220> get

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
system memory and maybe you're gonna get

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.219 
system memory and maybe you're gonna get
a<00:01:11.430> faster<00:01:11.820> processor<00:01:12.360> unless<00:01:12.869> you're<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.200> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
a faster processor unless you're like a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.810 
a faster processor unless you're like a
tech<00:01:13.500> geek<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:14.010> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> hard<00:01:14.520> sell

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
tech geek that's kind of a hard sell

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.539 
tech geek that's kind of a hard sell
right<00:01:15.090> what's<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> cost<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.549> cost

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
right what's the cost of this thing cost

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.160 
right what's the cost of this thing cost
has<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.909> been<00:01:18.060> announced<00:01:18.509> yet<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
back of the TV it's a simple upgrade

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.679 
back of the TV it's a simple upgrade
that<00:01:36.930> somebody<00:01:37.259> could<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.450> it's

that somebody could do and you know it's

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.789 
that somebody could do and you know it's
one<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.900> those<00:01:40.049> things<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> don't

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
one of those things that if you don't

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.620 
one of those things that if you don't
see<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> value<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.700> year<00:01:41.759> fine<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
see the value in it this year fine you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.730 
see the value in it this year fine you
don't<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> buy<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.290> year<00:01:43.530> your

things improve in the 2014 model so you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.679 
things improve in the 2014 model so you
know<00:01:50.189> things<00:01:50.490> always<00:01:50.790> move<00:01:50.939> forward<00:01:50.970> very

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
know things always move forward very

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.810 
know things always move forward very
cool<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.430> wave<00:01:53.640> at
