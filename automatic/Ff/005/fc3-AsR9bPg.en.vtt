00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.230 
still working with the product to figure
out<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:34.320> much<00:01:35.070> product<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.820> actually

appropriate<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.439> my<00:01:37.890> under-eye<00:01:38.659> when<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> was

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
appropriate for my under-eye when I was

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.569 
appropriate for my under-eye when I was
started<00:01:40.229> putting<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.860> you'll<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.400> this

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
started putting this on you'll see this

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.910 
started putting this on you'll see this
in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> video<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.869> side<00:01:43.140> had<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> really

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
in the video that one side had a really

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.359 
in the video that one side had a really
thicker<00:01:45.290> application<00:01:46.290> than<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> other<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
thicker application than the other and I

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.060 
thicker application than the other and I
find<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> thinner<00:01:48.390> application<00:01:49.259> seems

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
find that the thinner application seems

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.249 
find that the thinner application seems
to<00:01:50.310> blend<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:50.909> bit<00:01:51.180> better<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.990> just

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to blend a little bit better and is just

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
to blend a little bit better and is just
as<00:01:52.380> effective<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.090> putting

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
as effective as just really like putting

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.940 
as effective as just really like putting
a<00:01:54.689> whole<00:01:54.869> bunch<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.170> product<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:55.890> eye
