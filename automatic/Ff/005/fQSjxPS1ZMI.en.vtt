00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 Even if it is running in New York, let's just go back and really only go for six days 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.170
 Maybe I'm not talking about metabolism because I have not entered it 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.170
 that 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:20.440
 What a foolish meal was delicious This is a trip to the United States of America 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.440
 Also I've been thinking I Na delicious food from time to time there Tsu America for a long time 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:31.029
 It 's a gourmet person who said it was delicious in America 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.810

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.350
 Cooking 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.160
 For example, omelette sometimes eats that morning depending on how delicious the material is. 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.110
 But 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.890
 The deliciousness of the omelet 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.450
 How much Toka how much put butter of Tteyuu omelet taste to eat in Japan 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:52.090
 It's the heat of 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.680
 But the American omelet thinks that kind of thing at all and the shop where I entered is such a subtle thing 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.600
 It's not a shop to think about 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 That 's the best part of that example, ah, but that blue dark turban 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.130
 I went to a store called 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.260

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:09.860
 Former President Obama who is in a place near the preservation also flies and eats well 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.510
 In a place that eat breakfast America of completed active duty of bureaucracy Toka morning 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.460
 In the morning, the Is because doing from 6:30 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:22.140

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.910
 It's not commensurate seat To be Kedomo I went the other really to being said Fu that let's 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 If the table is off it 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.220
 So Americans eat so-called breakfast and so-called power breakfast 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.500
 It is guy 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.140
 Morning life in Japan is translated into a bit uncomfortable words , but 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:43.270
 Tomorrow is if there is a morning work flow to the United States also this by trying to conference while eating breakfast for the time being 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.990
 There is a trend of European culture that it is not good to talk about work while eating dinner 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.340
 It is a culture that no aristocrats usually work 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.490
 Talk while eating rice and ridiculous that such a vulgar Nante story work while eating that rice 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.110
 Is an art 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.829
 There is a European culture that is limited to the family sports story, so it is not American culture. 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.220
 If not 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.440
 For now 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 Work work is America's madly I also forgot to death eye in the first Well 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.000
 I think that there is an executive run and drink at such lunch meetings 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.590
 I was tired 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.980
 Story try Toka lunch meeting while eating lunch when saying the 1950s 60 yen Dora 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.210

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.740
 Power breakfast because I became more busy 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:29.260

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.440

 Since the rest is to say Washington dc come people, such as the so-called lobbying 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.410
 Well in that sense 1 in the United States 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.270

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.120
 Ri was seasoned or seasoned soon lie 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.980
 Well , I went after the seasoning because it is American health-oriented recently 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.950
 In Well bpk little myself issued stealing ketchup a beer to say that it has been found 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.740
 It opened even a whiff of bad people or are you doing this to everyone people of the beyond 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:41.170

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:55.730
 It is said that such a good omelet It is an exquisite village like you eat out like eating a hotel 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.970
 There is no such delicious but delicious 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.300
 Even if the bacon be so adults do go with Aomori taste of the eggs 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.300
 I know of'll're Americans there that bacon there is light 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.890
 Japan There is a translation of the old rice bowl in Japan Japan 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.120
 Look before me and I went to a crisp in the American bacon even though I'm roster at the time of breakfast 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.930
 I laughed a lot 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.959
 There is something like bacon grilled and it is like a toaster that is in an alpine shape 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.810
 If you bake bacon parrot on this, the oil will fall down more and more like this 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.310
 I'm say that it is bacon of Happikkari 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.360
 I bought something and this is great I'm good what I bought and I bought bacon 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.610
 Everyone 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.460
 I am ryobi to anything 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.620
 But that's 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.190
 Unit price of cooking method to the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:47.130
 Progress to have France 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:50.790
 Because whether Europe world came over to the New World from the Americans still seek sweetness 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:55.920
 How much is the height of that corn power 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:05:01.210
 If it is egg height or bacon, say something like pork height 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:05.280
 Of course there is a shop with a better store degree, but I think this time 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:10.710
 That simple material power that I thought that American food is delicious after all 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:16.590
