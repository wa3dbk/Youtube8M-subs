and what we know right now it's going to

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.030 
and what we know right now it's going to
be<00:00:30.849> running<00:00:31.029> an<00:00:31.180> eight<00:00:31.390> core<00:00:31.720> cpu<00:00:32.259> with<00:00:32.470> an<00:00:32.559> x86

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
be running an eight core cpu with an x86

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.890 
be running an eight core cpu with an x86
processor<00:00:33.970> it's<00:00:34.180> also<00:00:34.390> going<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.660> have<00:00:34.870> a
