00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.950 
could be a couple of reasons for that
firstly<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.880> need<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.119> shift<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.570> tons<00:01:25.840> of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.540 
firstly the need to shift to tons of
methyl<00:01:26.290> means<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:26.860> it's<00:01:27.010> difficult<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.400> run

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
methyl means that it's difficult to run
