Hello I'm Tania and in this video we're going to talk about korean makeup

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.000
KOREAN MAKEUP Chapter 1

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.040
As some of you know, a short time ago, approximately 3 weeks ago I opened a little store

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:21.260
on facebook where I sell korean makeup and accesories from Korea, Japan and China

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.360
So, I've been trying different products and today I'm going to talk about

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.260
4 of them which are the ones I'm using right now and that I love

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.480
There are some other products I would like to talk about too but that would be in further episodes

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.340
so for today, let's start

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.400
The first product I want to tell you about is this one

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.040
It's a rice mask from the brand Skin Food

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.580
It's used once or twice a week, I use it once

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.500
every sunday i put on my mask and I leave it for 10-15 minutes

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.000
i wash my face and that's it, I have a clean, fresh face free of dirt

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.060
This product has been very good for me because there are times when I've used exfoliators

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.720
and they are very aggressive for my skin, I have a very sensitive skin so

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.640
any thing can cause me allergies, breakouts, redness and it's very uncomfortable so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.080
this product has given me very good results and I recommend it a lot

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.040
Another product is this adorable and super cute little planda

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.580
This little panda is for all of us who enjoy going to sleep very late

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.060
Yes, I'm a person who sleeps very late always, ever since I remember I always go to sleep very late at night

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.300
So this product has been my ally because it's a little bar, like a giant lipstick

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.160
And this bar is cold, it's alwys cold so I apply it around my eyes, I give it a little massage

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.060
when I wake up

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.320
and that's it, the tiredness of my eyes is gone and as I keep using it, it starts to help with my eye bags

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.800
so this is a great product for all of us doramaniacs who enjoy going to sleep late

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.980
and staying awake until very late hours or not sleeping watching doramas

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.320
I recommend this one a lot, it's very cute, its design is adorable you can't deny it it's beautiful!

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.700
Next one is this one

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.960
This is a mask that is used at night to sleep

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.600
I found it very practical and effective. It's from Etude House  and this product

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.320
is a mask without color and you apply it before going to sleep  so at night

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.400
you wash your face, apply this product, you go to sleep and when you wake up to a beautiful skin

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.220
It feels very light and creamy so it feels super nice and good when you apply it on your face

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.640
I like this a lot and recomment it too

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.060
Another very popular product in Korea I'm sure you'll be very interested in are lip tints

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.380
This one is also from Etude House and is cherry colored

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.160
it's like pink, it's the one I'm using right now

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.720
So I've liked this one a lot because of its smell, its design, its consistency and is long lasting

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.580
You can use it in the morning, you apply it in the morning and in the afternoor you'll still have colour on your lips

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.740
So it is also a very good product and also very cute, I recommend it a lot

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.160
So if you're from Mexico and are interested in acquiring any of these products or any other product

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.160
Truth is korean products have surprised me a lot, all of the ones I've used have been very effective

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.700
and very good. So I recomment them a lot
