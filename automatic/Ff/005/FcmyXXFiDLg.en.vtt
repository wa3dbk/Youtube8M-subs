00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 for atos so here we are found to 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.460
 how to install a mode because I have 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.109
 had a lot of people on the forum who 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.269
 could not install a change mode and 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.620
 a5 who had a problem that the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.080
 files sort download every time 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.089
 caen launch does what you have 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.960
 in fact right click on the shortcut gta5 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.250
 you are doing file replacement 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.619
 then in the folder or create a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.949
 fashion folder with majestic pieces 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.929
 like here then it depends on your 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.059
 words of you will see on the modes or me 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.469
 look at their enemies or on the site at 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.270
 every time you have the record 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.120
 installed as they say here they do 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.300
 go back to the 64 points rpf the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.969
 Belgian in five point rpf vehicles 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:50.120
 so what we're going to do is actually 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:56.129
 we decompress the x 64 th point rpf 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.989
 finally we copy it or copy and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.289
 you paste it into month mode was trying 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.480
 already done because I have skins is 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.500
 in fact once it's done in 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.500
 paint 4 I think everyone has it 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.500
 this is in open 4 but install the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.479
 mode including the 64th by sme installed in 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.740
 the folder mode these are 80 first PF 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.899
 in fact it allows that when you have the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.729
 script to launch the modes launched 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.369
 automatically with the mode folder 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.100
 what and when you uninstall all 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 scripts to launch the modes at least 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.890
 you keep the original files of the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.890
 game not in the original files 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:53.030
 if not vehicles committed here 64 rpf 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.030

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.290

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:19.660
