00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello to all and david pug 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.310
 from the blog to take the car 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.799
 so today we will see a little 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.230
 how to paint a candle so we go 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.120
 see all the little things so 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.910
 So that's the first thing 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 to do is we go so voila voila 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 we have these two there an area that will be 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.980
 dark and a lighter area here so 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
 we will start by limiting these two 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 so we start right away with a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.789
 few young caddy means for 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 make the first base of this area 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.579
 go ahead so here I put some of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 yellow 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.649
 we continue now so what 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.050
 I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.040
 to begin thoroughly is my my base 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.110
 so I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 brown a little red a little blue 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.420
 of which sold dark colors and we 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.219
 will work directly on the canvas 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.160
 and not on the pallet we are not 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.090
 forced to work on the planet 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.370
 to mix on the planet 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.230
 so it's progressing well 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.030
 so now what are we going to do 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 we're going to start the other part 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 our area which is bright so with 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.490
 a first layer of white so the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.189
 white it's really for the light 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.150
 so it's his party is put is spread 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.710
 this first layer of white on 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.030
 do not hesitate, we really cover up 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.060
 the second part here and I start 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.330
 gently melt with the party 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 more obscure here softly gently 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.720
 the goal is actually going to be to do the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.400
 transition precisely between this area of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:37.470
 light and cdn more obscure so that's it 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.159
 we continue in stall it goes slowly 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.049
 slowly 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 so that's really a first base 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.630
 it's just already to set the tone of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.630
 our candle 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.050
 so now here we are trying to 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.430
 take somehow that color 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.470
 which are much more obscure and of the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 bring back to the light precisely and 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:08.670
 so we sort of do both 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:10.590
 parts of them waller so here 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.460
 his ranks this transition part there 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.490
 which is important 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:22.490
 we will try to melt it was really 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.490
 the dilemma we are going to say about this candle 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.970
 so from that moment on 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.340
 now we will be able to start 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.170
 to paint so that's it it's really the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.600
 basis of his shares and already these two 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.620
 areas and then melt them up so 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.910
 now we will try to give more 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.800
 of paint horns so now I 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.610
 let's speed up the video and because 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.760
 that now it's really very 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:54.000
 intuitive and here we are 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.080
 so we put some white here for the 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.340
 light right away 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.950
 and here you have seen how it is already 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.780
 much more melted and now we 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.180
 works little by little so always 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.739
 add some dark paint on the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.019
 dark area and melt it like that 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.050
 and little by little we advance we advance 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.050
 advanced 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.610
 So here I am, I decide to 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:28.070
 a little bit to delineate my candle the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.090
 beginning of the shadow here we continue it 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.160
 to you notice that I always keep 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.360
 the same brush is not a problem there 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.710
 just enough of the time sweats in 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.780
 time put a little bit of white 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.040
 spirit for to remove the color 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.230
 was trying the dark one that we want to pass 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.120
 directly to whites or vice versa 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.530
 so here you see that I worked 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.530
 also a lot on this central area 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.390
 it's really the candle thing 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.510
 is difficult to achieve melt these two 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.710
 men here and a little bit we will try 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.270
 to give more and more bodies to the 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.860
 candle so add paint 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.990
 precisely if we too are going to him 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.790
 to avoid seeing the canvas 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.560
 underneath that I'm also working his 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.710
 small bright areas at the top with the 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.820
 white had it already it starts 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.440
 to take shape there we see this 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.480
 bright there that he really starts to 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.660
 to model ourselves we always have this 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.280
 separation that is still between 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.160
 the two men so it's not yet 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:32.300
 totally finished that's it then I even 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.220
 put a little blue that's history 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.390
 background is the best candle 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.169
 different rather than putting all the 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:44.090
 black or brown weather but a little 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.980
 of blue continues here is really 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.770
 it's a work on the length not getting 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.330
 not in 5 minutes it's clear but 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.180
 with a little patience he had 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.870
 really a nice result not hesitated to 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.090
 put red 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.760
 and that's all the blends are really 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.640
 done on the planet so that's it 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.710
 who is fun is not obliged 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.950
 finally to prepare the mixture that 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:14.180
 to have fun on the canvas 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.330
 so there I repeat part-time Corsican and two 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.330
 zones I'm trying to escape this 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.300
 this is the goal is really to accentuate 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.010
 this contrast between these two men more 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.930
 this contract should be important and 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.520
 the more we will have this aspect of volume and 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.670
 this aspect a little awesome as 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.680
 I like in the paintings it's this 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:45.720
 aspect a bit of relief we will say of the 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:47.540
 candle already well form here it is there 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.170
 I decide to limit a little bit around 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.030
 because she was not totally 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.590
 right this candle fell already for 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.420
 have a preview worked well this 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.580
 upper area up there which is white 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.330
 and these two are doing gently with this 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.330
 which is below 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.060
 here are our towns and I work 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.790
 a lot also on this single central 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.760
 again we will try the 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.940
 melt as one can and possibly 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.730
 can resume the next day at the 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.140
 paint will be dry but so there already 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.190
 with the painting that is passed it's 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.570
 interesting because we can easily 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.100
 melt the colors between them 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.810
 here you are a little bit in 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.050
 aviaries even in the area are for the 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.210
 a little bit was cleared up towards 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.470
 the top 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.060
 well here we are careful about everything 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.380
 a little nuance that's really it 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.700
 a little brushstrokes it's 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.220
 really to try to reproduce well 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.860
 all these little shades and dj tube 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:58.140
 subtlety that make sure that the 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:07:00.360
 model be really alive which in 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.910
 below that we're really trying to 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.070
 do a unit synology will change 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:08.160
 still no brush here we come 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.870
 almost towards the end we will continue then 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.370
 7th higher it really has to be 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.370
 that gives the brightness 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.510
 here and last Thursday my candle finally 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:25.010
 to make it more upright and that's it 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.010
 finished our candle for today
