again<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.750> very<00:02:00.840> cool<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:02.520> paint<00:02:03.000> work<00:02:03.180> on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
again it's very cool the paint work on

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.969 
again it's very cool the paint work on
the<00:02:03.630> chest<00:02:03.930> maybe<00:02:04.320> could<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.680> been<00:02:04.830> done

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the chest maybe could have been done

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.859 
the chest maybe could have been done
like<00:02:05.160> slightly<00:02:05.490> darker<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.479> bring<00:02:06.660> that

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
like slightly darker just to bring that

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.480 
like slightly darker just to bring that
out<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.440> bit<00:02:07.619> more<00:02:07.800> but<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.130> still<00:02:08.340> not

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
out a little bit more but it's still not

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.969 
out a little bit more but it's still not
bad<00:02:08.869> again<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> could<00:02:10.170> very<00:02:10.200> firm<00:02:10.619> figure<00:02:10.890> 2

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
bad again that could very firm figure 2

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.580 
bad again that could very firm figure 2
figure<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.340> well<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:12.020> one<00:02:13.020> thing<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.320> point<00:02:13.440> out

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
figure as well a one thing to point out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.040 
figure as well a one thing to point out
is<00:02:13.650> um<00:02:14.130> some<00:02:15.090> points<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.570> figure<00:02:15.840> or

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
is um some points of the figure or

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.660 
is um some points of the figure or
actually<00:02:16.410> done<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> hard<00:02:17.070> plastic<00:02:17.280> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
actually done in like a hard plastic you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.540 
actually done in like a hard plastic you
know<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:17.910> example<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> legs<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.930> arms

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
know for example like the legs the arms

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.699 
know for example like the legs the arms
but<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:20.970> entire<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.540> upper<00:02:21.930> chest<00:02:22.530> piece

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
but this entire like upper chest piece

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.650 
but this entire like upper chest piece
is<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.250> cast<00:02:23.489> out<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:23.910> rubber<00:02:24.390> I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
is actually cast out of like rubber I

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.330 
is actually cast out of like rubber I
know<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.500> actually<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.070> moving

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
know if you can actually see that moving

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.729 
know if you can actually see that moving
or<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:27.840> what<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.080> articulation

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
or not you know what the articulation

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.350 
or not you know what the articulation
like<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.070> actually<00:02:29.220> moves<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.209> how

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
like this actually moves you can see how

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.949 
like this actually moves you can see how
it's<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.870> rubbery<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.540> kind<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.750> cool

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
it's like rubbery so it's kind of cool

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.060 
it's like rubbery so it's kind of cool
because<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.290> really<00:02:34.470> messes<00:02:34.709> with<00:02:34.980> your

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
because it really messes with your

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.250 
because it really messes with your
articulation<00:02:35.310> very<00:02:35.850> well<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.600> hands<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:37.080> well

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
articulation very well the hands as well

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
articulation very well the hands as well
at<00:02:37.650> least<00:02:37.830> some<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.100> them<00:02:38.280> are<00:02:38.430> made<00:02:38.580> out<00:02:38.730> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
at least some of them are made out of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.060 
at least some of them are made out of
like<00:02:39.390> rubber<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:39.900> these<00:02:40.230> fists<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.650> example

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
like rubber like these fists for example

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.460 
like rubber like these fists for example
I<00:02:41.100> don't<00:02:41.340> know<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:41.820> they<00:02:42.600> are<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:42.930> some<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
I don't know if they are but some of the

other ones are which we'll get to in the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.470 
other ones are which we'll get to in the
accessory<00:02:46.050> bit<00:02:46.400> but<00:02:47.400> very<00:02:47.730> nice<00:02:47.880> kulfi

it's figure it's like a ball joint but

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.699 
it's figure it's like a ball joint but
they're<00:03:24.420> actually<00:03:24.690> like<00:03:25.049> kind<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> hinge

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709

they're actually like kind of on a hinge
as<00:03:25.860> well<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.250> can<00:03:26.280> actually<00:03:26.489> move<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
as well so you can actually move that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.600 
as well so you can actually move that
leg<00:03:27.239> up<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.860> know<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.130> example<00:03:29.220> by

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
leg up and down you know for example by

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.680 
leg up and down you know for example by
pulling<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.269> can<00:03:30.390> give<00:03:30.480> them<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.660> a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
pulling it that you can give them like a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.550 
pulling it that you can give them like a
very<00:03:30.989> high<00:03:32.600> you<00:03:33.600> know<00:03:33.720> like<00:03:33.900> put<00:03:34.200> his<00:03:34.260> leg<00:03:34.440> up

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
very high you know like put his leg up

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.890 
very high you know like put his leg up
very<00:03:34.769> high<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.400> know<00:03:35.670> gives<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> nice

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
very high so you know gives you a nice

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.120 
very high so you know gives you a nice
range<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.290> motion<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.709> then<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.040> you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
range of motion and then you know you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.890 
range of motion and then you know you
just<00:03:38.340> kind<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.549> push<00:03:39.120> back<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.720> place

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
just kind of push back up in the place
