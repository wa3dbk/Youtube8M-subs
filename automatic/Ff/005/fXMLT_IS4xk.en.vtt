if<00:00:03.590> we<00:00:03.740> want<00:00:03.920> to<00:00:03.949> have<00:00:04.069> any<00:00:04.250> hope<00:00:04.340> of

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
if we want to have any hope of

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.280 
if we want to have any hope of
understanding<00:00:04.730> all<00:00:05.420> of<00:00:05.479> the<00:00:05.840> things<00:00:06.020> that<00:00:06.200> are

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
understanding all of the things that are

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.509 
understanding all of the things that are
going<00:00:06.410> on<00:00:06.620> in<00:00:06.649> the<00:00:06.800> financial<00:00:07.189> world<00:00:07.220> right

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
now we really have to start with

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.170 
now we really have to start with
understanding<00:00:09.860> money<00:00:10.099> and<00:00:10.309> how<00:00:10.490> its<00:00:10.700> created

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
understanding money and how its created

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.550 
understanding money and how its created
so<00:00:11.660> here<00:00:11.870> we're<00:00:11.960> going<00:00:12.080> to<00:00:12.140> explore<00:00:12.410> the

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:12.560 
so here we're going to explore the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.680 
so here we're going to explore the
process<00:00:13.010> by<00:00:13.130> which<00:00:13.160> money<00:00:13.460> is<00:00:13.610> created<00:00:13.820> let<00:00:14.570> me

now<00:00:31.159> about<00:00:31.489> money<00:00:31.909> he<00:00:32.300> famously<00:00:32.750> said<00:00:33.079> the

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
now about money he famously said the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.459 
now about money he famously said the
process<00:00:33.920> by<00:00:34.190> which<00:00:34.220> money<00:00:34.820> is<00:00:34.970> created<00:00:35.329> is<00:00:36.199> so

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
process by which money is created is so

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.849 
process by which money is created is so
simple<00:00:36.859> that<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.789> mind<00:00:38.000> is<00:00:38.149> repelled<00:00:38.859> we're

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
simple that the mind is repelled we're

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.799 
simple that the mind is repelled we're
about<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.190> discuss<00:00:40.519> that<00:00:40.550> very<00:00:40.699> thing<00:00:41.149> if<00:00:41.629> you

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
about to discuss that very thing if you

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.090 
about to discuss that very thing if you
don't<00:00:41.989> get<00:00:42.079> this<00:00:42.230> segment<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.679> first<00:00:42.890> pass

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
don't get this segment the first pass

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.830 
don't get this segment the first pass
don't<00:00:43.309> worry<00:00:43.519> because<00:00:43.850> money<00:00:44.120> creation<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:44.780> a

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
don't worry because money creation is a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.110 
don't worry because money creation is a
truly<00:00:45.260> bizarre<00:00:45.620> thing<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.100> ponder<00:00:46.370> let<00:00:46.910> alone

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
truly bizarre thing to ponder let alone

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.939 
truly bizarre thing to ponder let alone
except<00:00:47.539> it's<00:00:48.019> actually<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.379> very<00:00:48.589> simple

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
except it's actually a very simple

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.950 
except it's actually a very simple
process<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:49.519> really<00:00:50.210> difficult<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.690> accept

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
process but really difficult to accept

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.930 
process but really difficult to accept
first<00:00:51.620> let's<00:00:52.160> look<00:00:52.250> at<00:00:52.460> how<00:00:52.519> money<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:52.820> created

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
first let's look at how money is created

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.090 
first let's look at how money is created
by<00:00:53.329> banks<00:00:53.660> leaving<00:00:54.260> aside<00:00:54.379> for<00:00:54.769> now<00:00:54.800> where

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
by banks leaving aside for now where

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.069 
by banks leaving aside for now where
this<00:00:55.489> money<00:00:55.820> comes<00:00:56.089> from<00:00:56.149> suppose<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.929> person

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
this money comes from suppose a person

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.959 
this money comes from suppose a person
walks<00:00:57.620> into<00:00:57.859> town<00:00:58.039> with<00:00:58.249> a<00:00:58.280> thousand<00:00:58.699> dollars

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
walks into town with a thousand dollars

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.790 
walks into town with a thousand dollars
in<00:00:59.120> luckily<00:00:59.539> a<00:00:59.690> brand-new<00:01:00.260> bank<00:01:00.469> with<00:01:00.679> no

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
in luckily a brand-new bank with no

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.160 
in luckily a brand-new bank with no
deposits<00:01:01.339> has<00:01:01.460> just<00:01:01.730> opened<00:01:01.879> up<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.780> thousand

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
deposits has just opened up the thousand

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.840 
deposits has just opened up the thousand
dollars<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:03.499> deposited<00:01:04.040> in<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.129> bank<00:01:04.190> and<00:01:04.580> now

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
dollars is deposited in the bank and now

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.670

in theory banks are allowed to loan out
up<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.260> ninety<00:01:21.710> percent<00:01:21.860> of<00:01:22.130> what<00:01:22.280> people<00:01:22.640> have

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
later on the actual proportion is much

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.730 
later on the actual proportion is much
closer<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.260> one<00:01:27.470> hundred<00:01:27.530> percent

now if and when that happens things get

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.679 
now if and when that happens things get
tricky<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.310> that's<00:03:08.879> another<00:03:09.120> story<00:03:09.239> for

tricky and that's another story for

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.629 
tricky and that's another story for
later<00:03:09.900> for<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.829> want<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.280> understand

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
later for now I want you to understand

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.899 
later for now I want you to understand
that<00:03:11.730> money<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.269> loaned<00:03:12.689> into<00:03:13.049> existence

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
that money is loaned into existence

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.220 
that money is loaned into existence
conversely<00:03:14.909> when<00:03:15.419> loans<00:03:15.689> are<00:03:15.870> paid<00:03:15.989> back

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
conversely when loans are paid back

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.069 
conversely when loans are paid back
money<00:03:17.159> disappears<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.419> is<00:03:18.689> how<00:03:18.780> money<00:03:18.989> is

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
money disappears this is how money is

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.839 
money disappears this is how money is
created<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.709> i<00:03:19.859> invite<00:03:20.159> you<00:03:20.189> to<00:03:20.310> verify<00:03:20.609> this

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
created and i invite you to verify this

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.969 
created and i invite you to verify this
for<00:03:21.150> yourself<00:03:21.269> one<00:03:22.109> place<00:03:22.379> would<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.859> the

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
for yourself one place would be the

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.530 
for yourself one place would be the
federal<00:03:23.280> reserve<00:03:23.519> itself<00:03:23.970> which<00:03:24.389> has

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
federal reserve itself which has

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.089 
federal reserve itself which has
published<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.959> handy<00:03:25.319> comic<00:03:25.650> book<00:03:25.829> from<00:03:26.040> which

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
published a handy comic book from which

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.219 
published a handy comic book from which
i<00:03:26.340> actually<00:03:26.489> drew<00:03:26.879> this<00:03:27.120> fine<00:03:27.299> example<00:03:27.780> you

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
i actually drew this fine example you

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:29.629 
i actually drew this fine example you

under essential articles you may have

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.110 
under essential articles you may have

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
noticed that it left out something very

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.750 
noticed that it left out something very
important<00:03:34.019> here<00:03:34.169> and<00:03:34.319> that<00:03:34.949> is<00:03:35.159> interest

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
important here and that is interest

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.580 
important here and that is interest
where<00:03:36.329> does<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.629> money<00:03:36.659> come<00:03:36.870> from<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.319> pay

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
where does the money come from to pay

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.039 
where does the money come from to pay
the<00:03:37.739> interest<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.189> all<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.489> loans<00:03:38.699> if<00:03:39.030> all<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
the interest on all the loans if all the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.839 
the interest on all the loans if all the
loans<00:03:40.260> are<00:03:40.439> paid<00:03:40.590> back<00:03:40.829> without<00:03:41.129> interest<00:03:41.639> we

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
loans are paid back without interest we

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.460 
loans are paid back without interest we
can<00:03:42.000> undo<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.479> entire<00:03:42.930> string<00:03:43.349> of

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
can undo this entire string of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.379 
can undo this entire string of
transactions<00:03:44.159> in<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.370> example<00:03:44.729> but<00:03:45.120> when<00:03:45.269> we

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
transactions in this example but when we

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.179 
transactions in this example but when we
factor<00:03:45.629> in<00:03:45.810> interest<00:03:46.259> we'd<00:03:46.739> suddenly

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
factor in interest we'd suddenly

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:48.530 
factor in interest we'd suddenly
discover<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.759> there<00:03:47.939> isn't<00:03:48.299> enough<00:03:48.509> money

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
discover that there isn't enough money

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.719 
discover that there isn't enough money
here<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.259> this<00:03:49.530> example<00:03:49.889> to<00:03:50.099> pay<00:03:50.250> back<00:03:50.430> all<00:03:50.609> the

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
here in this example to pay back all the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.270 
here in this example to pay back all the
loans<00:03:51.169> clearly<00:03:52.169> that's<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.470> big<00:03:52.709> hole<00:03:53.009> in<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
loans clearly that's a big hole in the

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.589 
loans clearly that's a big hole in the
story<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.639> so<00:03:53.849> we'll<00:03:54.030> need<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.269> find<00:03:54.479> out

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
story and so we'll need to find out

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.569 
story and so we'll need to find out
where<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.780> comes<00:03:55.409> from<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.799> doing<00:03:56.129> so<00:03:56.159> we'll

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
where that comes from in doing so we'll

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.830 
where that comes from in doing so we'll
also<00:03:56.729> clear<00:03:57.030> up<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.239> mystery<00:03:57.479> of<00:03:57.540> where<00:03:57.689> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
also clear up the mystery of where the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.199 
also clear up the mystery of where the
original<00:03:58.259> thousand<00:03:58.680> dollars<00:03:58.949> came<00:03:59.159> from<00:03:59.370> so

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
original thousand dollars came from so

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.759 
original thousand dollars came from so
why<00:04:00.540> did<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:00.810> spend<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.199> past<00:04:01.379> five<00:04:01.590> minutes

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
why did we spend the past five minutes

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.589 
why did we spend the past five minutes
studying<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.459> mechanism<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.120> money<00:04:03.299> creation

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
studying the mechanism of money creation

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.599 
studying the mechanism of money creation
because<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.650> order<00:04:04.889> to<00:04:05.040> appreciate<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
because in order to appreciate the

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.939 
because in order to appreciate the
implications<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.629> our<00:04:06.989> massive<00:04:07.319> levels<00:04:07.829> of

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
implications of our massive levels of

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.830 
implications of our massive levels of
debt<00:04:08.129> you<00:04:08.609> need<00:04:08.759> to<00:04:08.849> understand<00:04:09.299> how<00:04:09.569> that

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
debt you need to understand how that

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.960 
debt you need to understand how that
debt<00:04:10.109> came<00:04:10.379> into<00:04:10.620> being<00:04:10.769> that's<00:04:11.549> one<00:04:11.819> reason

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
debt came into being that's one reason

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.479 
debt came into being that's one reason
and<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.629> more<00:04:12.810> important<00:04:13.319> reason<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:13.859> tied<00:04:14.340> to

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
and the more important reason is tied to

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.159 
and the more important reason is tied to
all<00:04:14.639> those<00:04:14.909> exponential<00:04:15.569> graphs<00:04:15.780> we<00:04:15.989> viewed

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
all those exponential graphs we viewed

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.589 
all those exponential graphs we viewed
earlier<00:04:16.500> in<00:04:16.650> section<00:04:17.009> 3<00:04:17.039> but<00:04:17.880> we're<00:04:18.060> not<00:04:18.239> quite

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
earlier in section 3 but we're not quite

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.370 
earlier in section 3 but we're not quite
there<00:04:18.630> yet<00:04:19.070> let's<00:04:20.070> continue
