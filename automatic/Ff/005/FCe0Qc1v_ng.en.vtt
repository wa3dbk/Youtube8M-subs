00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:37.089

the<00:06:37.309> price<00:06:37.520> is<00:06:37.550> reasonable<00:06:38.559> because<00:06:39.559> the

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:40.069 
the price is reasonable because the

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:42.070 
the price is reasonable because the

paper is good quality paper it's thick
it's<00:06:42.860> not<00:06:43.069> flimsy<00:06:43.399> at<00:06:43.729> all<00:06:44.289> so<00:06:45.289> this<00:06:45.740> is<00:06:45.919> thick

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:47.679 
it's not flimsy at all so this is thick

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:52.059 
it's not flimsy at all so this is thick
got<00:06:48.679> thick<00:06:49.159> paper<00:06:49.459> there<00:06:49.789> and<00:06:50.629> then<00:06:50.899> this<00:06:51.770> page

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:52.069 
got thick paper there and then this page

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.850 
got thick paper there and then this page
in<00:06:52.279> this<00:06:52.429> page<00:06:52.490> in<00:06:52.999> this<00:06:53.119> page<00:06:53.259> all<00:06:54.259> have<00:06:54.619> sort

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
in this page in this page all have sort

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.939

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
is a coloring and I think you could

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.529 
is a coloring and I think you could
actually<00:07:00.369> put<00:07:01.369> watercolors<00:07:02.059> on<00:07:02.209> that<00:07:02.419> because

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
actually put watercolors on that because

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:03.969 
actually put watercolors on that because
it<00:07:02.719> is<00:07:02.839> quite<00:07:03.229> thick<00:07:03.439> I<00:07:03.619> don't<00:07:03.800> know<00:07:03.889> whether

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
it is quite thick I don't know whether

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.549 
it is quite thick I don't know whether
it<00:07:04.189> would<00:07:04.279> take<00:07:04.599> but<00:07:05.599> I<00:07:05.659> might<00:07:05.899> experiment

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:06.559 
it would take but I might experiment

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.519 
it would take but I might experiment
with<00:07:06.709> that<00:07:06.889> if<00:07:07.699> you<00:07:07.849> don't<00:07:08.059> have<00:07:08.149> to<00:07:08.300> use

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.529 
with that if you don't have to use

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:15.219 
with that if you don't have to use
coloring<00:07:09.529> pencils<00:07:11.020> but<00:07:12.020> yeah<00:07:12.889> I<00:07:13.899> don't<00:07:14.899> see

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:15.229 
coloring pencils but yeah I don't see

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:21.119 
coloring pencils but yeah I don't see
why<00:07:15.349> not

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:21.129 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:22.449
