00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
kind of like one block and then it quit

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.940 
kind of like one block and then it quit
you<00:01:21.880> see<00:01:22.120> this<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.170> what<00:01:23.350> they<00:01:23.470> added<00:01:23.830> in

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
you see this this is what they added in

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.950 
you see this this is what they added in
right<00:01:24.130> here<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.700> stuff<00:01:24.970> rate<00:01:25.150> it's<00:01:25.690> kind<00:01:25.869> of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
right here the stuff rate it's kind of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.039 
right here the stuff rate it's kind of
like<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.200> smooth<00:01:26.590> transition<00:01:27.750> same<00:01:28.750> with<00:01:28.930> the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
like a smooth transition same with the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.130 
like a smooth transition same with the
water<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.440> would<00:01:29.680> imagine<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.810> can<00:01:31.960> see

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
water I would imagine as you can see

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.950 
water I would imagine as you can see
this<00:01:32.350> water<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:32.710> kind<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.220> faded<00:01:33.729> well<00:01:34.090> sort<00:01:34.840> of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
this water is kind of faded well sort of

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.570 
this water is kind of faded well sort of
it's<00:01:35.470> kind<00:01:35.650> of<00:01:35.740> hard<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:35.950> tell<00:01:36.010> with<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.369> water

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
it's kind of hard to tell with the water

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.760 
it's kind of hard to tell with the water
but<00:01:36.820> as<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.180> can<00:01:37.299> see<00:01:37.540> this<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.229> really<00:01:38.650> good

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
but as you can see this is a really good

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.450 
but as you can see this is a really good
example<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:39.369> this<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:40.720> one<00:01:41.020> thing<00:01:41.049> also<00:01:41.830> as

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
example of this that's one thing also as

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.750 
example of this that's one thing also as
you<00:01:42.820> can<00:01:43.150> see<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.220> swamp<00:01:45.909> biome<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:47.670> kind<00:01:48.670> of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
you can see this swamp biome is kind of

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.940 
you can see this swamp biome is kind of
hilly<00:01:48.939> now<00:01:49.210> before<00:01:49.990> they<00:01:50.229> were<00:01:50.290> mostly<00:01:50.530> all

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
hilly now before they were mostly all

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.510 
hilly now before they were mostly all
flat<00:01:51.400> or<00:01:52.090> had<00:01:52.330> maybe<00:01:52.689> one<00:01:52.810> or<00:01:53.170> two<00:01:53.200> hills<00:01:53.590> they

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
flat or had maybe one or two hills they

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.270 
flat or had maybe one or two hills they
added<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> codon<00:01:55.659> that<00:01:55.930> would<00:01:56.500> make<00:01:56.979> these<00:01:57.250> a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
added a codon that would make these a

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.340 
added a codon that would make these a
little<00:01:57.670> bit<00:01:57.909> more<00:01:58.060> varied<00:01:58.600> make<00:01:59.170> them<00:01:59.320> a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
little bit more varied make them a

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.530 
little bit more varied make them a
little<00:01:59.500> bit<00:01:59.710> more<00:01:59.860> mountain<00:02:00.280> s<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.939> would<00:02:01.330> say

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
little bit more mountain s I would say

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.539 
little bit more mountain s I would say
they<00:02:02.110> were<00:02:02.170> sick<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.500> basically<00:02:03.070> everything

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
they were sick of basically everything

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.089 
they were sick of basically everything
being<00:02:03.759> flat<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.490> as<00:02:06.820> far<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.890> changes<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
being flat so as far as changes to the

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.710 
being flat so as far as changes to the
world<00:02:09.399> that's<00:02:09.579> about<00:02:09.849> it<00:02:09.879> and<00:02:10.209> they<00:02:10.450> made<00:02:10.599> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
world that's about it and they made the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.850 
world that's about it and they made the
biome<00:02:11.079> so<00:02:11.409> we<00:02:11.500> did<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:13.349> transitions<00:02:14.349> they

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
biome so we did that transitions they

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.530 
biome so we did that transitions they
did<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.159> see<00:02:15.459> that's<00:02:15.819> that's<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.209> lot<00:02:16.390> better

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
did that see that's that's a lot better

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.490 
did that see that's that's a lot better
looking<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:17.410> so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
looking I think so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.960 
looking I think so
okay<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:19.220> on<00:02:19.730> to<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.510> next<00:02:20.690> part<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.160> far<00:02:22.610> as

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
okay so on to the next part so as far as

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.480 
okay so on to the next part so as far as
there's<00:02:23.630> no<00:02:23.840> new<00:02:24.020> items<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.590> game<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:25.340> if

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
there's no new items in the game but if

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.460 
there's no new items in the game but if
you're<00:02:25.670> creative<00:02:26.330> on<00:02:26.480> this<00:02:26.660> snapshot<00:02:27.170> you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you're creative on this snapshot you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.170 
you're creative on this snapshot you
will<00:02:27.590> see<00:02:27.740> these<00:02:27.890> eggs<00:02:28.190> these<00:02:28.460> eggs<00:02:28.700> spawned

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
will see these eggs these eggs spawned

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.460 
will see these eggs these eggs spawned
stuff<00:02:29.920> probably<00:02:30.920> want<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.220> spawn<00:02:31.460> here<00:02:32.470> most

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
stuff probably want to spawn here most

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.320 
stuff probably want to spawn here most
fun<00:02:33.650> places<00:02:34.690> all<00:02:35.690> these<00:02:35.930> eggs<00:02:36.670> look<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.910> if

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
fun places all these eggs look as if

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.500 
fun places all these eggs look as if
they<00:02:38.450> were<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.720> color<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:40.490> they<00:02:41.360> will

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
they were the color of the they will

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.040 
they were the color of the they will
resemble<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.440> color<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:43.010> their<00:02:43.910> their<00:02:44.360> proper

big<00:03:02.900> potion<00:03:03.350> guy<00:03:04.239> brewing<00:03:05.239> would<00:03:05.810> normally

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
big potion guy brewing would normally

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.890 
big potion guy brewing would normally
take<00:03:06.350> 20<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.250> 30<00:03:07.550> seconds<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.180> brew<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:08.840> a

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
take 20 to 30 seconds to brew it's a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.780 
take 20 to 30 seconds to brew it's a
pretty<00:03:09.440> good<00:03:09.650> time<00:03:09.860> nobody<00:03:10.310> could<00:03:10.430> walk<00:03:10.640> away

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
pretty good time nobody could walk away

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.100 
pretty good time nobody could walk away
go<00:03:11.060> do<00:03:11.180> what<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.330> had<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.660> come<00:03:11.900> back<00:03:12.050> and

go do what you had to do come back and
it<00:03:12.350> would<00:03:12.440> be<00:03:12.470> done<00:03:12.709> well<00:03:13.550> now<00:03:14.480> brewing<00:03:15.110> is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
it would be done well now brewing is

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.270 
it would be done well now brewing is
limited<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.340> 20<00:03:16.640> seconds<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.570> um<00:03:18.500> that's

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
limited to 20 seconds so um that's

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.949 
limited to 20 seconds so um that's
pretty<00:03:19.459> cool<00:03:19.580> take<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.270> little<00:03:20.450> bit<00:03:20.570> less<00:03:20.780> of

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
pretty cool take a little bit less of

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.650 
pretty cool take a little bit less of
time<00:03:21.640> looks<00:03:22.640> like<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.970> they<00:03:23.180> actually<00:03:23.510> did<00:03:23.600> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
time looks like this they actually did a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.180 
time looks like this they actually did a
pretty<00:03:23.840> good<00:03:23.959> job<00:03:24.019> on<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.440> I<00:03:24.590> think<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.980> like

pretty good job on this I think I like

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.170 
pretty good job on this I think I like
the<00:03:25.370> transition<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:27.200> as<00:03:27.470> as<00:03:27.950> basically<00:03:28.910> as

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the transition so as as basically as

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.509 
the transition so as as basically as
much<00:03:29.480> there<00:03:30.110> really<00:03:30.440> isn't<00:03:30.739> much<00:03:30.769> else<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:31.310> mean

ladder collision boxes have been fix you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.490 
ladder collision boxes have been fix you
know<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.910> thing<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:35.540> no<00:03:35.750> foes<00:03:35.959> Nova's

been like oh my good that's fixed the
gates<00:03:41.470> those<00:03:42.470> gates<00:03:42.799> boxes<00:03:43.370> have<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.610> fixable

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
gates those gates boxes have it fixable

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.430 
gates those gates boxes have it fixable
you<00:03:44.209> there's<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.780> less<00:03:44.959> chance<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.320> you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
you there's a less chance of you

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.810 
you there's a less chance of you
basically<00:03:45.739> getting<00:03:45.980> hung<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.519> on<00:03:46.700> it

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
basically getting hung up on it

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.650 
basically getting hung up on it
basically<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.299> what<00:03:47.329> I'm<00:03:47.480> trying<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.780> say<00:03:48.100> and

basically is what I'm trying to say and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.970 
basically is what I'm trying to say and
the<00:03:50.660> only<00:03:50.870> other<00:03:51.140> thing<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.650> really

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the only other thing that it really

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.960 
the only other thing that it really
needed<00:03:52.489> mentioning<00:03:53.000> was<00:03:53.709> when<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:55.549> are

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
needed mentioning was when you are

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.240 
needed mentioning was when you are
enchanting<00:03:56.239> something<00:03:57.140> there's<00:03:57.620> a<00:03:57.920> really

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
enchanting something there's a really

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.100 
enchanting something there's a really
high<00:03:58.880> chance<00:03:59.329> of<00:03:59.480> getting<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.870> something

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
high chance of getting to something

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.330 
high chance of getting to something
completely<00:04:00.590> random<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.130> would<00:04:01.250> never

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
completely random that you would never

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.140 
completely random that you would never
get<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:03.410> has<00:04:03.769> been<00:04:03.980> taken<00:04:04.250> out<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:04.790> say

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
get that has been taken out so say

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.940 
get that has been taken out so say
you're<00:04:05.420> enchanting<00:04:05.630> something<00:04:06.320> level<00:04:06.590> 50

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
you're enchanting something level 50

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.140 
you're enchanting something level 50
there's<00:04:07.280> a<00:04:07.370> lot<00:04:07.400> better<00:04:07.670> chance<00:04:07.730> you're<00:04:08.060> going

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
there's a lot better chance you're going

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.770 
there's a lot better chance you're going
to<00:04:08.239> get<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.390> silk<00:04:08.600> touch<00:04:08.810> or<00:04:09.910> fortune<00:04:10.910> something

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
to get a silk touch or fortune something

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.979 
to get a silk touch or fortune something
like<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:13.090> like<00:04:14.090> level<00:04:14.540> 10<00:04:14.780> would

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
like that so like level 10 would

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.170 
like that so like level 10 would
probably<00:04:15.380> be<00:04:15.530> like<00:04:15.709> sharpness<00:04:16.370> things<00:04:16.970> like

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
probably be like sharpness things like

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.930 
probably be like sharpness things like
that<00:04:17.329> unbreaking<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.489> just<00:04:19.640> wanted<00:04:19.850> to

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
that unbreaking so I just wanted to
