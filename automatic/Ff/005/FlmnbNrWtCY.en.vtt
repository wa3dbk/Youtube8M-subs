00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.100
 and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.610
 I do not know how to start the video but I do not 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.500
 let's start what about how guys how 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 you are welcome more friends web 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 rumÃ­ to see the first news I 'm going 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.660
 to throw a little soft so 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.119
 that we are assimilating it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.609
 exclusivity of black ops 3 for 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.759
 playstation 4 there is a little bit of wax already 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.420
 yes there is no problem all the content 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.570
 downloadable all of the efes all for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.239
 playstation 4 and even the beta comes out in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 August and leaves first for playstation 4 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.370
 as I do not know all that because they have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 said you just said my mom I'm 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.420
 really flipping goodbye to the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.250
 exclusivity of xbox one there will be people who 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.920
 the xbox has been purchased only by the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.510
 call of duty no exclusivity and now 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.480
 you will realize that you have changed for 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.699
 playstation and that's a bitch always 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 I will always recommend that you 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.870
 you take the console on which they are 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.910
 your friends exclusivity is a 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 silly unless you have a channel 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.560
 youtube and want to teach it before and such 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.200
 exclusivity is nonsense can 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.119
 be it could be that this time not 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.080
 there is a month difference between a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.480
 console and other 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.120
 or it may change I do not know no no no 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.670
 is spoken or nothing I think but maybe 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.890
 be less because a month was exaggerated and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.200
 guys the trailer has come out of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 multiplayer which we will see now 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.370
 together but I'll leave the link in the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.110
 description ok let's try saying 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.150
 four little things that you see in the trailer 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 and later on if we make a 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.020
 deep analysis because I want 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.480
 know which characters each and others 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 we go with the trailer there you are watching 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.970
 the colors of the game I love 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.890
 we see how it is now firing a 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 swat kind of reminds me of the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.970
 aswat but it is not eye to be blade 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.970
 rogad made the lovers of the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.470
 thrown be calm now 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.060
 there are eggs like a skill 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.280
 special that are the knives those 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.440
 let's see a fragment with the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.270
 species is from remington we have seen 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.670
 as the sente area is like that and has exploded 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.280
 is already in the first trailer but 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.130
 we see how he pulls out his hand even for a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.020
 triple remove with the magnum that mother of mine 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.209
 be killing a shot at any 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.130
 I already said that long ago when 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.080
 I analyzed them and others here for the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.540
 lovers snipe 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.640
 careful that the bow has been removed and 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.560
 come do that all multiplayer 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.040
 you drop your eggs because you're not going to 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.329
 make my mother really the colors me 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.489
 they love there are no colors that 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.799
 different are there is part like that has 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.019
 released a shock charge and we see how 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.750
 it has stayed a little in the air 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.970
 up will be some advantage or something but eye 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.730
 that here comes the main course here in 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.340
 the main course is that you are going to flip 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.260
 we see how many enemies jump and you 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.079
 appears behind or that is a 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.700
 skill but is that a lot of the 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.040
 problems that can give us that is 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.500
 pretty amazing here is driving 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.590
 a kind of pe 90 surely 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.659
 remember the 90 of modern warfare 3 and 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.669
 Well, I think it's that the 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.409
 colors of the colors is amazing me 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.389
 love the colors there we see the cat 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.310
 link that most death in 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.549
 arm that is another streak a skill 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.210
 special we see how a streak launches 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.490
 little ball killing under water 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.620
 and nothing else, guys, I think so far 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.230
 comes the trailer we see here the super 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.360
 streak that reminds a lot of vtol 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.580
 lubet hello to the famous vtol of call of 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.440
 duty black or 2 and up to here the trailer 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.990
 I think it will be a pass 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.930
 videogame it seems that the gameplay goes 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.520
 to be pretty decent that to walk around 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.080
 the walls because I think that in the end 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.280
 we will get used to it 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.900
 we have been doing jumps for almost a year 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.030
 double jumps and so on and we've 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.030
 come to accustom some more others 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.320
 less but I think good is another way 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.570
 of game 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.490
 it reminds me a lot and that's how the titan fails 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.080
 not in the gameplay is the same as 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.690
 the titan failed to walk with the walls and 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.020
 so, therefore, what do I know, guys? 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.240
 from wanting to prove it, nothing is missing and 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.210
 less so you can try this beta 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.890
 I'm with my mother's long teeth 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.540
 the only thing I believe when the beta comes out 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.460
 is on vacation and I'll be in the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.920
 little girl let's see our and how 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.690
 I will do but let's see what happens and grade 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.660
 was to leave some images of the 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.220
 creators of camouflages in the weapon of 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.630
 call of duty black ops 3 many of 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.900
 you have passed me many 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.479
 images look 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.280
 I already had them, I was not 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.690
 as long as he is quiet on twitter 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.699
 it's because I'm looking at things and so on 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.740
 to bring you a pretty decent video 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.630
 because I do not have too much time today 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.220
 I'm not going to do the mega analysis today 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.880
 so I'll have to upload it tomorrow 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.039
 and I miss you record is picked up the most 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.620
 important of all this that has come out of 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.210
 white stress to show you what's not and there 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.070
 you will have images of the creator of 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.960
 camouflages that have revealed a lot 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.610
 he'll put some on us so nothing 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.229
 I hope you liked it I want you to 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.960

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.620
