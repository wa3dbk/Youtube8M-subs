have a set of husky liner mud flaps that
I'm<00:00:49.900> going<00:00:50.049> to<00:00:50.110> be<00:00:50.229> installing<00:00:50.470> hopefully

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
I'm going to be installing hopefully

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.060 
I'm going to be installing hopefully
that'll<00:00:51.339> keep<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.989> bulk<00:00:53.199> of<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.440> mud<00:00:53.650> off<00:00:53.860> the

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
that'll keep the bulk of the mud off the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.899 
that'll keep the bulk of the mud off the
running<00:00:54.549> boards<00:00:54.820> there<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.610> we'll<00:00:57.760> see

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
running boards there and so we'll see

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.399 
running boards there and so we'll see
how<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.089> goes<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:01.239> first<00:01:01.750> part<00:01:02.110> of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
how that goes the first part of

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.380 
how that goes the first part of
installing<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.430> Med<00:01:03.610> flaps<00:01:03.939> is<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:07.150> my<00:01:07.330> case

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
installing the Med flaps is in my case

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.310 
installing the Med flaps is in my case

basically sticks on where the where the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
basically sticks on where the where the
mud<00:01:21.909> flaps<00:01:22.210> will<00:01:22.740> contact<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.950> paint<00:01:24.219> and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
mud flaps will contact the paint and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.569 
mud flaps will contact the paint and
this<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.469> protect<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.950> paint<00:01:27.159> keep<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
this is to protect the paint keep the

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.730 
this is to protect the paint keep the
paint<00:01:27.789> from<00:01:27.999> being<00:01:28.869> rubbed<00:01:29.079> off<00:01:29.259> by<00:01:29.469> the<00:01:29.530> mud

vinyl on squeegee the water out from
under<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:41.799> make<00:01:42.609> sure<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:42.909> covers<00:01:43.299> the

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
under it make sure it just covers the

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.940 
under it make sure it just covers the
area<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.079> mud<00:01:44.229> flaps<00:01:44.499> are<00:01:44.710> going<00:01:44.859> to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
area that the mud flaps are going to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.599 
area that the mud flaps are going to
contact<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:47.740> can<00:01:47.889> proceed<00:01:48.219> on<00:01:48.429> to

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
contact and then you can proceed on to

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.709 
contact and then you can proceed on to
installing<00:01:49.149> the<00:01:49.420> actual<00:01:49.749> mud<00:01:49.929> flaps<00:01:50.969> so<00:01:51.969> let

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
installing the actual mud flaps so let

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.590 
installing the actual mud flaps so let
me<00:01:52.810> see<00:01:52.990> if<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:55.210> this<00:01:55.329> final<00:01:55.719> in<00:01:55.810> there

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
me see if I can get this final in there

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.160 
me see if I can get this final in there
okay<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.789> got<00:02:00.969> the<00:02:01.090> front<00:02:01.270> flaps<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.899> both

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
okay so I got the front flaps on both

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.129 
okay so I got the front flaps on both
sides<00:02:03.270> there's<00:02:04.270> easy<00:02:04.600> enough<00:02:04.749> to<00:02:04.810> do<00:02:05.020> without

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
sides there's easy enough to do without

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.199 
sides there's easy enough to do without
taking<00:02:05.259> off<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.799> tire<00:02:06.009> just<00:02:06.340> turn<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.969> steer

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
taking off the tire just turn the steer

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.260 
taking off the tire just turn the steer
and<00:02:08.100> all<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.280> way<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.610> lock<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.119> can

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
and all the way to the lock so you can

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.570 
and all the way to the lock so you can
get<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.600> it

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
get to it

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.710 
get to it
it<00:02:13.540> reused<00:02:14.250> these<00:02:15.250> two<00:02:15.550> factory<00:02:16.090> fasteners

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
it reused these two factory fasteners

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.510 
it reused these two factory fasteners
that<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.560> fastener<00:02:17.950> had<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> drill

that this fastener had to drill

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.970 
that this fastener had to drill
oh<00:02:18.550> four<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.290> one<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.620> had<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.830> drill

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
oh four and this one that I had to drill

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.500 
oh four and this one that I had to drill
a<00:02:21.010> hole<00:02:21.100> for<00:02:21.460> in<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.700> fiber<00:02:21.970> wheel<00:02:22.270> well

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
a hole for in this fiber wheel well

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.680 
a hole for in this fiber wheel well
liner<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.490> other<00:02:24.610> side<00:02:24.730> where

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
liner the one on the other side where

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.650 
liner the one on the other side where
this<00:02:25.960> hole<00:02:26.170> was<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:28.030> wheel<00:02:28.210> weather<00:02:28.420> liner

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
this hole was the wheel weather liner

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.710 
this hole was the wheel weather liner
was<00:02:29.170> put<00:02:29.620> out<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:30.250> actually<00:02:30.600> there<00:02:31.600> was

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
was put out it actually there was

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.930 
was put out it actually there was
nothing<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.050> drill<00:02:32.320> into<00:02:32.530> there<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.730> ended

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
nothing to drill into there so I ended

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.580 
nothing to drill into there so I ended
up<00:02:34.000> having<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.360> drill<00:02:34.570> through<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> mud<00:02:35.380> flap

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
up having to drill through the mud flap

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.360 
up having to drill through the mud flap
and<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.480> liner<00:02:37.480> here<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.800> put<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.130> fourth

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and the liner here to put that fourth

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.400 
and the liner here to put that fourth
fastener<00:02:39.790> in<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.740> driver's<00:02:42.160> side

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
fastener in on the on the driver's side

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.570 
fastener in on the on the driver's side
so<00:02:44.410> now<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.590> got<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.890> get<00:02:44.980> back<00:02:45.100> there<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.430> try

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
so now I got to get back there and try

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.660 
so now I got to get back there and try
it<00:02:45.730> on<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.120> rears<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.250> kind<00:02:48.460> of<00:02:48.520> have<00:02:48.640> a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
it on the rears and I kind of have a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.250 
it on the rears and I kind of have a
feeling<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.270> I'm<00:02:49.420> gonna<00:02:49.570> have<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.840> take<00:02:50.050> this

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
feeling that I'm gonna have to take this

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.020 
feeling that I'm gonna have to take this
thing<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.860> shop<00:02:51.070> and<00:02:51.370> Jack<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.730> out<00:02:51.820> and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
thing up to the shop and Jack it out and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.370 
thing up to the shop and Jack it out and
take<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.270> rear<00:02:52.420> wheels<00:02:52.630> off<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.080> get<00:02:53.230> these

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
take the rear wheels off to get these

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.190 
take the rear wheels off to get these
mud<00:02:53.590> flaps<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:54.240> I'm<00:02:55.240> hoping<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.660> can<00:02:55.690> figure<00:02:55.990> out

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
mud flaps on I'm hoping I can figure out

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.690 
mud flaps on I'm hoping I can figure out
a<00:02:56.230> way<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.440> finagle<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.010> around<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.490> get<00:02:57.550> it

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
a way to finagle it around and get it

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.360 
a way to finagle it around and get it
done<00:02:57.820> without<00:02:58.500> having<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.680> take<00:02:59.890> those<00:03:00.100> wheels

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
done without having to take those wheels

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.640 
done without having to take those wheels
off<00:03:00.670> but<00:03:01.740> I'm<00:03:02.740> not<00:03:02.800> too<00:03:03.070> optimistic<00:03:04.500> we'll<00:03:05.500> see

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
off but I'm not too optimistic we'll see

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.310 
off but I'm not too optimistic we'll see
how<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:05.800> do<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:08.680> right<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:09.100> there<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:10.320> got

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
how I do all right so there it is got

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.520 
how I do all right so there it is got
the<00:03:11.500> rear<00:03:11.680> ones<00:03:11.860> installed<00:03:12.220> I<00:03:13.260> was<00:03:14.260> lucky

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the rear ones installed I was lucky

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.460 
the rear ones installed I was lucky
enough<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.800> they<00:03:15.900> had<00:03:16.900> used<00:03:17.140> all<00:03:17.350> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
enough that they had used all the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.390 
enough that they had used all the
factory<00:03:17.860> holes<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:20.650> was<00:03:20.770> one<00:03:20.980> factory

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
factory holes it was one factory

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.490 
factory holes it was one factory
fastener<00:03:21.850> here<00:03:22.180> an<00:03:22.750> empty<00:03:23.530> hole<00:03:23.740> here<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.780> need

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
fastener here an empty hole here I need

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.770 
fastener here an empty hole here I need
to<00:03:26.650> hole<00:03:26.830> up<00:03:26.860> under<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.550> bottom<00:03:27.760> going<00:03:28.570> into

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
to hole up under the bottom going into

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.230 
to hole up under the bottom going into
the<00:03:28.870> bottom<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.350> fender<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.940> only<00:03:30.940> old<00:03:31.090> I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
the bottom of the fender the only old I

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.730 
the bottom of the fender the only old I
had<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.510> drill<00:03:31.720> was<00:03:31.840> this<00:03:31.990> one<00:03:32.140> back<00:03:32.290> here<00:03:32.320> and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
had to drill was this one back here and

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.400 
had to drill was this one back here and
I<00:03:32.800> had<00:03:32.950> enough<00:03:33.160> room<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.870> snake<00:03:34.870> my<00:03:35.050> drill<00:03:35.260> in

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
I had enough room to snake my drill in

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.780 
I had enough room to snake my drill in
there<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.680> drill<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.250> I'd<00:03:36.490> have<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.700> take

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
there and drill it so I'd have to take

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.260 
there and drill it so I'd have to take
off<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.120> rear<00:03:37.240> tires<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:39.190> probably<00:03:39.880> could

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
off the rear tires you probably could

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.670 
off the rear tires you probably could
not<00:03:40.570> drill<00:03:40.990> that<00:03:41.140> hole<00:03:41.380> though<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:42.310> an<00:03:42.670> f250

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
not drill that hole though on an f250

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.040 
not drill that hole though on an f250
it's<00:03:44.680> another<00:03:44.920> inch<00:03:45.190> lower<00:03:45.550> an<00:03:45.880> f250<00:03:46.690> with

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
it's another inch lower an f250 with

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.350 
it's another inch lower an f250 with
these<00:03:47.200> sized<00:03:47.410> tires<00:03:47.740> I<00:03:48.190> don't<00:03:49.090> think<00:03:49.270> you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
these sized tires I don't think you

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.460 
these sized tires I don't think you
could<00:03:49.510> get<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.780> drill<00:03:49.990> back<00:03:50.110> there<00:03:50.320> unless

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
could get the drill back there unless

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.880 
could get the drill back there unless
you<00:03:50.590> had<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.740> right<00:03:50.950> angle<00:03:51.220> drill<00:03:55.500> those<00:03:56.500> red

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
you had a right angle drill those red

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.190 
you had a right angle drill those red
flaps<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:59.140> I<00:04:00.390> asked<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.450> dealer<00:04:01.750> about<00:04:01.990> some

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
flaps and I asked a dealer about some

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.850 
flaps and I asked a dealer about some
Ford<00:04:02.440> factory<00:04:02.680> flaps<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.780> they<00:04:04.930> wanted<00:04:05.170> $300

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
Ford factory flaps and they wanted $300

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.720 
Ford factory flaps and they wanted $300
installed<00:04:06.280> for<00:04:06.610> him<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:08.459> these<00:04:09.459> were<00:04:11.580> $40<00:04:12.580> for

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
installed for him and these were $40 for

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.150 
installed for him and these were $40 for
the<00:04:12.790> front<00:04:12.970> $40<00:04:13.510> for<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.780> rear

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
the front $40 for the rear

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.690 
the front $40 for the rear
so<00:04:16.090> 80<00:04:16.810> bucks<00:04:17.080> versus<00:04:17.470> 300<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.160> took<00:04:18.520> me

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
so 80 bucks versus 300 and it took me

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.110 
so 80 bucks versus 300 and it took me
about<00:04:20.250> not<00:04:21.250> counting<00:04:21.520> the<00:04:21.580> time<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.790> took<00:04:21.940> a

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
about not counting the time I took a

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.230 
about not counting the time I took a
wash<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:22.630> truck<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:22.960> took<00:04:23.110> me<00:04:23.230> about<00:04:23.350> an<00:04:23.500> hour

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
wash the truck it took me about an hour

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.360 
wash the truck it took me about an hour
so<00:04:26.160> yeah<00:04:27.160> overall<00:04:27.460> not<00:04:28.030> too<00:04:28.060> bad
