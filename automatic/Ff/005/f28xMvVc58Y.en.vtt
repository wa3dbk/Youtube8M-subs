00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
counters here which I think are really

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.190 
counters here which I think are really
nice<00:01:11.040> cuz<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.360> brown<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.840> blue<00:01:12.990> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
nice cuz they're like brown and blue so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.130 
nice cuz they're like brown and blue so
it<00:01:13.229> matches<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> store<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.340> well<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it matches the store really well so I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.899
