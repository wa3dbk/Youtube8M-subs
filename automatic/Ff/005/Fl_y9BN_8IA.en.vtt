a<00:00:17.369> pod<00:00:19.850> in<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.060> same<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.510> we're<00:00:21.990> trying<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
a pod in the same time we're trying to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.810

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so like I said that's a perfect example

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.790 
so like I said that's a perfect example

like and yeah it's the right time to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.119 
like and yeah it's the right time to
change<00:00:52.680> them<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:54.530> obviously<00:00:56.239> if<00:00:57.590> if<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:58.859> pod
