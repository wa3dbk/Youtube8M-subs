00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
don't know why someone can't just get in

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.030 
don't know why someone can't just get in
his<00:02:44.170> turret<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:45.870> shoot<00:02:46.870> behind<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.560> know<00:02:47.590> we're

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
his turret and shoot behind I know we're

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.970 
his turret and shoot behind I know we're
here<00:02:48.340> but<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.200> someone<00:02:53.650> else<00:02:53.800> could

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
here but you know someone else could

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.080 
here but you know someone else could
then<00:02:54.130> know<00:02:54.490> not<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.880> shoot<00:02:55.120> me<00:02:56.880> for<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.940> year

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
then know not to shoot me for the year

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.610 
then know not to shoot me for the year
this<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.330> much<00:02:58.690> worse<00:02:58.720> than<00:02:59.050> the<00:03:01.380> first<00:03:02.380> Death

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
this is much worse than the first Death

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.310 
this is much worse than the first Death
Star<00:03:02.890> because<00:03:03.370> we've<00:03:03.880> got<00:03:04.060> twists<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:05.170> turns

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
Star because we've got twists and turns

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.070 
Star because we've got twists and turns
so<00:03:05.940> that's<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.150> still<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.420> him<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.840> whatever

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
so that's one still on him well whatever
