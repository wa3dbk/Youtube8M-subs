of<00:00:39.059> chocolate<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.930> really<00:00:40.230> comes<00:00:40.530> down<00:00:40.680> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
of chocolate and it really comes down to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.619 
of chocolate and it really comes down to
the<00:00:41.010> flavor<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the flavor it's got to do with the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
the flavor it's got to do with the
amount<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> cocoa<00:00:43.320> solids<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> cocoa<00:00:44.460> butter

sugars that are put into chocolate to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
chilled I scream mixture here I'm going

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.900 
chilled I scream mixture here I'm going
to<00:02:20.360> gently<00:02:20.600> bring<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.959> setting<00:02:21.380> up<00:02:21.530> to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
to gently bring the setting up to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
to gently bring the setting up to
folding<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.060> kneading<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.510> I'm<00:02:23.720> going<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
folding and kneading and I'm going to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.110 
folding and kneading and I'm going to
pour<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.320> my<00:02:24.470> ice<00:02:24.620> cream<00:02:24.890> mixture<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.000> is

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
pour in my ice cream mixture and this is

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.150 
pour in my ice cream mixture and this is
going<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.360> turn<00:02:26.660> our<00:02:26.959> ice<00:02:27.110> cream<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:27.920> want<00:02:28.100> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
going to turn our ice cream we want to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.280 
going to turn our ice cream we want to
do<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.370> for<00:02:28.550> about<00:02:28.640> 15<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.300> 20<00:02:29.570> minutes

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.080 

so<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.470> freezer<00:02:36.740> bowl<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.190> actually<00:02:37.550> freezing

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
so the freezer bowl is actually freezing

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.180 
so the freezer bowl is actually freezing
the<00:02:38.180> ice<00:02:38.330> cream<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.230> paddle<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.740> turning

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
the ice cream and the paddle is turning

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.920 
the ice cream and the paddle is turning
the<00:02:40.280> mixture<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.090> ice<00:02:41.240> crystals<00:02:41.780> don't

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
the mixture so the ice crystals don't

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.290 
the mixture so the ice crystals don't
form<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.710> in<00:02:42.890> turn<00:02:43.100> makes<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.610> creamier

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
form this in turn makes a creamier

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.930 
form this in turn makes a creamier
smoother<00:02:45.140> ice<00:02:45.320> cream<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.820> looking

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
smoother ice cream so this is looking

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.300 
smoother ice cream so this is looking
really<00:02:47.510> close<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.900> being<00:02:48.050> ready<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.250> I'm

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
really close to being ready now so I'm

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.650 
really close to being ready now so I'm
gonna<00:02:49.400> switch<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.790> off<00:02:50.030> if<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.270> wanted<00:02:50.570> a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
gonna switch it off if you wanted a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.150 
gonna switch it off if you wanted a
harder<00:02:50.870> consistency<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.590> could<00:02:51.710> easily<00:02:51.890> just

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
harder consistency you could easily just

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.370 
harder consistency you could easily just
pop<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:52.550> into<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.850> plastic<00:02:53.450> tub<00:02:53.600> pop<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.320> the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
pop it into a plastic tub pop it in the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.040 
pop it into a plastic tub pop it in the
freezer<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.920> little<00:02:55.160> bit<00:02:55.550> longer<00:02:55.760> but<00:02:56.540> I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
freezer for a little bit longer but I

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.010 
freezer for a little bit longer but I
like<00:02:57.740> it
