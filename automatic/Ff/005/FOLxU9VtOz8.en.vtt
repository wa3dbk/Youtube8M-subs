00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.430
 I like the human evolution brings 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.619
 their bit to international year 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.720
 of sustainable energy with activities 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.430
 throughout the week since Tuesday 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.140
 hosts a sample of solar toys 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.700
 that can be visited for free 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.099
 until Sunday the provincial agency 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.470
 of energy we have brought here our 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.320
 solar toys so that the public in 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.810
 general about all the smallest the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.090
 children can see in situ that they with 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.800
 your own eyes here play with the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.390
 different devices that we have and that 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.670
 take advantage of one of the energies 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.390
 renewable in this case because the energy 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.699
 solar 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.859
 the devices work from light 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.960
 natural or in this case to be illuminated 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.730
 with a plexus as soon as it goes out or 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.620
 when moving towards a shady area they leave 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.420
 of working the light impacts on a 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.190
 cell or photovoltaic panel that 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.059
 converts solar energy into energy 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.679
 electric 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.390
 We have solar chargers for 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.280
 when we go for example to the beach we 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.690
 we lose our mobile and 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.180
 we can 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.110
 charge the battery then through this 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.560
 solar apparatus 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.840
 we have flashlights 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.530
 at a certain moment we load them and 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.530
 they provide us with the light that in another 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 moment that is necessary 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.409
 then with different applications there 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.240
 panels in which children can see 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.190
 how that electricity can be 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.979
 transform well into movement to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.200
 through a fan in lighting to 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.090
 through a light bulb we can generate 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.460
 movement in objects and even light 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.500
 we see how this photovoltaic panel makes 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.450
 that the bulb lights up if we pass the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.860
 hand between the light and the panel we can 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.960
 Observe how the intensity decreases 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.210
 another application is that of 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.250
 produce sound electricity is produced 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.759
 through the transformation of the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.440
 solar energy in electricity and 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.580
 So we will get here how 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.590
 music background music function 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.700
 in this case what has been commented are 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.990
 appliances that work with panels 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.000
 photovoltaic said transforms the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.220
 solar energy in electrical energy but 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.110
 another application of solar energy is 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.750
 solar thermal energy that takes advantage 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.239
 that radiation then for energy 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.600
 heat is not hot and here it's good 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.950
 a small scale sample of how it would be 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.920
 an oven or a solar oven 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.569
 here for example we could introduce 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.330
 one if we go camping 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.030
 we introduce a casserole with water 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.750
 we can heat that water through 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.570
 this little this oven 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.010
 is showing another example in which 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.990
 we can see the usefulness of the energies 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.840
 renewable is in this car model 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.730
 of hydrogen we would have a device 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.760
 that where the 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.860
 electrolysis of water then gives us the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.880
 passage of electricity through the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.000
 fluid we would produce oxygen in state 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.610
 gaseous and hydrogen in this case then 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.850
 well we would have the car that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.970
 We would arrive a deposit not your deposit 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.900
 of fuel like with this gas there 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.580
 team you can see another application of 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.170
 the energy of renewable energies 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.239
 because in this case, well, the 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.630
 electricity is produced with a 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.060
 small battery that makes the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.910
 apparatus but we could also get 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.220
 this then with through a panel 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.170
 photovoltaic the important thing is to do 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.060
 get to the little ones that use 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.860
 in your day to day renewable energies that 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.750
 are in everyday life is in the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.190
 market 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.470
 well not in any store but good 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.330
 us through internet and crowd 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.910
 of these are some examples some 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.660
 significant but 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.580
 a multitude of panel applications 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.130
 small photovoltaics to produce 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.190
 electricity backpacks new for the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.050
 People who like to go hiking 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.930
 good with that they go with their little plate 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.370
 photovoltaic and we can use that 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.350
 electricity at a specific moment 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.140
 that as for example for the 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.670
 charger that we run out of battery the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.260
 greeting the provincial energy agency 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.760
 organize a free tour 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.990
 his informative classroom of the complex 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.060
 assistance from white sources the 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.950
 Provincial Delegation we have a 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.459
 small wind turbine boiler 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.190
 good biomass different technologies that 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.290
 take advantage of that energy that we have of 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.440
 renewable energies what we have in the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.090
 nature and are therefore applied in a 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.730
 small building or so a classroom to 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.770
 mode of post a single-family dwelling 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.170
 where the general public not only 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.180
 the small ones but well anyone 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.030
 that is interested in these issues 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.129
 can see what real applications have 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.349
 these technologies in 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.089
 in the building the visit will be the 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.709
 Saturday at 11:30 in the morning is 

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:51.789
 free although you have to register 

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:53.589
 previously in the museum of evolution 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.360
 human the week of the energies 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:57.009
 Renewables is completed with a talk 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.080
 about the energy revolution in the 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.949
 the museum 's meeting hall the appointment this 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.949
 Friday at a quarter past eight
