00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.810
 co 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.060
 Hello. I will win the addition caricature. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.220
 In this time, I will draw people's faces 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:29.070
 I did a good job to let you know about the best tricks. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:33.600
 At least once when the room so you face is that you've done a very hesitant experience 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:38.720
 So, for example, the person named silver , and the result is an alien m 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 In addition, or what jjugeulyi make out the face, do not even think very 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:51.269
 Figure embarrassed because the film would have been part of that experience and wants seureowotdeon 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:58.649
 I do not think I can make it. 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:01:04.260
 So at this time, I will give you a quick, easy, 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:09.600
 I'm going to make the door open to you about the technique. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.120
 You can only remember two things: 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 Besides, there is something very important. 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:22.020
 Since it is a part of right 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:27.689
 b Les That is what divides the face fits how we doejil the Visage 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:34.259
 I'll tell you two rules in this part. 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.380
 First, the one- on- one rule, and second, the one-on-one rule 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.060
 Think about the branches. 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:45.840
 I will literally suck the brief that the screen one-to-one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.320
 And secondly, we split the screen in three. 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.710
 1 1 1 so splitting the Visage at a constant rate to the point that the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:00.539
 I'm talking about how to deploy it. 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.320
 So let's just hear how these things are connected to the world. 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.509
 I'll do it. 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:09.570
 You can draw an external command in the form of an egg on the screen first. 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.410
 Roll your hands several times. 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.410
 Please draw your face. 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.320
 Here again , one of the most important parts 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:25.300
 Of course, the human face basically the right party state layer 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.320
 Draw a pretty egg in the form of a retreat layer as it stands on the side 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.680
 Please. 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.170
 Then draw a center line 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.790
 Snow flock into the center of Buxton'll need to identify the correct characters, but preferred layer 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.830
 He can come out. 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.220
 There's already a laws of the region. 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.220
 right 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.120
 Obviously seona at the same rate because let's split the screen in half More 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:59.010
 You can see clothes . 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:04.350
 The first thing that comes out here is the eye. 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:10.430
 The position of the eye is drawn to the face of the head end and the toe end 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.430
 In other words, the one-to-one rule puts money in the middle position. 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:20.409
 The second one is Koh Coway Beach 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:28.000
 It just ends up in the same spot that divides the eye and chin into one . 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:33.790
 Third, I wish you to be in the middle between your nose and chin on your mouth. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.659
 In this way, the rule of one area is to put three elements 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.900
 You can count. 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.900
 And the second one-to-one rule 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:48.140
 If you divide your face into three equal parts from the tip of your head to the tip of your chin, 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.110
 Would it be 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.890
 4 You'll be your heart. 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.550
 Eyebrows on your eyes. Eyebrows . 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:02.110
 Position width 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:07.050
 You can set the width and then 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.050
 A snowball with a matte look 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:18.030
 The third part of the snow flakes of both eyes is the eye 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:22.380
 Golden Ratio pushes it would already be the one corresponding to the liver 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:26.730
 In this way the case 100 and the eyebrow 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:35.610
 You can talk about Migan. 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:36.480
 Secondly, if the nose is made in the central part of the right stand to see a nose and nose 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.260
 I will. 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.660
 In this way, choose the simplest child rights. 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:51.510
 Lastly, two-thirds of this week corresponds to Dell's rule. 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:55.590
 At the tip of your eyebrows and nose, you are the hero 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:00.200
 However jindago group pushes you see how to do this one law-one 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.200
 One-to-one rule 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.289
 In position 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.289
 Division 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.160
 Nose 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:20.059
 Yeah, I'll proceed quickly wear jundamyeon 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:23.749
 At an ideal rate 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:28.129
 A man's obsession 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:35.830
 You'll know it's complete. 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:35.830
 We have two kinds of laws can be seen as a very fast and easy to get 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:49.319
 How did you like it? This way you can draw a person's face quickly and simply. 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:50.490
 Oh thou two laws that now is not difficult to draw a human face 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:54.960
 Maybe. 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.469
 4 I will do this for the area around the face of a person 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.469
 Thank you
