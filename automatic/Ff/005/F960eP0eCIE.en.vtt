00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.360
 your mouth monsters droid and I bring you 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.279
 bad news something that we see ourselves coming 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.570
 because good if you remember the video 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.460
 last I told them that we were going to have the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.950
 beta testing group what you are going to do 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.230
 last Friday and well then it happened 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.449
 everything that is Friday and weekend and already 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.359
 decided to discuss the matter what it is 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.129
 tommaso and I am and now he was stealing 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.770
 about a group of truth texting that 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.140
 they opened and yes yes it was real but I am and neither 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.449
 tomás just tweeted because it was a 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 test group nothing else the group was already 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.510
 removed this and the beta is going to 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.629
 delay until August says I am and that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.299
 Well, it's nothing playable right now, like 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.239
 they have on phones that is really 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:58.510
 it's not going well and tomás just said 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.000
 also a tweet that says that if you 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.610
 they will take the 29 as we think and 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.470
 as they had said we would not 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.940
 what is music enchantments ni 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.750
 support for controls so 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.210
 possibly they take it out in August 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.590
 the windows beta not specified but 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.690
 I'm sure the windows beta 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.200
 if you are going to leave this sooner because that 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.940
 they already had almost finished you know until the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.280
 they were playing the main with that 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.900
 possibly if you go to first will be 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 what is the gameplay of that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.210
 likewise the discharge and all this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.010
 I will teach how to download and this because 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.080
 for pocket edition that what we 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.900
 matter more to us we have to 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.940
 wait until August ok and the group by 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.710
 now there is not all this this 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.140
 matter what I know I did not intimidate about the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.470
 group because like tomasson and shogi 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.479
 they had warned I said ok this group yes 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.670
 they had ministered is real that's how it was 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.410
 real but I said for something they have not 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.750
 announced then I will not do any 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.860
 hype because I knew it was going to 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.690
 delay because they did not say anything not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.369
 they said nothing and everything was like 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.890
 suspense you ask me a lot 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.330
 on the subject and I answered him then that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.100
 until I left them I did not 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.869
 I could say anything because I had to see 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.430
 that came out of them and well then here 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.620
 Unfortunately, this information comes out 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.510
 for all of us, it will be necessary 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.880
 wait a little bit more in August 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.590
 Such is the difference that is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.510
 good even if it is not at the end of August 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.569
 but good since it is missing for August 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:30.080
 how many days 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:32.720
 and then I'm a little bit with what and why 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.240
 I am not I was eager to see the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.220
 performance on phones as they were going to 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.170
 do with all the news was a 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.610
 curiosity that we all had what is going to 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.880
 happen with the phones there will be more 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.070
 the acc now I tell them may the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.810
 Windows version does come out on the 29th or 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.790
 those days that I'm sure because 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.220
 mick the software is getting too much 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.110
 pressure and as I tell you already the version 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.120
 they were playing at the conference in 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.310
 the main with that version to the windows 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.900
 10 and that version already had enchantments 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.690
 I already had music I had enough things 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.790
 then and what you have strived for 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.640
 little bit more and focus as you want to leave 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.130
 a little abandoned but apparently yes 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.660
 to see music because tomás just said 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.970
 it will not go all for all time but 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.620
 that there's going to be music then it's a 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.470
 good news who knows I know how much 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.850
 I'm going to think minecraft itself but I 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.680
 I warned them in the 45 days that I already did 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.840
 on the subject I warned you that the dates 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.340
 they were attempts that were always 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.030
 delay the matter always always 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.400
 always from the 0.8 that will start only 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.640
 sales have always been delays 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.380
 I swear this I warned them until 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.630
 that not good with me do not get angry 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.580
 I said it may be 29 may not 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.990
 it may be delayed but well I tell you 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.790
 If the Windows version is this train 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.540
 is a gameplay as detailed of all the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.010
 and this will be like a little taste 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.670
 what comes to pocket because it is what 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.830
 same 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.660
 and then we will have this from here to that 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.550
 give us the willis and all this 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.410
 comment what you think about this the truth is not 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.270
 I wanted to give you this bad news but 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.160
 I have to do it if it's my duty with 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.200
 you are not going to leave like that 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.080
 that the air as well as that although they passed 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.730
 you left flying with this because 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.890
 did not leave us on air it was just what 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.780
 that I did not touch the subject because I wanted 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.209
 what 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.889
 and confirm everything officially and good 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.730
 here is the sad confirmation of everything 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.730
 this is late 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.870
 If they are new to the community, 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.849
 they will know that this is normal what 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.029
 the will is leaving books that 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.560
 etcetera and some accounts so if they go 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.360
 soon they will give you a product of 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.650
 better quality as well that take it 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.610
 that they have to take so long is not 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:44.930
 a lot of half a month more then I do not know the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.930
 I really was something like what 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.420
 I'm a little disappointed but I do not 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.990
 Surprise because it is normal for this to happen 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.040
 so I do not know what you think but 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.569
 here is the news do not comment 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.159
 seriously comment on what 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.580
 I want to know your opinions because in 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.500
 reality 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.150
 I feel like they are going to leave me but 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.820
 I warned them not so there is not 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.650
 like we 're not going that you told us not to 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.680
 I did not tell them that possibly then 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.790
 there is the change of dates and by the 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.310
 moment I was watching how to install 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.500
 windows 10 on my computer this if that 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.380
 version comes out first and then to give no to 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.570
 what is the testing of that version by 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.870
 while curiously nothing else spoke 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.100
 of what is the android version and ios 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.110
 I do not know what will happen with the version of 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.150
 windows phone that is not the same as 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.160
 windows 10 windows phone that part 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.200
 then maybe that version comes out 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.900
 together with windows 10 I do not know how to 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.130
 are going to do but it will be interesting the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.840
 people who have a 2 went to see what 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.450
 will go by there to see if there are wheels 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.620
 over there I do not know how to handle the 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.419
 windows your store ever 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.600
 never stopped a phone with windows 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.520
 so 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.500
 do not comment too if they have windows 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.150
 phone it would be interesting to see if there 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.280
 people with windows seeing me because then 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.810
 I've never heard of subscribers with 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.510
 windows phones the truth 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.080
 but people have already diverted me a little 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.730
 about the topic 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.430
 I 'm sorry to give you that news but I tell you 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.410
 it's my duty and it's also an apology 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.190
 this is a bit I have been told a lot 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.190
 in your videos of what 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.630
 why I do not do a script telling me not 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.370
 I do not like to do scripts because I do not 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.990
 like to learn things or rehearse 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.970
 nothing I like to do everything more natural 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.650
 as if I were talking to my 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.050
 friends dare good because you are like 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.930
 my friends on the internet then I 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.880
 I like to talk to you at 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.250
 microphone I like to speak naturally 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.980
 as would anyone not me 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.000
 like I feel that rehearsing a script is very 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:43.610
 very very like that as for reports or 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.230
 serious things and this for me is like 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.880
 talking to you is a subject that 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.980
 it is in common interest that it is the 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.360
 update then recommend us 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.980
 also what they think of that has never 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.830
 made videos and series with a script because 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:58.260
 I do not like to be more fake 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.610
 but it is also not the answer that topic 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.330
 They are asking me a lot 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.879
 what did not script and then 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.590
 I do not like scripts I do not know always 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.639
 has been my style so improvise more 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.009
 natural 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.509
 I think I think it's better for me 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.219
 so if I write a script I would 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.569
 too much because I do not like to follow 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.189
 scripts I say like I would have to 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:18.740
 be remembering the parties and like that 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:20.599
 not then people want to clarify that 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.949
 topic has to do if it has to do with 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:24.020
 these videos because that's not what I 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.830
 they commented a lot but not as much as 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.300
 be all for this video 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.550
 twitter links of 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.009
 tomás or yogi in the description and then 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.930
 link also of what the group is 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.360
 that no longer exists if they want to move to 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.639
 see it because there is no longer a click this 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.099
 they do not open anything anymore, there is no longer 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:44.800
 group but in the link also and by my 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:46.419
 part be all for this video now yes
