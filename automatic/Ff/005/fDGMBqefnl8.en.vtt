00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.770 

the<00:01:29.520> heat<00:01:29.670> transfer<00:01:29.700> fluid<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.509> either<00:01:30.630> be

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the heat transfer fluid can either be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.319 
the heat transfer fluid can either be
drained<00:01:31.049> back<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.469> the<00:01:31.560> circulator<00:01:32.329> or

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
drained back to the circulator or

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
drained back to the circulator or
separately<00:01:33.780> by<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:33.930> strain
