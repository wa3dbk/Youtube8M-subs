silica<00:00:11.700> silica<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> mineral<00:00:12.750> basically

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
silica silica is a mineral basically

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.770 
silica silica is a mineral basically
derived<00:00:13.710> from<00:00:13.950> silicon<00:00:14.639> which<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
derived from silicon which is in the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.849 
derived from silicon which is in the
environment<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.529> actually<00:00:16.830> very

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
environment and it's actually very

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.160 
environment and it's actually very
credible<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> environment<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.930> kind

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
credible in the environment and so kind

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.439 
credible in the environment and so kind
of<00:00:19.289> Valley<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:20.070> California<00:00:20.100> fun<00:00:20.820> fact<00:00:21.180> is

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
of Valley in California fun fact is

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.599 
of Valley in California fun fact is
actually<00:00:22.170> named<00:00:22.439> Silicon<00:00:22.949> Valley<00:00:23.189> because

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
actually named Silicon Valley because

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.810 
actually named Silicon Valley because
silicon<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.510> very<00:00:24.720> prevalent<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> region

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
silicon was very prevalent in the region

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.370 
silicon was very prevalent in the region
many<00:00:26.820> years<00:00:27.119> ago<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.630> first<00:00:27.840> initially

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
many years ago when they first initially

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.320 
many years ago when they first initially
named<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.310> how<00:00:29.429> Silicon<00:00:29.880> Valley<00:00:30.119> was

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
named it so it's how Silicon Valley was

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.540 
named it so it's how Silicon Valley was
named<00:00:30.539> Silicon<00:00:30.990> Valley<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:32.070> cool<00:00:32.309> thing

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
named Silicon Valley the cool thing

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
named Silicon Valley the cool thing
about<00:00:32.579> silica<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.020> an<00:00:34.110> amazing

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
about silica is that it's an amazing

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.990 
about silica is that it's an amazing
mineral<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> has<00:00:35.070> many<00:00:35.489> beneficial

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
hair skin or nails silica is definitely

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.869 
hair skin or nails silica is definitely
a<00:00:43.379> supplement<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> beneficial<00:00:44.670> for

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
a supplement that is beneficial for

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.540 
a supplement that is beneficial for
those<00:00:45.000> things<00:00:45.270> initially<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:47.039> own<00:00:47.129> life<00:00:47.340> I

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
those things initially in my own life I

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.270 
those things initially in my own life I
got<00:00:47.789> silica<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.809> started<00:00:49.800> having<00:00:50.129> some

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
got silica because I started having some

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.810 
got silica because I started having some
different<00:00:50.899> hair<00:00:51.920> my<00:00:52.920> hair<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.250> falling<00:00:53.489> off<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
different hair my hair was falling off I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
different hair my hair was falling off I
had<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.270> receding<00:00:55.050> hairline<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.890> like

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
had a receding hairline and I'm like

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.500 
had a receding hairline and I'm like
this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> ridiculous<00:00:56.850> I'm<00:00:57.120> too<00:00:57.239> young<00:00:57.449> for

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this is ridiculous I'm too young for

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.470 
this is ridiculous I'm too young for
this<00:00:57.840> shenanigans<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> started<00:01:00.149> looking<00:01:00.239> up

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this shenanigans so I started looking up

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
this shenanigans so I started looking up
researching<00:01:00.989> online<00:01:01.109> different<00:01:01.820> basically

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
researching online different basically

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.690 
researching online different basically
holistic<00:01:03.530> modalities<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.830> minerals<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
holistic modalities and minerals and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.179 
holistic modalities and minerals and
herbs<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.659> name<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.680> helped<00:01:07.979> with

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
herbs and you name it that helped with

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.530 
herbs and you name it that helped with
hair<00:01:08.460> growth<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> regrowing

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
hair growth and kind of regrowing

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.080 
hair growth and kind of regrowing
widow's<00:01:10.200> peak<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.590> men<00:01:10.909> preventing<00:01:11.909> hair<00:01:12.060> loss

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
widow's peak in men preventing hair loss

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
widow's peak in men preventing hair loss
I<00:01:12.510> thought<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> silica<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> most

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
I thought a silica is one of most

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
I thought a silica is one of most
important<00:01:14.220> minerals<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.090> when<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.240> think

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
important minerals that so when I think

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
important minerals that so when I think
when<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.540> start<00:01:15.780> taking<00:01:15.900> silicon<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.619> took<00:01:16.830> this

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
when I start taking silicon I took this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
when I start taking silicon I took this
is<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> first<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.850> took<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.119> orbital

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is the first so if I took this orbital

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.679 
is the first so if I took this orbital
that<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> silica<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> liquid<00:01:21.090> silica

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
that the silica and just a liquid silica

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.140 
that the silica and just a liquid silica
and<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.439> liquid<00:01:22.890> dietary<00:01:23.640> supplements

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and I do like liquid dietary supplements

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
and I do like liquid dietary supplements
which<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.360> liquid<00:01:24.540> liquid<00:01:25.380> products<00:01:26.070> in

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
which is liquid liquid products in

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
which is liquid liquid products in
general<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.909> feel<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.180> liquids<00:01:27.720> are

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
general because I feel like liquids are

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
general because I feel like liquids are
more<00:01:28.049> bioavailable<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> body<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.520> opposed

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
more bioavailable to the body as opposed

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.319 
more bioavailable to the body as opposed
to<00:01:30.470> plants<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.520> other<00:01:32.700> things<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to plants or in other things I have a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.609 
to plants or in other things I have a
play<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.600> I'll<00:01:33.990> show<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> minute

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
play here I'll show you in a minute

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010 
play here I'll show you in a minute
but<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.939> started<00:01:36.180> taking<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.780> start

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
but so I started taking it and I start

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.870 
but so I started taking it and I start
realizing<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.310> hair<00:01:38.490> start<00:01:38.729> going

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
realizing really way my hair start going

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
realizing really way my hair start going
faster<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.350> my<00:01:40.409> toenails<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.950> had<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
faster one of my toenails that had a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.139 
faster one of my toenails that had a
spot<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.840> starting<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.399> get<00:01:44.399> basically

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
spot on it was starting to get basically

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.100

that synergistic ratio for your body to

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.800 
that synergistic ratio for your body to
use<00:04:10.370> what<00:04:11.030> happens<00:04:11.330> is<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.600> your<00:04:11.780> body

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
use what happens is that your body

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.350 
use what happens is that your body
starts<00:04:12.260> storing<00:04:12.530> calcium<00:04:13.160> in<00:04:13.400> your<00:04:13.460> joints

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
starts storing calcium in your joints

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.110 
starts storing calcium in your joints
and<00:04:14.510> ligaments<00:04:15.230> tendons<00:04:15.489> in<00:04:16.489> your<00:04:16.610> arteries

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
and ligaments tendons in your arteries

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.440 
and ligaments tendons in your arteries
which<00:04:17.360> is<00:04:17.540> obviously<00:04:18.310> connected<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.580> the<00:04:19.910> main

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
which is obviously connected is the main

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.420 
which is obviously connected is the main
blood<00:04:20.690> flow<00:04:21.110> channel<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.160> from<00:04:22.310> your

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
blood flow channel to and from your

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.090 
blood flow channel to and from your
heart<00:04:22.550> so<00:04:23.450> if<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.290> have<00:04:24.380> too<00:04:24.500> much<00:04:24.590> calcium<00:04:24.830> of

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
heart so if you have too much calcium of

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.260 
heart so if you have too much calcium of
your<00:04:25.220> body<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.550> not<00:04:25.640> enough<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.240> other

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
your body and not enough of the other

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.810 
your body and not enough of the other
minerals<00:04:26.810> your<00:04:27.560> body<00:04:27.590> will<00:04:28.130> start<00:04:28.370> depositing

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
minerals your body will start depositing

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.570 
minerals your body will start depositing
calcium<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:30.190> indicators<00:04:31.190> of<00:04:31.340> your<00:04:31.430> body

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
calcium and indicators of your body

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.080 
calcium and indicators of your body
causing<00:04:32.240> stiffness<00:04:32.930> joint<00:04:33.290> pain<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
causing stiffness joint pain the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.040 
causing stiffness joint pain the
constriction<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.150> your<00:04:35.300> arteries<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:35.900> your

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
constriction of your arteries so your

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.530 
constriction of your arteries so your
arteries<00:04:36.380> look<00:04:36.590> like<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.950> 5020<00:04:37.820> calcium<00:04:38.270> and

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
arteries look like this 5020 calcium and

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.730 
arteries look like this 5020 calcium and
now<00:04:38.750> that's<00:04:38.900> other<00:04:39.080> minerals<00:04:39.440> your<00:04:39.530> arteries

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
now that's other minerals your arteries

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.870 
now that's other minerals your arteries
will<00:04:39.890> start<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> actually<00:04:40.250> shrink<00:04:40.730> and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
will start to actually shrink and

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.360 
will start to actually shrink and
constrict<00:04:41.330> causing<00:04:42.230> your<00:04:42.500> heart<00:04:42.740> tap<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.220> work

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
constrict causing your heart tap to work

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.610 
constrict causing your heart tap to work
harder<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:44.390> pump<00:04:44.570> blood<00:04:44.840> through<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.380> same

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
harder to pump blood through that same

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.430 
harder to pump blood through that same
constricted<00:04:46.250> pathway<00:04:46.850> but<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.900> cool<00:04:48.200> thing

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
constricted pathway but the cool thing

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.190 
constricted pathway but the cool thing
about<00:04:48.530> silica<00:04:49.190> is<00:04:50.030> f2<00:04:50.360> something<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:50.810> helps

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
about silica is f2 something that helps

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.920 
about silica is f2 something that helps
