00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello lionel sartori energy director academy today i'm going 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.290
 explain how to hold a racket rolls the different 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.210
 opportunities to hold a racket either in forehand or backhand 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.800
 I will explain how to hold the racket in forehand we will have four 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.599
 potential 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.919
 on my racket phase I had eight small faces 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.960
 his racket guide I had eight faces that I will use differently 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 following the prices what I will take over 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.850
 the first track with the hammer catch 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.949
 it's a crisis I can haunt a blow with my racket where I have my index 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.110
 and my thumb that are potted 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 the racket phase 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.760
 six games to slightly modify 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.060
 we orient obama 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.380
 slightly on the right 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 and just changing a cold field on the racket 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.729
 I will go to stern jail that will allow me to hit bullets 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.889
 relatively flat and can cover slightly a little bit 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.610
 the ball to put a little more security 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.310
 we will be able to go to the fourth phase so we were on the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.350
 second the third the fourth 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.920
 with the palm of your hand is one of the axes 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.390
 so I will find myself on a track called the one where is the weapon for 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.290
 easily get a sad but western I'll lay my racket at 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.000
 flat on the tennis court 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.549
 I will get it back 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.640
 and automatically this place is good it's called racenet western 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:28.150
 this crisis there go 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.830
 a lot used by most competitive players that allow 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.310
 both to make straight shots relatively lifted basic euros and to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.590
 both flat strikes that will allow to hit at a level of 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.130
 core a little longer 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.460
 that the taking of arms 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.720
 so the pear to attack the ball and she with a body that is going to be 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.000
 slightly a little more moving at the moment of the typing I'm going to have more 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.990
 of rotations 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.350
 on the end of my gesture with this crisis 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.390
 q in the term presidency I had just before 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.189
 and I have one last take 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.979
 for jacques sanctions still a little 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.000
 my side on the other side 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.499
 which is going to be a western take 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.949
 and that will allow to put a lot of effect in the ball like big 

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:08.629
 players like rafael nadal 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.559
 that normally turn the ball that can hit very hard 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.839
 so we will have four possibilities 

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:20.259
 for the club players and let's say else for the players a little bit more 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:21.539
 evolved 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.009
 so after having 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:28.349
 seen the four shots on the right forehand side we will go to the reverse side on 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.989
 will likely have two possibilities 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.479
 different snowshoeing rate 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.899
 the first that I will be able to execute so with my left hand I 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.450
 will be able to move slightly racket mountain 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.360
 so yes he will go to the right 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.010
 and my hand will go to the left just now in forehand it moved 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.139
 in this sense 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.949
 now I'm going to go from the left side 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.569
 slightly it's going to give me a classic lapel grip so I'm going to 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.139
 find with a grip 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.079
 relatively flat that will allow me to perform either setbacks cut off either 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.629
 flat setbacks 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.239
 if jackson you are a little racket empty at the end a little more towards 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.150
 the left I'm going to have a catch for a closed country and that will allow to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.090
 cover with the ball to make backhands lifted they put a little more 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.799
 effect 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.799
 and allow to strike with greater violence 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.309
 hammer catch 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.119
 mystery 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.789
 sowing or thermal s 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.739
 western 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.739
 no 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:43.489
 I hope the presentation on the racket feet was clear enough 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.349
 for you 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.279
 and if by chance you still have some uncertainties you can 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.699
 always contact us about the energy academy point fr it will be a pleasure 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:52.359
 to inform you
