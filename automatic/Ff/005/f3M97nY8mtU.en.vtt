hard to find game for the Atari 2600 I
certainly<00:00:14.040> wouldn't<00:00:14.340> say<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.089> rare<00:00:15.389> ski

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719

certainly wouldn't say it's the rare ski
in<00:00:15.780> fact<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.410> not<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.920> rarest<00:00:17.190> game<00:00:17.400> for

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
in fact it is not the rarest game for

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.090 
in fact it is not the rarest game for
the<00:00:17.820> system<00:00:18.119> I'd<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.990> very<00:00:19.260> very<00:00:19.410> excited<00:00:20.070> that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the system I'd be very very excited that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.970 
the system I'd be very very excited that
was<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.910> case<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.140> very<00:00:22.710> rare

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
was the case but this is a very rare

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.120 
was the case but this is a very rare
game<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.630> Atari<00:00:24.840> 2600<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.920> main

game for the Atari 2600 and the main

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.189 
game for the Atari 2600 and the main
reason<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.699> because<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.359> history<00:00:27.539> not

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
reason that is because the history not

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
reason that is because the history not
because<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> great<00:00:28.949> game<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.400> fact<00:00:29.609> it's

it<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> reasons<00:01:42.960> why<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.200> Atari

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it was one of the reasons why the Atari

it was one of the reasons why the Atari
2600<00:01:44.240> end<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.920> video<00:01:47.130> game<00:01:47.280> crash<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
2600 end up the video game crash in a

2600 end up the video game crash in a
pathing<00:01:48.090> because<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.600> basically<00:01:48.990> we're

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
pathing because of this basically we're

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.030 
pathing because of this basically we're
not<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.530> game<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.860> because

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
not because of this game but because

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
not because of this game but because
there's<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.850> lot<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> shovelware<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.689> there

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
there's a lot of shovelware and there

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.120 
there's a lot of shovelware and there
was<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> lot<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.290> games<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.590> were<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:52.950> very

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
was a lot of games that were not very

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.020 
was a lot of games that were not very
good<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.329> Atari<00:01:54.710> 2600<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
good for the Atari 2600 so this is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.319

crash it didn't cause the video game
crash<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.689> certainly<00:02:04.170> didn't<00:02:05.070> help<00:02:05.250> the

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
stack of hay I really don't know this is

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.770 
stack of hay I really don't know this is
the<00:04:48.350> third<00:04:48.530> stage<00:04:48.860> like<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:50.090> very<00:04:50.300> top<00:04:50.510> is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
the third stage like the very top is

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.340 
the third stage like the very top is
very<00:04:50.840> narrow

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
very narrow

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.370 
very narrow
if<00:04:51.500> you<00:04:51.740> don't<00:04:51.920> time<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.190> just<00:04:52.640> right<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.990> you

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
if you don't time it just right it you

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.840 
if you don't time it just right it you
can't<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.740> go<00:04:54.890> in<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.070> very<00:04:55.250> top<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.580> may<00:04:55.760> it

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
can't I go in the very top it may it

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.910 
can't I go in the very top it may it
doesn't<00:04:56.090> make<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.210> difficult<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.290> as<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
doesn't make it difficult and as the

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.280 
doesn't make it difficult and as the
game<00:04:58.100> goes<00:04:58.250> on<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:59.060> food<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.540> jobs<00:04:59.780> does<00:05:00.110> go

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
game goes on the food that jobs does go

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.920 
game goes on the food that jobs does go
faster<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.800> faster<00:05:00.950> so<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:02.210> does<00:05:02.540> make<00:05:02.780> it

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
faster and faster so and does make it

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.480 
faster and faster so and does make it
more<00:05:02.960> difficult<00:05:03.110> in<00:05:03.890> that<00:05:04.070> regard<00:05:04.340> as<00:05:04.460> well

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
more difficult in that regard as well

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.170 
more difficult in that regard as well
here<00:05:05.450> is<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:06.110> final<00:05:06.320> stage<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.980> this<00:05:07.340> is<00:05:07.520> when

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
here is the final stage and this is when

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.880 
here is the final stage and this is when

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
you have to kind of figure out start

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.850 
you have to kind of figure out start
with<00:05:10.010> 60<00:05:10.250> seconds<00:05:10.700> another<00:05:11.330> flying<00:05:11.780> dog<00:05:12.290> don't

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860

frustrating<00:05:17.960> in<00:05:18.140> this<00:05:18.290> game<00:05:18.500> is<00:05:18.770> if<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.520> get

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700

you can get hit again and again and
again<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:24.980> again<00:05:25.160> I've<00:05:25.310> been<00:05:25.340> delayed<00:05:25.820> for

minutes<00:05:42.620> this<00:05:42.680> game<00:05:42.890> was<00:05:43.040> designed<00:05:43.250> very<00:05:43.730> fast

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
minutes this game was designed very fast

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.200

it was a commercial item that I guess

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.630

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230 
floating around like I said before in

floating around like I said before in
the<00:06:00.320> intro<00:06:00.500> of<00:06:00.560> the<00:06:00.680> video<00:06:00.860> it<00:06:01.040> certainly

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
the intro of the video it certainly

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.340 
the intro of the video it certainly
isn't<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.730> rarest<00:06:02.330> game<00:06:02.540> for<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:02.930> system<00:06:03.200> but

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
isn't the rarest game for the system but

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.300 
isn't the rarest game for the system but
it's<00:06:03.500> very<00:06:03.590> sought<00:06:03.860> after<00:06:03.980> by<00:06:04.280> collectors

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
it's very sought after by collectors

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.480 
it's very sought after by collectors
it's<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:04.970> very<00:06:05.210> cool<00:06:05.390> collector's<00:06:06.320> item<00:06:06.890> in

it's a very cool collector's item in

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.120 
it's a very cool collector's item in
conclusion<00:06:08.180> I<00:06:08.450> would<00:06:08.510> say<00:06:08.810> this<00:06:08.990> game<00:06:09.290> is<00:06:09.590> a
