00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.209

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.020
 in the car 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.940
 It's a shame it's a car that sure 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.390
 still 10 to put in the garage 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.400
 I would put it but there is no option here 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.140
 in the upgrade with 7 had option of 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.769
 save in the garage here you put 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.590
 total insurance but in update 1.8 a 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.049
 rockstar decided to take this option and 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.060
 people will understand right? 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.400

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.530
 took the possibility of entering here 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.820
 in the notion of cost but okay 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.650
