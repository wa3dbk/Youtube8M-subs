in<00:00:00.240> this<00:00:00.359> tutorial<00:00:00.599> we're<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.530> create

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
in this tutorial we're going to create

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.619 
in this tutorial we're going to create
the<00:00:01.979> user<00:00:02.129> interface<00:00:02.370> for<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.149> soundboard

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
the user interface for a soundboard

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.800 
the user interface for a soundboard
application<00:00:04.460> to<00:00:05.460> do<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:05.819> we're<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.690> to

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
application to do that we're going to

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.259 
application to do that we're going to
use<00:00:06.899> X<00:00:07.230> codes<00:00:07.620> interface<00:00:08.010> builder<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.610> that

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
use X codes interface builder and that

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.910 
use X codes interface builder and that
will<00:00:09.420> allow<00:00:09.570> us<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.809> visually<00:00:10.349> design<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
will allow us to visually design and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.749 
will allow us to visually design and
implement<00:00:11.490> our<00:00:11.639> apps<00:00:12.030> view<00:00:12.269> very<00:00:12.540> quickly

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
implement our apps view very quickly

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.609 
implement our apps view very quickly
what<00:00:14.759> we're<00:00:14.880> going<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.210> try<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.960> design

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
what we're going to try to do is design

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.410 
what we're going to try to do is design
the<00:00:16.800> interface<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.430> create<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> outlines

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the interface and create the outlines

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.029 
the interface and create the outlines
for<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.690> methods<00:00:19.050> associated<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.920> our

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
for the methods associated with our

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.040 
for the methods associated with our
interface<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.580> we're<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.600> try<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.840> do

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
interface and we're going to try and do

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.980 
interface and we're going to try and do
that<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.410> under<00:00:22.710> five<00:00:22.949> minutes<00:00:23.689> now<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> first

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
that in under five minutes now the first

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.630 
that in under five minutes now the first
thing<00:00:25.140> we're<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.980> create<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.430> new

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
thing we're going to do is create a new

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.480 
thing we're going to do is create a new
project<00:00:26.990> will<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.320> by<00:00:28.529> opening<00:00:28.560> up<00:00:28.949> Xcode

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
project will do that by opening up Xcode

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.030 
project will do that by opening up Xcode

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
clicking file new project making sure

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.680 
clicking file new project making sure
that<00:00:35.370> application<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.090> selected<00:00:36.510> under

mine<00:00:46.649> sound<00:00:47.010> would<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:49.050> save<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.960> can

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
mine sound would it save and as you can

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.430 
mine sound would it save and as you can
see<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:53.600> classes<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.780> been<00:00:54.809> created

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
see here but classes have been created

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.119 
see here but classes have been created
the<00:00:55.980> basic<00:00:56.370> classes<00:00:56.730> would<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.910> included<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
the basic classes would be included and

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
the basic classes would be included and
if<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.399> under<00:00:59.640> classes<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.410> you're

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
if you look under classes here you're

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.189 
if you look under classes here you're
going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> class<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.899> we<00:01:03.899> didn't

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
going to see a class that we didn't

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.780 
going to see a class that we didn't
mention<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.010> were<00:01:05.129> designing<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.640> app

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
mention when we were designing the app

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.330 
mention when we were designing the app
and<00:01:06.000> that's<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.960> soundboard<00:01:07.530> app<00:01:07.830> delegate

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and that's this soundboard app delegate

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
and that's this soundboard app delegate
class<00:01:08.990> now<00:01:09.990> we're<00:01:10.200> not<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
class now we're not going to be

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
class now we're not going to be
modifying<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.490> class<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
modifying that class so I'm not going to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170 
modifying that class so I'm not going to
go<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> details<00:01:13.430> but<00:01:14.430> basically<00:01:14.670> all

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
go into the details but basically all

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940 
go into the details but basically all
we're<00:01:15.330> using<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.720> class<00:01:15.960> form<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.799> load

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
we're using this class form is to load

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.880 
we're using this class form is to load
up<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.189> sound<00:01:17.460> board<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.740> use

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
up our sound board you and you can use

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.200 
up our sound board you and you can use
the<00:01:20.009> techniques<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.580> mentioned<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.090> earlier

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

the interface builder components that

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.520 
the interface builder components that
I'm<00:02:52.109> using<00:02:52.290> now<00:02:53.689> we're<00:02:54.689> going<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> build<00:02:55.260> our

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
I'm using now we're going to build our

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.250 
I'm using now we're going to build our
basic<00:02:56.069> view<00:02:56.510> first<00:02:57.510> thing<00:02:57.689> we're<00:02:57.810> going<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.049> do

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
and we'll do that by clicking on the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.210 
and we'll do that by clicking on the
view<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.870> selecting<00:03:03.870> attributes<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:07.220> you
