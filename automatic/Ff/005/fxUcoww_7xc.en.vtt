00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you start these it sucks up the water

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
you start these it sucks up the water
it's<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> boat<00:00:50.340> obviously<00:00:50.910> with

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it's not like a boat obviously with

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.889 
it's not like a boat obviously with
propeller<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.170> stuff<00:00:52.730> this<00:00:53.730> kind<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> has

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
propeller and stuff this kind of has

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.470 
propeller and stuff this kind of has
like<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.140> suction<00:00:55.469> effect<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:57.000> kind<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
like a suction effect and I was kind of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 
like a suction effect and I was kind of
in<00:00:57.600> lower<00:00:57.870> water<00:00:58.289> letting<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.219> friends

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
in lower water letting off some friends

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.729 
in lower water letting off some friends
and<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> Scan<00:01:00.239> bar<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:01.199> when<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> went<00:01:01.649> out

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and like a Scan bar then when I went out

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
and like a Scan bar then when I went out
turned<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> back<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.910> guess<00:01:03.239> obviously

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
turned it back on I guess obviously

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.899 
turned it back on I guess obviously
wasn't<00:01:04.170> deep<00:01:04.409> enough<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.830> whatever<00:01:05.129> it's

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
wasn't deep enough or whatever it's

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.300 
wasn't deep enough or whatever it's
sucked<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.420> rock<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.890> happens

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
sucked up a rock and then that happens

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.570 
sucked up a rock and then that happens
there's<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> wearing<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:10.020> that's<00:01:10.580> kind

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
there's like a wearing but that's kind

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.510 
there's like a wearing but that's kind
of<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.540> system<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:14.250> anything

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
of going into your system so if anything

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.359 
know like servicing it all the service
charges<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.290> labor<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:47.009> what<00:01:47.250> it's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
charges so it the labor that's what it's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:47.630 
charges so it the labor that's what it's
called

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
called

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.999 
called
and<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.570> friggin<00:01:48.990> sucks<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.829> pay

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and so that friggin sucks like to pay

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.969 
and so that friggin sucks like to pay
that<00:01:50.310> much<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.420> hundred<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.979> ten

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that much it's like a hundred and ten

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
that much it's like a hundred and ten
dollars<00:01:53.399> an<00:01:53.520> hour<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.790> think<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.329> guess<00:01:54.360> it

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
dollars an hour I think and I guess it

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.149 
dollars an hour I think and I guess it
took<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.280> quite<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:58.040> get<00:01:59.040> all

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
took like quite a little bit to get all

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459 
took like quite a little bit to get all
that<00:01:59.310> done<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.329> had<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> kind<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.049> fix<00:02:01.259> my

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that done so they had to kind of fix my

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.530 
that done so they had to kind of fix my
impeller<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.399> since<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.000> wake<00:02:03.149> series

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
impeller and since it's a wake series

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
impeller and since it's a wake series
obviously<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.259> pulled<00:02:04.680> people<00:02:04.890> tubing<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
obviously I pulled people tubing and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.760
