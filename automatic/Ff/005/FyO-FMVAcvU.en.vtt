00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.010 
too much about my own Jeff cab to be
honest<00:01:51.150> and<00:01:52.150> over<00:01:52.420> here<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.540> was<00:01:52.630> gonna<00:01:52.720> do<00:01:52.900> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
honest and over here I was gonna do the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.470 
honest and over here I was gonna do the
same<00:01:53.260> but<00:01:53.470> then<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.620> saw<00:01:53.950> his<00:01:54.700> Archer<00:01:55.060> formation

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
same but then I saw his Archer formation

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.570 
same but then I saw his Archer formation
just<00:01:55.810> wide<00:01:56.170> open<00:01:56.200> spot<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.220> thought<00:01:57.370> oh

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
just wide open spot and I thought oh

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.210 
just wide open spot and I thought oh
just<00:01:57.850> go<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.150> take<00:01:58.420> them<00:01:58.570> all<00:01:58.690> out<00:01:59.070> so<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.130> can

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
just go in take them all out so you can

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.190 
just go in take them all out so you can
see<00:02:00.340> his<00:02:00.430> artist<00:02:00.700> rating<00:02:00.909> runway<00:02:01.180> already<00:02:01.480> but

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
see his artist rating runway already but

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.240 
see his artist rating runway already but
I<00:02:02.230> think<00:02:02.409> he<00:02:02.470> turns<00:02:02.650> it<00:02:02.770> off<00:02:02.860> right<00:02:03.040> about<00:02:03.159> here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
I think he turns it off right about here

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.010 
I think he turns it off right about here
and<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:04.090> allows<00:02:04.270> me<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.630> go<00:02:04.720> straight

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
and this allows me to just go straight

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.270 
and this allows me to just go straight
into<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.260> middle<00:02:05.440> of<00:02:05.470> his<00:02:05.590> formation<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.190> do

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
into the middle of his formation and do

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.460 
into the middle of his formation and do
a<00:02:06.310> little<00:02:06.460> little<00:02:07.450> disruption

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.009 

and<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:13.489> can<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:13.819> it's<00:02:14.120> totally<00:02:14.629> disrupted

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
and you can see it's totally disrupted

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.320 
and you can see it's totally disrupted
them<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.379> taking<00:02:15.590> out<00:02:15.709> their<00:02:15.830> knives<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.400> I

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
them and taking out their knives and I

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.610 
them and taking out their knives and I
even<00:02:17.480> managed<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.870> take<00:02:17.989> out<00:02:18.049> his<00:02:18.170> one<00:02:18.379> minute

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
even managed to take out his one minute

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.050 
even managed to take out his one minute

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.259 
full reign in a constant battlefield and
his<00:02:24.440> militia<00:02:24.680> hoplites<00:02:25.099> can't<00:02:25.370> can't<00:02:26.000> move<00:02:26.150> in

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
his militia hoplites can't can't move in

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.979 
his militia hoplites can't can't move in
time<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.530> let's<00:02:27.680> think<00:02:27.709> about<00:02:27.890> these<00:02:28.190> uh<00:02:28.250> these

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
time so let's think about these uh these

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.390 
time so let's think about these uh these
light<00:02:29.989> infantry<00:02:30.170> formations<00:02:30.799> when<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:31.190> have

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
light infantry formations when you have

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.280 
light infantry formations when you have
all<00:02:31.760> these<00:02:32.000> spear<00:02:32.540> units<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.019> back<00:02:33.140> you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
all these spear units in the back you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.690 
all these spear units in the back you
need<00:02:33.379> to<00:02:33.440> make<00:02:33.620> sure<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.799> your<00:02:34.099> holes<00:02:34.489> are

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
need to make sure that your holes are

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.729 
need to make sure that your holes are
tight<00:02:34.970> otherwise<00:02:35.870> my<00:02:36.049> long<00:02:36.200> shield<00:02:36.470> cavalry

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
tight otherwise my long shield cavalry

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.030 
tight otherwise my long shield cavalry
can<00:02:36.860> just<00:02:37.010> go<00:02:37.129> right<00:02:37.280> into<00:02:37.430> those<00:02:37.549> holes<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
can just go right into those holes and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.440 
can just go right into those holes and
take<00:02:40.040> them<00:02:40.129> out<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.909> my<00:02:41.000> code<00:02:41.150> needs<00:02:41.329> to<00:02:41.390> be

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
take them out so you my code needs to be

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.670 
take them out so you my code needs to be
very<00:02:41.629> good<00:02:41.840> too<00:02:42.019> when<00:02:42.200> managing<00:02:42.560> these

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
very good too when managing these

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.000 
very good too when managing these
formations<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.530> name<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.859> game<00:02:45.950> here

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
to deal with them and that runs them all

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.280 
to deal with them and that runs them all
right<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.190> here's<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.610> hammer<00:03:58.760> anvil<00:04:03.340> and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
right and here's the hammer anvil and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.720 
right and here's the hammer anvil and
that<00:04:06.290> just<00:04:06.470> wiped<00:04:06.650> out<00:04:06.800> his<00:04:06.860> general<00:04:07.220> like<00:04:07.550> on

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
that just wiped out his general like on

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.820 
that just wiped out his general like on
the<00:04:07.910> first<00:04:08.120> charge

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.130 

so<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.640> really<00:04:12.970> do<00:04:13.120> like<00:04:13.270> long<00:04:13.510> steel<00:04:13.750> cavalry

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
so I really do like long steel cavalry

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.810 
so I really do like long steel cavalry
because<00:04:14.350> they're<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.920> light<00:04:15.160> and<00:04:15.310> they<00:04:15.700> also

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
because they're so light and they also

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.759 
because they're so light and they also
have<00:04:16.000> a<00:04:16.030> really<00:04:16.299> good<00:04:16.420> charge<00:04:16.720> for<00:04:17.530> what<00:04:17.650> they

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
have a really good charge for what they

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.180 
have a really good charge for what they
are<00:04:17.890> because<00:04:18.850> they<00:04:18.970> still<00:04:19.180> have<00:04:19.330> Spears<00:04:19.690> and

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
are because they still have Spears and

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.100 
are because they still have Spears and
they<00:04:21.190> are<00:04:21.340> really<00:04:21.670> useful<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:22.720> my<00:04:22.840> opinion

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
they are really useful in my opinion

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.810 
they are really useful in my opinion
probably<00:04:23.950> some<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.160> best<00:04:24.220> cavalry<00:04:24.550> in<00:04:24.760> the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
probably some of the best cavalry in the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.660 
probably some of the best cavalry in the
game<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.680> course<00:04:26.680> they<00:04:26.860> can't<00:04:27.040> duel<00:04:27.250> with<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
game of course they can't duel with the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.460 
game of course they can't duel with the
