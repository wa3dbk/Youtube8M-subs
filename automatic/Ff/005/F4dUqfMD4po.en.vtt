the<00:00:06.690> structure<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.140> used<00:00:07.410> basic<00:00:07.859> 2x4<00:00:08.550> as<00:00:08.730> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
the structure I used basic 2x4 as the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.580 
the structure I used basic 2x4 as the
length<00:00:09.090> was<00:00:09.389> 8<00:00:09.599> feet<00:00:09.929> from<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.230> hardware

off-the-shelf<00:00:47.520> grommet<00:00:48.030> kicks<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.390> found<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
off-the-shelf grommet kicks I found a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.450 
off-the-shelf grommet kicks I found a
really<00:00:49.080> strong<00:00:49.410> enough<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.309> what<00:00:50.370> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
really strong enough for this so what I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
really strong enough for this so what I
did<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.760> add<00:00:50.940> such<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> fabric<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.080> sew<00:00:52.500> lead<00:00:52.860> on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
did is add such a fabric and sew lead on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040 
did is add such a fabric and sew lead on
my<00:00:53.250> own<00:00:53.400> vomit<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> metal<00:00:54.870> washer

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
my own vomit and see if the metal washer

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
my own vomit and see if the metal washer
that<00:00:55.470> I<00:00:55.530> figured<00:00:55.920> that'd<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.250> stronger<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that I figured that'd be stronger the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.150 
that I figured that'd be stronger the
key<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> any<00:00:57.720> fabric<00:00:58.260> roof<00:00:58.440> structure<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
key to any fabric roof structure is to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
key to any fabric roof structure is to
keep<00:00:59.309> things<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.850> tension<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.540> see<00:01:00.900> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
keep things in tension you can see the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.360 
keep things in tension you can see the
hooks<00:01:01.229> going<00:01:01.530> through<00:01:01.650> the<00:01:01.769> grommet<00:01:02.129> there

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
hooks going through the grommet there

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.219 
hooks going through the grommet there
then<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.150> bungee<00:01:03.449> cord<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.780> down<00:01:03.960> underneath

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
then the bungee cord is down underneath

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.320 
then the bungee cord is down underneath
again<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.949> kept<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.280> constant<00:01:05.580> tension<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
again it's kept in constant tension the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
again it's kept in constant tension the
bungee<00:01:06.659> bugs<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.049> tension<00:01:07.500> thus<00:01:07.830> keeping<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bungee bugs in tension thus keeping the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
bungee bugs in tension thus keeping the
new<00:01:08.520> fabric<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:09.090> tension<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> keeps<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.470> from

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
new fabric in tension it keeps it from

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.190 
new fabric in tension it keeps it from
flapping<00:01:10.860> around<00:01:11.130> too<00:01:11.460> much

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.750 

let's<00:01:21.200> provide<00:01:21.470> some<00:01:21.680> extra<00:01:21.979> reinforcing<00:01:22.640> at

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
let's provide some extra reinforcing at

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.160 
let's provide some extra reinforcing at
the<00:01:22.909> scene<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.630> know<00:01:23.720> if<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.020> out<00:01:24.140> there

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
the scene you know if it's out there

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.020 
the scene you know if it's out there
flapping<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:24.860> wind<00:01:24.950> throw<00:01:25.369> these<00:01:25.549> I<00:01:25.760> added

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
flapping in the wind throw these I added

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.359 
flapping in the wind throw these I added
too<00:01:26.119> much<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.450> patches<00:01:26.960> just<00:01:27.250> double<00:01:28.250> the

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
too much the patches just double the

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.039 
too much the patches just double the
thickness<00:01:28.549> at<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:28.940> seams<00:01:29.270> actually

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
thickness at the seams actually

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.140 
thickness at the seams actually
reinforces<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> fly<00:01:31.040> ball<00:01:33.820> just<00:01:34.820> keep<00:01:35.030> the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
reinforces the fly ball just keep the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.760 
reinforces the fly ball just keep the
root<00:01:35.330> bed<00:01:35.509> just<00:01:35.720> from<00:01:35.840> flapping<00:01:36.080> around<00:01:36.409> I

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
root bed just from flapping around I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.740 
root bed just from flapping around I
sort<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.100> added<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.490> intermediate<00:01:38.210> tie<00:01:38.479> down

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
sort of added the intermediate tie down

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.590 
sort of added the intermediate tie down
it's<00:01:38.960> like<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.380> basic<00:01:39.790> canopy<00:01:40.790> top<00:01:41.030> tie-down

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
it's like a basic canopy top tie-down

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.660 
it's like a basic canopy top tie-down
that<00:01:42.020> goes<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.619> fabric<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.250> then<00:01:43.399> wraps

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
that goes to the fabric and then wraps

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.850 
that goes to the fabric and then wraps
around<00:01:43.850> underneath<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.810> obstruction<00:01:45.530> attack

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
around underneath the obstruction attack

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.649 
around underneath the obstruction attack
is<00:01:46.070> there<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.850> keeps<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.240> thing<00:01:47.450> we're

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
is there just keeps the thing we're

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:48.999 
is there just keeps the thing we're
gonna<00:01:47.750> flapping<00:01:48.290> in<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.409> breeze<00:01:48.500> that's

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
gonna flapping in the breeze that's

00:01:49.009 --> 00:02:03.060 
gonna flapping in the breeze that's
that's<00:01:49.250> really<00:01:49.520> cosmetic

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.889 

okay<00:02:04.070> since<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.399> suck<00:02:04.670> at<00:02:04.820> tying<00:02:05.060> Knox<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.659> bought

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
okay since I suck at tying Knox I bought

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.870 
okay since I suck at tying Knox I bought
tie-downs<00:02:06.500> you<00:02:06.770> might<00:02:06.920> use<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.250> secure<00:02:07.640> load

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
tie-downs you might use the secure load
