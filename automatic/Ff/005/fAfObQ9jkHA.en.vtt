let's<00:00:17.550> identify<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> components<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.650> we

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
let's identify all the components so we

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.429 
let's identify all the components so we
have<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.670> engine<00:00:21.029> oil<00:00:21.119> filter<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.170> an

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
have the engine oil filter which is an

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.189 
have the engine oil filter which is an
orange<00:00:23.100> which<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.400> mentioned<00:00:23.699> there<00:00:24.119> then<00:00:24.900> we

coming inside the engine is shown in

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.290 
coming inside the engine is shown in
blue<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.079> now<00:00:34.500> let's<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:34.920> how<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.850> engine<00:00:36.210> oil

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
blue so now let's see how the engine oil

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.770 
blue so now let's see how the engine oil
filter<00:00:36.780> bypass<00:00:37.170> valve<00:00:37.710> works<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.640> step<00:00:39.210> one

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
filter bypass valve works so step one

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
filter bypass valve works so step one
let's<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.680> engine<00:00:41.040> oil<00:00:41.100> filter<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.640> good

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
let's see the engine oil filter in good

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
let's see the engine oil filter in good
condition<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.690> means<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> engine<00:00:43.350> oil

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
condition that means the engine oil

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.819 
condition that means the engine oil
filter<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:43.950> clean<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.200> chocked

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
filter is clean and it is not in chocked

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
filter is clean and it is not in chocked
condition<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.910> happens<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
condition so what happens is that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.799 
condition so what happens is that
initially<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.980> oil<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.120> coming<00:00:51.480> from

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
initially the oil will be coming from

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.090 
initially the oil will be coming from
the<00:00:52.020> engine<00:00:52.350> oil<00:00:52.440> sump

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the engine oil sump

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.880

with<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> help<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> engine<00:00:54.600> oil<00:00:54.809> pump<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
with the help of the engine oil pump so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.910 
with the help of the engine oil pump so
the<00:00:56.010> engine<00:00:56.370> oil<00:00:56.460> pump<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.809> sucking<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the engine oil pump will be sucking the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
the engine oil pump will be sucking the
oil<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> engine<00:00:59.640> oil<00:00:59.910> sump<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.930> goes

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
oil from the engine oil sump and it goes

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.260 
oil from the engine oil sump and it goes
towards<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.680> engine<00:01:01.949> oil<00:01:02.039> cooler<00:01:02.239> which<00:01:03.239> is

in green and it cools the engine oil and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.050 
in green and it cools the engine oil and
it<00:01:06.630> passes<00:01:06.900> through<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.650> line<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.220> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it passes through this line and it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.719 
it passes through this line and it
enters<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.900> engine<00:01:10.049> oil<00:01:10.500> filter<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
enters the engine oil filter so here you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.609 
enters the engine oil filter so here you
can<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> engine<00:01:12.479> oil<00:01:12.570> filter<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
can see the engine oil filter the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
can see the engine oil filter the
function<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> engine<00:01:14.670> oil<00:01:14.760> filter<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
function of the engine oil filter is to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
function of the engine oil filter is to
purify<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.590> engine<00:01:17.070> oil<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.030> will

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
purify the engine oil because there will

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.260 
purify the engine oil because there will
be<00:01:18.240> some<00:01:18.900> impurities<00:01:19.650> like<00:01:20.340> metal<00:01:20.790> particles

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
be some impurities like metal particles

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.149 
be some impurities like metal particles
etc<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.080> engine<00:01:22.409> oil<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> keeps

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
filter is in chocked condition so here
you<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.970> oil<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.539> towards<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
you can see the oil is going towards the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.430 
you can see the oil is going towards the
engine<00:02:10.950> oil<00:02:11.069> filter<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.050> filtration

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
engine oil filter for the filtration

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
engine oil filter for the filtration
and<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:14.370> happens<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> engine<00:02:15.330> oil

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and what happens in the engine oil

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.990 
and what happens in the engine oil
filter<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.020> choked<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.250> impurities

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
filter is choked because of impurities

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.270 
filter is choked because of impurities
and<00:02:18.210> foreign<00:02:18.540> materials<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.530> when<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> filter

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and foreign materials so when the filter

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.280 
and foreign materials so when the filter
is<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.490> chocked<00:02:20.790> condition<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:22.110> not

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
is in chocked condition it will not

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.830 
is in chocked condition it will not
allow<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.710> oil<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.370> pass<00:02:23.700> towards<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.510> engine

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
allow the oil to pass towards the engine

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.560 
allow the oil to pass towards the engine
oil<00:02:24.930> main<00:02:25.290> gallery<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.160> no<00:02:26.610> oil<00:02:27.000> going<00:02:27.210> towards

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
oil main gallery so no oil going towards

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.060 
oil main gallery so no oil going towards
the<00:02:27.690> engine<00:02:27.810> oil<00:02:28.020> main<00:02:28.320> gallery

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
the engine oil main gallery

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.540 
the engine oil main gallery
this<00:02:29.550> will<00:02:29.790> create<00:02:30.060> oil<00:02:30.450> starvation

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
this will create oil starvation

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.220 
this will create oil starvation
overheating<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:32.730> seizure<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.420> engine<00:02:33.900> that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
overheating and seizure of engine that

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.050 
overheating and seizure of engine that
means<00:02:34.470> serious<00:02:34.770> failure<00:02:35.310> towards<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.790> engine

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
means serious failure towards the engine

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.020 
means serious failure towards the engine
can<00:02:36.240> occur<00:02:36.570> if<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.080> engine<00:02:37.620> oil<00:02:37.710> filter<00:02:38.370> gets

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
can occur if the engine oil filter gets

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.710 
can occur if the engine oil filter gets
choked<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.740> avoid<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.940> give<00:02:42.240> supply

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720

bypass<00:02:50.670> valve<00:02:51.090> comes<00:02:51.600> into<00:02:51.900> play<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.140> here<00:02:52.650> you

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
bypass valve comes into play so here you

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.560 
bypass valve comes into play so here you
can<00:02:52.920> see<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.190> engine<00:02:53.340> oil<00:02:53.520> filter<00:02:53.940> bypass

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
can see the engine oil filter bypass

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.860 
can see the engine oil filter bypass
valve<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.010> what<00:02:56.310> happens<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:56.940> when<00:02:57.720> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
valve so what happens is that when the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
valve so what happens is that when the
engine<00:02:58.320> oil<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.890> through<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.280> gallery

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
engine oil is going through this gallery

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.170 
engine oil is going through this gallery
towards<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> engine<00:03:00.960> oil<00:03:01.110> filter<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.220> when

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
towards the engine oil filter and when

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.790 
towards the engine oil filter and when
it<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.420> chocked<00:03:03.870> condition<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.590> pressure

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
it is chocked condition the pressure

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.400 
it is chocked condition the pressure
increases<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.060> line<00:03:06.270> because<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
increases in this line because of the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.430 
increases in this line because of the
resistance<00:03:07.740> provided<00:03:08.280> by<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.330> filter<00:03:09.780> so

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
resistance provided by the filter so

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500 
resistance provided by the filter so
what<00:03:10.590> happens<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.340> see<00:03:11.520> this<00:03:11.670> line<00:03:11.970> this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
what happens you can see this line this

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.000 
what happens you can see this line this
is<00:03:12.570> connected<00:03:13.020> towards<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> engine<00:03:13.920> oil

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
is connected towards the engine oil

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.030 
is connected towards the engine oil
filter<00:03:14.580> bypass<00:03:15.270> valve<00:03:15.600> or<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.380> safety<00:03:16.650> valve

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
filter bypass valve or the safety valve

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.520 
filter bypass valve or the safety valve
so<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> pressure<00:03:18.030> increases<00:03:18.720> which<00:03:19.320> will

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
so the pressure increases which will

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.860 
so the pressure increases which will
result<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.730> pressure<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.209> act<00:03:21.420> on<00:03:21.690> this

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
result in the pressure to act on this

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.870 
result in the pressure to act on this
valve<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.070> spring-loaded<00:03:23.459> valve

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
valve so this is a spring-loaded valve

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.080 
valve so this is a spring-loaded valve
and<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:25.110> spring-loaded<00:03:25.950> valve<00:03:26.100> moves<00:03:26.640> so

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
and this spring-loaded valve moves so

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.790 
and this spring-loaded valve moves so
here<00:03:27.300> we<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.600> an<00:03:27.720> opening<00:03:28.170> because<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.709> the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
here we have an opening because of the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.230 
here we have an opening because of the
excess<00:03:29.160> pressure<00:03:29.370> creator<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.120> the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
excess pressure creator of the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.500 
excess pressure creator of the
restriction<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.990> this<00:03:31.800> oil<00:03:32.300> passes<00:03:33.300> through

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
restriction and this oil passes through

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.330 
restriction and this oil passes through
words<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.930> line<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.500> this<00:03:34.770> is<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.100> oil

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
words this line so this is the oil

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.540 
words this line so this is the oil
filter<00:03:35.670> bypass<00:03:36.570> line<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.680> through<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:38.280> line

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
filter bypass line so through this line

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.330 
filter bypass line so through this line
it<00:03:38.820> enters<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.690> engine<00:03:40.050> oil<00:03:40.140> main<00:03:40.709> gallery

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it enters the engine oil main gallery

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.729 
it enters the engine oil main gallery
even<00:03:42.000> if<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.330> engine<00:03:42.690> oil<00:03:42.750> filter<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.380> chopped

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
even if the engine oil filter is chopped

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.190 
even if the engine oil filter is chopped
so<00:03:44.489> this<00:03:44.760> means<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.180> oil<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.480> not<00:03:45.660> purified

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
so this means the oil is not purified

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.130 
so this means the oil is not purified
but<00:03:46.770> still<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.459> avoids<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.239> failure<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.870> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
but still it avoids the failure of the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.830 
but still it avoids the failure of the
engine<00:03:49.590> by<00:03:50.040> supplying<00:03:50.520> oil<00:03:50.850> towards<00:03:51.420> engine

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
oil main gallery that means the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.430

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
crankshaft bearings the piston cooling

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.530 
crankshaft bearings the piston cooling
etcetera<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.070> happen<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:56.940> lubrication

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
etcetera can happen and the lubrication

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.479 
etcetera can happen and the lubrication
of<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.660> engine<00:03:57.900> also<00:03:58.080> can<00:03:58.380> happen<00:03:58.590> which<00:03:59.250> can

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
of the engine also can happen which can

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.240 
of the engine also can happen which can
avoid<00:03:59.850> serious<00:04:00.600> failures<00:04:01.290> towards<00:04:02.070> the
