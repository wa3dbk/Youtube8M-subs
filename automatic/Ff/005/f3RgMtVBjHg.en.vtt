avenged

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
avenged

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
avenged
and<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.460> has<00:01:10.490> evolved<00:01:11.490> into<00:01:11.640> something

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and this one has evolved into something

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.460 
and this one has evolved into something
nasty<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.260> leitzel<00:01:14.390> absolutely<00:01:15.390> jumped<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.259> man

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
nasty as leitzel absolutely jumped a man

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.649 
nasty as leitzel absolutely jumped a man
into<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> bench<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.460> would<00:01:17.759> say<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> initial

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
into the bench I would say the initial

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
into the bench I would say the initial
hit<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:19.020> clean<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.590> after<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
hit was clean but after that the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.429 
hit was clean but after that the
subsequent<00:01:21.030> jumping<00:01:21.689> into<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> mix<00:01:22.200> was

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
subsequent jumping into the mix was

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.320 
subsequent jumping into the mix was
somewhat<00:01:22.830> unnecessarily<00:01:23.670> worse<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> little

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
somewhat unnecessarily worse a little

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
somewhat unnecessarily worse a little
hard<00:01:24.540> after<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> fact<00:01:25.350> now<00:01:25.650> how<00:01:25.860> does<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.130> bit

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
hard after the fact now how does a bit

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
hard after the fact now how does a bit
problematic<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.150> Oh

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
problematic but Oh

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.200 
problematic but Oh

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
absolutely a great thaw out there I was

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
absolutely a great thaw out there I was
feeling<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.540> good<00:01:33.750> since<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> Ohio<00:01:34.500> game

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

feeling this good since the Ohio game

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
yeah and Wilson definitely had the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.380 
yeah and Wilson definitely had the
height<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> weight<00:01:39.720> advantage<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.409> Russo<00:01:41.009> but

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
height and weight advantage on Russo but

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.249 
height and weight advantage on Russo but
Russo<00:01:42.390> hung<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.140> bit

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
Russo hung in there a little bit

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.249 
Russo hung in there a little bit
good<00:01:46.259> good<00:01:46.799> fights<00:01:47.130> for<00:01:47.939> Scully<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> Russo

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
good good fights for Scully and Russo

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.030 
good good fights for Scully and Russo
and<00:01:49.820> unless<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> refs<00:01:51.500> take<00:01:52.500> control<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.860> this

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and unless the refs take control of this

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.499 
and unless the refs take control of this
one<00:01:53.250> pretty<00:01:53.460> quickly<00:01:53.729> which<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.149> doubt<00:01:54.360> they're

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
one pretty quickly which I doubt they're

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.910 
one pretty quickly which I doubt they're
going<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.780> able<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> don't<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.770> this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
going to be able to I don't think this

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.490 
going to be able to I don't think this
is<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> end<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.759> would<00:01:57.479> say<00:01:57.719> luckily<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.320> least

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
is the end I would say luckily at least

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
is the end I would say luckily at least
there's<00:01:58.710> only<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> minute's<00:01:59.280> money<00:01:59.490> left<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> go

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
there's only a minute's money left to go

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.219 
there's only a minute's money left to go
so<00:02:00.170> we<00:02:01.170> will<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:02.420> hopefully<00:02:03.420> calmer<00:02:04.020> heads

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
so we will see hopefully calmer heads

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.170 
so we will see hopefully calmer heads
here<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> third<00:02:05.009> period<00:02:05.040> as<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.030> looks

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
here in the third period as it looks

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.459 
here in the third period as it looks
like<00:02:06.299> Buffalo's<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.049> power<00:02:07.229> play

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like Buffalo's going on the power play

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.320 
like Buffalo's going on the power play
here<00:02:07.940> light<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.149> we'll<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.479> taking<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.989> pen

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
here light so we'll be taking a pen

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.580 
here light so we'll be taking a pen
not<00:02:10.540> sure<00:02:10.720> for<00:02:10.840> what<00:02:10.990> we<00:02:11.080> need<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:11.380> get<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
not sure for what we need we get the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.420 
not sure for what we need we get the
last<00:02:11.800> penalties<00:02:12.370> yet<00:02:12.610> before<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.180> happened

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
last penalties yet before that happened

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.800 
last penalties yet before that happened
unbelievable<00:02:15.430> turn<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.640> events<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.300> knew

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
unbelievable turn of events here I knew

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.480 
unbelievable turn of events here I knew
the<00:02:16.990> first<00:02:17.260> period<00:02:17.560> with<00:02:17.740> no<00:02:17.770> penalties<00:02:18.310> was

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
the first period with no penalties was

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.030 
the first period with no penalties was
too<00:02:18.700> good<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.210> true<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:20.500> probably<00:02:20.740> should

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
too good to be true we probably should

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.890 
too good to be true we probably should
have<00:02:21.070> left<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.400> untalked<00:02:22.030> about<00:02:22.210> some

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
have left that untalked about some

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.630 
have left that untalked about some
things<00:02:23.140> are<00:02:23.260> better<00:02:23.410> left<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.890> set<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.490> gonna

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
things are better left on set I'm gonna

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.610 
things are better left on set I'm gonna
call<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.060> rough<00:02:25.300> on<00:02:25.540> lysyl<00:02:26.050> until<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.410> hear

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
call it a rough on lysyl until I hear

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.680 
call it a rough on lysyl until I hear
anything<00:02:26.800> else<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.460> now<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:28.450> know<00:02:28.540> with

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
anything else and now you know with

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.710 
anything else and now you know with
retribution<00:02:29.050> being<00:02:29.680> served<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.310> suppose<00:02:30.820> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
retribution being served I suppose the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.210 
retribution being served I suppose the
Lakers<00:02:32.050> need<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.260> worry<00:02:32.440> about<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:32.920> lead

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
Lakers need to worry about this lead

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.700 
Lakers need to worry about this lead
here<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.610> mean<00:02:33.880> four<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> two<00:02:34.960> ultimately<00:02:35.500> the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
here I mean four to two ultimately the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.350 
here I mean four to two ultimately the
scoreboard<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.340> where<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.640> can<00:02:36.760> hurt<00:02:37.210> your

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
scoreboard is where you can hurt your

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.510 
scoreboard is where you can hurt your
opponent<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.870> most<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.410> right<00:02:39.070> now<00:02:39.280> if<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
opponent the most and right now if the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.980 
opponent the most and right now if the
Lakers<00:02:39.700> give<00:02:40.000> up<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.270> two<00:02:40.450> goal<00:02:40.630> lead<00:02:40.660> and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
Lakers give up this two goal lead and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.390 
Lakers give up this two goal lead and
make<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.200> only<00:02:41.320> one<00:02:41.620> going<00:02:41.860> into<00:02:42.070> the<00:02:42.160> third

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
make it only one going into the third

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
automatically and it looks ok all he

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.810

that slow ball again and I think that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.240 
that slow ball again and I think that
only<00:03:00.459> works<00:03:00.700> once<00:03:01.290> far<00:03:02.290> side<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.920> goes<00:03:03.100> ahead
