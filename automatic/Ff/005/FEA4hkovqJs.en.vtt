doing<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.969> know<00:01:45.060> architectural<00:01:45.780> projection

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
doing you know architectural projection

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.889 
doing you know architectural projection
or<00:01:46.320> environmental<00:01:46.799> projection<00:01:47.569> that's<00:01:48.569> great

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
or environmental projection that's great

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.340 
or environmental projection that's great
but<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.350> are<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.499> doing<00:01:50.069> on<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> stage

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
but then what are you doing on the stage

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.779 
but then what are you doing on the stage
LED<00:01:52.350> lighting<00:01:52.710> has<00:01:52.799> gotten<00:01:53.100> less<00:01:53.280> expensive

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
LED lighting has gotten less expensive

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.730 
LED lighting has gotten less expensive
but<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.030> actually<00:01:54.179> use<00:01:54.539> video<00:01:55.140> elements<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
but to actually use video elements on

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.069 
but to actually use video elements on
the<00:01:55.859> stage<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.909> still<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.509> little<00:01:57.600> bit<00:01:57.780> tricky

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the stage is still a little bit tricky

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.289 
the stage is still a little bit tricky
it's<00:01:58.530> great<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.859> costco<00:01:59.219> sells<00:01:59.460> these<00:01:59.670> 42

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
it's great the costco sells these 42

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.340 
it's great the costco sells these 42
inch<00:02:00.450> plasma<00:02:00.659> TVs<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.679> LCD<00:02:02.100> tvs<00:02:02.759> for<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:04.259> know

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
three or four hundred dollars now what

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.489 
three or four hundred dollars now what
used<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.060> cost<00:02:06.119> three<00:02:06.479> thousand<00:02:06.869> dollars<00:02:07.079> but

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
used to cost three thousand dollars but

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.469 
used to cost three thousand dollars but
how<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:07.859> creatively<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.610> them<00:02:08.910> beyond

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
how can you creatively use them beyond

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.720 
how can you creatively use them beyond
just<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.319> having<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.890> couple<00:02:11.130> TVs<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
just you know having a couple TVs on the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.160 
just you know having a couple TVs on the
stage<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:12.659> pro<00:02:12.780> video<00:02:12.900> player

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
stage so that's what pro video player

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.259 
stage so that's what pro video player
two<00:02:13.409> is<00:02:13.440> all<00:02:13.650> about<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:14.040> giving<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:15.000> lot<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.209> the

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
two is all about is giving a lot of the

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.490 
two is all about is giving a lot of the
power<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.780> hadn't<00:02:15.989> pro<00:02:16.080> video<00:02:16.200> player

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
power that we hadn't pro video player

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.420 
power that we hadn't pro video player
one

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
one

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.979 
one
get<00:02:17.549> up<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.909> notch<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.269> then<00:02:18.420> making<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.750> really

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
get up a notch and then making it really

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.920 
get up a notch and then making it really
really<00:02:19.260> easy<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.739> do<00:02:19.859> so<00:02:20.040> okay<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.390> what<00:02:21.659> K

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
really easy to do so okay so so what K

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.119 
really easy to do so okay so so what K
what<00:02:22.109> can<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.319> kind<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.590> show<00:02:22.739> us<00:02:22.859> as<00:02:23.010> an

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
what can you kind of show us as an

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.610 
what can you kind of show us as an
overview<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.870> big<00:02:25.019> thing<00:02:25.049> is<00:02:25.260> that

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
overview of it so the big thing is that

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.819 
overview of it so the big thing is that
we<00:02:25.709> allow<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.280> map<00:02:26.519> video<00:02:27.510> content<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
we allow you to map video content to

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.059 
we allow you to map video content to
displays<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.510> real<00:02:30.719> time<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.859> create

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
displays in in real time and to create

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.559 
displays in in real time and to create
what's<00:02:32.310> called<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.609> pixel<00:02:32.909> space<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.390> way

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
what's called a pixel space and the way

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.670 
what's called a pixel space and the way
that<00:02:33.719> I<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.989> think<00:02:34.079> about<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> pixel

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
that I like to think about a pixel

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.280 
that I like to think about a pixel
spaces<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.310> pixel<00:02:35.879> space<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.359> saying<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.810> want<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
spaces a pixel space is saying I want to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.379 
spaces a pixel space is saying I want to
fill<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.799> stage<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.280> video<00:02:38.639> but<00:02:39.269> my

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
fill the stage with video but my

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.970 
fill the stage with video but my
displays<00:02:39.840> themselves<00:02:40.409> are<00:02:40.500> actually<00:02:40.829> just

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
displays themselves are actually just

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.629 
displays themselves are actually just
going<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.189> be<00:02:41.310> windows<00:02:41.819> into<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.420> video<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
going to be windows into that video so

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.369 
going to be windows into that video so
that<00:02:44.639> what<00:02:44.819> we're<00:02:44.909> actually<00:02:45.060> showing<00:02:45.389> here

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
that what we're actually showing here

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.729 
that what we're actually showing here
I've<00:02:46.709> configured<00:02:47.189> this<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> I'm<00:02:49.349> using<00:02:49.530> our

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
I've configured this and I'm using our

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.229 
I've configured this and I'm using our
old<00:02:49.919> friend<00:02:50.189> the<00:02:50.220> matrix<00:02:50.609> triple<00:02:50.939> had<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> go

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
old friend the matrix triple had to go

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.970 
old friend the matrix triple had to go
so<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.510> actually<00:02:51.659> have<00:02:51.930> three<00:02:52.139> video<00:02:52.470> outputs

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
so I actually have three video outputs

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.629 
so I actually have three video outputs
out<00:02:53.159> of<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.370> single<00:02:54.060> iMac<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.489> I'm<00:02:56.489> not

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
out of this single iMac and I'm not

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.039 
out of this single iMac and I'm not
beholding<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.120> using<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.629> triple<00:02:57.870> had<00:02:57.989> to

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
beholding that using the triple had to

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.720 
beholding that using the triple had to
go<00:02:58.169> by<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.349> way<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.709> now<00:02:58.889> act<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.280> ability<00:02:59.609> to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
go by the way we now act the ability to

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.580 
go by the way we now act the ability to
output<00:03:00.060> video<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.419> as<00:03:00.689> many<00:03:00.810> graphics<00:03:01.290> outputs

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
output video to as many graphics outputs

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.709 
output video to as many graphics outputs
as<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.889> have<00:03:02.069> in<00:03:02.310> your<00:03:02.459> machine<00:03:02.609> so<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.150> new

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
as you have in your machine so this new

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.809 
as you have in your machine so this new
cylinder<00:03:04.500> Mac<00:03:04.769> Pro<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.189> has<00:03:05.340> six<00:03:05.579> video

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
cylinder Mac Pro that has six video

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.479 
cylinder Mac Pro that has six video
outputs<00:03:06.150> we<00:03:06.269> could<00:03:06.419> output<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> all<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.260> them

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
outputs we could output to all of them

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.000 
outputs we could output to all of them
so<00:03:08.489> we<00:03:08.579> have<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.879> ability<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.319> output<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.980> a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
so we have the ability to output to a

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.649 
so we have the ability to output to a
triple<00:03:11.310> had<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.489> go<00:03:11.609> in<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.879> in<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.419> case

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
triple had to go in this in this case

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.629 
triple had to go in this in this case
and<00:03:12.930> I've<00:03:13.230> taken<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.590> three<00:03:14.069> outputs<00:03:14.519> at

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
and I've taken the three outputs at

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.129 
and I've taken the three outputs at
triple<00:03:15.030> had<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.239> go<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.540> can<00:03:15.569> treat<00:03:15.959> them<00:03:16.109> as

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
triple had to go and I can treat them as

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.979 
triple had to go and I can treat them as
three<00:03:16.769> separate<00:03:17.129> displays<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.750> way<00:03:18.840> that

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
three separate displays so the way that

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.289 
three separate displays so the way that
I<00:03:19.049> haven't<00:03:19.200> them<00:03:19.349> configured<00:03:19.769> here<00:03:20.129> is<00:03:20.819> I've

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
I haven't them configured here is I've

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.990 
I haven't them configured here is I've
laid<00:03:21.479> them<00:03:21.629> out<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.290> they're<00:03:23.000> rotated

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
laid them out in this they're rotated

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.800 
laid them out in this they're rotated
about<00:03:24.090> 45<00:03:24.599> degrees<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:25.199> I'm<00:03:26.159> I've<00:03:27.150> just<00:03:27.209> laid

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
about 45 degrees and I'm I've just laid

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.149 
about 45 degrees and I'm I've just laid
them<00:03:27.989> out<00:03:28.079> side<00:03:28.440> by<00:03:28.470> side<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.949> create

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
them out side by side to create

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.719 
them out side by side to create
something<00:03:29.310> that's<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.519> little<00:03:29.609> more

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
something that's a little more

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.699 
something that's a little more
interesting<00:03:30.030> than<00:03:30.299> looking<00:03:30.569> at<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.989> 16<00:03:31.560> by

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
interesting than looking at just a 16 by

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.000 
interesting than looking at just a 16 by
9<00:03:31.889> image<00:03:32.129> and<00:03:32.489> then<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.269> target<00:03:33.680> my<00:03:34.680> video

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
9 image and then I can target my video

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.670 
9 image and then I can target my video
layer<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:36.060> display<00:03:36.540> over<00:03:36.870> all<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.199> them<00:03:37.349> so

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
layer to display over all of them so

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.189 
layer to display over all of them so
here<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.459> my<00:03:38.609> three<00:03:39.269> displays<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.139> I've

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
here I have my three displays and I've

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.659 
here I have my three displays and I've
said<00:03:40.379> I<00:03:40.409> don't<00:03:40.620> want<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.889> I<00:03:40.919> want<00:03:41.069> to<00:03:41.280> throw<00:03:41.639> a

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
said I don't want to I want to throw a

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.550 
said I don't want to I want to throw a
video<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.060> spans<00:03:42.510> across<00:03:42.689> all<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.139> them<00:03:43.379> and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
video that spans across all of them and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.319 
video that spans across all of them and
then<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:43.979> result<00:03:44.310> of<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.760> what<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.180> see

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
then that result of that is what you see

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.689 
then that result of that is what you see
behind<00:03:45.479> you<00:03:45.750> here<00:03:45.959> van<00:03:46.430> we<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.549> this

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
behind you here van we have this

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:51.679 
behind you here van we have this
aquarium<00:03:48.060> video<00:03:48.509> and<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:50.519> can<00:03:51.150> see<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.509> fish

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
aquarium video and you can see the fish

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.569 
aquarium video and you can see the fish
is<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.019> that<00:03:52.500> leaves<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:52.979> screen<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.430> goes

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
is that that leaves one screen it goes

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.780 
is that that leaves one screen it goes
right<00:03:53.819> over<00:03:53.879> the<00:03:54.090> other<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:55.560> very<00:03:56.310> effective

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
right over the other so very effective

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.530 
right over the other so very effective
very<00:03:57.299> simple<00:03:57.689> to<00:03:57.810> do<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.109> as<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.530> move<00:03:58.859> my<00:03:59.540> video

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
very simple to do and as I move my video

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.740 
very simple to do and as I move my video
target<00:04:01.019> around<00:04:01.319> it's<00:04:01.979> moving<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.579> around

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
target around it's moving it around

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.809 
target around it's moving it around
across<00:04:03.750> all<00:04:04.019> these<00:04:04.290> screens<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.099> if<00:04:05.519> i<00:04:05.579> wanted

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
across all these screens and if i wanted

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.999 
across all these screens and if i wanted
to<00:04:05.879> do<00:04:06.090> five<00:04:06.659> screens<00:04:07.019> six<00:04:07.409> screens<00:04:07.620> seven

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.009 
to do five screens six screens seven

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.469 
to do five screens six screens seven
screens<00:04:08.220> as<00:04:08.549> long<00:04:08.819> as<00:04:08.939> I<00:04:09.000> have<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.269> video

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
screens as long as I have the video

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.300 
screens as long as I have the video
outputs<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.139> do<00:04:10.259> it<00:04:10.409> whether<00:04:10.739> it's<00:04:10.919> out<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.069> one

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
outputs to do it whether it's out of one

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.520 
outputs to do it whether it's out of one
machine<00:04:11.609> or<00:04:11.819> multiple<00:04:12.329> network<00:04:12.629> machines<00:04:13.019> we

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
machine or multiple network machines we

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.069 
machine or multiple network machines we
can<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.949> very<00:04:13.979> very<00:04:14.220> easily<00:04:14.750> if<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.900> want

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
can do that very very easily if I want

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.099 
can do that very very easily if I want
to<00:04:16.400> move<00:04:17.400> my<00:04:17.609> display<00:04:18.239> around<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:18.810> say<00:04:18.959> oh<00:04:18.989> you

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
to move my display around so say oh you

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.080 
to move my display around so say oh you
know<00:04:19.229> what<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.739> make<00:04:20.039> up<00:04:20.340> for<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.579> bezels<00:04:20.909> they

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
know what to make up for the bezels they

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.009 
know what to make up for the bezels they
don't<00:04:21.269> they<00:04:21.389> need<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.599> be<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> little<00:04:21.870> bit

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
don't they need to be a little bit

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.450 
don't they need to be a little bit
closer<00:04:22.229> together<00:04:22.500> or<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.949> little<00:04:23.159> bit<00:04:23.280> further

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
closer together or a little bit further

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.820 
closer together or a little bit further
apart<00:04:23.789> again<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.599> display<00:04:25.110> just<00:04:25.380> becomes<00:04:25.650> a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
apart again the display just becomes a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.550 
apart again the display just becomes a
window<00:04:26.250> into<00:04:26.580> my<00:04:27.060> video<00:04:27.300> content<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.440> it's

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
window into my video content so it's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.580 
window into my video content so it's
very<00:04:28.680> easy<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.130> map<00:04:29.370> content<00:04:29.849> that<00:04:30.060> way

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
very easy to map content that way

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.110 
very easy to map content that way
a<00:04:30.680> lot<00:04:30.980> of<00:04:31.010> other<00:04:31.190> things<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.640> lot<00:04:31.880> of<00:04:32.000> other

a lot of other things a lot of other

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.000 
a lot of other things a lot of other
features<00:04:32.480> that<00:04:32.510> are<00:04:32.780> in<00:04:32.900> their<00:04:33.110> different

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
features that are in their different
