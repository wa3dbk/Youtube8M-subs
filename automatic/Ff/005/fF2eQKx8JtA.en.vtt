00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
run through some of the new features in

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.550 
run through some of the new features in
cinematic<00:00:15.190> strings<00:00:15.580> -<00:00:16.409> what<00:00:17.409> you've<00:00:17.529> just

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.409 
cinematic strings - what you've just
heard<00:00:17.769> was<00:00:18.159> the<00:00:18.339> first<00:00:18.579> violins<00:00:19.089> playing

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
heard was the first violins playing

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.319 
heard was the first violins playing
legato<00:00:19.630> and<00:00:20.400> our<00:00:21.400> new<00:00:21.550> legato<00:00:21.880> system

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
legato and our new legato system

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.689 
legato and our new legato system
features<00:00:22.779> sample<00:00:23.439> legato<00:00:23.739> transitions<00:00:24.460> and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
features sample legato transitions and

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.450 
features sample legato transitions and
is<00:00:25.239> powered<00:00:25.659> by<00:00:25.689> advanced<00:00:26.199> scripting<00:00:26.829> which

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
is powered by advanced scripting which

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.309 
is powered by advanced scripting which
adjusts<00:00:28.029> the<00:00:28.119> envelope<00:00:28.479> while<00:00:28.689> you<00:00:28.839> play

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:29.319 
adjusts the envelope while you play

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.950 
adjusts the envelope while you play
this<00:00:30.159> makes<00:00:30.429> sequencing<00:00:30.970> legato<00:00:31.269> easier<00:00:31.839> than

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.870 

we've<00:01:25.590> also<00:01:25.740> made<00:01:25.920> key<00:01:26.310> switching<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.729> lot

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
we've also made key switching a lot

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.539 
we've also made key switching a lot
simpler<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.710> assign<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> key<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> any<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the great features of cinematic strings

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
the great features of cinematic strings
is<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> selection<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.020> playing<00:01:58.289> position<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
is the selection of playing position and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.279 
is the selection of playing position and
this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.759> achieved<00:02:00.209> either<00:02:00.450> by<00:02:00.600> holding<00:02:01.080> alt
