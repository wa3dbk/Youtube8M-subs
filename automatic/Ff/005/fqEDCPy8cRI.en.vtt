00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.180
 hi to all this evening let's see how the tomtom app navigator works 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.999
 version 7 top view of nunno handheld device 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.759
 toshiba g900 portègè black edition 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.750
 the software has already been installed on the external memory 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.999
 to eat it 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.960
 just start the program directly from the program menu 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.949
 we can already see the screen 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.670
 application that 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 the covers the entire screen to drink it 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 of our handheld device 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.310
 let's go out our nib to try some stability with some features 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.500
 this software 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.780
 the main screen in this case where it has already been done 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.699
 previously a pairing with a bluetooth GPS device 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.490
 shows us the route in the street 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.710
 fixed in my case as a starting point by clicking on a part 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.950
 any of the screen we can see on the sea at main 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.570
 the navigation menus of this software 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.770
 the screen is quite simple and intuitive tallava else the keys are well 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.020
 spaced so that they can 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.350
 el click directly on the re tab tecinca rezza 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.400
 or openly return to the main screen again 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.570
 courier we come to know quite stable ector works excellently 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.190
 also in the mode 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.690
 horizontal of our software 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.430
 let's go to the remscheid inversion screen 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.590
 we have practically no application at all 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.390
 -.- 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.520
 parts of the screen that are mum obscured by the application 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.670
 in addition, the sound is also perfect 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.009
 in the language comes 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.220
 automatically recognized based on our settings 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:18.789
 for today it is all this is the first application seen on the beautiful place 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.430
 toshiba smartphone, goodbye action 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.530
