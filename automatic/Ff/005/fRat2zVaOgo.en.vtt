measurements again my bus was the same

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.289 
measurements again my bus was the same
my<00:01:48.960> waist<00:01:49.259> originally<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:52.369> 37<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.880> went<00:01:54.149> down

my waist originally was 37 it went down

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.800 
my waist originally was 37 it went down
to<00:01:54.509> 35<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.530> an<00:01:55.649> inch<00:01:55.829> lost<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:57.420> arms

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to 35 so it's an inch lost there my arms

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.490 
to 35 so it's an inch lost there my arms
were<00:01:57.990> originally<00:01:58.469> 12<00:01:58.829> inches<00:01:59.310> and

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
were originally 12 inches and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.740 
were originally 12 inches and
they're<00:02:00.890> each<00:02:01.070> 11<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:02.080> my<00:02:03.080> five<00:02:03.790> were<00:02:04.790> 23<00:02:05.720> and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
they're each 11 and my five were 23 and

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.800 
they're each 11 and my five were 23 and
a<00:02:05.840> half<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:06.440> now<00:02:07.250> they're<00:02:07.550> 22<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.600> is<00:02:08.780> a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
a half and now they're 22 so that is a

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.410 
a half and now they're 22 so that is a
total<00:02:09.320> of<00:02:09.380> four<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.680> a<00:02:09.800> half<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:11.090> block

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
total of four and a half and just block

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.590 
total of four and a half and just block
that<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.410> really<00:02:12.950> great<00:02:13.130> as<00:02:13.370> well<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:14.570> I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
that is really great as well so I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.850 
that is really great as well so I
couldn't<00:02:14.990> be<00:02:15.170> happier<00:02:15.560> with<00:02:15.740> my<00:02:15.770> results<00:02:16.490> I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
couldn't be happier with my results I

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.110 
couldn't be happier with my results I
mean<00:02:18.860> what<00:02:19.040> more<00:02:19.220> can<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.430> ask<00:02:19.550> for<00:02:19.760> that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
mean what more can you ask for that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.070
