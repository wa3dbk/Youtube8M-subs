00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
coming through the sort of final stages

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.980 
coming through the sort of final stages
I'm<00:04:29.979> just<00:04:30.190> looking<00:04:30.430> at<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.990> insulating

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
I'm just looking at the insulating

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.810 
I'm just looking at the insulating
plastic<00:04:32.080> mold<00:04:32.500> this<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.010> what<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.340> going<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.669> go

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
plastic mold this is what is going to go

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.060 
plastic mold this is what is going to go
on<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:35.050> wall<00:04:35.260> over<00:04:35.830> there<00:04:35.950> once<00:04:36.729> that<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.540> dry

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
on the wall over there once that is dry

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.980 
on the wall over there once that is dry
you're<00:04:39.070> going<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.220> use<00:04:39.400> pasta<00:04:39.700> put<00:04:40.660> some<00:04:40.780> bags

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
you're going to use pasta put some bags

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.070 
you're going to use pasta put some bags
on<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.200> wall<00:04:41.700> then<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:43.000> insulated<00:04:43.780> plaster

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
on the wall then the insulated plaster

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.300 
on the wall then the insulated plaster
board<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.350> going<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.530> be<00:04:44.650> fitted<00:04:44.950> to<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.160> wall

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
board is going to be fitted to the wall

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.680 
board is going to be fitted to the wall
and<00:04:45.520> then<00:04:45.639> that's<00:04:45.850> going<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.180> skinned<00:04:46.510> as

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
and then that's going to be skinned as

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.870 
and then that's going to be skinned as
well<00:04:46.930> so<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:48.100> can<00:04:48.280> see<00:04:48.490> it's<00:04:48.639> going<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.820> be

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
well so you can see it's going to be

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.590 
well so you can see it's going to be
completely<00:04:49.300> sealed<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.310> also<00:04:51.479> really<00:04:52.479> isn't

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
completely sealed and also really isn't

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.560 
completely sealed and also really isn't
it<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.140> is<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.880> what<00:04:54.880> is<00:04:54.970> this<00:04:55.120> possibly

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
it so this is the what is this possibly

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.110 
it so this is the what is this possibly
putting<00:04:55.930> on<00:04:56.020> lime<00:04:56.680> I've<00:04:56.950> been<00:04:57.190> making<00:04:57.430> plastic

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.770 
putting on lime I've been making plastic
right<00:04:58.510> from<00:04:58.870> what's<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.229> advantage<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.770> that

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
right from what's the advantage of that

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.430 
right from what's the advantage of that
this<00:05:01.780> is<00:05:01.900> fat<00:05:02.140> just<00:05:02.289> pasta<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:03.539> combat<00:05:04.539> with

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
this is fat just pasta to combat with

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.860 
this is fat just pasta to combat with
the<00:05:05.470> salt<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.220> rising<00:05:06.729> up<00:05:07.090> all<00:05:07.630> right

cold from the outside to the inside but
the<00:06:12.510> insulation<00:06:13.020> board<00:06:13.230> will<00:06:13.440> start<00:06:13.710> that

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
the insulation board will start that

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:30.260
