00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 panorama 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:13.059
 workers from other countries contribute about 6% to the 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.610
 creation of the Italian gross domestic product 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.580
 in recent years they have made up for the lack of labor in some 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.789
 specific production sectors 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.910
 immigration is also a resource because it allows you to get in touch 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.750
 directed with carriers of different culture by introducing an element of dynamism 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.970
 in the fabric of Italian society 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.210
 but that at the same time immigration poses problems that do not go well 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.420
 underestimated m - exasperated and of which it is necessary to be aware in order 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.059
 to identify realistically adequate strategies to address them 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.710
 reflections on the future of the debate on the convenience of the phenomenon 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.050
 migration must take into account the capacity to absorb the flows e 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.840
 therefore of the question of the capacity of reception of immigrants by a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.270
 determined territorial context the social book tickets some problems 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.950
 require further investigation is a broader public debate yes 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.980
 think of the question of border control in contrast 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.810
 of irregularity and crime 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.990
 and then it is known that the underground economy continues to exert a very strong 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.010
 new attractiveness of irregular immigration recalled 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.620
 from the belief that in Italy it is possible to enter and work even if 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.860
 you do not have a residence permit that enables you to work what the data 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.950
 available clearly demonstrate why the programming system is 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.190
 flow regulation does not meet the real operating needs of the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.860
 Italian labor market 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.510
 in fact, the various regulatory systems have not yet come out to affect 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.600
 significantly on irregular presence 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.730
 lamination is definitely a positive contribution to cheat force for branches 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.310
 job captain attentive to the system 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.899
 and that therefore from an important contribution to a reality like the Italian one 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.680
 kenya we know very much much needed 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.799
 of course, however, all its limits in the sense that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.720
 the positive element, however, risks being canceled when growth is 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.600
 so substantial and in all things what is happening is more or less 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.509
 similar 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:20.079
 because in some way I accelerate too much development and therefore can create 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.259
 problems they replace before problems they should solve 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.259
 we should find a way to define a harmonic development 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.419
 schedule flows that you can sell somehow respected 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.409
 and make sure that the message of some regulation is tired 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.579
 of outside because these years we have seen 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.749
 that in fact 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.590
 it didn't work I think eating a nice result would be extreme 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.019
 clarity on what the rules of the game are 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.779
 and above all to inform the outside because these are the rules and yes 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.560
 intends to keep this 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.510
 the real problem is to define a behavior then make the exception of the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.010
 pure cost. makes it all possible that we have seen that in this way the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.060
 call actually ceased does not come out then more control alfano 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.159
 no
