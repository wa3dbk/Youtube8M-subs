it<00:02:34.860> looks<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.370> unfortunately<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.510> palette

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
it looks like unfortunately this palette

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
I barely even touched it I think I only

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.630

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
purchasing it i think mainly because i

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
eyeshadows I have in my collection and

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.350 
eyeshadows I have in my collection and
I<00:04:12.420> absolutely<00:04:13.110> love<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.220> then<00:04:14.700> for<00:04:15.060> my

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
I absolutely love this and then for my

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.630 
I absolutely love this and then for my
desert<00:04:15.870> island<00:04:15.990> palette<00:04:16.829> this<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.280> how<00:04:17.430> I'm

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
desert island palette this is how I'm

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.580 
desert island palette this is how I'm
taking<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.209> i'm<00:04:18.359> assuming<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.440> can

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
taking it i'm assuming that you can

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.650 
taking it i'm assuming that you can
break<00:04:19.829> this<00:04:19.950> down<00:04:20.160> into<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.579> mother<00:04:21.180> palette

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
break this down into a mother palette

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.810 
break this down into a mother palette
but<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:22.140> my<00:04:22.230> desert<00:04:22.590> island<00:04:22.740> palette<00:04:23.310> it

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
but for my desert island palette it

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.400 
but for my desert island palette it
would<00:04:23.970> have<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.180> go<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.780> aqua<00:04:25.140> lilies

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.280 
would have to go to the aqua lilies
