00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
like a light error and check check and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.120 
like a light error and check check and
error<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.759> she'd<00:01:19.719> get<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:19.929> like<00:01:20.079> this<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.499> I

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
error and she'd get it like this and I

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.090 
error and she'd get it like this and I
just<00:01:21.310> got<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.439> just<00:01:23.679> happens

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
just got that now that just happens

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.230 
just got that now that just happens
we're<00:01:24.219> out<00:01:24.340> say<00:01:24.549> around<00:01:24.700> seventy-five

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
we're out say around seventy-five

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.149 
we're out say around seventy-five
percent<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.659> time<00:01:25.810> another<00:01:26.679> twenty<00:01:27.009> five

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
percent of time another twenty five

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.609 
percent of time another twenty five
percent<00:01:27.189> you<00:01:27.639> end<00:01:27.850> up<00:01:27.939> bailing<00:01:28.259> which<00:01:29.259> is<00:01:29.469> I

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
percent you end up bailing which is I

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.169 
percent you end up bailing which is I
mean<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.889> sucks<00:01:30.100> but<00:01:30.310> I<00:01:30.429> mean<00:01:30.609> you<00:01:30.639> can<00:01:30.850> create

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
mean it sucks but I mean you can create

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.120 
mean it sucks but I mean you can create
a<00:01:31.209> really<00:01:32.079> cool<00:01:32.229> parks<00:01:32.590> where<00:01:32.799> it<00:01:32.920> could<00:01:33.039> just

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
a really cool parks where it could just

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.620 
a really cool parks where it could just
be<00:01:33.219> on<00:01:33.429> one<00:01:33.639> level<00:01:33.850> like<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.359> basement

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
be on one level like a basement

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.330 
be on one level like a basement
skatepark<00:01:35.289> then<00:01:35.469> you<00:01:35.590> can<00:01:35.709> go<00:01:35.829> all<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.009> way<00:01:36.130> up

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
skatepark then you can go all the way up

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.410 
skatepark then you can go all the way up
and<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.579> could<00:01:36.700> be<00:01:36.729> like<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.060> street<00:01:37.299> or

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
and it could be like the street or

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.359 
and it could be like the street or
something<00:01:37.719> like<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:37.869> as<00:01:38.709> she<00:01:39.009> right<00:01:39.130> there<00:01:39.159> I

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
something like that as she right there I

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.660 
something like that as she right there I
bailed<00:01:39.909> which<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.539> happens<00:01:41.259> I<00:01:41.619> mean<00:01:41.950> what

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
bailed which it happens I mean what

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.510 
bailed which it happens I mean what
you're<00:01:42.789> gonna<00:01:42.880> do<00:01:43.179> it's<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.749> mean<00:01:44.319> it's<00:01:44.520> an

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
you're gonna do it's I mean it's an

you're gonna do it's I mean it's an
elevator<00:01:45.969> it's<00:01:46.959> an<00:01:47.079> imaginary<00:01:47.619> elevator

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
elevator it's an imaginary elevator

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.980 
elevator it's an imaginary elevator
because<00:01:48.429> skate<00:01:49.329> through<00:01:49.509> like<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.779> imagine

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
because skate through like to imagine

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.069 
because skate through like to imagine
things<00:01:50.380> because<00:01:51.179> half<00:01:52.179> the<00:01:52.209> time<00:01:52.359> they<00:01:52.779> could

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
things because half the time they could

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.839 
things because half the time they could
I<00:01:53.109> had<00:01:53.259> way<00:01:53.439> more<00:01:53.469> better<00:01:53.889> stuff<00:01:54.249> in<00:01:54.459> this<00:01:54.609> game

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
I had way more better stuff in this game

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.539 
I had way more better stuff in this game
but<00:01:55.090> they<00:01:55.270> didn't<00:01:55.599> which<00:01:56.079> is<00:01:56.109> unfortunate<00:01:56.829> so

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
but they didn't which is unfortunate so

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.710 
but they didn't which is unfortunate so
I'll<00:01:57.909> just<00:01:57.969> build<00:01:58.599> this<00:01:58.810> right<00:01:59.049> now<00:01:59.200> so

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.010 

let's<00:02:01.870> just<00:02:02.110> delete<00:02:02.260> these<00:02:02.590> things<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.130> hear

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
let's just delete these things to hear

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.480 
let's just delete these things to hear
now<00:02:05.020> let's<00:02:05.350> dilute<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.920> don't<00:02:06.190> need<00:02:06.280> any

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
now let's dilute that I don't need any

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.060 
now let's dilute that I don't need any
help<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:08.020> we<00:02:08.110> got<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.380> one<00:02:08.530> pad<00:02:08.800> right<00:02:09.040> there

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
help so we got the one pad right there

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:18.290 
help so we got the one pad right there
let's<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:09.759> add<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.149> backing<00:02:14.640> man<00:02:15.640> let's<00:02:16.350> so

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
let's just add a backing man let's so

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.830 
let's just add a backing man let's so
all<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.360> want<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.260> here<00:02:20.950> let's<00:02:21.840> there

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
all you want to do is here let's there

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.270 
all you want to do is here let's there
that<00:02:23.080> there's<00:02:23.320> our<00:02:23.470> benchmark<00:02:23.920> now<00:02:24.100> we're

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
that there's our benchmark now we're

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.790 
that there's our benchmark now we're
going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> want<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> turn<00:02:24.940> off<00:02:25.800> snapping

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
going to want to turn off snapping

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.010 
going to want to turn off snapping
because<00:02:27.220> that'll<00:02:27.580> make<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.940> our<00:02:28.480> job<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.870> lot

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
because that'll make it our job a lot

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.580 
because that'll make it our job a lot
harder<00:02:29.170> now<00:02:29.740> let's<00:02:30.580> see<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:31.660> I'm<00:02:31.840> inching<00:02:32.080> it

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
harder now let's see as I'm inching it

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.090 
harder now let's see as I'm inching it
closer<00:02:32.890> I<00:02:33.340> think<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.360> too<00:02:34.660> much<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.230> also

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
closer I think this is too much and also

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.380 
closer I think this is too much and also
you<00:02:36.340> don't<00:02:36.550> want<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.790> go<00:02:36.880> with<00:02:37.000> your<00:02:37.150> board

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
you don't want to go with your board

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.750 
you don't want to go with your board
because<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:37.840> over<00:02:38.020> harder<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:39.280> my<00:02:39.610> guy

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
because just over harder and see my guy

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.520 
because just over harder and see my guy
kind<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.150> glitches<00:02:40.390> he<00:02:40.720> doesn't<00:02:40.990> go<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.260> even

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
kind of glitches he doesn't go in even

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.070 
kind of glitches he doesn't go in even
though<00:02:41.650> he<00:02:41.740> could<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.910> we'll<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.209> fix<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
though he could so we'll just fix that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.199 
though he could so we'll just fix that
just<00:02:44.860> move<00:02:45.550> right<00:02:45.580> there<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:47.880> let's<00:02:48.880> try<00:02:49.150> it

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
just move right there and let's try it

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.770 
just move right there and let's try it
and<00:02:50.970> see<00:02:51.970> he<00:02:52.330> goes<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.750> as<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:54.100> see<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.780> my

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
and see he goes in as you see like my

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.360 
and see he goes in as you see like my
guy<00:02:55.930> didn't<00:02:56.170> go<00:02:56.230> all<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.380> way<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.740> top<00:02:56.770> now

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
guy didn't go all the way to the top now

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.080 
guy didn't go all the way to the top now
it's<00:02:57.820> nothing<00:02:58.660> it's<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.320> glitch<00:02:59.620> I<00:03:00.100> think

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
it's nothing it's just a glitch I think

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.270 
it's nothing it's just a glitch I think
if<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:01.390> I'll<00:03:02.020> move<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.250> little

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
if you just I'll move it just a little

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.509 
if you just I'll move it just a little
bit<00:03:03.490> closer<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:04.660> should<00:03:05.110> be<00:03:05.230> alright<00:03:05.519> like

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
bit closer it should be alright like

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.820 
bit closer it should be alright like
very<00:03:07.209> slightly<00:03:07.660> I'm<00:03:07.959> barely<00:03:08.170> moving<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:08.650> at

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
very slightly I'm barely moving in at

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.020 
very slightly I'm barely moving in at
all<00:03:09.750> I'll<00:03:10.750> place<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.700> should<00:03:13.000> work

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
all I'll place this and it should work

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.780 
all I'll place this and it should work
now<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.660> my<00:03:13.780> guy<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.140> broke<00:03:14.290> his<00:03:14.410> neck<00:03:14.790> here

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
now and my guy just broke his neck here

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.440 
now and my guy just broke his neck here
let's<00:03:16.060> try<00:03:16.390> this<00:03:17.160> go<00:03:18.160> in<00:03:18.310> there<00:03:18.489> Oh<00:03:18.730> see<00:03:19.300> it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.449 
let's try this go in there Oh see it's
too<00:03:19.630> much<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:20.050> don't<00:03:20.230> know<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.530> game<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:21.130> a

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
too much I don't know this game is a

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.570 
too much I don't know this game is a
little<00:03:22.269> bit<00:03:22.360> glitchy<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:23.280> what<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.370> going<00:03:24.519> to

little bit glitchy but what you going to
do<00:03:25.650> now<00:03:26.650> let's<00:03:26.830> try<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.100> one<00:03:27.250> more<00:03:27.310> time

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
do now let's try it one more time

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.179 
do now let's try it one more time
see<00:03:29.519> now<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:29.999> over<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:31.620> having<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.010> seizure

this is a very annoying glitch it's I
mean<00:03:53.159> it<00:03:53.250> works<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.909> I<00:03:54.389> wouldn't<00:03:55.349> necessarily

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
mean it works and I wouldn't necessarily

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.670 
mean it works and I wouldn't necessarily
use<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.579> in<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.909> park<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.689> mine<00:03:58.019> just<00:03:58.260> cuz<00:03:58.469> it
