00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.500 
continually ramping up and right now
there's<00:03:58.989> plenty<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.380> jobs<00:03:59.590> in<00:03:59.800> this<00:03:59.890> area<00:04:00.100> and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
there's plenty of jobs in this area and

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.390 
there's plenty of jobs in this area and
hydrogen<00:04:01.510> power<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:02.020> also<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> viable<00:04:03.040> means<00:04:03.190> of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
hydrogen power is also a viable means of

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.610 
hydrogen power is also a viable means of
public<00:04:03.850> transportation<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:05.080> think<00:04:05.500> it's

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
public transportation I think it's

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.110 
public transportation I think it's
important<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.040> note<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.760> fuel<00:04:07.030> cell

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
important to note that the fuel cell

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.150 
important to note that the fuel cell
technology<00:04:07.690> is<00:04:07.870> also<00:04:08.200> works<00:04:08.739> very<00:04:08.920> well<00:04:09.010> in

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
technology is also works very well in

well<00:05:30.280> instead<00:05:30.700> you<00:05:31.090> could<00:05:31.240> just<00:05:31.480> have<00:05:31.720> a

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
well instead you could just have a

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.990 
well instead you could just have a
hydrogen<00:05:32.020> canister<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.010> in<00:05:33.460> just<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.790> minute

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
hydrogen canister and in just a minute

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.080 
hydrogen canister and in just a minute
or<00:05:34.210> two<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:34.389> could<00:05:34.780> put<00:05:35.680> hydrogen<00:05:36.070> into<00:05:36.669> us

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
or two you could put hydrogen into us

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.210 
or two you could put hydrogen into us
into<00:05:37.480> a<00:05:37.510> tank<00:05:37.810> on<00:05:37.930> your<00:05:38.080> laptop<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.980> it<00:05:39.100> could

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
into a tank on your laptop and it could

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.980 
into a tank on your laptop and it could
last<00:05:39.400> much<00:05:39.700> longer<00:05:39.730> and<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:40.330> could<00:05:40.480> refuel<00:05:40.870> it

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
last much longer and you could refuel it

much<00:05:41.139> faster<00:05:41.350> another<00:05:42.340> advantage<00:05:42.880> is<00:05:42.970> that

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
much faster another advantage is that

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.050 
much faster another advantage is that
unlike<00:05:43.630> oil<00:05:43.990> hydrogen<00:05:44.889> can<00:05:45.100> be<00:05:45.130> made<00:05:45.430> almost
