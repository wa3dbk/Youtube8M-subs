00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
really nice but once I started coloring

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.209 
really nice but once I started coloring
it<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.270> don't<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.860> I

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it I don't know what it was but like I

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.779 
it I don't know what it was but like I
kind<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.590> maybe<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.460> cuz<00:00:47.640> when

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
kind of I don't know maybe it's cuz when

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.510 
kind of I don't know maybe it's cuz when
I<00:00:47.820> added<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> blue<00:00:48.870> violet<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
I added like the blue violet as the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.029 
I added like the blue violet as the
shading<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.090> kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.300> made<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:52.469> narrower

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
shading it kind of made it look narrower

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.740 
shading it kind of made it look narrower
and<00:00:53.399> more<00:00:53.539> icky

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and more icky

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.250 
and more icky
I<00:00:54.780> guess<00:00:55.289> muddy<00:00:56.090> because<00:00:57.090> um<00:00:57.420> usually<00:00:57.809> I<00:01:00.260> I'll

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

blue<00:01:09.780> violet<00:01:10.140> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> turned<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> gray<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
when I used it to shade like the what is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.530 
when I used it to shade like the what is
it<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.670> shade<00:01:18.000> everything

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

bad<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.430> don't

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bad like I kind of like it but I don't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.550 
bad like I kind of like it but I don't
know<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.840> everything<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.290> went

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
know it just like everything just went

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.620 
know it just like everything just went
downhill<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.399> could<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.060> done<00:01:45.329> totally

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
downhill I could have done totally

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530 
downhill I could have done totally
better<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.710> guess<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.670> didn't<00:01:48.270> put<00:01:48.420> in

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
better but I guess I didn't put in

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.340 
better but I guess I didn't put in
enough<00:01:48.899> effort<00:01:49.290> even<00:01:49.950> though<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.430> took<00:01:50.700> me<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
enough effort even though this took me a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.660 
enough effort even though this took me a
long<00:01:52.350> time<00:01:53.299> maybe<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.960> day<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.920> two<00:01:56.159> like

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
long time maybe like a day or two like

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
long time maybe like a day or two like
it<00:01:56.939> took<00:01:57.090> me<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> few<00:01:57.329> days<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> lineart<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
it took me a few days to lineart it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.870 
it took me a few days to lineart it

a<00:04:24.090> white<00:04:24.479> fuchsia<00:04:24.810> which<00:04:25.200> isn't<00:04:25.530> that<00:04:25.770> light

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
a white fuchsia which isn't that light

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.620 
a white fuchsia which isn't that light
so<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.940> don't<00:04:28.930> know<00:04:29.410> well<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.760> skipped<00:04:31.420> the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
so I don't know well I skipped the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.750 
so I don't know well I skipped the
coloring<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.440> majority<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.310> because

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
coloring of the majority of this because

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.210 
coloring of the majority of this because
if<00:04:34.420> I<00:04:34.600> didn't<00:04:35.080> it<00:04:35.230> would<00:04:35.350> have<00:04:35.470> taken<00:04:35.710> probably

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
if I didn't it would have taken probably

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.490 
if I didn't it would have taken probably
a<00:04:36.610> few<00:04:36.970> years<00:04:37.300> and<00:04:37.510> I'm<00:04:37.570> not<00:04:37.750> even<00:04:37.870> joking<00:04:38.020> when

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
a few years and I'm not even joking when

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.040 
a few years and I'm not even joking when
I<00:04:38.530> say<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:39.010> I<00:04:39.280> skipped<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:40.000> ton<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.300> this<00:04:40.630> and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
I say that I skipped a ton of this and

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.380 
I say that I skipped a ton of this and
the<00:04:41.380> video<00:04:41.620> was<00:04:41.830> already<00:04:42.010> at<00:04:42.310> like<00:04:42.520> 10<00:04:43.120> minutes

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
the video was already at like 10 minutes

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.680 
the video was already at like 10 minutes
so<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.720> had<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.990> shorten<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.410> down<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.920> like<00:04:45.040> 5

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
so I had to shorten it down to like 5

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.820 
so I had to shorten it down to like 5
