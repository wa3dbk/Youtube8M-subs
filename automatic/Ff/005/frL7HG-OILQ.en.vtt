00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
it's already mounted for focusing on the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.550 
it's already mounted for focusing on the
speedometer<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.670> odometer<00:00:15.320> today<00:00:16.320> I'm<00:00:16.440> gonna

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
speedometer and odometer today I'm gonna

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.420 
speedometer and odometer today I'm gonna
be<00:00:16.650> talking<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.580> RPMs<00:00:18.480> i<00:00:19.430> mounted

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
be talking about on the RPMs i mounted

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.450 
be talking about on the RPMs i mounted
like<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.359> guys<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.430> where<00:00:23.430> our

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
like this so you guys can see where our

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.089 
like this so you guys can see where our
pms<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.330> at<00:00:24.480> when<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> shift<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.529> how<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
pms are at when I shift and how it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.679 
pms are at when I shift and how it
should<00:00:26.279> look<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.490> when<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:26.970> shift<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
should look like when I do shift and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.240 
should look like when I do shift and
also<00:00:28.650> for<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.640> guys<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.830> RPM<00:00:31.830> should

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
also for you guys to see what RPM should

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.560 
also for you guys to see what RPM should
look<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.660> shift<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.640> also<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
look like when I down shift and also to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.549 
look like when I down shift and also to
look<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> miles<00:00:37.559> per<00:00:37.800> hour<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:39.030> see<00:00:39.559> what

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
look at the miles per hour to see what

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
look at the miles per hour to see what
my<00:00:40.710> power<00:00:40.980> range<00:00:41.309> i<00:00:41.489> am<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.629> i<00:00:42.690> do<00:00:42.809> ship

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
my power range i am and what i do ship

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
my power range i am and what i do ship
them<00:00:43.469> down<00:00:43.649> shift<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.940> right<00:00:45.180> why<00:00:45.629> don't<00:00:45.690> get

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
them down shift all right why don't get
