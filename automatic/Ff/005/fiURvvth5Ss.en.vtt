00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
remember a couple months ago I did take

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.299 
remember a couple months ago I did take
a<00:00:12.300> look<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.690> Trident<00:00:12.929> Cyclops<00:00:13.590> which<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
a look at the Trident Cyclops which is

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.950 
a look at the Trident Cyclops which is
basically<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.030> scaled<00:00:15.360> version<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.839> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
basically the up scaled version of this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.930 
basically the up scaled version of this
case<00:00:16.230> right<00:00:16.470> here<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> little<00:00:17.730> bit

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
case right here so it is a little bit

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
case right here so it is a little bit
thicker<00:00:18.150> offers<00:00:18.600> more<00:00:18.750> protection<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.470> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
thicker offers more protection in that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.349 
thicker offers more protection in that
case<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.730> those<00:00:20.789> people<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> want

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
case but for those people that want

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.490 
case but for those people that want
something<00:00:21.689> slimmer<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.170> fits<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.470> your

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
something slimmer that fits in your

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.810 
something slimmer that fits in your
pocket<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> little<00:00:23.310> bit<00:00:23.400> more<00:00:23.519> lightweight

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
pocket is a little bit more lightweight

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.089 
pocket is a little bit more lightweight
than<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.480> probably<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> option<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.769> so

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
than this probably the option for you so

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.300 
than this probably the option for you so
let's<00:00:26.730> pop<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> packaging

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
let's pop this out of the packaging

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.640 
let's pop this out of the packaging
which<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.460> right<00:00:29.640> here<00:00:29.689> so<00:00:30.689> before<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
which is right here so before I get it

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
which is right here so before I get it
out<00:00:31.769> i<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:32.070> want<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> show<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.969> little<00:00:33.480> bit

out i just want to show you a little bit
about<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.899> case<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.559> comes<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:34.980> six

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
about the case so it comes in six

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.530 
about the case so it comes in six
different<00:00:35.399> colors<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.510> right

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
different colors that you can see right

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.500 
different colors that you can see right
there<00:00:37.040> according<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.070> trident<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.059> offers

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
there according to trident it offers

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.840 
there according to trident it offers
rugged<00:00:39.899> protection<00:00:40.129> with<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.370> hybrid

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
rugged protection with that hybrid

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.580 
rugged protection with that hybrid
construction<00:00:42.059> which<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.780> basically<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
construction which is basically a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.799 
construction which is basically a
polycarbonate<00:00:44.489> shell<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.059> silicone<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
polycarbonate shell with silicone and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.779 
polycarbonate shell with silicone and
it's<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.469> very<00:00:46.500> slim<00:00:46.980> design<00:00:47.129> according<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it's a very slim design according to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.979 
it's a very slim design according to
them<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.180> we'll<00:00:48.329> take<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> look<00:00:48.719> at<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.930> in

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
them so we'll take a look at that in

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.150 
them so we'll take a look at that in
just<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.410> second<00:00:50.870> move<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> sauce<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.949> here's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
just a second move the sauce so here's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.880 
just a second move the sauce so here's
the<00:00:53.309> case<00:00:53.489> itself<00:00:53.899> does<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.140> QR<00:00:55.500> code<00:00:55.710> here

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the case itself does have a QR code here

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
the case itself does have a QR code here
which<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.219> cool<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.910> use<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> QR

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
which is pretty cool if you do use a QR

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.290 
which is pretty cool if you do use a QR
code<00:00:57.960> reader<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.070> video

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
code reader it will take you to a video

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
code reader it will take you to a video
let's<00:01:00.300> take<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.840> silicone<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> shell

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
let's take the silicone out of the shell

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
let's take the silicone out of the shell
and<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> inside<00:01:03.719> right<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.350> you'll<00:01:04.530> see

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and on the inside right here you'll see

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
and on the inside right here you'll see
that<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> screen<00:01:05.670> protector<00:01:05.850> as

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that you do get a screen protector as

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.469 
that you do get a screen protector as
you<00:01:06.450> did<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.350> original<00:01:08.250> or<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.180> other

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you did with the original or the other

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.929 
you did with the original or the other
trident<00:01:10.049> case<00:01:10.200> which<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> Cyclops<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
trident case which is the Cyclops it

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.770 
trident case which is the Cyclops it
also<00:01:12.060> comes<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> microfiber<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.689> then<00:01:15.689> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
also comes with a microfiber and then it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.990 
also comes with a microfiber and then it
also<00:01:15.900> comes<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.380> instructions<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.759> how<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
also comes with instructions on how to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.520 
also comes with instructions on how to
put<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> case<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.960> how<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> install<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
put the case on and how to install the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
put the case on and how to install the
screen<00:01:19.890> protector<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.759> cool

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
screen protector so it's pretty cool

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.960 
screen protector so it's pretty cool
them<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.479> add<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.220> case<00:01:23.400> does<00:01:23.610> retail

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
them to add that so the case does retail

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
them to add that so the case does retail
for<00:01:24.200> 2995<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.409> 30<00:01:25.650> bucks<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.100> an<00:01:26.220> ok<00:01:26.520> price<00:01:26.729> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
for 2995 so 30 bucks it's an ok price so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.310 
for 2995 so 30 bucks it's an ok price so
at<00:01:27.330> least<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.750> include<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.200> screen

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
at least they do include a screen

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
at least they do include a screen
protector<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
protector on here so this is a

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.749 
protector on here so this is a
crystal-clear<00:01:30.630> model<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> seems<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> be

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
crystal-clear model so it seems to be

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.469 
crystal-clear model so it seems to be
pretty<00:01:32.939> decent<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.979> case<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.430> right<00:01:36.150> here

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
pretty decent so the case is right here

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.020 
pretty decent so the case is right here
as<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.470> two<00:01:37.680> pieces<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
as you can see it is two pieces so this

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090 
as you can see it is two pieces so this
is<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.299> silicon<00:01:39.869> layer<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.680> will<00:01:40.860> add<00:01:41.070> some

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
is a silicon layer which will add some

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.399 
is a silicon layer which will add some
chocolate<00:01:41.460> dorp<00:01:41.880> shun<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.659> pretty<00:01:42.869> stake<00:01:43.200> as

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
chocolate dorp shun it's pretty stake as

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
chocolate dorp shun it's pretty stake as
you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.549> does<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.700> pork

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you can see and it does have pork

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.670 
you can see and it does have pork
coverings<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> bottom<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
coverings right at the bottom for the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
coverings right at the bottom for the
micro<00:01:47.100> USB<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> headphone<00:01:48.240> jack<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
micro USB and for the headphone jack and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.960 
micro USB and for the headphone jack and
here<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> polycarbonate<00:01:50.729> show

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
here you have the polycarbonate show

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.700 
here you have the polycarbonate show
which<00:01:51.149> has<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> very<00:01:51.600> nice<00:01:51.780> matte<00:01:52.110> finish<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.680> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
which has a very nice matte finish on it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.399 
which has a very nice matte finish on it
so<00:01:53.159> even<00:01:53.909> though<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.119> matt<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.110> pick<00:01:55.290> up

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
so even though it's matt it does pick up

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.620 
so even though it's matt it does pick up
a<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.829> oils<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.549> very<00:01:57.119> bad<00:01:57.390> but

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
a little bit of oils not very bad but

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.600 
a little bit of oils not very bad but
just<00:01:57.810> something<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.290> note<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.369> does

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
just something to note but this does

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
just something to note but this does
slide<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.390> pocket<00:02:00.780> very

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
slide in and out of your pocket very

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
slide in and out of your pocket very
easily<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.850> protection

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
easily and really for the protection

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.910 
easily and really for the protection
offers<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> does<00:02:03.869> keep<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> pretty<00:02:04.350> slim<00:02:04.710> design

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
offers it does keep a pretty slim design

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.449 
offers it does keep a pretty slim design
so<00:02:05.430> let's<00:02:05.880> props<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> phone<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
so let's props just on to the phone and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
so let's props just on to the phone and
the<00:02:08.459> case<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.879> most<00:02:09.119> reminds<00:02:09.420> me<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the case this most reminds me of is the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.920 
the case this most reminds me of is the
city<00:02:10.440> 0<00:02:10.500> activex<00:02:11.220> just<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.450> featured

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
city 0 activex just because it featured

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.349 
city 0 activex just because it featured
silicone<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.310> hybrid<00:02:14.790> design<00:02:15.090> although

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
silicone and that hybrid design although

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:16.910 
silicone and that hybrid design although
this<00:02:15.540> one<00:02:15.719> is<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.200> little<00:02:16.379> bit<00:02:16.469> weirder<00:02:16.859> as

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
this one is just a little bit weirder as

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.830 
this one is just a little bit weirder as
you<00:02:17.129> can<00:02:17.250> see<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.849> installing<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.450> case<00:02:18.629> onto

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you can see so installing the case onto

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.089 
you can see so installing the case onto
the<00:02:19.019> phone<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.319> actually<00:02:19.500> pretty<00:02:19.829> difficult

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the phone is actually pretty difficult

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.729 
the phone is actually pretty difficult
just<00:02:20.519> because<00:02:20.609> you<00:02:21.450> need<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.629> line<00:02:21.900> up<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
just because you need to line up the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.449 
just because you need to line up the
silicone<00:02:23.340> onto<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.510> plastic<00:02:24.959> shell<00:02:25.500> almost

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
silicone onto the plastic shell almost

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.920 
silicone onto the plastic shell almost
perfectly<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.209> can<00:02:27.329> see<00:02:27.420> there<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:27.719> really

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
perfectly as you can see there is really

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.679 
perfectly as you can see there is really
no<00:02:28.109> space<00:02:28.439> for<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.099> button<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.609> go<00:02:29.730> through<00:02:30.120> so

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
no space for the button to go through so

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.149 
no space for the button to go through so
once<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.019> do<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.680> do<00:02:31.889> it<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
once you do that if you do it on the

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.009 
once you do that if you do it on the
right-hand<00:02:32.489> side<00:02:32.579> for<00:02:32.879> example<00:02:33.269> your<00:02:33.780> left

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
right-hand side for example your left

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.959 
right-hand side for example your left
short<00:02:34.469> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.650> plastic<00:02:35.189> on<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> left-hand

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:35.969 
short of the plastic on the left-hand

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.089 
short of the plastic on the left-hand
side<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.139> got<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> massage<00:02:37.739> and

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
side so you really got a massage and

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.890 
side so you really got a massage and
pull<00:02:38.459> over<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.819> plastic<00:02:39.269> over<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.689> little

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
pull over the plastic over that little

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.390 
pull over the plastic over that little
silicone<00:02:40.500> nub<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.099> pretty<00:02:41.280> difficult

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
silicone nub so it is pretty difficult

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.550 
silicone nub so it is pretty difficult
so<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.569> do<00:02:42.659> pick<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.959> up<00:02:43.049> you<00:02:43.170> might<00:02:43.290> want

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
so if you do pick it up you might want

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.440 
so if you do pick it up you might want
to<00:02:43.620> just<00:02:43.769> keep<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.129> on<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.459> phone<00:02:44.639> and<00:02:44.700> your

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
to just keep this on your phone and your

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.759 
to just keep this on your phone and your
person<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.900> change<00:02:46.139> this<00:02:46.230> case<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.650> pretty

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
person that change this case is pretty

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.440 
person that change this case is pretty
often<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.669> then<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.939> might<00:02:48.090> have<00:02:48.269> some

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
often like I do then you might have some

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.899 
often like I do then you might have some
difficulty<00:02:48.959> putting<00:02:49.169> this<00:02:49.379> on<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.579> terms

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
difficulty putting this on so in terms

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.729 
difficulty putting this on so in terms
of<00:02:51.120> style<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.540> really<00:02:51.720> do<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.230> case<00:02:52.439> i

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
of style I really do like the case i

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.129 
of style I really do like the case i
love<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.700> hybrid<00:02:54.090> design<00:02:54.359> just<00:02:54.599> because<00:02:54.900> in

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
love the hybrid design just because in

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.800 
love the hybrid design just because in
this<00:02:55.290> case<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.340> color<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:57.359> accents

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
this case you see the color it accents

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
this case you see the color it accents
the<00:02:58.049> red<00:02:58.260> really<00:02:58.530> nicely<00:02:58.739> with<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.280> dark

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
the red really nicely with that dark

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.720 
the red really nicely with that dark
black<00:03:00.419> all<00:03:01.409> around<00:03:01.469> here<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.219> can<00:03:02.340> see<00:03:02.519> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
black all around here you can see that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
black all around here you can see that
it's<00:03:02.909> not<00:03:03.090> like<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.359> city<00:03:03.569> o<00:03:03.629> actives<00:03:04.019> case

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
it's not like the city o actives case

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.080 
it's not like the city o actives case
which<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:04.799> basically<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.280> straight<00:03:05.669> up<00:03:05.700> x

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
which is just basically a straight up x

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.459 
which is just basically a straight up x
design<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.719> actually<00:03:07.109> a<00:03:07.139> little<00:03:07.230> bit

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
design this actually a little bit

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.229 
design this actually a little bit
different<00:03:07.889> i<00:03:07.950> do<00:03:08.010> like<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.310> way<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.700> looks<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
different i do like the way it looks so

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.330 
different i do like the way it looks so
right<00:03:10.109> here<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:10.620> camera<00:03:11.010> cut<00:03:11.189> out

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
right here you have the camera cut out

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.390 
right here you have the camera cut out
which<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.609> perfect<00:03:12.060> works<00:03:12.689> just<00:03:12.930> fine<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
which is perfect works just fine on the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.679 
which is perfect works just fine on the
left-hand<00:03:14.730> side<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.150> your<00:03:15.239> volume<00:03:15.389> up

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
left-hand side you have your volume up

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.750 
left-hand side you have your volume up
and<00:03:15.900> down<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.439> super<00:03:16.650> easy<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:17.099> press<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
and down this is super easy to press the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.030 
and down this is super easy to press the
silicone<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.329> really<00:03:18.629> soft<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.319> no<00:03:19.680> issues

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
silicone is really soft so no issues

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.059 
silicone is really soft so no issues
there<00:03:20.069> it's<00:03:20.370> very<00:03:20.400> responsive<00:03:21.799> at<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.889> bottom

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
there it's very responsive at the bottom

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.129 
there it's very responsive at the bottom
you<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.549> have<00:03:23.669> to<00:03:23.849> cut<00:03:24.090> outs<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.840> do<00:03:24.989> have

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
you do have to cut outs that do have

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.629 
you do have to cut outs that do have
ports<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.620> them<00:03:25.799> which<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.040> awesome<00:03:26.340> just

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
ports in them which is awesome just

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.759 
ports in them which is awesome just
because<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.150> keeps<00:03:27.269> dust<00:03:27.599> out<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.199> so<00:03:28.709> you

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
because it keeps dust out of here so you

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.259 
because it keeps dust out of here so you
have<00:03:28.949> your<00:03:28.979> micro<00:03:29.370> USB<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.030> have<00:03:30.150> your

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
have your micro USB and you have your

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.330 
have your micro USB and you have your
headphone<00:03:30.629> jack<00:03:30.870> these<00:03:31.049> work<00:03:31.260> perfectly<00:03:31.799> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
headphone jack these work perfectly and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.830 
headphone jack these work perfectly and
then<00:03:32.519> at<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.639> back<00:03:32.909> you<00:03:33.090> do<00:03:33.180> have<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.329> Trident

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
then at the back you do have the Trident

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.539 
then at the back you do have the Trident
logo<00:03:34.109> right<00:03:34.349> there<00:03:34.379> you<00:03:35.099> have<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.250> couple

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
logo right there you have a couple

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.039 
logo right there you have a couple
speakers<00:03:35.939> right<00:03:36.180> around<00:03:36.359> here<00:03:36.540> i'm<00:03:36.720> not<00:03:36.900> sure

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
speakers right around here i'm not sure

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.420 
speakers right around here i'm not sure
what<00:03:37.169> these<00:03:37.349> do<00:03:37.620> probably<00:03:37.889> for<00:03:38.159> heat

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
what these do probably for heat

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.219 
what these do probably for heat
dissipation<00:03:38.939> and<00:03:39.239> these<00:03:39.419> right<00:03:39.629> here<00:03:39.659> or<00:03:40.079> for

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
dissipation and these right here or for

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.289 
dissipation and these right here or for
the<00:03:40.319> speaker<00:03:40.739> girl<00:03:40.919> no<00:03:41.579> i'm<00:03:41.639> opting<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.090> sound

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
the speaker girl no i'm opting the sound

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.030 
the speaker girl no i'm opting the sound
they<00:03:42.449> work<00:03:42.599> just<00:03:42.629> perfectly<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.470> one<00:03:43.650> thing

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
they work just perfectly and one thing

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.379 
they work just perfectly and one thing
to<00:03:44.189> know<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.609> probably<00:03:44.879> can<00:03:45.000> see<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.209> little

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
to know is you probably can see a little

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.210 
to know is you probably can see a little
bit<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.599> darkness<00:03:46.169> right<00:03:46.379> around<00:03:46.500> there<00:03:46.739> it's

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
bit of darkness right around there it's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.339 
bit of darkness right around there it's
actually<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.549> small<00:03:47.790> felt<00:03:48.060> pad<00:03:48.329> so<00:03:48.689> it<00:03:48.900> will

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
actually a small felt pad so it will

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.899 
actually a small felt pad so it will
prevent<00:03:49.620> dust<00:03:49.889> from<00:03:50.129> getting<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.579> there<00:03:50.759> but

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
prevent dust from getting in there but

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.149 
prevent dust from getting in there but
the<00:03:51.000> sound<00:03:51.239> still<00:03:51.479> comes<00:03:51.720> out<00:03:51.900> fine<00:03:52.199> on<00:03:52.739> the

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
the sound still comes out fine on the

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.379 
the sound still comes out fine on the
right<00:03:53.280> hand<00:03:53.340> side<00:03:53.639> you<00:03:53.849> do<00:03:53.970> have<00:03:54.060> your<00:03:54.120> power

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
right hand side you do have your power

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.330 
right hand side you do have your power
button<00:03:54.509> and<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.079> works<00:03:55.349> just<00:03:55.500> fine<00:03:55.889> as<00:03:56.129> well

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
button and that works just fine as well

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.729 
button and that works just fine as well
all<00:03:57.030> around<00:03:57.479> the<00:03:57.659> screen<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.229> have<00:03:58.349> this<00:03:58.500> nice

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
all around the screen you have this nice

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.949 
all around the screen you have this nice
thick<00:03:59.400> lay<00:03:59.729> on<00:03:59.879> the<00:03:59.970> table<00:04:00.000> design<00:04:00.599> so<00:04:00.780> this

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
thick lay on the table design so this

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.809 
thick lay on the table design so this
will<00:04:01.199> protect<00:04:01.409> in<00:04:01.919> case<00:04:02.129> your<00:04:02.280> phone<00:04:02.459> falls

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
will protect in case your phone falls

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.300 
will protect in case your phone falls
flat<00:04:03.169> and<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.259> does<00:04:04.439> lift<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.829> up<00:04:04.889> off<00:04:05.129> the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
flat and it does lift it up off the

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.309 
flat and it does lift it up off the
table<00:04:05.459> so<00:04:05.759> you<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:05.879> place<00:04:06.479> your<00:04:06.599> phone<00:04:06.810> facing

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.830 
table so you can place your phone facing
down<00:04:07.500> which<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.310> always<00:04:08.609> great<00:04:08.909> now<00:04:09.659> one<00:04:09.810> thing

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
down which is always great now one thing

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.869 
down which is always great now one thing
to<00:04:10.049> note<00:04:10.199> though<00:04:10.439> same<00:04:11.189> as<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> city<00:04:11.759> of

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
to note though same as a city of

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.479 
to note though same as a city of
interactive<00:04:12.599> x<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.439> silicon<00:04:13.979> on<00:04:14.069> this<00:04:14.189> is<00:04:14.340> not

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
interactive x the silicon on this is not

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.550 
interactive x the silicon on this is not
of<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.790> highest<00:04:14.819> quality<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.750> it's<00:04:16.229> not<00:04:16.440> going

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
of the highest quality so it's not going

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.110 
of the highest quality so it's not going
to<00:04:16.650> break<00:04:16.799> on<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.070> just<00:04:17.340> because<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:17.849> thick

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
to break on you just because it is thick

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.580 
to break on you just because it is thick
but<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.449> does<00:04:18.630> attempt<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.019> pick<00:04:19.199> up<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.409> lot<00:04:19.530> of

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
but it does attempt to pick up a lot of

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.700 
but it does attempt to pick up a lot of
lint<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:20.549> lot<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:20.789> debris<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.570> i<00:04:21.779> did<00:04:22.409> clean

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
lint and a lot of debris so i did clean

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.649 
lint and a lot of debris so i did clean
it<00:04:22.830> out<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:23.159> before<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.909> review<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.419> as<00:04:24.570> you

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
it out just before the review so as you

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.770 
it out just before the review so as you
can<00:04:24.779> see<00:04:24.930> it's<00:04:25.080> not<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.469> bad

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
can see it's not that bad

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.629 
can see it's not that bad
but<00:04:25.990> dust<00:04:26.290> pick<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:26.680> lint<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.100> debris<00:04:27.460> all

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
but dust pick up lint and debris all

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.210 
but dust pick up lint and debris all
around<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.660> case<00:04:28.930> still<00:04:29.290> slides<00:04:29.830> in<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.130> out

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
around this case still slides in and out

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.010 
around this case still slides in and out
your<00:04:30.340> pocket<00:04:30.670> very<00:04:30.850> easily<00:04:31.060> just<00:04:31.450> because<00:04:31.780> of

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
your pocket very easily just because of

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.230 
your pocket very easily just because of
the<00:04:32.050> plastic<00:04:32.740> shell<00:04:33.010> right<00:04:33.280> here<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.880> e<00:04:33.910> just

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
the plastic shell right here the e just

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.730 
the plastic shell right here the e just
walk<00:04:34.480> or<00:04:34.660> some<00:04:34.810> pretty<00:04:34.990> good<00:04:35.110> protection<00:04:35.500> just

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
walk or some pretty good protection just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.440 
walk or some pretty good protection just
because<00:04:36.100> as<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.430> makes<00:04:36.639> of<00:04:36.850> silicone<00:04:37.300> and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
because as that makes of silicone and

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.450 
because as that makes of silicone and
plastic<00:04:37.560> one<00:04:38.560> thing<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.860> note<00:04:38.980> that<00:04:39.010> I<00:04:39.280> really

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
plastic one thing to note that I really

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.159 
plastic one thing to note that I really
do<00:04:39.669> like<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.180> fact<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.480> these<00:04:40.660> corners

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
do like is the fact that these corners

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.659 
do like is the fact that these corners
right<00:04:41.350> here<00:04:41.410> reinforce<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.490> some<00:04:42.639> more

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
right here reinforce it some more

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.879 
right here reinforce it some more
silicone<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:44.080> sticker<00:04:44.410> right<00:04:44.650> around

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
silicone so it is sticker right around

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.070 
silicone so it is sticker right around
here<00:04:45.160> more<00:04:45.430> than<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.910> in<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.210> middle<00:04:46.480> so<00:04:46.990> in

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
here more than it is in the middle so in

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.629 
here more than it is in the middle so in
that<00:04:47.200> case<00:04:47.410> when<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.740> do<00:04:47.860> drop<00:04:48.100> your<00:04:48.280> phone<00:04:48.460> it

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
that case when you do drop your phone it

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.340 
that case when you do drop your phone it
will<00:04:49.180> add<00:04:49.450> some<00:04:49.630> more<00:04:49.720> shock<00:04:49.960> absorption

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
will add some more shock absorption

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.440 
will add some more shock absorption
right<00:04:50.680> around<00:04:50.860> these<00:04:51.130> corners<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:51.970> that's

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
right around these corners so that's

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.730 
right around these corners so that's
pretty<00:04:52.660> good<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.930> them<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.080> have<00:04:53.290> done<00:04:53.560> that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
pretty good of them to have done that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.890 
pretty good of them to have done that
same<00:04:54.639> time<00:04:54.850> it's<00:04:55.000> very<00:04:55.030> comfortable<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.750> hold

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
same time it's very comfortable to hold

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.320 
same time it's very comfortable to hold
in<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.230> hand<00:04:56.380> I<00:04:56.710> do<00:04:56.980> like<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.370> design<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:58.030> over

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
in the hand I do like to design and over

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.909 
in the hand I do like to design and over
I<00:04:58.360> am<00:04:58.660> pretty<00:04:58.900> pleased<00:04:59.200> with<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.500> whole<00:04:59.530> case

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919

itself<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.970> only<00:05:01.150> thing<00:05:01.270> like<00:05:01.390> i<00:05:01.540> said<00:05:01.780> is

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
itself the only thing like i said is

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.050 
itself the only thing like i said is
this<00:05:02.110> picks<00:05:02.380> up<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.650> little<00:05:02.860> bit<00:05:02.980> of<00:05:03.100> lint<00:05:03.370> the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
this picks up a little bit of lint the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.520 
this picks up a little bit of lint the
case<00:05:04.270> isn't<00:05:04.540> as<00:05:04.780> slim<00:05:05.080> as<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.290> would<00:05:05.440> have

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
case isn't as slim as I would have

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.840 
case isn't as slim as I would have
thought<00:05:05.770> but<00:05:06.070> it<00:05:06.160> still<00:05:06.370> fits<00:05:06.550> in<00:05:06.700> your<00:05:06.730> pocket

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
thought but it still fits in your pocket

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.970 
thought but it still fits in your pocket

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
nicely I do see myself using it as an

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.000 
nicely I do see myself using it as an
everyday<00:05:09.100> case<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:09.850> overall<00:05:10.690> very<00:05:11.590> good<00:05:11.860> case
