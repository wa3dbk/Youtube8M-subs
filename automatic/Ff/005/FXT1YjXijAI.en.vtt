well after watching live molt his video

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.999 
well after watching live molt his video
I<00:00:03.210> thought<00:00:03.629> laughter<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:03.959> forgot<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.470> led

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
I thought laughter I forgot this led

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.270 
I thought laughter I forgot this led
plates<00:00:05.339> idea<00:00:05.819> but<00:00:06.750> after<00:00:07.109> trying<00:00:07.379> some<00:00:07.649> solder

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
plates idea but after trying some solder

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.540 
plates idea but after trying some solder
that<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.550> found<00:00:09.139> well<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.710> didn't<00:00:10.950> work<00:00:10.980> out<00:00:11.280> so

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
that I found well it didn't work out so

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.190 
that I found well it didn't work out so
I<00:00:11.880> thought<00:00:12.059> hang<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> minute<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I thought hang on a minute what about a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.700 
I thought hang on a minute what about a
broken<00:00:13.880> gel<00:00:14.880> cell<00:00:15.179> 12<00:00:15.540> volt<00:00:15.839> gel<00:00:16.230> battery

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
broken gel cell 12 volt gel battery

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.640 
broken gel cell 12 volt gel battery
which<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.690> which<00:00:18.930> I've<00:00:19.230> taken<00:00:19.380> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
which is this one which I've taken a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.170 
which is this one which I've taken a
power<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> internals<00:00:20.939> there

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
power you can see the internals there

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.560 
power you can see the internals there
and<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.410> two<00:00:22.590> plates<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.660> that<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:25.460> and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
and so with two plates of that side and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.669 
and so with two plates of that side and
I<00:00:28.490> neutralized<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.500> baking<00:00:31.500> soda

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
I neutralized them in some baking soda

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.360 
I neutralized them in some baking soda
and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.790> made<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> album<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.370> distilled

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and then made up the album and distilled

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
and then made up the album and distilled
water<00:00:35.520> mixture<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.020> thing<00:00:37.230> works<00:00:37.469> out

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
water mixture and the thing works out

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.030 
water mixture and the thing works out
really<00:00:37.950> quite<00:00:38.309> well<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> turn<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.570> around

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
really quite well as a turn this around

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.680 
really quite well as a turn this around
you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> brown<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:42.210> developed

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
you can see the brown that's developed

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
you can see the brown that's developed
there<00:00:42.960> no<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:43.920> doing<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.309> moment<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
there no I'm doing at the moment is a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.350 
there no I'm doing at the moment is a
bit<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> test<00:00:46.219> using<00:00:47.219> car<00:00:47.820> battery<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.300> was

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
bit of a test using car battery that was

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.500 
bit of a test using car battery that was
converted<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.870> alum<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> moment

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
converted to alum and at the moment

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.350 
converted to alum and at the moment
there<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.890> run<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> cell<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.399> down<00:00:53.699> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
there is run the cell right down so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.830 
there is run the cell right down so
here's<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.039> little<00:00:56.039> motor<00:00:56.449> that<00:00:57.449> were<00:00:57.570> trying

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
here's a little motor that were trying

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.479 
here's a little motor that were trying
it<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.879> if<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.210> act<00:01:00.390> on

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.950 

I<00:01:03.520> had<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.180> second<00:01:04.740> if<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.920> connect<00:01:06.250> up<00:01:06.960> you'll

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
I had a second if I connect up you'll

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.899 
I had a second if I connect up you'll
see<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:08.740> doesn't<00:01:09.040> do<00:01:09.100> anything<00:01:09.340> it's<00:01:09.760> now

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
see that it doesn't do anything it's now

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.550 
see that it doesn't do anything it's now
flat<00:01:10.240> there's<00:01:10.479> no<00:01:10.570> LED<00:01:10.930> flashing<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:11.440> there's

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
flat there's no LED flashing and there's

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.499 
flat there's no LED flashing and there's
no<00:01:11.650> nothing<00:01:12.270> however<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.909> can<00:01:16.090> supercharge

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
no nothing however you can supercharge

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.990 
no nothing however you can supercharge
these<00:01:17.020> things<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:19.240> I<00:01:20.520> connect<00:01:21.520> up<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.759> the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
these things if I connect up to the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.630 
these things if I connect up to the
battery<00:01:22.180> I'm<00:01:22.659> gonna<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.950> about<00:01:24.130> nine<00:01:24.369> point

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
battery I'm gonna some about nine point

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.399 
battery I'm gonna some about nine point
three<00:01:24.880> volts<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.840> like<00:01:25.960> that<00:01:26.140> because<00:01:26.320> we

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
three volts and I like that because we

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.719 
three volts and I like that because we
use<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.649> battery<00:01:26.979> all<00:01:27.100> yesterday<00:01:27.550> I'm<00:01:27.700> not

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
use the battery all yesterday I'm not

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.870 
use the battery all yesterday I'm not
charged<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.360> off<00:01:28.479> I'm<00:01:28.899> actually<00:01:29.050> charging<00:01:29.649> up

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
charged it off I'm actually charging up

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.399 
charged it off I'm actually charging up
using<00:01:30.880> those<00:01:31.149> panels<00:01:31.540> I'm<00:01:31.840> charging<00:01:32.170> up<00:01:32.290> this

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
using those panels I'm charging up this

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.609 
using those panels I'm charging up this
other<00:01:32.619> battery<00:01:32.979> at<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.070> moment<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.350> if<00:01:35.470> I

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
other battery at the moment so if I

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.040 
other battery at the moment so if I
connect<00:01:36.009> up<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.210> other<00:01:37.330> one<00:01:37.570> about<00:01:37.720> nine

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
connect up to the other one about nine

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.180 
connect up to the other one about nine
point<00:01:38.289> three<00:01:38.380> volts<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.220> what<00:01:42.729> you'll<00:01:42.880> see<00:01:44.190> if

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
point three volts and what you'll see if

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.100 
point three volts and what you'll see if
the<00:01:45.429> gas<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.640> being<00:01:45.850> produced<00:01:46.390> of<00:01:46.840> the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
the gas is being produced of the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.550 
the gas is being produced of the
positive<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.820> mm<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.899> know<00:01:50.050> probably

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
positive which mm you know probably

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.660 
positive which mm you know probably
isn't<00:01:50.740> very<00:01:50.860> safe<00:01:51.130> for<00:01:51.160> it<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.429> bother

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
isn't very safe for it but is bother

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.919 
isn't very safe for it but is bother
this<00:01:54.940> is<00:01:55.090> healthy<00:01:55.450> stuff

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
this is healthy stuff

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.600 
this is healthy stuff
they<00:01:56.229> just<00:01:56.440> let<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.649> do<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> few<00:01:57.190> seconds

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
they just let it do that a few seconds

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.060 
they just let it do that a few seconds
and<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:59.200> we'll<00:01:59.289> try<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.710> motor<00:01:59.890> again

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
and then we'll try it on the motor again

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.760 
and then we'll try it on the motor again
the<00:02:00.729> thing<00:02:00.909> charge<00:02:01.179> is<00:02:01.360> octavo<00:02:01.780> well<00:02:02.470> what<00:02:02.679> is

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
the thing charge is octavo well what is

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.580 
the thing charge is octavo well what is
it<00:02:02.920> about<00:02:03.610> 1.8<00:02:04.330> volts<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.810> then<00:02:04.929> goes<00:02:05.259> down<00:02:05.440> to

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
it about 1.8 volts and then goes down to

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.160 
it about 1.8 volts and then goes down to
about<00:02:05.619> 1.3<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.789> sits<00:02:07.630> there<00:02:07.840> for<00:02:07.869> quite<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
about 1.3 and sits there for quite a

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.810 
about 1.3 and sits there for quite a
while<00:02:08.380> but<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.979> amperage<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.399> pretty<00:02:09.610> good<00:02:09.759> on

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
while but the amperage is pretty good on

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.390 
while but the amperage is pretty good on
the<00:02:10.060> thing<00:02:10.239> about<00:02:10.810> 20<00:02:11.200> milliamps<00:02:11.680> same<00:02:11.860> as<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
the thing about 20 milliamps same as the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.340 
the thing about 20 milliamps same as the
motor<00:02:12.610> was<00:02:12.820> saying<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.810> now<00:02:13.930> I'll<00:02:14.049> disconnect

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
motor was saying so now I'll disconnect

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.850 
motor was saying so now I'll disconnect
that's<00:02:14.829> just<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.070> few<00:02:15.250> seconds<00:02:15.700> oh<00:02:16.530> yeah<00:02:17.530> that's

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
that's just a few seconds oh yeah that's

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.600 
that's just a few seconds oh yeah that's
the<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.720> other<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.680> now<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.519> add

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the one as the other and now we can add

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:31.300 
the one as the other and now we can add
the<00:02:21.700> motor<00:02:23.579> wait<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.610> second<00:02:25.030> ago

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.960 

and<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:32.120> are<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.420> light<00:02:32.569> is<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:32.840> bright

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
and that we are the light is on bright

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.020 
and that we are the light is on bright
you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.000> see<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.819> after<00:02:38.090> we<00:02:38.270> spin<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
you can see and after we spin and the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.940 
you can see and after we spin and the
circuit<00:02:41.480> for<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.780> now<00:02:42.350> it's<00:02:42.590> based<00:02:42.800> on

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
circuit for this now it's based on

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.550 
circuit for this now it's based on
magnet<00:02:43.459> man's<00:02:43.640> idea<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.209> rotor<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.290> it's

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
magnet man's idea of the rotor and it's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.710 
magnet man's idea of the rotor and it's
that<00:02:45.709> circuit<00:02:46.160> there<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:47.060> modified

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
that circuit there it's a modified

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.800 
that circuit there it's a modified
modified<00:02:48.430> self<00:02:49.430> start<00:02:49.730> pulse<00:02:50.000> motor<00:02:50.239> based<00:02:50.569> on

smart creations 20 tons SS 1 CC and with

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.970 
smart creations 20 tons SS 1 CC and with
motors<00:02:55.040> work<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:57.489> now<00:02:58.489> we<00:02:58.550> are<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:58.940> Z<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.980> thought

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
motors work so now we are on Z I thought

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.550 
motors work so now we are on Z I thought
that<00:03:01.130> was<00:03:01.280> ha<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:02.120> rapid<00:03:02.480> charge<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.989> amazing

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
that was ha the rapid charge is amazing

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.229 
that was ha the rapid charge is amazing
now<00:03:04.459> if<00:03:04.519> we<00:03:04.730> go<00:03:04.880> back<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:07.160> which<00:03:08.030> I

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
now if we go back to this which I

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.340 
now if we go back to this which I
thought<00:03:08.450> was<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:08.720> gonna<00:03:08.900> be<00:03:09.019> used<00:03:09.170> for<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
thought was just gonna be used for the

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.590 
thought was just gonna be used for the
plates<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:09.830> know<00:03:09.860> mr.<00:03:10.400> gel<00:03:10.610> cell<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.120> but

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
plates you know mr. gel cell so but

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.009 
plates you know mr. gel cell so but
these<00:03:11.720> white<00:03:12.500> pass<00:03:12.769> here<00:03:13.570> we're<00:03:14.570> all<00:03:14.720> dried<00:03:14.989> up

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
these white pass here we're all dried up

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.479 
these white pass here we're all dried up
and<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.440> thought<00:03:15.590> what<00:03:15.739> about<00:03:15.769> converting<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
and I thought what about converting the

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.020 
and I thought what about converting the
whole<00:03:16.670> thing<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.300> Alan<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:17.989> this<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.440> sitting

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
whole thing to Alan so this is sitting

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.690 
whole thing to Alan so this is sitting
in<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.150> bath<00:03:20.360> there<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.920> element<00:03:22.370> distilled

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
in a bath there of element distilled

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.500 
in a bath there of element distilled
water<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.970> might<00:03:26.150> have<00:03:26.239> seen<00:03:26.390> the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
water and you might have seen the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.790 
water and you might have seen the
picture<00:03:26.810> I'll<00:03:26.900> I'll<00:03:27.110> post<00:03:27.319> at<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.500> end<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.739> the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
picture I'll I'll post at the end of the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.620 
picture I'll I'll post at the end of the
video<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.670> there<00:03:28.790> was<00:03:28.940> there's<00:03:29.360> nothing

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
video that there was there's nothing

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.570 
video that there was there's nothing
left<00:03:29.780> on<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.110> ok<00:03:30.319> if<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.680> really<00:03:30.860> wanna<00:03:31.040> blocking

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
left on it ok if I really wanna blocking

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.870 
left on it ok if I really wanna blocking
off<00:03:31.670> side<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.950> now<00:03:34.180> four<00:03:35.180> point<00:03:35.420> four<00:03:35.600> volts<00:03:36.880> so

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
off side so now four point four volts so

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.789 
off side so now four point four volts so
this<00:03:38.060> thing<00:03:39.040> appears<00:03:40.040> to<00:03:40.220> be<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.720> rejuvenated

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
this thing appears to be a rejuvenated

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.830 
this thing appears to be a rejuvenated
gel<00:03:42.799> cell<00:03:43.100> battery<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.209> I've<00:03:44.299> not<00:03:44.450> seen<00:03:44.660> one

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
gel cell battery and I've not seen one

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.930 
gel cell battery and I've not seen one
Don<00:03:45.110> so<00:03:45.950> what<00:03:46.100> I'm<00:03:46.190> gonna<00:03:46.340> do<00:03:46.579> is<00:03:46.760> I'm<00:03:46.850> gonna

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
Don so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.479 
Don so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
cover<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.450> pieces<00:03:48.010> put<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.130> pieces<00:03:49.310> back

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
cover the pieces put the pieces back

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.690 
cover the pieces put the pieces back
onto<00:03:49.880> him<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.500> seal<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.650> up<00:03:51.860> glue<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.579> or

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
onto him and seal it up glue it or

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.720 
onto him and seal it up glue it or
whichever<00:03:53.090> way<00:03:53.239> around<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:54.700> hopefully<00:03:55.700> I

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
whichever way around and hopefully I

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.370 
whichever way around and hopefully I
will<00:03:55.850> return<00:03:56.180> battery<00:03:56.750> at<00:03:56.840> least<00:03:57.049> give<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.320> a

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
will return battery at least give it a

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.400 
will return battery at least give it a
try<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:59.239> there<00:03:59.390> we<00:03:59.480> ice<00:03:59.600> back<00:03:59.930> up<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.200> four

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
try so there we ice back up to four

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.830 
try so there we ice back up to four
point<00:04:00.650> 4<00:04:00.829> volts

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.520 

oh<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.180> just<00:04:07.330> to<00:04:07.390> prove<00:04:07.630> that<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:07.989> battery

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
oh and just to prove that this battery

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.040 
oh and just to prove that this battery
does<00:04:08.680> have<00:04:08.860> something<00:04:09.190> about<00:04:09.280> it

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
does have something about it

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.580 
does have something about it
well<00:04:11.050> connect<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.470> up<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.680> Volta<00:04:16.350> now<00:04:17.350> yeah

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
well connect it up to the Volta now yeah

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.340 
well connect it up to the Volta now yeah
the<00:04:18.070> lights<00:04:18.280> on

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
the lights on

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.770 
the lights on
listen<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:20.470> thing<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:25.480> powerful

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
listen to that thing that is so powerful

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.960 
listen to that thing that is so powerful
now<00:04:26.200> by<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.040> way<00:04:27.130> this<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.490> connection

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
now by the way this is the connection

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:36.240 
now by the way this is the connection
side<00:04:28.360> oh<00:04:28.720> well<00:04:29.260> see<00:04:31.440> it's<00:04:32.440> too<00:04:32.620> powerful<00:04:35.250> proof

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
side oh well see it's too powerful proof

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.760 
side oh well see it's too powerful proof
enough<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.700> hope<00:04:36.850> now<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.990> gel<00:04:38.200> cell<00:04:38.410> can<00:04:38.620> be

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
enough I hope now the gel cell can be

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.129 
enough I hope now the gel cell can be
brought<00:04:38.979> back<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.460> yeah<00:04:40.419> this<00:04:40.630> on<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.930> side

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
brought back and yeah this on this side

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.280 
brought back and yeah this on this side
here<00:04:41.350> is<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.950> charge<00:04:42.190> port<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.020> your<00:04:44.020> charge
