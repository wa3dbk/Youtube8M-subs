to say Tampa Bay wins the game outright
but<00:02:28.189> i<00:02:28.250> think<00:02:28.489> they<00:02:28.609> stay<00:02:28.849> within<00:02:29.060> seven

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
but i think they stay within seven

but i think they stay within seven
points<00:02:29.569> their<00:02:29.989> defense<00:02:30.349> is<00:02:30.530> playing<00:02:30.650> pretty

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069

they're<00:02:37.310> often<00:02:37.670> struggled<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.209> little<00:02:38.359> bit<00:02:38.629> I

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
they're often struggled a little bit I

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.720 
they're often struggled a little bit I
think<00:02:39.439> you're<00:02:39.530> looking<00:02:39.799> at<00:02:39.889> a<00:02:39.950> lower<00:02:40.159> scoring

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
think you're looking at a lower scoring

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.140 
think you're looking at a lower scoring
game<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.090> think<00:02:41.239> you're<00:02:41.450> going<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:41.629> see<00:02:41.689> a<00:02:41.870> 20-17

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
game I think you're going to see a 20-17

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.490 
game I think you're going to see a 20-17
one<00:02:44.150> way<00:02:44.329> or<00:02:44.510> another<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.900> think<00:02:45.019> it's<00:02:45.290> gonna<00:02:45.409> be

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
one way or another I think it's gonna be

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.990 
one way or another I think it's gonna be
a<00:02:45.530> lower<00:02:45.709> scoring<00:02:45.980> game<00:02:46.189> I<00:02:46.220> think<00:02:46.400> Tampa<00:02:46.879> Bay

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
a lower scoring game I think Tampa Bay

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.210 
a lower scoring game I think Tampa Bay

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
always tough to go on the road in Denver

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.920 
always tough to go on the road in Denver
and<00:02:55.280> you're<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.849> against<00:02:56.269> Peyton<00:02:56.569> Manning

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
and you're going against Peyton Manning

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.750 
and you're going against Peyton Manning
and<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.109> Broncos<00:02:57.349> have<00:02:57.799> a<00:02:57.889> great<00:02:58.129> defense<00:02:58.340> so

and the Broncos have a great defense so
that<00:02:59.150> makes<00:02:59.389> me<00:02:59.540> nervous<00:02:59.659> as<00:02:59.959> well<00:03:00.109> right<00:03:00.379> I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
that makes me nervous as well right I

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.649 
that makes me nervous as well right I
think<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:01.519> fair<00:03:01.700> points<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.209> do<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.389> think

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
think it's fair points I do I think

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.149 
think it's fair points I do I think
they're<00:03:02.810> fair<00:03:03.019> points<00:03:03.409> there<00:03:03.560> i<00:03:03.590> think<00:03:03.950> i

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
they're fair points there i think i

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.890 
they're fair points there i think i
think<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.669> way<00:03:04.760> Greg<00:03:05.030> Schiano<00:03:05.329> has<00:03:05.569> his<00:03:05.689> team

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
think the way Greg Schiano has his team

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.119 
think the way Greg Schiano has his team
built<00:03:06.109> in<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.379> way<00:03:06.530> they're<00:03:06.709> playing<00:03:06.859> they're

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
built in the way they're playing they're

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.860 
built in the way they're playing they're
not<00:03:07.250> built<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.639> get<00:03:07.790> blown<00:03:07.970> out<00:03:08.180> right<00:03:08.629> they're

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
not built to get blown out right they're

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.509 
not built to get blown out right they're
built<00:03:09.109> to<00:03:09.200> play<00:03:09.439> games<00:03:09.739> close<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.400> they've

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
built to play games close and they've

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:11.949 
built to play games close and they've
been<00:03:10.669> pulling<00:03:10.909> out<00:03:11.090> close<00:03:11.359> games<00:03:11.689> all<00:03:11.930> year

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
been pulling out close games all year

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.899 
been pulling out close games all year
like<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:12.829> said<00:03:12.919> I<00:03:13.099> don't<00:03:13.489> think<00:03:13.760> they

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
like I said I don't think they

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.699 
like I said I don't think they
necessarily<00:03:14.060> win<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:14.870> game<00:03:15.049> outright<00:03:15.319> but<00:03:15.650> I

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
necessarily win this game outright but I

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.869 
necessarily win this game outright but I
think<00:03:15.949> you're<00:03:16.069> looking<00:03:16.159> at<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.430> doc<00:03:16.639> but<00:03:16.819> I

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
think you're looking at a doc but I

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.819 
think you're looking at a doc but I
think<00:03:17.090> Tampa<00:03:17.419> Bay<00:03:17.569> establishes<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.409> run<00:03:18.590> game

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
think Tampa Bay establishes the run game

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.860 
think Tampa Bay establishes the run game
a<00:03:18.859> little<00:03:19.099> bit<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.819> know<00:03:19.849> Denver<00:03:20.329> can<00:03:20.540> give<00:03:20.750> up

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
a little bit you know Denver can give up

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.680 
a little bit you know Denver can give up
can<00:03:21.319> give<00:03:21.440> up<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:22.090> lot<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.209> yards<00:03:23.449> on<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.659> ground

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
can give up a lot of yards on the ground

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.869 
can give up a lot of yards on the ground
and<00:03:24.169> you<00:03:24.409> know<00:03:24.530> what<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.889> gaze<00:03:25.099> out<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.519> think

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
and you know what the gaze out I think

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.280 
and you know what the gaze out I think
Denver<00:03:26.060> struggles<00:03:26.540> will<00:03:26.629> move<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> ball<00:03:27.079> kind

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
Denver struggles will move the ball kind

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.020 
Denver struggles will move the ball kind
of<00:03:27.409> makes<00:03:27.590> them<00:03:27.739> somewhat<00:03:28.069> on<00:03:28.250> dimensional<00:03:28.819> we

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
of makes them somewhat on dimensional we

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.640 
of makes them somewhat on dimensional we
saw<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.359> against<00:03:29.659> Kansas<00:03:29.959> City<00:03:30.139> when<00:03:30.349> Peyton

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
saw that against Kansas City when Peyton

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.170 
saw that against Kansas City when Peyton
becomes<00:03:31.010> one-dimensional<00:03:31.819> it's<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.000> little

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
becomes one-dimensional it's a little

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.640 
becomes one-dimensional it's a little
bit<00:03:32.299> tougher<00:03:32.449> for<00:03:32.750> them<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.989> put<00:03:33.169> up<00:03:33.260> 30<00:03:33.560> points

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
bit tougher for them to put up 30 points

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.159 
bit tougher for them to put up 30 points
i<00:03:34.010> think<00:03:34.159> that<00:03:34.280> when<00:03:34.459> they<00:03:34.549> put<00:03:34.819> 17<00:03:35.810> against

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
i think that when they put 17 against

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.199 
i think that when they put 17 against
Kansas<00:03:36.500> City<00:03:36.709> last<00:03:36.919> week<00:03:37.159> in<00:03:37.310> Kansas<00:03:37.819> City<00:03:38.060> is

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
Kansas City last week in Kansas City is

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.240 
Kansas City last week in Kansas City is
terrible<00:03:38.629> yeah<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.049> think<00:03:39.169> Tampa<00:03:39.650> Bay<00:03:39.799> comes<00:03:40.099> in

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
terrible yeah I think Tampa Bay comes in

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.800 
terrible yeah I think Tampa Bay comes in
and<00:03:40.400> test<00:03:40.609> is<00:03:40.790> Denver<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.180> think<00:03:41.479> they<00:03:41.569> stay

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
and test is Denver I think they stay

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.899 
and test is Denver I think they stay
within<00:03:41.989> that<00:03:42.199> seven<00:03:42.590> points<00:03:42.919> okay<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.639> like<00:03:43.790> I

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
within that seven points okay and like I

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:44.949 
within that seven points okay and like I
said<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.150> beginning<00:03:44.389> of<00:03:44.449> the<00:03:44.510> call<00:03:44.659> it<00:03:44.840> is
