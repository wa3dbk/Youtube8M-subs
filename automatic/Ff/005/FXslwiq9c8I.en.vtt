to<00:00:06.519> everybody<00:00:06.700> it's<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:07.509> drill<00:00:07.750> that<00:00:07.779> I've<00:00:07.960> been

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:08.049 
to everybody it's a drill that I've been

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:09.750 
to everybody it's a drill that I've been
doing<00:00:08.139> it<00:00:08.290> for<00:00:08.320> last<00:00:08.530> year<00:00:08.740> or<00:00:08.830> so<00:00:09.040> I<00:00:09.309> start<00:00:09.670> my

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
doing it for last year or so I start my

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.799 
doing it for last year or so I start my
training<00:00:09.969> with<00:00:10.209> it

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
training with it

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.840 
training with it
I<00:00:10.840> make<00:00:11.709> herself<00:00:11.860> do<00:00:12.129> it<00:00:12.279> to<00:00:12.400> like<00:00:12.490> get<00:00:12.670> under

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
I make herself do it to like get under

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.670 
I make herself do it to like get under
ten<00:00:13.029> seconds<00:00:13.389> and<00:00:13.570> then<00:00:14.170> I<00:00:14.199> move<00:00:14.410> on<00:00:14.500> to<00:00:14.619> the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
ten seconds and then I move on to the

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680 
ten seconds and then I move on to the
rest<00:00:14.799> of<00:00:14.949> my<00:00:15.039> training<00:00:15.580> day<00:00:15.760> I<00:00:16.029> think<00:00:16.510> it's<00:00:16.630> a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:16.690 
rest of my training day I think it's a

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.300 
rest of my training day I think it's a
practical<00:00:17.529> because<00:00:17.740> it<00:00:17.920> makes<00:00:18.070> you<00:00:18.160> actually

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
practical because it makes you actually

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.859 
practical because it makes you actually
mount<00:00:18.640> and<00:00:18.820> dismount<00:00:18.849> the<00:00:19.210> gun<00:00:19.359> several<00:00:19.660> times

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
mount and dismount the gun several times

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.650 
mount and dismount the gun several times
shoot<00:00:20.529> targets<00:00:20.890> that<00:00:20.949> react<00:00:21.279> load<00:00:22.029> it<00:00:22.210> it's

plate load for shoot two plates for
shoot<00:00:36.760> two<00:00:36.940> plates<00:00:37.210> load<00:00:37.750> for<00:00:38.050> sure<00:00:38.560> so<00:00:39.040> you've

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
shoot two plates load for sure so you've

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.030 
shoot two plates load for sure so you've
loaded<00:00:39.430> 12<00:00:40.030> rounds<00:00:40.420> shot<00:00:40.840> six<00:00:41.170> started<00:00:41.950> with

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
loaded 12 rounds shot six started with

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.350 
loaded 12 rounds shot six started with
two<00:00:42.160> rounds<00:00:42.430> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.550> gun<00:00:42.700> you<00:00:42.940> wind<00:00:43.150> up<00:00:43.240> with

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
two rounds of the gun you wind up with

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.700 
two rounds of the gun you wind up with
eight<00:00:43.570> so<00:00:43.900> you<00:00:43.960> need<00:00:44.110> a<00:00:44.140> middle<00:00:44.380> of<00:00:44.470> an<00:00:44.560> eight

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
eight so you need a middle of an eight

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.270 
eight so you need a middle of an eight
round<00:00:44.920> two<00:00:45.130> let's<00:00:45.690> use<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:46.890> judge<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.070> gear

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
round two let's use it to judge the gear

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.610 
round two let's use it to judge the gear
judge<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.850> technique<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:50.320> out<00:00:50.440> of<00:00:50.560> our

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
judge the technique get out of our

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.620 
judge the technique get out of our
basements<00:00:51.190> get<00:00:51.700> out<00:00:51.820> of<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:51.970> garage<00:00:52.120> get<00:00:52.570> out

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
basements get out of the garage get out

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.300 
basements get out of the garage get out
the<00:00:52.840> rage<00:00:53.050> actually<00:00:53.710> shoot<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.130> see<00:00:54.220> what

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
the rage actually shoot and see what

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.010 
the rage actually shoot and see what
happens<00:00:54.490> when<00:00:54.580> you<00:00:54.640> fire<00:00:54.820> live<00:00:55.060> rounds<00:00:55.090> and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
happens when you fire live rounds and

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.450 
happens when you fire live rounds and
load<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.410> gun<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.560> keep<00:00:56.800> fire<00:00:57.130> because<00:00:57.400> you

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
load the gun and keep fire because you

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.740 
load the gun and keep fire because you
got<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.580> mountain<00:00:57.760> dismount<00:00:58.270> together<00:00:58.540> that's

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
got a mountain dismount together that's

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.030 
got a mountain dismount together that's
a<00:00:58.780> little<00:00:58.930> more<00:00:59.050> practical<00:00:59.380> kind<00:00:59.860> of<00:00:59.920> more

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
a little more practical kind of more

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.380 
a little more practical kind of more
like<00:01:00.070> what<00:01:00.310> we<00:01:00.400> do<00:01:00.520> in<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.640> match<00:01:00.820> we're<00:01:01.330> not

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
like what we do in a match we're not

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.850 
like what we do in a match we're not
moving<00:01:01.570> but<00:01:02.020> then<00:01:02.410> again<00:01:02.500> one<00:01:02.740> more

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
moving but then again one more

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.770 
moving but then again one more
standardized<00:01:03.310> test<00:01:03.580> all<00:01:04.059> right<00:01:04.239> I'm<00:01:04.600> not

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
standardized test all right I'm not

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.910 
standardized test all right I'm not
saying<00:01:04.960> on<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.110> best<00:01:05.290> of<00:01:05.379> this<00:01:05.500> I'm<00:01:05.710> saying

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
saying on the best of this I'm saying

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.190 
saying on the best of this I'm saying
that<00:01:06.100> I'm<00:01:06.340> testing<00:01:06.609> my<00:01:06.880> gear<00:01:07.149> this<00:01:07.270> way<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:08.049> if

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
that I'm testing my gear this way and if

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.719 
that I'm testing my gear this way and if
we<00:01:08.259> kind<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.439> have<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> standardized<00:01:09.009> test<00:01:09.249> guys

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
we kind of have a standardized test guys

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.520 
we kind of have a standardized test guys
get<00:01:09.939> out<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.060> basements<00:01:10.539> and<00:01:10.659> stuff<00:01:10.810> start

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
get out of basements and stuff start

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.989 
get out of basements and stuff start
shooting<00:01:11.799> some<00:01:11.890> live<00:01:12.070> ammo<00:01:12.280> maybe<00:01:12.759> some<00:01:12.939> of

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:12.999 
shooting some live ammo maybe some of

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.770 
shooting some live ammo maybe some of
these<00:01:13.060> techniques<00:01:13.299> just<00:01:13.450> going<00:01:13.630> to<00:01:13.689> blow

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
these techniques just going to blow

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.149 
these techniques just going to blow
everybody<00:01:14.049> else's<00:01:14.259> away<00:01:14.409> maybe<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.039> new<00:01:15.130> a

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
everybody else's away maybe a new a

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.770 
everybody else's away maybe a new a
dilution<00:01:15.460> gear<00:01:15.880> will<00:01:16.210> really<00:01:16.509> set<00:01:16.689> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
dilution gear will really set the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.090 
dilution gear will really set the
standard<00:01:16.929> and<00:01:17.350> of<00:01:17.590> course<00:01:17.770> we're<00:01:17.890> all<00:01:17.950> going

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
standard and of course we're all going

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.069 
standard and of course we're all going
to<00:01:18.159> go<00:01:18.249> to<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.460> right<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.149> this<00:01:19.719> is<00:01:19.840> more<00:01:20.020> of

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
to go to that right so this is more of

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.719 
to go to that right so this is more of
an<00:01:20.140> informational<00:01:20.259> thing<00:01:20.619> I'm<00:01:21.249> not<00:01:21.429> trying<00:01:21.670> to

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
an informational thing I'm not trying to

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.090 
an informational thing I'm not trying to
say<00:01:21.909> that<00:01:22.390> any<00:01:23.140> based<00:01:23.319> techniques<00:01:23.649> good<00:01:23.890> bad

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
say that any based techniques good bad

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.649 
say that any based techniques good bad
or<00:01:24.130> different<00:01:24.609> just<00:01:25.090> get<00:01:25.210> out<00:01:25.329> there<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.509> do

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
or different just get out there and do
