use our superior qualities made for
abrasion<00:00:32.730> resistance<00:00:33.330> and<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.080> color<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.410> tan

all<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.550> through<00:00:35.580> the<00:00:35.940> weather<00:00:36.290> we<00:00:37.290> could

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
all the way through the weather we could

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650 
all the way through the weather we could
talk<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.769> day<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:37.920> quality<00:00:38.699> but<00:00:39.330> I<00:00:39.360> think

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
talk all day about quality but I think

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
talk all day about quality but I think
when<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.440> gets<00:00:40.680> down<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.949> it<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.640> best<00:00:41.850> thing

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
when it gets down to it the best thing

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.520 
when it gets down to it the best thing
that<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.300> describe<00:00:42.479> our<00:00:42.750> quality<00:00:43.080> is<00:00:43.199> just<00:00:43.350> by

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that can describe our quality is just by

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
that can describe our quality is just by
asking<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.220> your<00:00:44.370> buddies<00:00:44.550> how<00:00:44.820> long<00:00:45.000> he's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
asking one of your buddies how long he's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.770 
asking one of your buddies how long he's
had<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.360> jacket<00:00:45.839> I<00:00:46.080> think<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:48.150> greatest<00:00:48.479> thing

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
had a jacket I think the greatest thing

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
had a jacket I think the greatest thing
that<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.049> can<00:00:49.199> pay<00:00:49.350> attention<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.159> new

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that we can pay attention to is new

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.789 
that we can pay attention to is new
innovation<00:00:51.059> new<00:00:51.239> technology<00:00:52.019> there<00:00:52.650> was<00:00:52.769> a

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
innovation new technology there was a

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.649 
innovation new technology there was a
lot<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.040> discussion<00:00:53.580> around<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:54.150> do<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.420> build

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
lot of discussion around how do we build

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:57.110 
lot of discussion around how do we build
reflectivity<00:00:55.440> into<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> jacket<00:00:56.519> for<00:00:56.670> example

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
reflectivity into a jacket for example

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.149 
reflectivity into a jacket for example
that's<00:00:57.720> right<00:00:58.019> for<00:00:58.229> the<00:00:58.290> brand<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.830> that

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
that's right for the brand and that

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.950 
that's right for the brand and that
conveys<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.909> our<00:01:00.150> writers<00:01:00.510> want

conveys the look that our writers want
to<00:01:01.080> wear<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.250> started<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.119> build<00:01:03.629> custom

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
to wear so we started to build custom

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.219 
to wear so we started to build custom
colorized<00:01:04.830> reflective<00:01:05.700> material<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:07.110> we

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
colorized reflective material what we

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
colorized reflective material what we
came<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> find<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.070> our<00:01:08.580> customers<00:01:09.060> not

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
came to find is that our customers not

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.710 
came to find is that our customers not
only<00:01:09.659> wanted<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.290> wanted<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.720> we

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
only wanted it they wanted more of it we

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.609 
only wanted it they wanted more of it we
are<00:01:13.440> true<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:14.070> heritage<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.030> merge<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
are true to our heritage the merge of

are true to our heritage the merge of
technology<00:01:16.619> functionality<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.840> goes

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
technology functionality then it goes

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.170 
technology functionality then it goes
through<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> filter<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.100> how<00:01:20.789> can<00:01:20.909> we<00:01:20.939> make<00:01:21.149> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
through the filter of how can we make it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.440 
through the filter of how can we make it
better<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.810> how<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.829> it<00:01:22.859> different

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
better and how can we do it different

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.419 
better and how can we do it different
and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.539> think<00:01:24.750> about<00:01:24.960> being<00:01:25.649> at<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.799> rally<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
and I think about being at a rally and

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.730 
and I think about being at a rally and
you<00:01:26.670> know<00:01:26.789> having<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.420> woman<00:01:28.170> come<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.590> me

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.399 
and say thank you so much for making the
waist<00:01:31.619> adjustable<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.820> jacket<00:01:33.409> just

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
waist adjustable on this jacket just

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.919 
waist adjustable on this jacket just
very<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:35.460> different<00:01:35.850> styling<00:01:36.570> from<00:01:36.780> where

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
very very different styling from where

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.770 
very very different styling from where
we<00:01:37.049> were<00:01:37.259> how<00:01:37.979> many<00:01:38.130> years<00:01:38.340> ago<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:38.909> women's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
we were how many years ago where women's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.679 
we were how many years ago where women's
were<00:01:39.899> just<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> downsized<00:01:40.859> version<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.369> men's

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
were just a downsized version of men's

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
were just a downsized version of men's
so<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.020> power<00:01:43.259> stretch<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.039> side

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
so we have power stretch we have side

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
so we have power stretch we have side
panels<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.939> contour<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> sides<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.990> her
