00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
wool jungle biome suborning on it's very

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.209 
wool jungle biome suborning on it's very
nice<00:00:53.989> you'd<00:00:54.989> use<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.500> word<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.640> let's<00:00:58.219> let's

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
nice you'd use this word so let's let's

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.380 
nice you'd use this word so let's let's
fly<00:01:00.260> find<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.100> flat<00:01:02.370> place<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:03.270> be

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
fly find a kind of flat place will be

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.519 
fly find a kind of flat place will be
easier<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:04.039> okay<00:01:05.039> see<00:01:05.880> ya<00:01:06.719> under<00:01:07.319> sound

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:07.529 
easier there okay see ya under sound

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:15.550 
easier there okay see ya under sound
just<00:01:08.399> there<00:01:08.609> so<00:01:09.359> if<00:01:09.509> we<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:11.189> dig<00:01:12.439> one<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.709> and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
just there so if we you dig one down and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.870 
just there so if we you dig one down and
next<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.679> it<00:01:16.709> you<00:01:16.979> take<00:01:17.959> two<00:01:18.959> down<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.880> another

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
next to it you take two down and another

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.879 
next to it you take two down and another
to<00:01:21.119> drown<00:01:21.359> so<00:01:21.959> you're<00:01:22.109> gonna<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.319> glow<00:01:22.649> stone

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889 
to drown so you're gonna need glow stone

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:25.069 
to drown so you're gonna need glow stone
for<00:01:23.099> this

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
for this

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.499 
for this
let's<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.920> close<00:01:26.249> to<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:27.770> blue<00:01:28.770> stone<00:01:29.419> so<00:01:30.419> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
let's get close to up blue stone so you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.859 
let's get close to up blue stone so you
put<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> place<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> two<00:01:32.039> glowstone<00:01:32.849> up<00:01:33.389> there

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
put the place the two glowstone up there

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.999 
put the place the two glowstone up there
then<00:01:35.749> he<00:01:36.749> put<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.969> yeah<00:01:38.969> it's<00:01:39.389> one<00:01:39.539> down<00:01:39.749> and

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
then he put one yeah it's one down and

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.870 
then he put one yeah it's one down and
you<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.249> your<00:01:41.700> sticky<00:01:42.090> pistons<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
you get your sticky pistons and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.389 
you get your sticky pistons and
obviously<00:01:45.679> place<00:01:46.679> it<00:01:47.509> towards<00:01:49.639> right<00:01:52.279> you<00:01:53.279> can

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
obviously place it towards right you can

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.219 
obviously place it towards right you can
just<00:01:53.549> fill<00:01:53.669> that<00:01:53.819> back<00:01:54.029> up<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:55.369> cobble<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
just fill that back up with cobble and

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.109 
just fill that back up with cobble and
then<00:01:58.309> basically<00:01:59.309> what<00:01:59.459> you<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.789> is<00:02:00.829> you<00:02:01.829> get

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
then basically what you do is you get

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.130 
then basically what you do is you get
redstone<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.249> have<00:02:05.639> got

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
redstone which I have got

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:19.210 
redstone which I have got
here<00:02:07.950> lips<00:02:08.759> paper<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:15.780> do<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.110> for<00:02:16.260> you

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.190 
there we go so you put the leave it
there<00:02:37.760> see<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.850> works<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.440> get<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:40.980> and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
there see it works so you get in and

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.840 
there see it works so you get in and
tooms<00:02:43.970> underground<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.530> lava<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.580 

haven't<00:02:50.850> explored<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.390> was<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> new<00:02:51.989> world<00:02:52.200> so

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
haven't explored it was a new world so

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.340 
haven't explored it was a new world so
and<00:02:53.400> obviously<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:54.060> change<00:02:54.330> places<00:02:54.660> it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
and obviously you can change places it

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.540 
and obviously you can change places it
doesn't<00:02:55.620> always<00:02:55.739> have<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.220> desert

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
doesn't always have to be in desert

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.120 
doesn't always have to be in desert
biome<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.880> can<00:02:57.030> be<00:02:57.120> anywhere<00:02:57.530> yeah<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.830> well

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
biome it can be anywhere yeah so well

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.840 
biome it can be anywhere yeah so well
there's<00:02:59.400> no<00:02:59.519> caves<00:02:59.910> around<00:03:00.090> here<00:03:00.709> whoo<00:03:01.850> yeah

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
there's no caves around here whoo yeah

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.990 
there's no caves around here whoo yeah
so<00:03:03.120> that's<00:03:03.360> basically<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.470> just<00:03:05.459> try

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
so that's basically I do it and just try

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.790 
so that's basically I do it and just try
to<00:03:06.620> press<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.769> again<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:08.340> out<00:03:08.519> yeah
