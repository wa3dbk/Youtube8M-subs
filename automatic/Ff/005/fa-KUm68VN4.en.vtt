00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
like that for jet mode obviously but

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.330 
like that for jet mode obviously but
there's<00:01:39.610> this<00:01:39.729> basic<00:01:39.909> jet<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.530> transform<00:01:42.100> him

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
there's this basic jet to transform him

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.950 
there's this basic jet to transform him
to<00:01:42.549> robot<00:01:42.880> mode<00:01:42.909> you<00:01:43.210> flip<00:01:43.390> up<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.630> landing

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
to robot mode you flip up the landing

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.920 
to robot mode you flip up the landing
gear<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.630> take<00:01:47.310> these<00:01:48.310> arms<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
gear and you take these arms and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.990 
gear and you take these arms and
underneath<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.189> take<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.520> arms<00:01:51.820> and<00:01:51.939> you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
underneath you take the arms and you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.639 
underneath you take the arms and you
flip<00:01:52.210> them<00:01:52.360> up<00:01:52.479> like<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.700> rotate<00:01:55.320> again<00:01:56.320> up

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
flip them up like so rotate again up

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.520 
flip them up like so rotate again up
like<00:01:56.920> this<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:01.090> lift<00:02:01.300> up<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.659> piece<00:02:01.929> and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
like this you lift up this piece and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.690 
like this you lift up this piece and
flip<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:03.520> down<00:02:03.819> I<00:02:04.890> split<00:02:05.890> these<00:02:06.069> pieces<00:02:06.429> up

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
flip this down I split these pieces up

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.449 
flip this down I split these pieces up
to<00:02:06.819> form<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.210> chest<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:09.069> hook<00:02:09.250> comes

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
to form the chest and this hook comes

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.009 
to form the chest and this hook comes
down<00:02:09.610> forms<00:02:10.030> his<00:02:10.119> torso<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.810> piece

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
down forms his torso and that piece

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.229 
down forms his torso and that piece
flips<00:02:11.410> down<00:02:11.980> like<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> head<00:02:15.250> you

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
flips down like so then the head you

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:22.289 
flips down like so then the head you
turn<00:02:16.480> around<00:02:18.720> back<00:02:19.720> piece<00:02:20.049> pulls<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:21.299> flips

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
turn around back piece pulls up flips

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.920 
turn around back piece pulls up flips
and<00:02:22.569> tabs<00:02:23.260> into<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> back<00:02:23.920> there<00:02:24.780> then<00:02:25.780> you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
and tabs into the back there then you

couldn't get rid of that for

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.770 
couldn't get rid of that for
transformation<00:02:44.769> reasons<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:45.640> underneath<00:02:45.940> he

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
transformation reasons but underneath he

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.620 
transformation reasons but underneath he
does<00:02:46.959> have<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.230> newly<00:02:47.650> sculpted<00:02:48.359> dread<00:02:49.359> wind

head<00:02:49.959> which<00:02:50.560> also<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.040> very<00:02:51.609> much<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:52.019> I've

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
head which also I very much like I've

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.460 
head which also I very much like I've
rarely<00:02:53.620> ever<00:02:54.010> have<00:02:54.280> him<00:02:54.430> wear<00:02:54.579> this<00:02:54.730> helmet

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470

when<00:02:56.470> it's<00:02:56.590> not<00:02:56.769> on<00:02:56.980> his<00:02:57.160> head<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.430> usually<00:02:58.000> flip

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
when it's not on his head I usually flip

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.170 
when it's not on his head I usually flip
the<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.620> they<00:02:59.739> face<00:02:59.950> back<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.579> it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the can so they face back and it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.660 
the can so they face back and it
perfectly<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:01.959> tabs<00:03:02.310> right<00:03:03.310> onto<00:03:03.579> this

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
perfectly just tabs right onto this

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.610 
perfectly just tabs right onto this
little<00:03:03.850> hinge<00:03:04.120> holds<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.840> right<00:03:04.989> there<00:03:05.230> and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
little hinge holds it right there and

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.560 
little hinge holds it right there and
one<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.579> interesting<00:03:06.940> things<00:03:07.150> about<00:03:07.239> that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
one of the interesting things about that

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.740 
one of the interesting things about that
is<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.810> never<00:03:08.200> even<00:03:08.350> knew<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:09.510> until<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.540> was

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
is I never even knew this until I was

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.030 
is I never even knew this until I was
just<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.019> other<00:03:11.109> day<00:03:11.200> as<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.620> were<00:03:11.650> unpacking

exactly<00:03:23.170> where<00:03:23.590> as<00:03:23.680> helmets<00:03:23.859> it's<00:03:24.190> he

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
exactly where as helmets it's he

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.559 
exactly where as helmets it's he
actually<00:03:24.639> has<00:03:24.790> these<00:03:24.970> two<00:03:25.150> little<00:03:25.180> guns

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
actually has these two little guns

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.229 
actually has these two little guns
behind<00:03:25.810> his<00:03:26.109> head<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.980> I<00:03:27.250> was<00:03:27.579> very<00:03:27.910> happy<00:03:28.209> to

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
has a super robot mode where you just

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.710 
has a super robot mode where you just
reattach<00:03:50.610> these<00:03:51.030> launchers<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:53.100> his<00:03:53.250> forearms
