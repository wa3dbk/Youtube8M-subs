00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.480
 And then there is the sole moderator of the group and 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.960
 in this video I'm trying to clarify 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 some doubts the staff have about the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 arby's how to save and how to power 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.340
 have a much nicer game without 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.340
 surprises 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.750
 many people wonder what they can 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.960
 improve in game how can have a game 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 easier and how you can have a match 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 a little more aggressive and with no surprises 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.420
 and saving is a good answer, right? 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.460
 is going to give is something a little more 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.040
 complicated that is not simply you 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.739
 go to the mall and buy bad 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.080
 you need a little more 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.800
 knowledge and know exactly where 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.909
 You must wait, let's start with 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.400
 top line 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.949
 the top line you will have two places that 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.740
 you must always have a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.979
 place to mention the blue team that is this 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.310
 a place in the Russian team that is this is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.890
 keeping the river guarded you will have the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.409
 control of almost the entire map and are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.380
 four inputs or four outputs of the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.049
 that you see to control the river and a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.890
 these entries will always be made by 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.530
 you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.140
 You have to be careful a little with 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.509
 the top line to avoid a bit of field 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.990
 and especially if your team's django 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.840
 it was a dialogue that jumps if they high or 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.810
 if he has or bid dominates and in his 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.020
 line does not come out of it so it would 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.289
 You put an art in the bushes in daycare. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.289
 also 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.080
 Good. Let's go now for neither me nor 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.000
 there are two places that are very 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.000
 important and awaited the first 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.460
 This is where the second place is here. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.100
 underneath you keep in these two places 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.800
 you will not have any 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.410
 surprise at the gain you make. 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.050
 will be with a very big vision 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.540
 given the river 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.420
 and you have enough time 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.520
 to go backward or forward 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.580
 depending on the drawer of both if you have 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.180
 singing you as the lowest gap to 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 you have enough time to 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.850
 prepare for gain and not only does this have a 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.390
 seed also that these two paths 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.900
 here both above and below 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.350
 they are very important for hangu 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.110
 is invading your lenny or soy 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.640
 django or out of it and this view 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.340
 It's very important for your team. 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.980
 now abbott lenny abbott lenny she has 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.769
 You'll have to put two guards. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.230
 you are on a blue team and 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.489
 only one if you're on the team 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.590
 purple 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.670
 If you're on the blue team you have to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.220
 save here and up here 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.790
 keeping these two languages ​​you go 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.760
 have completely saved the entry only 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.430
 from hangu the dragon the entrance of django 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.830
 enemy and so he can only play 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.010
 surprised if he wins by law n 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.350
 leaving a very clear view of the 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.110
 what is happening on the bottom 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.380
 purple team switzerland map 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.110
 technically you just need to keep 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.319
 I do not bring it because you already have the 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.569
 control of both the drink and 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.060
 your hangu entrance 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.850
 but if you have a sovereign order 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.410
 would be great to put the biggest diack in 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.180
 Up you will both help the omid 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.510
 not have to buy as many users 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.260
 to avoid holding a video there 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.200
 he 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.019
 How much are you going to be holding the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.180
 hangu entry for if by chance he 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.540
 invade this path 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.000
 You can see the people to finalize. 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.820
 Remembering you have a chance. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.760
 bigger to win a new one there is nothing 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.789
 easier than dying a little, huh? 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.630
 and there is no other way to die little 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.250
 than air giving and putting these 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.080
 orders in the right place 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.970
 today will have much greater control over 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.610
 map will be getting there. 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.530
 controlling the map not only your side but 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.590
 also on the enemy side, right? 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.600
 how much longer is the game time 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.920
 more places you can be 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.850
 guarding it as the buffs bring it 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.670
 param 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.890
 but it has even the enemy laws and 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.370
 with the greater control of the map you 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.620
 have a greater chance of winning the game 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.320
 I hope this is this little tutorial 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.440
 zinho explains to omm said save in 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.230
 Game start has helped you 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:11.660
 evolve a little more from the game grow in 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:13.580
 a little more and that you get there if 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.000
 grow playing right 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.100
 a good night's stand a great game 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.580
 for you, if we see each other in a 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.580
 video
