00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 thomas müller has some insights 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.580
 take it into the late summer night of 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:11.309
 hannover cognition gained knowledge 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.290
 taken the important three points 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.260
 I think everyone knew about the game 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.900
 what's on us was very good 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.150
 will defend very deeply 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.939
 while one or the other goal chance 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.859
 hilarious as maybe already in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.439
 the last play, however, hang 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.029
 every possibility has been well kept 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.859
 we wanted the theme so I have 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.790
 now no torchance seen the the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.020
 was given lightly 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.180
 otherwise you can hear opponents, of course 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.469
 compliment that with so 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.100
 few inhabitants that one such a 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.079
 strong troupe put together but for 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 It was important to us that we were not blind 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.200
 give and I think with the 3 0 there can 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.879
 you live quite well 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.289
 because they have seen time there before 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.239
 gunnar nielson the thing then still 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.730
 held has indeed a first was a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.410
 few times so we made good ones 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.840
 situations shot at the goal or 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.340
 also beheaded and then moinard good off 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.539
 maybe the shots were up to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.789
 unplaced 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.310
 but it was important that you get the 1 0 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:13.039
 and then afterwards until 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.759
 230 to hedge and now you can 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.369
 satisfied 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:21.189
 Of course we will go the next week 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.189
 A harder crack is outside the door 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.640
 new will have complained to them 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.470
 Thomas wants has talked so long 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.240
 Congratulations on the victory to the expected 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.040
 Duty to succeed in what today was the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 biggest problem the bulwark is not yet 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.380
 to crack more often 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.780
 yes very well arranged were very deep 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.130
 and very well staggered was very much for us 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.750
 difficult to get through but me 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.220
 believe this is the first and the second 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.690
 be done very well 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.210
 maybe one or the other situations 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.580
 but I have to be more consistent so far 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.530
 On the whole, it was very much thinking 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.050
 A lot will be satisfying these days 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.539
 in the over the growing bvb block 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.369
 The dfb team did not talk that important 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.310
 Is this very special for you or is it 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.539
 all this covered medially 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.950
 I think it is less common 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.690
 dependent on who is in the square 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.860
 we all understand each other very well and me 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.590
 belief there is no role of whom 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.910
 when I arrive and I think so 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.650
 work seen on the space that looks 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.870
 one is also out of place and me 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.580
 think that's no role she plays 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.750
 today a new role six a half 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.950
 or eighth, as appropriate 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.190
 Can you position yourself with this 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.890
 make friends it was a half 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.940
 10 almost and the position know the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.170
 I actually out of my leg and out 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.010
 the youth and therefore it was not 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.299
 big change 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.299
 Thanks for the numbers empty 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.030
 mesut özil how important was today's 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.530
 factor patience of course very important 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.280
 but we are threatened by inquiries 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.660
 We wanted to do sports later 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.100
 we had some scoring chances are before 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.800
 especially in the first half of the we 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.690
 normally make rhyme would have 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.790
 Unfortunately , you should forgive the game 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.400
 interesting but ultimately 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.110
 Striker be satisfied with the result 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.500
 we have given and deserved everything 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.720
 won 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.770
 he caresses that the soccer soul 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.860
 if you like them within one 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.970
 quarter of an hour then makes two gates 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.459
 Of course I'm happy about it when 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.750
 I give ten goals I am 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.850
 Of course, very happy about it though 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.090
 the most important thing is that we are with the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.380
 Team successes count that 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.910
 today we have the first one 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.390
 step made first game won 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.560
 and are happy with what won 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.880
 I still have to change against 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.850
 Austria 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.500
 we just have to play our game 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.660
 concentrated from the first minute on 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.620
 then I think that we are against Austria 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.390
 or spree railing philipp lame 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.720
 Congratulations on a premiere 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.000
 for the first country game victory as a father 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.810
 Thank you very much we will you this evening 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.300
 the mandatory victory against the Faroe Islands 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.160
 as we said right we wanted 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.690
 play well first half 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.560
 successful 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.480
 only we have not made the gates 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.970
 believes 4 0 can stand 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.680
 and yes then your last game will be 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.109
 a little bit to himself 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.790
 at the score of 10 but still is the 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.230
 played team has properly 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.439
 playing football on the right side 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.120
 really so much more fun than left at 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:10.390
 whether initiate fun I only find myself 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.010
 right and tick better is an em left 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.260
 analysis has shown the federal coach 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.150
 want more dressing so more active 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.620
 You probably will work on that 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.269
 tuesday against austria then the first 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.489
 You can practice that sometimes 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.440
 What else do I have to change in comparison 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.240
 for today's game yes you have to own it 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.169
 study again and we study 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 had only a few days now 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.280
 time that you have me constantly that goes 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.740
 you always put pressure on the front 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.630
 against the Faroe Islands but otherwise 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.919
 it is not always possible over 90 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.630
 minutes the conduct but one 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.520
 must then find the knowledge mix of 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.449
 early pressing after losing ball immediately 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.400
 switch 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.979
 That's what we try to teach in and 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.360
 yes but there you need less units 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.770
 we had a few now but there are 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.449
 a few more up to Austria we 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.690
 enjoy these days the quiet nights 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.599
 or he is always nice , but too 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.990
 be and I also love when 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.460
 family with many thanks philipp der 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.470
 Bundestrainer has just in our studio 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.479
 the record victory against the driver 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.710
 teammanager said this 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:11.320
 13 0-series style train station many opportunities 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.750
 have created and it should also be robots 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.220
 Of course , we will get more goals 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.860
 We just wanted the opportunities 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.970
 had and that has except national coach 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.680
 addressed jogi 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.120
 He simply improved that 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.400
 you have to have that at the em 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.900
 bit disturbed and of course 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.039
 such opponents that's bad though 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.560
 maybe with other difficult ones 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.080
 games will not forgive 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.150
 you will be up later this year 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.770
 Quarters search in brazil given out 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.659
 what criteria they are there before 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.759
 pay attention to everything 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:41.139
 that is quite difficult in advance exactly 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.150
 to drive does not know in which group 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.409
 one is and on the group distribution 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.370
 is so that you are in the whole of Brazil 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.099
 can play 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.080
 so you can already try short 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.310
 Above all, that has to be 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.120
 creative good training conditions 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.770
 offer the big media area too 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.289
 have options and I as a 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.479
 airport because when you travel 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.860
 these travel cravings simply too 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.469
 remarkable in such a tournament 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.370
 and they have to be minimized 

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:08.380
 brazil the more distant future 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.770
 Austria in a few days is something 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.479
 more 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.990
 what do you expect from this regime 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:17.979
 Neighborhood has been very good so far 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.340
 who have prepared a lot of trains 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.510
 no game today and that is for 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.050
 you certainly the game of the times 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.330
 year 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.279
 We always have a hard time in Austria 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.419
 done and I think again this time 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:30.159
 be very difficult 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.840
 The Austrians have continued 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.340
 increased a very good coach and 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.750
 the team can adjust well and 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.590
 that we are warned 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.590
 go there
