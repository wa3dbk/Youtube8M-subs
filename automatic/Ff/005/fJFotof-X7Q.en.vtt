00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
that the one we let's talk about the way

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.830 
that the one we let's talk about the way
they<00:06:17.310> were<00:06:17.400> playing<00:06:17.610> too<00:06:17.790> and<00:06:17.970> i<00:06:18.270> like<00:06:18.570> i<00:06:18.720> like

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
they were playing too and i like i like

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.360 
they were playing too and i like i like
the<00:06:18.990> structure<00:06:19.380> in<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.590> defense<00:06:19.920> i<00:06:20.070> think<00:06:20.250> i

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
the structure in the defense i think i

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.770 
the structure in the defense i think i
think<00:06:20.460> burlington's<00:06:21.150> three<00:06:21.450> in<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.630> back

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
think burlington's three in the back

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.970 
think burlington's three in the back
were<00:06:22.080> solid<00:06:22.770> as<00:06:22.890> can<00:06:23.250> be<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:24.570> in<00:06:24.960> relation<00:06:25.860> to

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
were solid as can be I in relation to

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.440 
were solid as can be I in relation to
that<00:06:26.010> if<00:06:26.340> you<00:06:26.430> look<00:06:26.610> across<00:06:26.730> the<00:06:27.060> back<00:06:27.240> from

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
that if you look across the back from

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.000 
that if you look across the back from
mississauga<00:06:27.930> they<00:06:28.050> were<00:06:28.170> two<00:06:28.290> solid<00:06:28.590> and

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
mississauga they were two solid and

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.320 
mississauga they were two solid and
probably<00:06:29.370> that<00:06:29.550> comes<00:06:29.820> right<00:06:30.030> from<00:06:30.090> the

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
probably that comes right from the

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.970 
probably that comes right from the
goalkeeper<00:06:30.750> round<00:06:30.900> he<00:06:31.320> made<00:06:31.500> a<00:06:31.530> mistake<00:06:31.680> on
