00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
facilities and this one in particular

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.700

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.109 
champions I think these are the days
that<00:01:13.710> everyone<00:01:14.159> benefits<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.939> most

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that everyone benefits from the most

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.280
