ok<00:00:00.870> still<00:00:01.620> got<00:00:01.650> my<00:00:01.800> f-18<00:00:04.310> now<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.339> switched<00:00:06.029> out

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
ok still got my f-18 now I switched out

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.499 
ok still got my f-18 now I switched out
the<00:00:06.270> battery<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:08.719> 2200<00:00:09.719> milliamp<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:12.240> first

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
the battery to a 2200 milliamp the first

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.369 
the battery to a 2200 milliamp the first
video<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:13.980> 1800<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:15.839> now<00:00:15.870> she's<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
video was with 1800 and so now she's a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.080 
video was with 1800 and so now she's a
little<00:00:16.560> bit<00:00:16.770> heavier<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.640> lot<00:00:17.850> heavier<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
little bit heavier a lot heavier and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
little bit heavier a lot heavier and
hopefully<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.150> don't<00:00:21.210> tip<00:00:21.539> stolen<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.769> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
hopefully I don't tip stolen just got to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:32.749 
hopefully I don't tip stolen just got to
make<00:00:23.070> sure<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.279> keep<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.640> speed<00:00:23.910> up

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:42.310 

look<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.920> little<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.129> trim<00:00:35.429> on<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.960> launch

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:54.730 

she's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> lot<00:00:43.590> heavier<00:00:45.740> see<00:00:46.740> how<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.070> goes<00:00:47.370> oh

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:05.160 

and<00:00:55.740> she<00:00:55.920> still<00:00:56.160> flies

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.600 

it<00:01:05.680> was<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.830> lot<00:01:06.070> faster<00:01:06.610> too

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
it was a lot faster too

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.810 
it was a lot faster too
we<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.300> get<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.630> speed<00:01:10.670> where<00:01:11.670> our

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
we can get a little speed where our

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:51.840 
we can get a little speed where our
high-speed<00:01:13.340> hats

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.590 

when<00:01:52.850> starting<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.360> pick<00:01:53.570> up

tossing<00:02:00.600> around<00:02:00.720> up<00:02:01.140> there

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:39.380 

I<00:02:08.929> know<00:02:09.470> what<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.769> problem<00:02:10.039> is<00:02:10.280> my<00:02:10.519> up<00:02:10.700> term

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390

this<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> great<00:02:40.560> flying<00:02:40.920> plane<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:41.790> a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
this is a great flying plane it's a

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.520 
this is a great flying plane it's a
wonderful<00:02:42.330> design<00:02:44.240> even<00:02:45.240> though<00:02:45.530> this

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
wonderful design even though this

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.930 
wonderful design even though this
version<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.130> lot<00:02:47.459> heavier<00:02:47.700> than<00:02:48.120> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
version is a lot heavier than the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:07.500 
version is a lot heavier than the
original<00:02:52.490> heart<00:02:53.490> rate<00:02:53.730> design

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:32.300 

well

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
she goes out the 1800 milliamp now I got

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.950 
she goes out the 1800 milliamp now I got
to<00:04:12.080> check<00:04:12.290> my<00:04:12.350> batteries<00:04:13.240> I'm<00:04:14.240> sorry<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:14.870> was

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
to check my batteries I'm sorry that was

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.250 
to check my batteries I'm sorry that was
with<00:04:15.080> 2200<00:04:15.830> I<00:04:16.010> gotta<00:04:16.280> check<00:04:16.489> my<00:04:16.519> batteries<00:04:17.260> see

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
with 2200 I gotta check my batteries see

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.750 
with 2200 I gotta check my batteries see
how<00:04:18.380> much<00:04:22.900> milliamps<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:24.020> used<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.680> then<00:04:25.580> maybe

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
how much milliamps I used and then maybe

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.970 
how much milliamps I used and then maybe
I<00:04:25.880> can<00:04:25.970> get<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.330> little<00:04:26.510> bit<00:04:26.720> longer<00:04:27.590> flight

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
I can get a little bit longer flight

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.270 
I can get a little bit longer flight
time<00:04:28.280> out<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.450> pattern<00:04:30.640> she<00:04:31.640> is<00:04:33.010> f18<00:04:34.010> Blue

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
time out of that pattern she is f18 Blue

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.990 
time out of that pattern she is f18 Blue
