00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.120 

then<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> move<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> flatted<00:01:52.500> fifth

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130

that's the first half and then I do a

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.649 
that's the first half and then I do a
kind<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.579> question<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.180> answer<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.479> the

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.990 
kind of a question and answer and the
answer<00:01:59.689> would<00:02:00.259> be<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.520> second<00:02:04.970> time

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
number of reasons one positioning wise

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.790 
number of reasons one positioning wise
on<00:02:28.030> guitar<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.540> fantastic<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.320> can<00:02:29.440> play

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
on guitar it's fantastic you can play

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.500 
on guitar it's fantastic you can play
low<00:02:30.100> but<00:02:30.610> you're<00:02:30.730> not<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.000> don't<00:02:31.030> have<00:02:31.360> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
low but you're not you don't have you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.360 
low but you're not you don't have you
can<00:02:31.540> use<00:02:31.840> open<00:02:32.170> strings<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:33.040> you're<00:02:33.190> not

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
can use open strings but you're not

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.400 
can use open strings but you're not
playing<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.450> first<00:02:34.690> position<00:02:35.230> and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
playing just in that first position and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.320 
playing just in that first position and
obviously<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.850> play<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.060> an<00:02:37.210> octave

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
obviously you can play it an octave

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.420 
obviously you can play it an octave
higher<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.380> get<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.770> low<00:02:39.100> E<00:02:39.400> string

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
higher but you get that low E string

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.700 
higher but you get that low E string
where<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.390> can<00:02:40.600> add<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.530> make<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
where you can add to that and make it

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:51.040 
where you can add to that and make it
sound<00:02:42.130> really<00:02:42.370> evil<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.180> metal

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.920 

what<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.080> do<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.770> play<00:02:53.190> this<00:02:53.430> riff<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.569> hammer

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.470 
what I do to play this riff is I hammer
on<00:02:55.230> from<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.130> e<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.580> f-sharp<00:02:56.849> on<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
on from the e to the f-sharp on the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.860 
on from the e to the f-sharp on the
sixth<00:02:57.840> string<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.970> from<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.239> point<00:03:00.420> on

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
sixth string so but from that point on

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.229 
sixth string so but from that point on
when<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.080> play<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.560> fast<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.310> all<00:03:02.610> alternate

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
when I play it fast it's all alternate

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:24.119 
when I play it fast it's all alternate
picking<00:03:03.480> sir

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.970 

when<00:03:25.129> I<00:03:25.159> play<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.879> riff<00:03:26.379> it's<00:03:27.379> a<00:03:27.560> combination

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
when I play this riff it's a combination

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.059 
when I play this riff it's a combination
of<00:03:28.400> palm<00:03:28.730> muting<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:30.319> little<00:03:30.769> bit<00:03:30.950> of

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
of palm muting and a little bit of

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.099 
of palm muting and a little bit of
playing<00:03:31.430> open<00:03:31.819> strings<00:03:32.209> for<00:03:32.510> example<00:03:32.959> when<00:03:33.079> I

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
playing open strings for example when I

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.330 
playing open strings for example when I
hamill<00:03:33.709> on<00:03:33.859> i<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.959> really<00:03:36.170> don't<00:03:36.560> palm<00:03:37.040> mute

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
hamill on i I really don't palm mute

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:46.569 
hamill on i I really don't palm mute
that<00:03:37.370> but

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.819 

when<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.610> do<00:03:47.760> play<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.629> Paul<00:03:49.019> mute<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.439> though<00:03:49.620> I

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
when I do play and Paul mute it though I

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.080 
when I do play and Paul mute it though I
think<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.700> has<00:03:50.909> a<00:03:51.209> more<00:03:51.420> aggressive<00:03:51.780> and

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
think that it has a more aggressive and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.750 
think that it has a more aggressive and
a<00:03:54.090> more<00:03:54.629> attack<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.260> there<00:03:55.469> when<00:03:56.400> I'm<00:03:56.519> playing

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
a more attack on there when I'm playing

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.970 
a more attack on there when I'm playing
this<00:03:57.150> riff<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.659> majority<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.170> it<00:03:58.379> is<00:03:58.500> palm

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
this riff the majority of it is palm

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.759 
this riff the majority of it is palm
muted<00:03:59.370> but<00:03:59.760> when<00:04:00.239> i<00:04:00.269> do<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.719> do<00:04:00.959> when<00:04:01.349> i<00:04:01.379> do<00:04:01.500> the

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
muted but when i do you do when i do the

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.460 
muted but when i do you do when i do the
pinch<00:04:02.040> harmonic<00:04:02.720> then<00:04:03.720> i<00:04:03.810> have<00:04:03.959> to<00:04:03.989> take<00:04:04.290> my

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
pinch harmonic then i have to take my

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:18.810 
pinch harmonic then i have to take my
hand<00:04:04.739> off<00:04:04.920> so

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.090 

you

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.560 

what<00:04:25.100> I've<00:04:25.190> learned<00:04:25.220> about<00:04:25.670> music<00:04:26.240> over<00:04:26.480> the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
what I've learned about music over the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.570 
what I've learned about music over the
years<00:04:26.840> especially<00:04:27.080> studying<00:04:28.010> music<00:04:28.130> theory

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
years especially studying music theory

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.750 
years especially studying music theory
and<00:04:29.050> studying<00:04:30.050> great<00:04:30.290> composers<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.190> my

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
and studying great composers is that my

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.170 
and studying great composers is that my
idea<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.570> writing<00:04:33.500> in<00:04:33.860> weird<00:04:34.280> time<00:04:34.610> signatures

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
idea of writing in weird time signatures

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.260 
idea of writing in weird time signatures
or<00:04:35.390> mixed<00:04:35.720> meters<00:04:36.140> or<00:04:36.640> we<00:04:37.640> sometimes<00:04:38.060> goof

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
or mixed meters or we sometimes goof

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.870 
or mixed meters or we sometimes goof
around<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.570> call<00:04:38.780> it<00:04:38.870> math<00:04:39.140> rock<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:40.430> not

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
around and call it math rock is not

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.730 
around and call it math rock is not
something<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.420> think<00:04:41.540> about<00:04:41.900> beforehand

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
something that I think about beforehand

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.100 
something that I think about beforehand
I<00:04:42.920> usually<00:04:43.340> come<00:04:43.790> up<00:04:43.940> with<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.180> riff<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:44.600> then

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
I usually come up with the riff and then

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.930 
I usually come up with the riff and then
because<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:45.830> my<00:04:45.950> theory<00:04:46.280> background<00:04:46.700> i<00:04:46.790> can

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
because of my theory background i can

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.180 
because of my theory background i can
analyze<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:47.630> later<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.170> so<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.680> didn't

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
analyze it later and so I didn't

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.970 
analyze it later and so I didn't
intentionally<00:04:49.520> try<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.420> write<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:51.080> riff<00:04:51.380> in<00:04:51.530> 15

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
intentionally try to write a riff in 15

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.460 
intentionally try to write a riff in 15
for<00:04:52.280> that's<00:04:52.730> just<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.120> way<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:53.270> heard<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:53.780> and

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
for that's just the way I heard it and

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.350 
for that's just the way I heard it and
i'm<00:04:54.680> pretty<00:04:54.920> sure<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.700> when<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.240> know

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
i'm pretty sure that that when you know

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.210 
i'm pretty sure that that when you know
some<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:56.600> my<00:04:56.870> favorite<00:04:57.290> classic<00:04:57.770> bands<00:04:58.010> like

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
some of my favorite classic bands like

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.310 
some of my favorite classic bands like
King<00:04:58.520> Crimson<00:04:58.910> when<00:04:59.480> they<00:04:59.570> would<00:04:59.720> write<00:04:59.870> our

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
King Crimson when they would write our

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.190 
King Crimson when they would write our
riffs<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.800> 54<00:05:01.400> or<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:02.150> song<00:05:02.390> money<00:05:02.660> by<00:05:02.900> Pink

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
riffs and 54 or the song money by Pink

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.980 
riffs and 54 or the song money by Pink
Floyd<00:05:03.440> in<00:05:03.650> 74<00:05:04.370> I'm<00:05:04.610> sure<00:05:05.120> they<00:05:05.270> didn't<00:05:05.540> think

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
Floyd in 74 I'm sure they didn't think

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.500 
Floyd in 74 I'm sure they didn't think
about<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:07.310> time<00:05:07.580> signature<00:05:07.820> before<00:05:08.210> they

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
about the time signature before they

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.930 
about the time signature before they
wrote<00:05:08.750> it<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.290> I<00:05:09.620> just<00:05:10.130> heard<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.550> riff<00:05:10.730> like

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
wrote it so I just heard the riff like

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:21.470 
wrote it so I just heard the riff like
this

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.850 

it's<00:05:22.480> just<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.720> way<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:22.900> heard<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.260> and<00:05:23.410> then<00:05:23.650> I

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
it's just the way I heard it and then I

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.890 
it's just the way I heard it and then I
listen<00:05:24.490> back<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.880> said<00:05:25.060> well<00:05:25.390> what<00:05:25.540> is<00:05:25.660> that

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
listen back and said well what is that

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.360 
listen back and said well what is that
you<00:05:26.230> know<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:26.500> order<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.800> teach<00:05:27.070> it<00:05:27.100> to<00:05:27.340> a

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
you know in order to teach it to a

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.400 
you know in order to teach it to a
drummer<00:05:27.700> I<00:05:27.970> had<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.750> know<00:05:28.840> figure<00:05:29.050> out<00:05:29.290> how

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
drummer I had to you know figure out how

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.740 
drummer I had to you know figure out how
to<00:05:29.470> how<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.740> explain<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.610> him<00:05:30.700> and<00:05:30.970> so

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
to how to explain it to him and so

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.140 
to how to explain it to him and so
that's<00:05:31.930> what<00:05:32.110> i<00:05:32.170> did<00:05:32.500> i<00:05:32.860> write<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.700> riff<00:05:33.880> first

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
that's what i did i write the riff first

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.610 
that's what i did i write the riff first
think<00:05:34.840> about<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.140> time<00:05:35.350> signature

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
think about the time signature

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.760 
think about the time signature
afterwards<00:05:36.540> another<00:05:37.540> example<00:05:38.050> of<00:05:38.350> using

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
afterwards another example of using

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.340 
afterwards another example of using
mixed<00:05:39.280> meters<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:39.820> songs<00:05:40.090> is<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:40.810> song<00:05:41.170> that<00:05:41.200> I

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
mixed meters and songs is a song that I

wrote called I do for you and it's on my
2x<00:05:43.840> against<00:05:44.230> ed<00:05:44.680> and<00:05:44.920> what<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.610> do<00:05:45.700> is<00:05:45.820> instead

2x against ed and what I do is instead

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.780 
2x against ed and what I do is instead
of<00:05:46.630> just<00:05:46.870> playing<00:05:47.260> like<00:05:47.920> a<00:05:47.950> riff<00:05:48.310> in<00:05:48.520> notes

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
of just playing like a riff in notes

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.540 
of just playing like a riff in notes
this<00:05:49.330> is<00:05:49.510> more<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:50.020> riff<00:05:50.290> with<00:05:50.770> chords<00:05:51.340> and

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
this is more of a riff with chords and

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.090 
this is more of a riff with chords and
it's<00:05:52.060> in<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.300> key<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.540> e<00:05:52.960> you<00:05:53.890> it's

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
it's in the key of e you it's

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.060 
it's in the key of e you it's
blues-based<00:05:55.200> but<00:05:56.200> it<00:05:56.410> uses<00:05:56.650> a<00:05:56.830> lot<00:05:57.010> of

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
blues-based but it uses a lot of

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.950 
blues-based but it uses a lot of
chromatic<00:05:57.580> tones<00:05:57.760> and<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.150> main<00:05:58.390> body<00:05:58.720> of<00:05:58.870> the

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
chromatic tones and the main body of the

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.320 
chromatic tones and the main body of the
riff<00:05:59.260> is<00:05:59.470> in<00:05:59.950> 74<00:06:00.730> and<00:06:00.910> then<00:06:01.060> there's<00:06:01.240> a

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
riff is in 74 and then there's a

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.570 
riff is in 74 and then there's a
turnaround<00:06:01.720> at<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.110> end<00:06:02.320> that's<00:06:02.980> a<00:06:03.130> total<00:06:03.460> of

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
turnaround at the end that's a total of

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.970 
turnaround at the end that's a total of
nine<00:06:03.610> counts<00:06:04.420> so<00:06:04.570> you<00:06:04.930> could<00:06:05.110> consider<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.920> a

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:05.980 
nine counts so you could consider it a

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.470 
nine counts so you could consider it a
measure<00:06:06.160> for<00:06:06.280> four<00:06:06.820> and<00:06:06.880> a<00:06:06.940> measure<00:06:07.090> of<00:06:07.210> five

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
measure for four and a measure of five

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.230 
measure for four and a measure of five
for<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:08.530> main<00:06:08.740> riff<00:06:09.040> sounds<00:06:09.490> like<00:06:09.700> this<00:06:09.850> in

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
for the main riff sounds like this in

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:22.770 
for the main riff sounds like this in
seven<00:06:10.600> four<00:06:10.840> one<00:06:11.110> two<00:06:11.650> three<00:06:11.830> four

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.390 

then<00:06:23.780> there's<00:06:23.990> a<00:06:24.050> turnaround<00:06:24.530> that<00:06:25.069> goes<00:06:25.280> like

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
then there's a turnaround that goes like

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.750 
then there's a turnaround that goes like
this

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.750 

so<00:06:31.760> the<00:06:31.970> main<00:06:32.230> riff<00:06:33.230> complete<00:06:33.830> with<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:34.190> 74

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
so the main riff complete with the 74

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.510 
so the main riff complete with the 74
section<00:06:35.240> and<00:06:35.420> the<00:06:35.780> 94<00:06:36.410> section<00:06:36.920> sounds<00:06:37.400> like

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
section and the 94 section sounds like

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:54.980 
section and the 94 section sounds like
this<00:06:37.790> one<00:06:38.420> two<00:06:38.840> three<00:06:39.440> four

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.830 

here<00:06:55.990> is<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:56.290> first<00:06:56.590> section<00:06:56.949> slow<00:06:57.729> in<00:06:58.000> seven

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
here is the first section slow in seven

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:26.140 
here is the first section slow in seven
four<00:06:59.110> one<00:06:59.820> two<00:07:01.020> three<00:07:02.020> four

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.600 

to<00:07:27.150> wrap<00:07:27.330> things<00:07:27.570> up<00:07:27.870> what<00:07:28.830> I<00:07:28.860> like<00:07:29.130> to<00:07:29.280> do<00:07:29.460> when

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
to wrap things up what I like to do when

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.110 
to wrap things up what I like to do when
I<00:07:29.669> write<00:07:29.970> songs<00:07:30.300> and<00:07:30.630> use<00:07:31.169> mix<00:07:31.560> meters<00:07:31.980> is<00:07:32.160> a<00:07:32.610> I

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 
I write songs and use mix meters is a I

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.270 
I write songs and use mix meters is a I
find<00:07:33.660> that<00:07:33.870> that<00:07:34.110> I'll<00:07:34.380> come<00:07:34.650> up<00:07:34.680> with<00:07:34.800> a<00:07:34.950> riff

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 
find that that I'll come up with a riff

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.360 
find that that I'll come up with a riff
and<00:07:35.580> then<00:07:35.820> I<00:07:35.850> might<00:07:36.180> want<00:07:36.389> to<00:07:36.540> add<00:07:36.810> something

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.370 
and then I might want to add something

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.740 
and then I might want to add something
maybe<00:07:38.370> towards<00:07:38.760> the<00:07:38.760> end<00:07:38.940> or<00:07:39.210> add<00:07:39.360> something

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
maybe towards the end or add something

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.690 
maybe towards the end or add something
to<00:07:39.900> the<00:07:40.169> river<00:07:40.470> possibly<00:07:41.040> take<00:07:41.280> something

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:41.700 
to the river possibly take something

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.080 
to the river possibly take something
away<00:07:42.060> from<00:07:42.360> it<00:07:42.750> to<00:07:43.530> put<00:07:43.770> it<00:07:43.800> in<00:07:44.160> a<00:07:44.340> mixed<00:07:44.820> meter

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.090 
away from it to put it in a mixed meter

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.930 
away from it to put it in a mixed meter
so<00:07:45.330> it's<00:07:45.510> not<00:07:45.690> in<00:07:46.020> 44<00:07:46.680> so<00:07:47.010> when<00:07:47.520> you're<00:07:47.669> writing

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 
so it's not in 44 so when you're writing

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.900 
so it's not in 44 so when you're writing
riffs<00:07:48.770> try<00:07:49.770> and<00:07:49.980> think<00:07:50.220> a<00:07:50.370> little<00:07:50.400> bit<00:07:50.730> outside

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910 
riffs try and think a little bit outside

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.940 
riffs try and think a little bit outside
the<00:07:51.150> box<00:07:51.360> say<00:07:51.810> you<00:07:51.870> have<00:07:51.960> something<00:07:52.560> that's<00:07:52.770> in

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:52.950 
the box say you have something that's in

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.550 
the box say you have something that's in
standard<00:07:53.460> for<00:07:53.730> four<00:07:54.060> then<00:07:54.540> maybe<00:07:54.810> add<00:07:55.169> a

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 
standard for four then maybe add a

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.790 
standard for four then maybe add a
little<00:07:56.100> extra<00:07:56.430> part<00:07:57.330> to<00:07:57.570> that<00:07:57.600> riff<00:07:58.050> to<00:07:58.560> maybe

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 
little extra part to that riff to maybe

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.640 
little extra part to that riff to maybe
change<00:07:59.220> it<00:07:59.490> into<00:07:59.700> a<00:07:59.850> mixed<00:08:00.270> meter<00:08:00.510> because<00:08:01.440> so

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:01.650 
change it into a mixed meter because so

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.379 
change it into a mixed meter because so
many<00:08:01.800> songs<00:08:02.160> so<00:08:02.370> many<00:08:02.520> great<00:08:02.790> songs<00:08:03.060> whether

00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:03.389 
many songs so many great songs whether

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:06.290 
many songs so many great songs whether
go<00:08:03.570> on<00:08:03.690> the<00:08:03.810> radio<00:08:04.139> or<00:08:04.350> from<00:08:04.680> bands<00:08:05.070> have<00:08:06.060> that

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.300 
go on the radio or from bands have that

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.520 
go on the radio or from bands have that
and<00:08:06.479> do<00:08:06.930> mixed<00:08:07.320> meters<00:08:07.680> in<00:08:07.919> their<00:08:08.160> music
