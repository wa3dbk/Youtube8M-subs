 a buddy at this game it's so a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.010
 waste he managed to pollute expensive 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.010

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.469

 had also barbaric sus space newton 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.500
 I never could finish the first 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.359
 level of this game because at the time I 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.980
 did not speak English yet so 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.840
 costs I knew that slab of what he 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.090
 had to do godzilla what good to 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.530
 godzilla that's a little holes the 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.540
 people were taking half of the screen 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.799
 suddenly it was disgusting and you 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.739
 was pungating all the time 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:22.629
 because of that and the list is still 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.519
 long very long but that pitt edison 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.230
 and then to all the other games I have 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.609
 could discover through the attic player 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 which prevented me from making a huge 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.970
 stupidity and play by myself thank you 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.230
 because it's been years since 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.970
 I hesitated to buy barbie or so 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.560
 takeshi this challenge and then the nes in 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.609
 over her shit game mountain she 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.409
 also had some small flaws 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.489
 kind eg me I spent more than 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.540
 time to blow in my cartridges 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.540
 she plays audi game 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.930
 so my mother is like that she 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:58.480
 believed that it plays in it will you born 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:03.730
 have fun with the console ben then 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.870
 you do not play anymore and in addition to 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.670
 to blow fifteen thousand times in 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.470
 cartridges so that finally it passes you do not 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.000
 had to mostly feathers so especially more 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.500
 touch the console because if by 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.239
 misfortune you move offended a 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.010
 millimeter your console by pulling a little 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.820
 too much with the cape of your joystick 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:24.400
 it was the drama and as on the nes he 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.690
 there was no blood keeping the first 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.710
 but it was so much to pick it up a 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.060
 that I had points it's the gap 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.470
 touched that a little piece of paper and 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.330
 of cardboard for it to work I 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.330
 called it the mac gyver nes 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.099
 the trick not so good with the nes 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.689
 it was the controllers she fuck you 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.639
 hands or 30 minutes of play which 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.900
 after one hour max of play when 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.590
 he was suffering too much ben you were doing a 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.939
 pause by yourself 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.259
 you do not even need your mother to 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:47.270
 then say the last thing that annoys me 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.169
 with the nes and other retro consoles 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.180
 in general too 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.740
 it is the price of egg that it reaches 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.840
 since retro gaming has become a 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.349
 fucking business brothel in twenty years that's 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.669
 will give 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.620
 and so I bought a private island 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.569
 why do I create a cycle of eight for 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.909
 scare but we jaguar collection 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.710

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.449
 john holmes hero coins 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.370

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.909

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.870
