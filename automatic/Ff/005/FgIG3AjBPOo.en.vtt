00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
expensive card but it is a beautiful

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.249 
expensive card but it is a beautiful

elite card plus 22 acceleration as well
which<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:46.950> nice<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.700> awareness<00:01:47.970> remains<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
which is nice the awareness remains the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.880 
which is nice the awareness remains the
same<00:01:48.689> which<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.110> bit<00:01:49.290> surprising<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
same which is a little bit surprising to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.060 
same which is a little bit surprising to
me<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.399> i<00:01:50.430> did<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:50.790> add<00:01:51.119> +<00:01:51.479> 8<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.020> catching<00:01:52.619> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
me but i did also add + 8 to catching so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.260 
me but i did also add + 8 to catching so
it's<00:01:53.250> definitely<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.000> some<00:01:54.180> more

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's definitely going to get some more

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.959 
it's definitely going to get some more
interceptions<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.280> then<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.549> course<00:01:56.759> when

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
interceptions and then it of course when

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.639 
interceptions and then it of course when
you<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.719> actual<00:01:58.140> coverage

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you go down to the actual coverage

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.219 
you go down to the actual coverage
attributes<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.520> has<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.119> plus<00:02:00.450> 2<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.020> play

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
attributes it has a plus 2 to play

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.709 
attributes it has a plus 2 to play
recognition<00:02:01.829> plus<00:02:02.130> 2<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.880> man<00:02:03.060> coverage<00:02:03.270> plus

22<00:02:04.079> zone<00:02:04.290> coverage<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> plus<00:02:05.520> 5<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.600> press<00:02:06.930> so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
22 zone coverage and plus 5 to press so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.100 
22 zone coverage and plus 5 to press so
very<00:02:08.369> very<00:02:08.459> impressive<00:02:09.270> i<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.989> this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
very very impressive i think that this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
very very impressive i think that this
is<00:02:10.289> definitely<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.310> best<00:02:11.489> cornerback

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
is definitely one of the best cornerback

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
is definitely one of the best cornerback
cards<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> game<00:02:12.660> right<00:02:12.840> now<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
cards in the game right now all the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.180 
cards in the game right now all the
other<00:02:13.620> thing<00:02:13.830> too

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
other thing too

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.250 
other thing too
it<00:02:14.400> also<00:02:14.550> does<00:02:14.850> add<00:02:15.030> plus<00:02:15.390> six<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.810> hit<00:02:16.020> power

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
it also does add plus six to hit power

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.250 
it also does add plus six to hit power
so<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.530> goes<00:02:16.680> from<00:02:16.800> 66<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.520> 70<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.240> still<00:02:19.110> not

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
so it goes from 66 to 70 to still not

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.840 
so it goes from 66 to 70 to still not
spectacular<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> cornerback<00:02:20.580> that's

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
spectacular but for a cornerback that's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.120 
spectacular but for a cornerback that's
pretty<00:02:21.060> decent<00:02:21.510> overall<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.530> absolutely

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
pretty decent overall this is absolutely

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.010 
pretty decent overall this is absolutely
like<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.460> said<00:02:23.670> one<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> best<00:02:24.510> cornerback

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
like I said one of the best cornerback

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.240 
like I said one of the best cornerback
cards<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.500> game<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.830> don't<00:02:26.100> know<00:02:26.160> if
