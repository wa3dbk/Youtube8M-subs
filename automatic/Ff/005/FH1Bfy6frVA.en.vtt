00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
made it like right to the end just
before<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.660> screen<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.949> can't<00:01:05.040> go

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
before that screen we just can't go

is great great out for his orange it out
and<00:01:09.770> yeah<00:01:10.770> i<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> ending<00:01:14.189> I

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
and yeah i think that is the ending I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.140 
and yeah i think that is the ending I
mean<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.470> said<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.189> started<00:01:17.700> hell<00:01:18.000> mode<00:01:18.290> but

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
mean it said it started hell mode but

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.310 
mean it said it started hell mode but
usually<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.420> num<00:01:23.210> it's<00:01:24.210> an<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> game<00:01:24.960> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
usually in num it's an only a game that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.700 
usually in num it's an only a game that
hell<00:01:26.009> mode<00:01:26.369> doesn't<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:27.360> mean<00:01:27.869> anything<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
hell mode doesn't really mean anything I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.140 
hell mode doesn't really mean anything I
mean<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> train<00:01:30.600> so

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
mean is is there for you to train so

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.730 
mean is is there for you to train so
yeah<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.500> this<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.630> ending<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:39.740> what

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
yeah I think this is the ending so what

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.840 
yeah I think this is the ending so what
it<00:01:40.860> means<00:01:42.079> I'm<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.259> really<00:01:43.439> sure<00:01:43.560> yet<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.159> mean

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it means I'm not really sure yet I mean

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.130 
it means I'm not really sure yet I mean
