00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.169
 hi girls, guys, how are we doing that? 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 I'm going to ask you mirror mirror 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:14.060
 magical who is prettier than me and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.009
 serious problem that we all have 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.919
 here we are going to see how to get good my 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.890
 greater defect and greater than you have and face 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:25.829
 and house of my eyes is to say the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.529
 nature that has given me some eyes 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.230
 beautiful although myopic but I can say 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.750
 that with mascara I 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.730
 solved everything I have very easy but 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.410
 my mother my teeth is to say is the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.050
 part of my face that if I have them healthy 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.360
 but then nature did not see me well 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.590
 posts as soon as we place the ones we're going to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.100
 I can not do what I say to 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:54.380
 what smile I look so beautiful 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.380
 because I do not like them 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.550
 because because my polish is very yellow 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.140
 and it's more look than the least brush and 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.520
 less 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.670
 brush but there's no way it 's like that and for 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.140
 at least once a year to the dentist myself 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.150
 I do not smoke and then I drink coffee more than 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.800
 just like chocolate 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.430
 nor with those who stain teeth 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.070
 I have to courage solution look you get 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.990
 fed because in addition neither enamel nor 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.720
 can whiten more I would need to be 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.910
 submitted to a special postponement and I 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.070
 over time the truth is that I want 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.230
 put on veneers is not to say 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.240
 that has veneers but that part of 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.210
 my tooth from the front carry 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.290
 a perfect glaze made with with this 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.860
 material there is such a new but of 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.020
 moment as my tooth or are mine because 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.300
 then vice first a brush 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.250
 fundamental electric because you give it to 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.270
 this 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.010
 today apart they are expensive tracts up 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.770
 Good to say, I do not say what it looks like 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.690
 this the toothbrush this type 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.390
 that are electric vain scary 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.690
 first because they reach everywhere 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.310
 good to almost all parties 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.610
 morgan what we are going to do is a mixture 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.010
 of bicarbonate once a week in 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.070
 you spend a mix with a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.380
 teaspoon of baking soda one 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.090
 teaspoonful 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:31.110
 oxygenated water 1 teaspoon soup 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.870
 of water and then your toothpaste 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.880
 usual if the scientist is also a 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.920
 little nothing happens nothing but about 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.350
 everything that carries fluoride and also that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.230
 can be of all those who owe in that 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.330
 goes with antich the jazzista is better 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.700
 so you have all this potingue of 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.710
 Mix in a bowl and no need 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.080
 that mount it here is to say you take 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.350
 revolvers with a bowl and a spoon 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.220
 the teaspoon that you have put of 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.590
 toothpaste the teaspoon that you have 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.540
 water bicarbonate 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.370
 oxygenated and the tablespoon of water 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.370
 you take this handle 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.060
 by god I am here if you see like this 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.800
 so to the teeth this image is that they are 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.470
 the teeth because there would not be that 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.660
 camera because in a few shots or not 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.070
 well the face caracas text of more goes very 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.070
 well because this makes a movement 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.120
 because I'm doing so very badly the 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 teeth enrich and catch those of 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.030
 up down 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.920
 as the dentist has taught you and 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.930
 up down from top to bottom 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.440
 never like this so I to gather this 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.980
 problem was caught singing you have to see 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.980
 ribs 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.650
 I will use for other things today my 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.840
 husband 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.500
 He had the prime rib for good night 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.490
 well once this eye is done for two 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.720
 minutes minimally a week then you 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.740
 you have it with your toothpaste 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.590
 habitual and sansocabÃ³ that yes this is a 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.200
 home remedy does not mean that no 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.810
