00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.979 
this and I I think it's both convenient
and<00:00:37.550> really<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.879> unmanageable<00:00:39.629> because

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and really a little unmanageable because

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.500 
and really a little unmanageable because
it's<00:00:40.290> extremely<00:00:41.280> sensitive<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's extremely sensitive you have to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.470 
it's extremely sensitive you have to
press<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.110> likely<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> product

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
press very likely to get out the product
and<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.649> amount<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.100> i<00:00:47.219> would

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and this is like the amount that i would

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910

ethyl paraben methylparaben things like
that<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:50.130> harmful<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
that they are not harmful at all as you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.080 
that they are not harmful at all as you
can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> packaging<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.189> an<00:01:53.399> open<00:01:53.850> jar

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
can see the packaging is not an open jar

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.959 
can see the packaging is not an open jar
so<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.680> difficult<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.399> bacteria

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so it's really difficult for bacteria

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.569 
so it's really difficult for bacteria
and<00:01:57.240> stuff<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.920> come<00:01:58.920> inside<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and stuff like that to come inside the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.889 
and stuff like that to come inside the
container<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.159> that<00:02:02.159> makes<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.670> okay<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
container and that makes it okay that it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.810 
container and that makes it okay that it
