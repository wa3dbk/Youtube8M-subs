00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you know some assembly required so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.100 
you know some assembly required so
that's<00:02:41.040> pretty<00:02:41.879> much<00:02:41.970> that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that's pretty much that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.740 
that's pretty much that
and<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.400> comes<00:02:44.549> with<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.989> little<00:02:46.049> bag

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
and then it comes with this little bag

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.210 
and then it comes with this little bag
and<00:02:48.750> inside<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.980> bag<00:02:51.620> two<00:02:52.620> little<00:02:52.920> pieces

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
and inside the bag two little pieces

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.400 
and inside the bag two little pieces
look<00:02:58.099> it's<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.340> little<00:02:59.430> circles<00:03:00.319> from<00:03:01.319> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
look it's the little circles from the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:11.760 
look it's the little circles from the
middle<00:03:04.129> just<00:03:05.129> goes<00:03:06.079> in<00:03:07.079> there

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.750 

and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.660 
and
this<00:03:14.450> goes<00:03:14.720> in<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.930> center

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
this goes in the center

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.630 
this goes in the center
No

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
No

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.940 
No
that's<00:03:19.150> pretty<00:03:19.360> much<00:03:19.510> it

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.410 

obviously<00:03:23.790> there's<00:03:24.030> going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> be<00:03:24.240> some

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
obviously there's going to be some

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.750 
obviously there's going to be some
sanding<00:03:24.900> because<00:03:24.990> that's<00:03:25.230> not<00:03:25.760> complete

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
sanding because that's not complete

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.199 
sanding because that's not complete
circle<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.300> this<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.630> not<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> complete<00:03:28.110> circle

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
circle and this is not a complete circle

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.309 
circle and this is not a complete circle
and<00:03:32.480> pretty<00:03:33.480> much<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:33.900> goes<00:03:34.140> like<00:03:34.290> that

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
and pretty much it just goes like that

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.030 
and pretty much it just goes like that
and<00:03:35.660> that's<00:03:36.660> in<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.990> middle<00:03:37.170> Oh

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.120 

so<00:03:41.040> technically<00:03:42.500> kind<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.620> looks<00:03:43.770> like<00:03:43.830> that

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
so technically kind of looks like that

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.830 
so technically kind of looks like that
not<00:03:45.000> really<00:03:45.300> obviously<00:03:45.630> it's<00:03:47.060> not<00:03:48.060> done<00:03:48.360> but

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
not really obviously it's not done but

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.010 
not really obviously it's not done but
yeah<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.590> easy<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.780> it's<00:03:51.780> gonna

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
yeah this is so easy like it's gonna

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.150 
yeah this is so easy like it's gonna
need<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.319> lot<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.560> sanding<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:55.680> say<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> lot
