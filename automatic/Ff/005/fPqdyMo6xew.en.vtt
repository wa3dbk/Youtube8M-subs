00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
to say away from the middle but in this

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
those wooden like kind of scaffolding i

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
those wooden like kind of scaffolding i
think<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> Builder<00:01:50.250> scaffolding

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
think it's the the Builder scaffolding

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.530 
think it's the the Builder scaffolding
they<00:01:50.759> haven't<00:01:50.970> completed<00:01:51.270> their

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
they haven't completed their

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.450 
they haven't completed their
construction<00:01:52.049> yet<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.229> guess<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:53.280> going

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
construction yet I guess and I'm going

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.830 
construction yet I guess and I'm going
to<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.060> order<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.479> forgot<00:01:54.750> to

to kind of go out of order I forgot to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.270 
to kind of go out of order I forgot to
talk<00:01:54.899> about<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> attachment<00:01:55.619> dual<00:01:55.770> mags<00:01:55.950> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
talk about the attachment dual mags on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.780 
talk about the attachment dual mags on
most<00:01:57.240> guns<00:01:57.540> dual<00:01:57.840> mags<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.259> probably<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
most guns dual mags is probably the the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.060 
most guns dual mags is probably the the
best<00:02:00.090> attachment<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.719> use<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.860> kind<00:02:01.979> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
best attachment you can use it's kind of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.499 
best attachment you can use it's kind of
like<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.820> reason<00:02:03.030> why<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
like the reason why is because if you

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
like the reason why is because if you
use<00:02:03.630> dual<00:02:03.869> mags<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.320> gives<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.590> kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
use dual mags it gives you kind of a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.620 
use dual mags it gives you kind of a
scavenger<00:02:05.340> light<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.119> sleight-of-hand

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
scavenger light and a sleight-of-hand

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.550 
scavenger light and a sleight-of-hand
light<00:02:07.369> perk<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.550> there<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
light perk in there because the

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.740 
light perk in there because the
you<00:02:10.429> get<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> faster<00:02:10.910> reload<00:02:11.180> time<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.690> get

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
you get a faster reload time and you get

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.120 
you get a faster reload time and you get
dealt<00:02:12.020> with<00:02:12.170> in<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.319> starting<00:02:12.860> amount<00:02:12.980> of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
dealt with in a starting amount of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.430 
dealt with in a starting amount of
ammunition<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.700> on<00:02:14.270> this<00:02:14.599> one<00:02:14.780> right<00:02:14.900> here<00:02:14.959> i'm

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
ammunition so on this one right here i'm

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.199 
ammunition so on this one right here i'm
not<00:02:15.590> using<00:02:15.770> scavenger<00:02:16.280> except<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.640> body<00:02:16.790> x<00:02:17.000> I

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
not using scavenger except and body x I

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.360 
not using scavenger except and body x I
because<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:17.930> don't<00:02:17.959> have<00:02:18.380> any<00:02:18.890> money<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.190> do

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
because I don't have any money to do

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.520 
because I don't have any money to do
that<00:02:19.489> and<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.300> was<00:02:20.420> using<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.750> dual<00:02:21.020> max<00:02:21.230> kind

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
that and so I was using a dual max kind

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.440 
that and so I was using a dual max kind
of<00:02:21.650> take<00:02:22.010> care<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.430> ammunition<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.180> then

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
sleight of hand pro with dual mags kind

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.729 
sleight of hand pro with dual mags kind
of<00:02:25.520> doubled<00:02:25.880> reload<00:02:26.180> speed<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:26.900> it's<00:02:27.500> so

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
of doubled reload speed so it's it's so

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.080 
of doubled reload speed so it's it's so
fast<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:28.340> almost<00:02:28.489> like<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> got<00:02:28.849> him<00:02:28.940> you

there's<00:02:37.760> two<00:02:37.940> toughest<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.269> wanted<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.540> talk

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
there's two toughest I wanted to talk

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.120 
there's two toughest I wanted to talk
about<00:02:38.720> one<00:02:39.019> was<00:02:39.170> ghost<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.560> almost<00:02:39.769> hate<00:02:39.950> mail

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
about one was ghost and almost hate mail

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.890 
about one was ghost and almost hate mail
as<00:02:40.640> far<00:02:40.849> as<00:02:40.880> ghosts<00:02:41.180> ghosts<00:02:41.420> somebody<00:02:41.720> asked

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
as far as ghosts ghosts somebody asked

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.240 
as far as ghosts ghosts somebody asked
me<00:02:42.019> if<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.200> thought<00:02:42.230> ghosts<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:42.709> overpowered

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
me if I thought ghosts was overpowered

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.370 
me if I thought ghosts was overpowered
and<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:44.030> guess<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:44.750> game<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.019> only<00:02:45.170> reason

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
and I guess in this game the only reason

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.509 
and I guess in this game the only reason
that<00:02:45.410> would<00:02:45.620> seem<00:02:45.769> overpowers<00:02:46.220> because

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
that would seem overpowers because

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.490 
that would seem overpowers because
there's<00:02:46.670> no<00:02:46.730> stopping<00:02:47.090> power<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:48.170> previous

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
there's no stopping power so in previous

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.600 
there's no stopping power so in previous
Call<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.650> Duty's<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.100> either<00:02:49.160> had<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.489> option

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
Call of Duty's you either had the option

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.370 
Call of Duty's you either had the option
of<00:02:49.850> either<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.209> choosing<00:02:50.750> ghost<00:02:50.989> or<00:02:51.319> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.229 
cold-blooded or UAV jammer or bees and
stopping<00:02:54.590> power<00:02:54.769> which<00:02:55.040> kind<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.370> everybody

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
stopping power which kind of everybody

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.699 
stopping power which kind of everybody
knows<00:02:56.390> what<00:02:56.510> stopping<00:02:56.750> power<00:02:56.870> by<00:02:57.110> by<00:02:57.470> far

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
knows what stopping power by by far

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.229 
knows what stopping power by by far
stopping<00:02:57.980> power<00:02:58.250> was<00:02:58.489> always<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.819> best<00:02:59.000> for

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
stopping power was always the best for

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.940 
stopping power was always the best for
it<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.840> lot<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.410> people<00:03:00.650> like<00:03:00.709> me<00:03:00.769> were

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
it so a lot of people like me were

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.900 
it so a lot of people like me were
disappointed<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.519> can<00:03:01.610> get<00:03:01.670> stuff<00:03:01.880> in

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
disappointed that you can get stuff in

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.300 
disappointed that you can get stuff in
power<00:03:02.150> in<00:03:02.239> here<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:03.140> don't<00:03:03.920> think<00:03:04.160> it's

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
power in here I don't think it's

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.100 
power in here I don't think it's
typically<00:03:05.239> overpowered<00:03:05.630> because<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.930> play

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
typically overpowered because if I play

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.930 
typically overpowered because if I play
a<00:03:06.140> custom<00:03:06.530> game<00:03:06.709> with<00:03:06.860> my<00:03:06.950> buddies<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.549> don't

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
a custom game with my buddies I don't

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.000 
a custom game with my buddies I don't
have<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.090> problem<00:03:08.239> with<00:03:08.450> ghost<00:03:08.780> users<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.349> think

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
have a problem with ghost users I think

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.130 
have a problem with ghost users I think
for<00:03:10.190> most<00:03:10.280> people<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.480> problem<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.930> that

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
for most people the problem is that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.870 
for most people the problem is that
there's<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.590> lot<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.739> campers<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.370> black<00:03:13.700> ops

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
there's a lot of campers and black ops

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.009 
there's a lot of campers and black ops
probably<00:03:14.209> more<00:03:14.390> than<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.600> word<00:03:14.720> modern

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
probably more than the word modern

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.039 
probably more than the word modern
warfare<00:03:15.170> 2<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.820> if<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.060> were<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.269> say<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.959> don't

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
warfare 2 so if you were to say I don't

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.660 
warfare 2 so if you were to say I don't
know<00:03:18.260> fifty<00:03:18.680> percent<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.190> call<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.640> duty

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
know fifty percent of the call of duty

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.090 
know fifty percent of the call of duty
black<00:03:19.940> ops<00:03:20.150> population<00:03:20.780> our<00:03:21.440> campers<00:03:21.920> right

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
black ops population our campers right

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.470 
black ops population our campers right
so<00:03:22.250> let's<00:03:22.370> say<00:03:22.489> fifty<00:03:22.670> percent<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.970> campers<00:03:23.329> of

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
so let's say fifty percent of campers of

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.910 
so let's say fifty percent of campers of
those<00:03:23.720> fifty<00:03:24.019> percent<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.590> would<00:03:24.709> imagine

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
those fifty percent I would imagine

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.370 
those fifty percent I would imagine
ninety-five<00:03:25.670> percent<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:26.120> those<00:03:26.209> guys<00:03:26.420> use<00:03:27.350> a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
ninety-five percent of those guys use a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.770 
ninety-five percent of those guys use a
ghost<00:03:28.280> which<00:03:28.850> is<00:03:28.970> strange<00:03:29.090> because<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.720> think

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
ghost which is strange because I think

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.360 
ghost which is strange because I think
using<00:03:30.109> flak<00:03:30.410> jacket<00:03:30.769> ease<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:30.980> tack<00:03:31.130> mask

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
using flak jacket ease and tack mask

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.270 
using flak jacket ease and tack mask
would<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.470> blackjack<00:03:33.470> antagonize<00:03:34.010> would<00:03:34.190> be

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
would be a blackjack antagonize would be

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.740 
would be a blackjack antagonize would be
a<00:03:34.310> better<00:03:34.459> solution<00:03:34.760> for<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> camp<00:03:35.299> hood<00:03:35.510> just

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
a better solution for a camp hood just

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.630 
a better solution for a camp hood just
don't<00:03:35.900> tell<00:03:36.049> them<00:03:36.109> that<00:03:36.170> right<00:03:36.560> so<00:03:37.430> with<00:03:37.549> that

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
don't tell them that right so with that

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.740 
don't tell them that right so with that
being<00:03:37.819> said<00:03:37.940> it's<00:03:38.209> kind<00:03:38.299> of<00:03:38.389> guilt<00:03:38.630> by

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
being said it's kind of guilt by

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.319 
being said it's kind of guilt by
association<00:03:38.989> it's<00:03:39.530> like<00:03:39.680> well<00:03:40.549> since<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.090> use

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
association it's like well since you use

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.150 
association it's like well since you use
goes<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.780> your<00:03:41.840> camper<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.620> since<00:03:43.010> your

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
goes to your camper and since your

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.129 
goes to your camper and since your
camper<00:03:43.459> I<00:03:43.489> don't<00:03:43.670> like<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:44.000> therefore<00:03:44.780> ghosts

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
camper I don't like you therefore ghosts

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.660 
camper I don't like you therefore ghosts
must<00:03:45.230> be<00:03:45.350> overpowered<00:03:45.829> so<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.280> don't

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
must be overpowered so I don't

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.390 
must be overpowered so I don't
necessarily<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.269> overpowered<00:03:47.780> but

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
necessarily think it's overpowered but

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.379 
necessarily think it's overpowered but
getting<00:03:49.400> ghost<00:03:49.639> pro<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.060> one<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.329> the

getting ghost pro that one of the

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.819 
getting ghost pro that one of the
reasons<00:03:50.660> why<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.780> only<00:03:50.989> have<00:03:51.170> one<00:03:51.350> goes<00:03:51.560> class

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
reasons why I only have one goes class

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.559 
reasons why I only have one goes class
and<00:03:52.130> i'll<00:03:52.850> probably<00:03:53.000> put<00:03:53.180> up<00:03:53.299> another<00:03:53.389> good

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
and i'll probably put up another good

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.110 
and i'll probably put up another good
class<00:03:53.900> because<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.230> lot<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.440> people<00:03:54.530> were

really bad team and the other two know
there's<00:04:08.389> bored<00:04:08.690> they're<00:04:08.959> probably<00:04:09.200> not<00:04:09.380> going

to<00:04:09.560> shoot<00:04:09.680> down<00:04:09.889> which<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.130> kind<00:04:10.280> of

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
to shoot down which is kind of

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.129 
to shoot down which is kind of
frustrating<00:04:10.489> for<00:04:10.850> me<00:04:10.940> because<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.480> figure<00:04:12.049> if

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
frustrating for me because I figure if

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.150 
frustrating for me because I figure if
you're<00:04:12.260> not<00:04:12.319> very<00:04:12.500> good<00:04:12.590> at<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:12.829> game<00:04:12.980> the

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
you're not very good at this game the

you're not very good at this game the
least<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.400> could<00:04:13.519> do<00:04:13.609> was<00:04:13.760> probably<00:04:13.970> shoot

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
least you could do was probably shoot

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.870 
least you could do was probably shoot
down<00:04:14.209> her<00:04:14.329> sport<00:04:14.630> but<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.470> lot<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.950> much<00:04:16.729> of

the community doesn't think like that so

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.320 
the community doesn't think like that so
if<00:04:18.680> there's<00:04:18.890> a<00:04:18.950> lot<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.099> air<00:04:19.250> support<00:04:19.640> in<00:04:20.209> the

frustrating things in any game I have no

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.150 
frustrating things in any game I have no
idea<00:04:51.180> how<00:04:51.480> they<00:04:52.139> would<00:04:52.260> resolve<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:52.889> was

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
idea how they would resolve that I was

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.490 
idea how they would resolve that I was
kind<00:04:53.340> of<00:04:53.600> pitching<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.780> idea<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.110> maybe

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
kind of pitching the idea that maybe

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.800 
kind of pitching the idea that maybe
there<00:04:55.710> should<00:04:55.860> be<00:04:55.919> a<00:04:55.950> playlist<00:04:56.340> where<00:04:56.810> the

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
there should be a playlist where the

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.570 
there should be a playlist where the
only<00:04:58.050> time<00:04:58.229> you<00:04:58.260> show<00:04:58.500> on<00:04:58.620> radar<00:04:59.010> is<00:04:59.250> if<00:04:59.460> you

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
only time you show on radar is if you

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.070 
only time you show on radar is if you
stay<00:04:59.790> still<00:05:00.120> kind<00:05:00.419> of<00:05:00.450> like<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.660> opposite<00:05:01.020> of

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
stay still kind of like the opposite of

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.540 
stay still kind of like the opposite of
the<00:05:01.200> halo<00:05:01.350> radar<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:01.889> if<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.070> were<00:05:02.160> moving<00:05:02.310> the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
the halo radar so if you were moving the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.490 
the halo radar so if you were moving the
whole<00:05:02.639> time<00:05:02.820> or<00:05:03.000> running<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:04.169> didn't<00:05:04.380> show<00:05:04.470> up

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
whole time or running you didn't show up

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.230 
whole time or running you didn't show up
on<00:05:04.680> radar<00:05:04.740> but<00:05:05.220> if<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.490> stayed<00:05:05.669> still<00:05:05.910> for<00:05:05.970> too

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
on radar but if you stayed still for too

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.700 
on radar but if you stayed still for too
long<00:05:06.389> you<00:05:06.450> would<00:05:06.690> pop<00:05:06.840> up<00:05:06.870> on<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.110> radar<00:05:07.200> then

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
long you would pop up on the radar then

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.200 
long you would pop up on the radar then
that<00:05:08.250> could<00:05:08.340> be<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.490> solution<00:05:08.760> of<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:09.000> but<00:05:09.180> I

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
that could be a solution of that but I

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.400 
that could be a solution of that but I
don't<00:05:09.330> know<00:05:09.419> how<00:05:09.479> that<00:05:09.510> would<00:05:09.660> work<00:05:09.750> or<00:05:10.200> people

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
don't know how that would work or people

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.140 
don't know how that would work or people
would<00:05:10.500> even<00:05:10.530> like<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:11.010> right<00:05:11.820> here<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.030> get

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
would even like that right here I get

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.670 
would even like that right here I get
kind<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.450> good<00:05:12.630> streak<00:05:12.990> going<00:05:13.139> I<00:05:13.380> go<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.560> the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
kind of a good streak going I go to the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.930 
kind of a good streak going I go to the
place<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.950> told<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.190> guys<00:05:14.250> not<00:05:14.340> to<00:05:14.520> go<00:05:14.729> through

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
place I told you guys not to go through

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
but I'm kind of trying to fight my way

even younger who brought shouldn't be
playing<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:32.970> game<00:06:33.120> but<00:06:33.630> you<00:06:33.720> know<00:06:33.810> they<00:06:33.930> play

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
playing the game but you know they play

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.100 
playing the game but you know they play
cause<00:06:34.260> it's<00:06:34.380> on<00:06:34.500> live<00:06:34.760> it's<00:06:35.760> kind<00:06:35.880> of

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
cause it's on live it's kind of

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.440 
cause it's on live it's kind of
heartening<00:06:36.440> to<00:06:36.500> know<00:06:36.680> that<00:06:36.980> people<00:06:37.430> go<00:06:38.210> out<00:06:38.240> of

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
heartening to know that people go out of

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.600 
heartening to know that people go out of
their<00:06:38.630> way<00:06:38.750> to<00:06:39.230> you<00:06:39.980> know<00:06:40.100> trying<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.400> make<00:06:40.520> you

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
reason why I uses one cuz I don't have

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.440 
reason why I uses one cuz I don't have
enough<00:07:33.710> money<00:07:33.890> and<00:07:34.190> to<00:07:34.400> sometimes<00:07:34.970> I<00:07:35.150> wanted
