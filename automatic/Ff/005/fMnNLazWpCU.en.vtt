okay<00:00:10.370> you<00:00:11.370> know<00:00:11.460> how<00:00:11.580> before<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.000> was<00:00:12.179> talking

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
okay you know how before I was talking

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.910 
okay you know how before I was talking
about<00:00:12.480> don't<00:00:12.809> rely<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.380> instructions

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
about don't rely on the instructions

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.150 
about don't rely on the instructions
well<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> fell<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:15.929> own<00:00:16.109> fell<00:00:16.920> into<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
well I fell for my own fell into the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210 
well I fell for my own fell into the
trap<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.580> doing<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:18.199> and<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> perfect

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
trap of doing that and this is a perfect

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.330 
trap of doing that and this is a perfect
example<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.060> great<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.720> happened

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
example so it's great that it happened

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.200 
example so it's great that it happened
right<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.720> leading-edge<00:00:25.619> doubler

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
right here is a leading-edge doubler

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.200 
right here is a leading-edge doubler
that<00:00:27.260> has<00:00:28.260> two<00:00:28.619> separate<00:00:29.070> pieces<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.060> can

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that has two separate pieces as you can

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.950 
that has two separate pieces as you can
see<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.369> as<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.210> only<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.570> needed

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
see here and as there is only one needed

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
see here and as there is only one needed
you<00:00:34.020> might<00:00:34.170> ask<00:00:34.410> him<00:00:34.500> why<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.860> two

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
you might ask him why do you have two

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.660 
you might ask him why do you have two
sets<00:00:35.250> well<00:00:35.960> the<00:00:36.960> first<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.410> where<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.489> actual

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
sets well the first one where the actual

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.720 
sets well the first one where the actual
die-cut<00:00:39.180> parts<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.530> glued<00:00:40.829> together<00:00:40.950> but

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
die-cut parts that I glued together but

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.369 
die-cut parts that I glued together but
I<00:00:41.969> did<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.450> pay<00:00:42.690> attention<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
I did not pay attention to the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
I did not pay attention to the
instructions<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.059> know<00:00:45.180> ahead<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> time

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
instructions but I know ahead of time

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
instructions but I know ahead of time
how<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.350> supposed<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.430> look

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
how it's supposed to be and if you look

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.229 
how it's supposed to be and if you look
here<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:50.430> other<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:54.000> difference

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
here the other is that that difference

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
here the other is that that difference
in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> space<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.190> should<00:00:56.370> be

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
in the space there that should be

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.880 
in the space there that should be
aligned<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.690> bottom<00:00:58.109> should<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.620> aligned

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
aligned the bottom should not be aligned

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.790 
aligned the bottom should not be aligned
and<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> did<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.289> lined<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.500> part

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and that's what I did I lined this part

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.039 
and that's what I did I lined this part
on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.940> bottoms<00:01:03.449> leaving<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:05.630> space<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on the bottoms leaving a space on the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
on the bottoms leaving a space on the
top<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> gap<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.100> that's<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.210> was

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
top a gap here that's not how it was

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
top a gap here that's not how it was
supposed<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:10.170> were<00:01:10.290> supposed<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> be

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
supposed to be they were supposed to be

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.670 
supposed to be they were supposed to be
aligned<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:12.450> slots<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.140> those<00:01:13.650> were

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
aligned in the slots here those were

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
aligned in the slots here those were
supposed<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.250> flush<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.939> another<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
supposed to be flush with one another as

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.310 
supposed to be flush with one another as
you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.350> they're<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
you can see they're not and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.890 
you can see they're not and
unfortunately<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.560> gluing<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.600> with<00:01:21.600> CA

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
unfortunately with gluing that with CA

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.980 
unfortunately with gluing that with CA
there's<00:01:22.350> no<00:01:22.650> real<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> pry<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> apart<00:01:24.450> so

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
there's no real way to pry that apart so

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.010 
there's no real way to pry that apart so
instead<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.880> being<00:01:26.880> frustrated<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.659> trying

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
instead of being frustrated and trying

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.249 
instead of being frustrated and trying
to<00:01:28.170> rip<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.890> apart<00:01:29.189> unsuccessfully<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.259> just

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
to rip that apart unsuccessfully I just

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.460 
to rip that apart unsuccessfully I just
made<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> couple<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> new<00:01:32.009> ones<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:34.350> was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
made a couple of new ones and it was

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.700 
made a couple of new ones and it was
pretty<00:01:34.619> easy<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.909> did<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
pretty easy to do all I did is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.730 
pretty easy to do all I did is
thankfully<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> scraps<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> saved<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
thankfully the scraps that I saved I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.230 
thankfully the scraps that I saved I
laid<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:42.360> original<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
laid out the original on here is the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.140 
laid out the original on here is the
original

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
original

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.310 
original
that<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.840> had<00:01:47.960> already<00:01:49.030> made<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.480> traced<00:01:51.110> it

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
that I had already made and I traced it

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.760 
that I had already made and I traced it
out<00:01:51.440> all<00:01:52.430> along<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.000> edges<00:01:53.150> here<00:01:53.480> and<00:01:53.770> that

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
out all along the edges here and that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.600 
out all along the edges here and that
gave<00:01:54.980> me<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.250> pattern<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:57.050> then<00:01:57.230> cut<00:01:57.860> out<00:01:58.070> each

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
gave me the pattern to then cut out each

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.080 
gave me the pattern to then cut out each
of<00:01:58.820> these<00:01:58.910> pieces<00:01:59.150> so<00:01:59.620> not<00:02:00.620> only<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:02.000> good

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
of these pieces so not only is it a good

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.930 
of these pieces so not only is it a good
idea<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.470> think<00:02:03.470> ahead<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.460> time<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:04.820> also

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
idea to think ahead of time and also

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.450 
idea to think ahead of time and also
read<00:02:05.390> your<00:02:05.540> instruction<00:02:05.930> clearly<00:02:06.380> but<00:02:07.220> also

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
read your instruction clearly but also

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.270 
read your instruction clearly but also
what<00:02:08.300> I've<00:02:08.450> mentioned<00:02:08.600> before<00:02:08.810> many<00:02:09.259> times<00:02:09.530> is

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
what I've mentioned before many times is

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.750 
what I've mentioned before many times is
save<00:02:11.210> your<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:12.830> scraps<00:02:13.160> because<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.640> never

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
save your your scraps because you never

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.920 
save your your scraps because you never
know<00:02:13.970> when<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.210> might<00:02:14.330> eat<00:02:14.510> them<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.750> this

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
know when you might eat them in this

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.720 
know when you might eat them in this
case<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.440> needed<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.490> draw<00:02:16.850> out<00:02:17.120> two<00:02:17.900> new

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
case I needed it to draw out two new

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.270 
case I needed it to draw out two new
doublers<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.030> leading<00:02:20.240> edge<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
doublers for this leading edge and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.650
