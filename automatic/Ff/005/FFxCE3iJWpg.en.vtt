00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
improvising over this kind of chord

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.170 
improvising over this kind of chord
progression<00:00:48.430> you<00:00:49.430> know<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.579> lot<00:00:49.700> you<00:00:49.730> guys<00:00:49.969> like

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
progression you know a lot you guys like

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.810 
progression you know a lot you guys like
to<00:00:50.329> use<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.570> pentatonic<00:00:50.930> cover<00:00:51.489> can<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:52.610> take

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
to use the pentatonic cover can you take

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.900 
to use the pentatonic cover can you take
our<00:00:53.059> progression<00:00:53.510> which<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:53.840> cool<00:00:54.250> but<00:00:55.250> I

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
our progression which is cool but I

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.740 
our progression which is cool but I
think<00:00:56.449> it's<00:00:56.570> good<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.899> start<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:57.469> develop<00:00:57.710> some

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
think it's good to start to develop some

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.840 
think it's good to start to develop some
targeting<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.870> cartons<00:01:00.410> when<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:00.980> familiar

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
targeting of cartons when you familiar

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.999 
targeting of cartons when you familiar
with<00:01:01.879> using<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.300> pentatonic<00:01:02.570> scale<00:01:03.079> so<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
with using a pentatonic scale so the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.740 
with using a pentatonic scale so the
idea<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.339> I'm<00:01:04.460> going<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.610> show<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:05.449> camp

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
idea that I'm going to show you it camp

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.779 
idea that I'm going to show you it camp
happens<00:01:06.110> really<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.619> end<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.890> bar<00:01:07.100> for<00:01:07.460> a

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
happens really the end of bar for a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:18.969 
happens really the end of bar for a
4-barrel<00:01:08.690> veena<00:01:08.869> malik<00:01:09.649> by<00:01:10.280> itself<00:01:10.610> goes<00:01:17.979> so

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
4-barrel veena malik by itself goes so

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.130 
4-barrel veena malik by itself goes so
it's<00:01:19.160> kind<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.520> Vern<00:01:19.820> Adele<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.509> blues<00:01:20.720> idea

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
it's kind of Vern Adele the blues idea

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.399 
it's kind of Vern Adele the blues idea
mixed<00:01:21.830> into<00:01:22.070> something<00:01:22.460> kind<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.119> jazzy<00:01:23.409> okay

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
mixed into something kind of jazzy okay

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.330 
mixed into something kind of jazzy okay
so<00:01:24.470> what<00:01:24.680> we're<00:01:24.799> doing<00:01:24.830> is<00:01:25.100> we're<00:01:25.280> starting

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
so what we're doing is we're starting

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.789 
so what we're doing is we're starting
with<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.150> little<00:01:26.450> shape<00:01:26.720> here<00:01:26.990> which<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:27.770> a

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
with this little shape here which is a

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.490 
with this little shape here which is a
7th<00:01:28.250> fret<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.610> top<00:01:28.790> E<00:01:28.820> string<00:01:28.960> then<00:01:29.960> 8th<00:01:30.200> fret

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
7th fret the top E string then 8th fret

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.749 
7th fret the top E string then 8th fret
of<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.590> B<00:01:30.799> string<00:01:30.829> we're<00:01:31.820> bending<00:01:32.030> up<00:01:32.240> twice

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
of the B string we're bending up twice

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.240 
of the B string we're bending up twice
and<00:01:34.759> we<00:01:35.479> kind<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.840> then<00:01:36.049> bending<00:01:36.920> as<00:01:37.100> we're

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
and we kind of then bending as we're

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.929 
and we kind of then bending as we're
picking<00:01:39.729> okay<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.090> doing<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.329> spice<00:01:42.939> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
picking okay so doing that spice and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.149 
picking okay so doing that spice and
then<00:01:44.750> I'm<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.049> matically<00:01:45.560> down<00:01:45.829> from

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
then I'm going to matically down from

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.609 
then I'm going to matically down from
the<00:01:46.250> 9th<00:01:46.490> fret<00:01:46.759> of<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.119> g<00:01:47.420> string<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.200> 6th

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
the 9th fret of the g string to the 6th

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.170 
the 9th fret of the g string to the 6th
fret<00:01:51.829> and<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.310> significant<00:01:52.850> thing<00:01:53.000> about

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
fret and the significant thing about

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.639 
fret and the significant thing about
this<00:01:53.329> is<00:01:53.479> we're<00:01:53.630> going<00:01:53.810> from<00:01:54.110> E<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:56.180> D<00:01:56.210> sharp<00:01:56.649> to

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
this is we're going from E to D sharp to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.330 
this is we're going from E to D sharp to
D<00:01:57.829> to<00:01:58.700> C<00:01:58.909> sharp<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.570> C<00:01:59.840> sharp

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
D to C sharp and C sharp

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.039 
D to C sharp and C sharp
it's<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:02.000> third<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.840> farquard<00:02:03.409> air<00:02:03.560> 7<00:02:05.049> so

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
it's a third of the farquard air 7 so

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.719 
it's a third of the farquard air 7 so
outlining<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.799> chord<00:02:07.100> perfectly<00:02:07.610> were

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
outlining that chord perfectly were

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.500 
outlining that chord perfectly were
really<00:02:08.800> hits<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.950> nail<00:02:10.069> on<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.610> head<00:02:10.819> with<00:02:11.180> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
really hits the nail on the head with a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.860 
really hits the nail on the head with a
sharp<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.500> sari<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.190> c-sharp<00:02:13.370> or<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.970> air<00:02:14.150> so

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
sharp of a sari of c-sharp or the air so

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.030 
sharp of a sari of c-sharp or the air so
this<00:02:15.110> again<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:16.010> bend<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.650> then<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
this again is a bend and then the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.380 
this again is a bend and then the
chromatic<00:02:19.489> run<00:02:20.860> -<00:02:21.860> yeah<00:02:22.730> sure

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
chromatic run - yeah sure

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.170 
chromatic run - yeah sure
so<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.750> see<00:02:23.989> sharpen<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.580> chord<00:02:25.849> is<00:02:26.000> there

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
so you see sharpen the chord is there

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.199 
so you see sharpen the chord is there
another<00:02:26.660> suture<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:31.190> there<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
another suture so there is a you know a

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.410 
another suture so there is a you know a
simple<00:02:32.360> idea<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:33.110> I'll<00:02:33.470> just<00:02:34.000> make<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.180> color

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
simple idea but I'll just make the color

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.729 
simple idea but I'll just make the color
change<00:02:35.750> down<00:02:36.049> a<00:02:36.080> little<00:02:36.290> bit<00:02:36.530> less

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
change down a little bit less

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.259 
change down a little bit less
predictable<00:02:37.340> really<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:37.910> you're<00:02:38.030> playing

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
predictable really when you're playing

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.330 
predictable really when you're playing
you<00:02:38.630> know<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.230> know<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.560> kind<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.190> it's

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
you know you know this kind of it's

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.800 
you know you know this kind of it's
world<00:02:40.519> bar<00:02:40.730> blues<00:02:40.940> at<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.180> jam<00:02:41.420> or<00:02:41.450> something
