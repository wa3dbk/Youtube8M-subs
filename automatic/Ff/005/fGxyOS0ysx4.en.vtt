00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
thing I think happened just random and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.560 
thing I think happened just random and
it's<00:02:51.250> probably<00:02:51.550> will<00:02:51.760> never<00:02:51.940> happen<00:02:52.300> again

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
it's probably will never happen again

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.100 
it's probably will never happen again
well<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:54.670> was<00:02:54.760> ridiculous<00:02:55.270> this<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.840> an

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
well it was ridiculous this is just an

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.440 
well it was ridiculous this is just an
example<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.980> like<00:02:57.160> what<00:02:57.400> good<00:02:57.580> 15<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.240> can<00:02:58.360> do

example of like what good 15 you can do
and<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.690> think<00:02:58.870> it's<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.740> direction<00:03:00.010> now<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.280> think

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
and I think it's a direction now I think

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.860 
and I think it's a direction now I think
we<00:03:00.580> need<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.820> like<00:03:01.000> start<00:03:01.270> studying<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.780> the
