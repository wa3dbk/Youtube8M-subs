because<00:01:40.740> all<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> other<00:01:41.280> themes<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.640> they

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
because all the other themes that they

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.789 
because all the other themes that they
used<00:01:42.060> were<00:01:42.240> from<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.570> series<00:01:42.899> 1<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.259> 2<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.649> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
used were from like series 1 or 2 but I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.899 
used were from like series 1 or 2 but I
thought<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.070> dropped<00:01:44.369> some<00:01:44.490> trucks<00:01:44.759> theme

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
thought that dropped some trucks theme

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
thought that dropped some trucks theme
was<00:01:45.060> from<00:01:45.210> much<00:01:45.450> later<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.990> thought<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> was

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
was from much later I thought it was

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.770 
was from much later I thought it was
like<00:01:46.920> series<00:01:47.250> 8<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.670> something<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.240> don't<00:01:48.630> know

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
like series 8 or something I don't know

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
like series 8 or something I don't know
I<00:01:48.840> liked<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.560> was<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.130> kind

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I liked that it was in there I just kind

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.550 
I liked that it was in there I just kind
of<00:01:51.119> caught<00:01:51.270> me<00:01:51.299> off<00:01:51.630> guard<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.079> wasn't<00:01:52.170> really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
of caught me off guard I wasn't really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440 
of caught me off guard I wasn't really
expecting<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.360> glad

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
expecting it to be in there but I'm glad

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
expecting it to be in there but I'm glad
it<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.920> themes<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.430> used

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it was all the themes that they used

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.080 
it was all the themes that they used
really<00:01:57.509> blew<00:01:57.689> me<00:01:57.840> away<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.350> these<00:01:59.009> these

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
really blew me away just these these

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.340 
really blew me away just these these
themes<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.509> understand<00:02:00.930> these<00:02:01.110> are

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
themes you have to understand these are

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.490 
themes you have to understand these are
like<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> piece<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.920> my<00:02:02.219> soul<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> hear<00:02:04.290> them

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
like a piece of my soul so to hear them

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.990 
like a piece of my soul so to hear them
for<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> first<00:02:04.979> time<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.340> years<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.820> here's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
for the first time in years and here's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.429 
for the first time in years and here's
the<00:02:06.119> thing<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.390> didn't<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:06.719> redo<00:02:07.079> them<00:02:07.290> I

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
the thing they didn't just redo them I

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.559 
the thing they didn't just redo them I
mean<00:02:07.649> they<00:02:07.740> didn't<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.369> reuse<00:02:08.729> them<00:02:08.970> they

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
mean they didn't just reuse them they

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.589 
mean they didn't just reuse them they
redid<00:02:10.170> them<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.180> they<00:02:12.180> got<00:02:12.390> Robert

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
redid them they like they got Robert

composer they like had him redo it and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.670 
composer they like had him redo it and
you<00:02:21.510> might<00:02:21.630> think<00:02:21.900> oh<00:02:22.050> no<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:22.530> they're

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
you might think oh no now they're

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.140 
you might think oh no now they're
different<00:02:22.860> now<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:23.310> they<00:02:23.490> are<00:02:23.610> better<00:02:23.910> than

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
different now but they are better than

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.880 
different now but they are better than
they<00:02:24.270> used<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.660> they<00:02:24.780> actually<00:02:25.230> matched

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
they used to be they actually matched

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.830 
they used to be they actually matched
the<00:02:26.100> style<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.700> music<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.600> in

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the style of the music that is like in

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.750 
the style of the music that is like in
the<00:02:27.930> series<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.400> makes<00:02:29.580> any<00:02:29.640> sense

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the series now if that makes any sense

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.750 
the series now if that makes any sense
they<00:02:30.120> sound<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.930> fit<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.430> suit

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
they sound like it fit in like they suit

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.180 
they sound like it fit in like they suit
the<00:02:33.090> CGI<00:02:33.440> because<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.650> original<00:02:34.800> themes

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the CGI because the original themes

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.310 
the CGI because the original themes
don't<00:02:35.460> really<00:02:35.640> suit<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:35.940> CGI<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:37.140> makes

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
don't really suit the CGI if that makes

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.810 
don't really suit the CGI if that makes
any<00:02:37.470> sense<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.830> they<00:02:37.920> don't<00:02:38.040> really<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.460> don't

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
any sense like they don't really I don't

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.880 
any sense like they don't really I don't
know<00:02:38.940> they<00:02:39.060> don't<00:02:39.120> really<00:02:39.210> match<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:40.650> way<00:02:40.740> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
know they don't really match the way the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.400 
know they don't really match the way the
CGI<00:02:41.190> looks<00:02:41.550> but<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.570> way<00:02:42.660> they<00:02:42.810> remixed<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.290> it

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
CGI looks but the way they remixed it it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.530 
CGI looks but the way they remixed it it
totally<00:02:43.590> works<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.760> love<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.300> they<00:02:45.390> did

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
totally works and I love that they did

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.640 
totally works and I love that they did
this<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> move<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.170> movie<00:02:46.410> would<00:02:46.500> not

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
this the move in the movie would not

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.270 
this the move in the movie would not
have<00:02:46.770> been<00:02:46.890> half<00:02:47.550> as<00:02:47.730> good<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.890> because

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
have been half as good as it is because

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.490 
have been half as good as it is because
they<00:02:50.400> did<00:02:50.460> this<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.690> said<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.050> movie<00:02:52.350> is

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
they did this like I said this movie is

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.620 
they did this like I said this movie is
an<00:02:52.680> emotional<00:02:53.160> roller<00:02:53.190> coaster<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:54.060> had<00:02:54.540> to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
an emotional roller coaster I had to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.970 
an emotional roller coaster I had to
keep<00:02:54.750> walking<00:02:55.140> away<00:02:55.230> from<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.710> taking

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
keep walking away from it and taking

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.740 
keep walking away from it and taking
little<00:02:56.130> breaks<00:02:56.400> because<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.180> was<00:02:57.300> getting<00:02:57.420> too

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
little breaks because I was getting too

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.450 
little breaks because I was getting too
emotional<00:02:58.500> about<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.890> movie<00:02:59.130> as<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.340> was

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
emotional about the movie as I was

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.250 
emotional about the movie as I was
watching<00:02:59.820> it<00:02:59.940> every<00:03:00.510> two<00:03:00.630> minutes<00:03:00.930> something

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
watching it every two minutes something

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.310 
watching it every two minutes something
would<00:03:01.440> come<00:03:01.680> out<00:03:02.070> there<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> make<00:03:02.400> me<00:03:02.550> go<00:03:03.320> like

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
would come out there to make me go like

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.800 
would come out there to make me go like
I<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.560> had<00:03:05.010> my<00:03:05.160> hand<00:03:05.460> over<00:03:05.970> my<00:03:06.090> mouth<00:03:06.240> through

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
I I had my hand over my mouth through

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.840 
I I had my hand over my mouth through
most<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.350> movie<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.860> was<00:03:08.240> intense<00:03:09.240> um<00:03:09.750> and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
most of this movie it was intense um and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.340 
aren't really they had to kind of mess
with<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.910> chronological<00:04:56.389> order<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:57.050> some

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
with the chronological order of some

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.689 
with the chronological order of some
things<00:04:57.680> in<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.919> railway<00:04:58.190> series<00:04:58.310> which<00:04:58.580> I

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
things in the railway series which I

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.870 
things in the railway series which I
understand<00:05:00.220> because<00:05:01.220> they<00:05:01.310> actually<00:05:01.460> went<00:05:01.760> in

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
understand because they actually went in

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.250 
understand because they actually went in
a<00:05:01.970> more<00:05:02.120> detail<00:05:02.449> with<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.660> lot<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:02.900> elements

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
a more detail with a lot of elements

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.930 
a more detail with a lot of elements
from<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.770> early<00:05:04.010> stories<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.610> actual

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
from the early stories and the actual

from the early stories and the actual
early<00:05:05.270> stories<00:05:05.630> did<00:05:05.810> which<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.110> love<00:05:06.380> although

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
early stories did which I love although

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.460 
early stories did which I love although
they're<00:05:07.580> in<00:05:07.669> different<00:05:07.970> order<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:09.080> one<00:05:09.229> thing

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
they're in different order the one thing

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.900 
they're in different order the one thing
that<00:05:09.620> really<00:05:09.710> bugged<00:05:10.070> me<00:05:10.190> was<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.520> Henry<00:05:10.850> is

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
that really bugged me was the Henry is

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.969 
that really bugged me was the Henry is
in<00:05:10.970> his<00:05:11.180> new<00:05:11.330> shape<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.870> don't<00:05:12.560> get<00:05:12.740> why<00:05:12.830> they

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
in his new shape I don't get why they

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.080 
in his new shape I don't get why they
did<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.280> don't<00:05:13.430> know<00:05:13.550> how<00:05:13.669> hard<00:05:13.880> it<00:05:14.030> would

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
did that I don't know how hard it would

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.719 
did that I don't know how hard it would
have<00:05:14.210> been<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.419> just<00:05:14.539> model<00:05:14.870> him<00:05:15.050> in<00:05:15.139> CGI<00:05:15.729> I

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
have been to just model him in CGI I

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.340 
have been to just model him in CGI I
don't<00:05:17.570> know<00:05:17.630> maybe<00:05:17.780> it<00:05:17.900> was<00:05:17.990> cost<00:05:18.199> prohibitive

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
don't know maybe it was cost prohibitive

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.710 
don't know maybe it was cost prohibitive
but<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:18.979> can't<00:05:19.310> imagine<00:05:19.400> that<00:05:19.699> it<00:05:19.880> was<00:05:20.000> with<00:05:20.270> the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
but I can't imagine that it was with the

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.080 
but I can't imagine that it was with the
constant<00:05:21.680> barrage<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:22.190> new<00:05:22.400> characters<00:05:22.639> they

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
constant barrage of new characters they

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.070 
constant barrage of new characters they
introduced<00:05:23.449> I<00:05:23.510> don't<00:05:23.630> know<00:05:23.690> why<00:05:23.780> they<00:05:23.900> can't

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
introduced I don't know why they can't

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.390 
introduced I don't know why they can't
just<00:05:24.260> make<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.410> Henry<00:05:24.680> in<00:05:24.889> his<00:05:24.919> old<00:05:25.130> shape

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
just make a Henry in his old shape

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.879 
just make a Henry in his old shape
because<00:05:26.300> I<00:05:26.600> understand<00:05:27.320> they<00:05:27.440> mess<00:05:27.620> with<00:05:27.800> the

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
because I understand they mess with the

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.350 
because I understand they mess with the
chronological<00:05:28.460> order<00:05:28.699> of<00:05:28.820> some<00:05:29.000> stuff<00:05:29.180> for

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
chronological order of some stuff for

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.090 
chronological order of some stuff for
the<00:05:29.419> sake<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.630> storytelling<00:05:30.169> but<00:05:30.440> why<00:05:31.039> is

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
the sake of storytelling but why is

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.250 
the sake of storytelling but why is
Henry<00:05:31.340> in<00:05:31.550> his<00:05:31.669> new<00:05:31.910> shape<00:05:32.180> that<00:05:32.900> why<00:05:33.020> did<00:05:33.169> that

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
Henry in his new shape that why did that

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.200 
Henry in his new shape that why did that
have<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.620> be<00:05:33.740> that's<00:05:34.280> my<00:05:34.430> only<00:05:34.849> gripe<00:05:35.030> with

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
have to be that's my only gripe with

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.600 
have to be that's my only gripe with
this<00:05:35.389> movie<00:05:35.690> everything<00:05:36.050> else<00:05:36.229> was<00:05:37.190> awesome
