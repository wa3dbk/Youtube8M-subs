going to burn the edges of this
birdhouse<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.500> make<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.800> look<00:00:11.429> more<00:00:11.900> narrow<00:00:12.900> we

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
birdhouse to make it look more narrow we

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.259 
birdhouse to make it look more narrow we
got<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.469> that's<00:00:14.309> first<00:00:14.580> time<00:00:14.670> several<00:00:15.059> it

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
got it that's first time several it

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.140 
got it that's first time several it
first<00:00:15.630> time<00:00:15.839> line<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.850> come

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
first time line so what we do is come

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840 
first time line so what we do is come
along<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.690> if<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.250> light<00:00:20.460> color<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
along here if you see the light color of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.880 
along here if you see the light color of
the<00:00:20.939> wood<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.810> we'll<00:00:22.439> just<00:00:22.619> kind<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
the wood there and we'll just kind of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.810 
the wood there and we'll just kind of
make<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.070> look<00:00:23.310> darker<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.779> looks<00:00:25.140> more

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
make it look darker so it looks more

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.960 
make it look darker so it looks more
original<00:00:27.590> most<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.670> doesn't

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
original most of this and it doesn't

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.020 
original most of this and it doesn't
take<00:00:30.119> too<00:00:30.330> long<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:31.189> do<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:34.460> what<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.550> like

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
take too long to do it and what I like

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.060 
take too long to do it and what I like
to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> edges<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.170> raw<00:00:37.620> edge<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
to do all the edges that raw edge is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.910 
to do all the edges that raw edge is
what<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.399> saw<00:00:38.750> because<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.379> makes<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> look

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
what you saw because it it makes it look

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.880 
what you saw because it it makes it look
so<00:00:40.950> much<00:00:41.250> nicer<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.559> looks<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so much nicer and then in it it looks a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.279 
so much nicer and then in it it looks a
lot<00:00:44.010> older<00:00:44.070> looking<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> wood<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.960> old

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
lot older looking and the wood is old

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.290 
lot older looking and the wood is old
but<00:00:46.530> when<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> cut<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.730> still<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.239> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
but when you cut it it's still kind of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
but when you cut it it's still kind of
on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.110> inside<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> take<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
on the inside there so you take the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.110 
on the inside there so you take the
torch<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> burn<00:00:52.969> burn<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
torch and you just kind of burn burn it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.290 
torch and you just kind of burn burn it
in<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.129> color<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.090> little

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
in there and that that color a little

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.830 
in there and that that color a little
bit<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> it'll<00:00:57.899> come<00:00:58.050> off<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.600> like

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
bit of it'll come off and I I don't like

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.039 
bit of it'll come off and I I don't like
to<00:01:01.020> use<00:01:01.230> any<00:01:01.440> finish<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.219> birdhouses

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
to use any finish on my birdhouses

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.100 
to use any finish on my birdhouses
because<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.350> find<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.339> don't<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.119> why<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
because I find that I don't know why but

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.590 
because I find that I don't know why but
birds<00:01:07.409> seem<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:08.070> when<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.210> finished

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
birds seem to know when it's finished

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.020 
birds seem to know when it's finished
with<00:01:10.409> some<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.159> lack<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.490> something

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
with some kind of a lack or something

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.250 
with some kind of a lack or something
like<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.990> at<00:01:13.110> all

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
like that and they don't like it at all

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530 
like that and they don't like it at all
so<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> chimneys<00:01:15.270> too

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so what I like to do on the chimneys too

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
so what I like to do on the chimneys too
is<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> hold<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> middle<00:01:18.000> there

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
is I like to hold it in the middle there

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.929 
is I like to hold it in the middle there
and<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:19.200> burn<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.590> chimneys<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and really burn the chimneys because the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.810 
and really burn the chimneys because the
chimneys<00:01:21.860> usually<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.009> pretty<00:01:23.040> book<00:01:23.490> burned

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
chimneys usually are pretty book burned

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.170 
chimneys usually are pretty book burned
it<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:25.080> after<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.100> burn<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> inside<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.060> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it but after I burn the inside of it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.440 
it but after I burn the inside of it
real<00:01:27.330> good<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.680> come<00:01:28.950> down<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.880> let<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
real good then I come down and let it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.780 
real good then I come down and let it
burn<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> outside<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.680> bit<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.610> make

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
burn on the outside a little bit to make

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.539 
burn on the outside a little bit to make
it<00:01:32.939> look<00:01:33.119> more<00:01:33.150> real<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.189> course<00:01:35.400> on

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it look more real and then of course on

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
it look more real and then of course on
your<00:01:35.579> roof<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> always<00:01:36.810> got<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
your roof you know you always got a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.319 
your roof you know you always got a
burnt<00:01:37.979> place<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.460> your<00:01:38.610> roof<00:01:38.759> where<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> comes

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
burnt place on your roof where it comes

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.800 
burnt place on your roof where it comes
down<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.250> take<00:01:41.460> him<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> run<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
down and so you just take him and run it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.859 
down and so you just take him and run it
down<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.290> way<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.790> then<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.390> looks<00:01:45.630> more

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
down that way and and then it looks more

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.480 
down that way and and then it looks more
original<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.500> looks<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.799> you've<00:01:46.979> had<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.159> fire

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
original it looks like you've had a fire

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.840 
original it looks like you've had a fire
in<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.710> we've<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> back<00:01:50.220> edges<00:01:50.700> here

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
in it and we've got the back edges here

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.969 
in it and we've got the back edges here
to<00:01:51.000> do<00:01:51.149> about<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.509> say<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.290> had<00:01:52.470> two<00:01:52.710> rides

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
to do about to say if you had two rides

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.670 
to do about to say if you had two rides
it's<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.820> may<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:55.079> nice<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.500> use

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it's like this may be really nice to use

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
it's like this may be really nice to use
is<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> older<00:01:56.399> edges<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.689> there's<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:58.020> really

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
is the older edges so there's not really

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.410 
is the older edges so there's not really
a<00:01:58.439> lot<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.939> takes<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.270> little

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
a lot to do it it just takes a little

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.060 
a lot to do it it just takes a little
time<00:02:00.540> sometimes<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> burn<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
time sometimes you want to burn it a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.810 
time sometimes you want to burn it a
little<00:02:02.250> bit<00:02:02.490> darker<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
little bit darker and

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.649 
little bit darker and
but<00:02:04.659> I'd<00:02:05.050> like<00:02:05.230> to<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.700> leave<00:02:06.880> it'll<00:02:07.120> just

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
but I'd like to to leave it'll just

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.330 
but I'd like to to leave it'll just
pretty<00:02:07.900> close<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.470> same<00:02:08.679> color<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.160> wood

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
pretty close to the same color of wood

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.360 
pretty close to the same color of wood
that<00:02:09.369> was<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:09.910> there<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.710> go<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.070> next

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
that was on there we can go to the next

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.660 
that was on there we can go to the next
segment<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.620> you'll<00:02:14.620> finish<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.010> finish<00:02:15.430> it

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
segment and you'll finish it finish it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.290 
segment and you'll finish it finish it
up<00:02:15.820> I'll<00:02:16.000> show<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.270> my<00:02:16.450> little<00:02:16.630> trademarks
