00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
then I'm just going to start rolling the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.259 
then I'm just going to start rolling the
paper<00:03:13.180> off<00:03:13.780> very<00:03:14.440> gently<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.550> you<00:03:15.850> could<00:03:16.060> see

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
paper off very gently so you could see

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.479 
paper off very gently so you could see
there<00:03:16.540> it's<00:03:17.019> starting<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.560> reveal<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.220> would

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
there it's starting to reveal so I would

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.560 
there it's starting to reveal so I would
continue<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.030> do<00:03:19.299> all<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.720> rest<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.230> these<00:03:20.410> and

continue to do all the rest of these and

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.880 
continue to do all the rest of these and
then<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.690> would<00:03:22.810> look<00:03:22.959> something<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.470> this

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
then it would look something like this

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.690 
then it would look something like this

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
and I brush it around and it removes

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.229 
and I brush it around and it removes
those<00:03:34.090> last<00:03:34.480> little<00:03:34.840> bit<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.200> fuzzies<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:37.030> now

I finish the transfer and what I'm going
to<00:03:40.030> do<00:03:40.420> is<00:03:40.930> cut<00:03:41.769> out<00:03:41.980> these<00:03:42.519> flowers<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.510> you

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
to do is cut out these flowers and you

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.640 
to do is cut out these flowers and you
can<00:03:44.200> see<00:03:44.500> here<00:03:45.280> where<00:03:45.940> parts<00:03:46.570> of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.900> transfer

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
can see here where parts of the transfer

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.890 
can see here where parts of the transfer
are<00:03:47.950> lighter<00:03:48.310> than<00:03:48.700> others<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:49.630> what

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
are lighter than others but that's what

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.930 
are lighter than others but that's what
I<00:03:49.930> really<00:03:50.410> like<00:03:50.620> about<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:51.070> process<00:03:51.730> it

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
I really like about this process it

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.060 
I really like about this process it
makes<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.299> look<00:03:52.450> very<00:03:52.480> different<00:03:53.470> from<00:03:53.980> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
makes it look very different from the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.330 
makes it look very different from the
original<00:03:54.329> scrapbook<00:03:55.329> paper<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.799> just<00:03:57.160> go

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
original scrapbook paper so just go

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.960

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.470 
ahead and cut out all the flowers so now
I<00:04:01.000> need<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.690> decide<00:04:02.140> what<00:04:02.940> fabrics<00:04:03.940> I'm<00:04:04.209> going

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
circles that are slightly larger than

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.260 
circles that are slightly larger than
the<00:04:32.540> flowers<00:04:33.020> out<00:04:33.590> of<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.040> back<00:04:34.310> backing

the flowers out of the back backing

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.740 
the flowers out of the back backing
fabric<00:04:36.130> now<00:04:37.130> that<00:04:37.340> I've<00:04:37.460> got<00:04:37.730> all<00:04:38.000> my<00:04:38.030> pieces

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750

peach<00:04:45.380> fabric<00:04:46.070> which<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.430> think<00:04:46.640> goes<00:04:46.850> really

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
peach fabric which I think goes really

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.470

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
line using orange thread the back

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.630 
line using orange thread the back
circles<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:38.330> fabric<00:05:39.169> together<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:40.280> this<00:05:40.460> is

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
circles of fabric together so this is

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.210

but I felt like it looked pretty good

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.790 
but I felt like it looked pretty good
this<00:06:38.440> way<00:06:38.680> and<00:06:38.979> then<00:06:39.460> to<00:06:39.669> add<00:06:39.850> the<00:06:39.880> closure

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
this way and then to add the closure

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.680 
this way and then to add the closure
since<00:06:41.800> I'm<00:06:42.070> not<00:06:42.280> a<00:06:42.340> jeweler<00:06:42.729> what<00:06:43.180> I<00:06:43.210> did<00:06:43.479> was

since I'm not a jeweler what I did was

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.279 
since I'm not a jeweler what I did was
cannibalize<00:06:44.530> a<00:06:45.600> necklace<00:06:46.600> that<00:06:46.660> I<00:06:46.900> got<00:06:47.080> at<00:06:47.260> the
