00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
and so you should have been able to see

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.500 
and so you should have been able to see
comet<00:00:56.140> mcnaught<00:00:56.370> which

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.689 

we'll<00:01:01.079> reach<00:01:01.289> perihelion<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.219> three<00:01:02.489> days

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
we'll reach perihelion in three days

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.280 
we'll reach perihelion in three days
here<00:01:03.030> just<00:01:03.329> set<00:01:04.290> behind<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.689> palm<00:01:06.689> tree<00:01:06.720> over

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
here just set behind that palm tree over

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.730 
here just set behind that palm tree over
to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.710> right<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> frame

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
to the right of the frame

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.520 
to the right of the frame
never<00:01:12.659> same<00:01:13.659> thing<00:01:13.840> I'd<00:01:13.960> ever<00:01:14.020> get<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.319> see<00:01:14.499> a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
never same thing I'd ever get to see a

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.179 
never same thing I'd ever get to see a
comment<00:01:15.399> that<00:01:15.609> bright<00:01:15.939> in<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.770> while<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:18.039> that

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
comment that bright in a while but that

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.800 
comment that bright in a while but that
those<00:01:18.880> definitely<00:01:19.569> brighter<00:01:19.780> than

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:33.060 

definitely<00:01:23.810> even<00:01:23.960> brighter<00:01:24.140> than<00:01:24.290> hale-bopp

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.540 

I<00:01:33.210> guess<00:01:34.210> for<00:01:34.390> comparison<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.860> can<00:01:36.070> zoom<00:01:36.340> out

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
I guess for comparison you can zoom out

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:43.050 
I guess for comparison you can zoom out
here<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.740> go<00:01:39.130> take<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.340> look<00:01:39.490> for<00:01:39.820> Venus<00:01:42.060> which

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
here and go take a look for Venus which

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.430 
here and go take a look for Venus which
is

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.160 

let's<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.160> where's<00:01:47.520> Venus

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
let's see where's Venus

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.109 
let's see where's Venus
now<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.920> spire<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.759> see<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.060> i

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
now that spire that you see there i

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.780 
now that spire that you see there i
think<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> campus<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.979> Loyola

Rumble<00:02:46.569> before<00:02:47.569> them<00:02:48.129> wasn't<00:02:49.129> a<00:02:49.159> quake<00:02:49.370> that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
Rumble before them wasn't a quake that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.339 
Rumble before them wasn't a quake that
was<00:02:49.819> one<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.269> security<00:02:50.659> cruisers<00:02:51.110> going

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
was one of the security cruisers going

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.610 
was one of the security cruisers going
by<00:02:51.909> so<00:02:52.909> there's<00:02:53.269> just<00:02:53.569> for<00:02:53.780> comparison<00:02:54.470> birth

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
by so there's just for comparison birth

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.579 
by so there's just for comparison birth
which<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.189> would<00:02:55.310> comment
