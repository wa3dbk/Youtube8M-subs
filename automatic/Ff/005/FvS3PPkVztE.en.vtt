 if I write this to you leave 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.890
 same amount of people half a spoon 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.539
 white vinegar tea 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.409
 there are people who use apple cider vinegar 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.810
 each goes for the vinegar he prefers 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:56.429
 then I'm using the common miracle that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:02.420
 had at home with salad half a spoon 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:05.369

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.619
 now has shown to like the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.280
 our recipe is a teaspoon 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.660
 then the proportions and can fold 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.390
 in your house you make for more people 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.830
 care that showed that you will use 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.200
 There's a lot of cool brand nowadays. 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.030

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.590
 if you want if you do not know much concierge 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.290
 very cheap too 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.359
 It's not going to be the same, so do not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.359
 it was reasonable these cool brands 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.459
 I will not use the mixer here to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.620
 to facilitate 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.150
 You can make a blender yourself. 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.579
 You can say that was not Mayonnaise 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.810
 point in hand also including other 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.329
 recipe prices mayonnaise prices 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.819
 that is going to be hit in the hand is with olive oil 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.370
 a different business is I use the 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.269
 mixer with this wire whisk here 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.269
 quiet 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.379
 quick starbatty just to mix the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.950
 ingredients and are now no longer sure 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.220
 We put oil on the wire 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.049
 slowly 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.420
 if you are a blender it is the same 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.909
 thing the indicator is a more powerful 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.439
 low is playing now in wire in hand 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.180
 same thing in the hand you need 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.480
 Someone to handle depending on the way 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.069
 What are you, you need to ask someone 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.109
 hold your eye for you and put it on 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.700
 if you do not have a very firm base 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.150
 so come on let's see how this here 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.150
 the state 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.610
 At this point people are where I usually 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.680
 put the salt 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.590
 I'll put money or change as much 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.670
 that we have a reference of what is 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:02.939
 a brad tea room put here the 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.140
 I salute the people in putting another sock 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.140
 total teaspoon 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.220
 you can here tastes to it then if 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.920
 Do you want to put the chopped parsley? 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.599
 To make heat is green is this time of 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.329
 put a little powder water is 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.900
 this hour 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.900
 an absurdity 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.600
 I'll see how are we to see the 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.160
 Score 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.190
 we'll pick it up here with a spoon and 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:47.330
 agent lived for is to see how much 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:51.289
 abandoned films and then that part is pd 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.190
 I like it, I like it, I'll put one more 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.190
 a little to leave there 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:18.710
 with another woman here now we do not 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:25.550
 asked one point we also more 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:34.900
 My son is a little over an hour 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:38.000
 falls in safe harbor 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.889
 It is at this time that you experience 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.360
 missing a little salt a thing of the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.580
 proof corrected 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.409
 what can not you put more here and lemon 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.430
 or vinegar that kind of thing that he 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.889
 sent off 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.589
 but spices can put your agenda but 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.819
 the police at that point I do not 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:56.029
 I know if I 'll give it to you, they'll try. 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:06:00.830

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:06.740
 here is the first point second gave 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:07.189
 More or less secondly, they prepare 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.860

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:15.710

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.870

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.270
 who already does it now is ready but who 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.580
 she heals to become more palatable 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.950
 just because we put people in 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.750

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.750

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.850
 it was ready there are people here 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:52.770

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.630
 with which the pots she a refrigerator already 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.910

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.710
 She looks really nice here. 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.870

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:07.850
