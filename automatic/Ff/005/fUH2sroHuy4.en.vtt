strong<00:00:19.170> stretchy<00:00:19.859> paper<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:21.060> able<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
strong stretchy paper so I was able to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.490 
strong stretchy paper so I was able to
use<00:00:21.949> really<00:00:22.949> big<00:00:23.340> pieces<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:24.060> paper<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.660> it's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
use really big pieces of paper and it's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980 
use really big pieces of paper and it's
so<00:00:25.800> strong<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.849> only<00:00:27.000> need<00:00:27.300> two<00:00:27.599> layers

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
so strong that you only need two layers

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
so strong that you only need two layers
in<00:00:28.410> order<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.769> make<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.250> mask<00:00:29.779> it's

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
in order to make this mask it's

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.830 
in order to make this mask it's
obviously<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:32.430> stiff<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.270> it's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
obviously really really stiff and it's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.510 
obviously really really stiff and it's
nice<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.020> smooth<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> inside<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
nice and smooth on the inside so it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.690 
nice and smooth on the inside so it
would<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.820> easy<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.989> wear<00:00:37.350> I'm<00:00:37.680> using<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.460> for

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
would be easy to wear I'm using this for

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.799 
would be easy to wear I'm using this for
a<00:00:38.730> mask<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.180> my<00:00:39.360> wall<00:00:39.629> actually<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:41.809> can't

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
a mask on my wall actually so I can't

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.450 
a mask on my wall actually so I can't
put<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:44.510> hanger<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.539> there<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.340> but<00:00:47.340> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
put it on hanger on there but but this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.060 
put it on hanger on there but but this
is<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.120> way<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.590> masks

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
is this is the way that all of the masks

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
is this is the way that all of the masks
in<00:00:50.190> my<00:00:50.370> book<00:00:50.640> were<00:00:50.850> made<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> particular

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
in my book were made but this particular

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.850 
in my book were made but this particular
one<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.530> actually<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.980> variation<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:54.860> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
one is actually a variation of the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.310 
one is actually a variation of the
bottom<00:00:56.610> mask<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> white<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
bottom mask up there the white one so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.709 
bottom mask up there the white one so
this<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.340> isn't<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.910> book<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> can

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the book are built over a mass form and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.109 
the book are built over a mass form and
the<00:01:34.079> features<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.829> made<00:01:35.430> either<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.090> of

the features are made either out of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.780 
the features are made either out of
super<00:01:36.570> sculpey<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.200> modeling<00:01:37.979> clay<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.759> can

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
super sculpey or modeling clay you can

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.510 
super sculpey or modeling clay you can
use<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.299> over<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:40.079> again<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
use that over and over again because the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
use that over and over again because the
mold<00:01:41.970> itself<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:42.990> actually<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.470> destroyed

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
mold itself will actually be destroyed

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.460 
mold itself will actually be destroyed
when<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.340> pulled<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.759> paper<00:01:45.509> mache<00:01:45.960> off<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
when you pulled the paper mache off of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.679 
when you pulled the paper mache off of
there<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.130> each<00:01:47.369> mask<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.540> be

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there so each mask is going to be

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.780 
there so each mask is going to be
completely<00:01:49.200> original<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.320> apply<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
completely original then you apply the

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.399 
completely original then you apply the
fast-setting<00:01:53.790> paper<00:01:54.210> mache<00:01:54.659> paste<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.259> an

old<00:01:55.590> brush<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.909> put<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.659> super

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
old brush and you put on the super

strong paper in large pieces and this
will<00:02:02.070> be<00:02:02.310> done<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.149> two<00:02:03.950> layers<00:02:04.950> some

will be done in just two layers some
things<00:02:05.759> like<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.270> nose<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.439> a

little bit
difficult<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.819> them<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.239> white<00:02:09.539> spaces<00:02:10.170> but

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
difficult to do them be white spaces but

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.270 
difficult to do them be white spaces but
it<00:02:10.829> still<00:02:11.099> only<00:02:11.280> takes<00:02:11.609> a<00:02:11.730> few<00:02:11.760> minutes<00:02:13.280> most
