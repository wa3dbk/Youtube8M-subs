electives<00:02:22.200> electric<00:02:22.950> stove<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.520> my<00:02:23.640> problem

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
electives electric stove and my problem

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.940 
electives electric stove and my problem
with<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.600> turns<00:02:24.780> out<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.650> not<00:02:25.890> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
with it and it turns out it's not a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.880 
with it and it turns out it's not a
problem<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.610> normal<00:02:27.180> because<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:28.200> stove

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
problem it's normal because this stove

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.670 
problem it's normal because this stove
has<00:02:29.160> auto<00:02:29.700> thermostat<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.900> means<00:02:31.230> that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
has auto thermostat and that means that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680 
has auto thermostat and that means that
the<00:02:32.220> lamp<00:02:32.430> will<00:02:32.580> turn<00:02:32.760> off<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.360> proc

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the lamp will turn off a proc

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.690 
the lamp will turn off a proc
approximately<00:02:34.650> 15<00:02:35.040> minutes<00:02:35.070> when<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.580> hot

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
approximately 15 minutes when the hot

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.520 
approximately 15 minutes when the hot
plate<00:02:35.910> features<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.600> selected<00:02:37.020> temperature

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
plate features is selected temperature

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.890 
plate features is selected temperature
and<00:02:37.770> will<00:02:38.280> cycle<00:02:38.459> on<00:02:38.820> approximately<00:02:39.690> two

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and will cycle on approximately two

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.320 
and will cycle on approximately two
minutes<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.500> maintain<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.550> temperature<00:02:41.700> so

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
minutes to maintain the temperature so

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.710 
minutes to maintain the temperature so
