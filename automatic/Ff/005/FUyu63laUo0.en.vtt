00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.450
 The building has been for us from the beginning, the building has no one likes 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.359
 I still like the jazz music and you probably can not do much there 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.049
 do better 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.419
 Marta took the step three years ago 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.419
 but taken out of real estate internals to do it much better 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.509
 But what you definitely need to take effect is with the order 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.249
 People who keep running around making the train impossible for travelers 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.140
 impossible 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.289
 impossible for travelers 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.269
 a message that is not without a trace on the German railway 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.689
 should pull 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.629
 and especially at Trier central station should be arriving and continue 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.589
 Traveling welcome feel like the red giant himself to the appearance of the 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.680
 Trier central station stands for this seems from the side of the German course AG no 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.750
 greater need for action 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.150
 on antenna West request, the railway group explained the following 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.350
 In the short term, there are no planned construction measures Trier Central Station 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.400
 but the verdict of the Trier is quite different 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.440
 I do not like it, he's just mad 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.510
 he is not warns MÃ¼nster another club give it more atmosphere 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.030
 more flair 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.420
 be 15 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.549
 it has only become too confused to broken 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.800
 well, the forecourt everything 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.500
 So I'm a normal one usually goes along who grew up 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.850
 but in the hall 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.560
 Nine years ago the Swiss and that they were there that way 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.090
 he wants 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.490
 So far, as a child, you will soon be well educated and educated 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.720
 Midrange Bartels will 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.300
 ask for help could garbage bins around Conti stands the service 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.550
 Dr Hartwig is a better way to drive out 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.300
 that is so and so 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.000
 to carry east and southeast without organizing now color 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 Munich 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.790
 added the grasp to the coffee to the newspaper and the quick info 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.410
 All this you get in the station area 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.090
 this may shorten the waiting time 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.650
 But the act of the car can fail at the opening hours 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.860
 because from 22 o'clock on arrival and departure no wind protected or reasonably 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.850
 learned space available 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.250
 There seems to be a glimmer of hope on the red horizon 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.020
 and he creates Trier are currently running talks regarding the bonds 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.139
 remodeling 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.989
 This has also confirmed a spokesman for the city here 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.269
 a start 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.099
 But as the concrete plans look, the rail company could not 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.159
 express 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.019
 Since the main station Trier in the possession of the red giant is sense of the city Trier 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.099
 your hands tied there 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.309
 but the station forecourt belongs to the action areas of the city 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:33.449
 and that's what reshaping SGA is all about 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.329
 the city of Trier expressly declared a redesign of the main station 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.169
 just welcomed by the city 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.599
 just a pity that the large railroad meadow has no concrete plans 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.760
 What the Triers think of their gate to the city is very clear
