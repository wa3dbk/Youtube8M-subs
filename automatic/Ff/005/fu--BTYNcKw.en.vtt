00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
to shuffle in my opinion maybe it's just

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.190 
to shuffle in my opinion maybe it's just
a<00:03:40.660> tad<00:03:41.519> play<00:03:42.519> around<00:03:42.880> with<00:03:43.060> them<00:03:43.180> enough<00:03:43.389> but<00:03:44.170> I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
a tad play around with them enough but I

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.129 
a tad play around with them enough but I
say<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.470> just<00:03:44.560> because<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:45.069> curb<00:03:45.910> how<00:03:46.870> it's

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
say it just because this curb how it's

say it just because this curb how it's
going<00:03:49.139> if<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.410> do<00:03:50.889> like<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.750> face<00:03:52.750> up<00:03:54.510> because

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
going if I do like this face up because

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.479 
going if I do like this face up because
I'm<00:03:55.660> softly<00:03:56.200> in<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.620> same<00:03:56.859> way<00:03:56.980> as<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.160> curve

it's<00:03:58.150> much<00:03:58.359> easier<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.750> shuffle<00:04:01.470> effortless

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.500
