00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I think it's just I was embarrassed to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
I think it's just I was embarrassed to
sit<00:00:42.329> right<00:00:42.360> next<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.140> him<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.920> hear<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.610> at

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
sit right next to him and hear that at

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
sit right next to him and hear that at
public<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.360> hear<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.780> media<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.379> hear<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
public and hear that media can hear it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.100 
public and hear that media can hear it
because<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.399> puts<00:00:47.640> certain<00:00:47.850> shadow<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
because it puts certain shadow on the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
because it puts certain shadow on the
sport<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> David<00:00:50.430> Haye<00:00:50.640> is
