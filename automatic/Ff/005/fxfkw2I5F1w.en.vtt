00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.770
 today we make the classic pastry 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.110
 however we will see two different ways of 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.840
 knead it 1 the classic method e 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.309
 the other the sandblasted method we start from 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.260
 classic method 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.720
 let's take some butter that isn't really 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.610
 we put it in the fridge 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.490
 in our gifted kneader 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:31.039
 of hook ak and then add it 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.719
 shortcrust pastry and a lot of sugar 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.859
 simple even to remember in doses 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:40.339
 half of the butter is 300 g of flour 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:43.190
 then 150 grams and a third respect 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.120
 with sugar flour for which 100 g of 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.339
 sugar 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.210
 finally an egg that will serve will serve to 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.249
 tie it all together 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.899
 we start to start the machine for 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.769
 then mix these two ingredients 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.769
 butter and sugar 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:03.370
 well now these two ingredients are well 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.370
 blended we must add new 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.670
 now you will have to add all the flour 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.460
 together then we will add the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.710
 classic aromas a lemon peel e 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.600
 of vanilla with and grated the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.210
 zest directly into the bowl e 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.720
 let's add a full handle 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.720
 vanilla extract 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.439
 here it is 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.930
 and very little our pastry is 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.049
 ready we give a fast processed a 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.049
 but no 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.990
 see how beautiful and homogeneous it is 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.909
 typical of this work have a 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.979
 smooth and homogeneous paste 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.610
 now what we have to do we have to put it 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.790
 in the baking paper and put it in 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.619
 fridge for half an hour just right 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.580
 to make it cool a little, then yes 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.840
 you can use for any type of 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.390
 product that is a tart one 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.970
 tartelletta a biscuit etc. vi 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.570
 I show you how to put in 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.400
 baking paper we put the ball in and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.860
 we begin to crush such a way that yes 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.569
 thin as much as possible in this 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.260
 so it will put us much less to 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.260
 chill 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.489
 here he is ready to go in 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.019
 fridge 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.430
 now let's see how to do it a 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.379
 the sandblasted dough we sell 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 ingredients that are the same as before 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:49.709
 then 300 of 100 sugar flour i 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.420
 aromas an egg and that the butter is missing 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.680
 I left it in the fridge specially 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.590
 because it must be really cold of 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.709
 fridge remember 150 g of butter 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.189
 we only need flour and butter 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.370
 we put the flour on the pastry board in 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.280
 this way and we take a knife for 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.790
 cut the butter into small pieces 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.459
 now take an iron spatula e 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.530
 let's start cutting the butter until it does 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.900
 each piece of butter will not be 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:33.120
 of the size of a lentil for 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:35.790
 which in this way ok 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.489
 I would say we are doing one 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:44.000
 fontanella we add the sugar e 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.000
 the whole egg 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.639
 we begin to knead with our hands 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.600
 the butter cut into small pieces 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.360
 under the heat of the hands it will melt 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.900
 slightly and in this way will go to 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.480
 race to bind eggs and eggs to flour 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.090
 other ingredients when you see that 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.160
 the dough is almost done 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.370
 add aromas so now let's go to 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.370
 put the lemon and a little vanilla 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.100
 with this processing method 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.190
 you will surely get a pastry 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.919
 more rustic as I like it with i 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.729
 ingredients blended yes but less smooth 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.160
 and less so in the past in a homogeneous way 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:47.370
 here is our pastry with the method 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.040
 salviato is ready see that also the 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.240
 color is less homogeneous than quell 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.370
 another hour we put it as for the other 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.320
 in parchment paper and in the refrigerator for 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.720
 half an hour before at least one 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.180
 half an hour before using it 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.740
 dishes I love as for the other one then 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.820
 we cover with parchment paper and more 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.510
 we press to get a record 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:17.430
 let's put it rather thin 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.550
 together with the other and go try it too 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.550
 you
