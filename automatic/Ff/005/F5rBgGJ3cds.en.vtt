 how everything should be removed with a bib 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.029

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.060
 the list given by the five continents the tables under their control in the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.760
 port terminals 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 the end of the games will always be applicable 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.800
 in a constant way he concluded 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.620
 voluntary for you that is to say added occasions in which the games 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.950
 can take a juicy de nÃ­jar 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.950

 of great mobility among many sources 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.080
 as I told you the day before 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 in which we were advancing 90 vogue 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.500
 in the moment that there is some game 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.900
 the one that can be applied this measure I will you on the wall to this video 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.930
 to represent them 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.040
 and you can carry out your bart attacks 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.319
 the offer war holds cow narvaja 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.130
 some letters in this case 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.510
 in this position the musac is very similar to the sale in which he compared 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.440
 letters 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.319
 a 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.389
 two 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.029
 3 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.169
 and it has arrived until that case we have 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.649
 five letters and we want to make see 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.649
 that if I do not tell them that we do not want to show 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:25.609
 the red one so he opted to show the bear 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.530
 possibly the clubs 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.669
 companies an eye now we ran bulls or five letters 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.290
 and below 50 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.249
 of face for the public see them 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.609
 those of assistants we pay attention in them since the circumstance is given 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.400
 As it happens nothing in gmail tells that one of them is repeated barak 2 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.999
 3 and when you get to the fourth, what you do is counted 4 and they keep running one of 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:55.510
 the majors the shock is not perceived if you do not name it but you comment it 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.539
 I have letters on the same counter 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.429
 but the 'red' remained hidden 

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:02.599
 And this one is left 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.820
 the centered position the case of traffic letters 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.589
 how it is carried out why he explained on his site 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:11.279
 you will hold from a song 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.199
 by the right hand the letters and the locks to the left hand 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.689
 and linking more a work 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.340
 I lose them with smoking according to deposit them 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.869
 place them in your palm 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.539
 in this position azÃºa counts one 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.339
 at 2 dragging 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:32.549
 at 3 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.909
 and as we know loaded fourth below we hide the one we want to hide 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.429
 when he finished fourth leave all behind 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.299
 the two heads 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.469
 together 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.129
 but how 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.149
 so far a rule was that he leaves them sixth in his hands 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:51.090
 they were in this position that is 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.379
 deposited for such a good purpose because on this occasion 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.019
 what it will do will be to deposit them in the much more horizontal position 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.449
 your index finger should welcome 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.159
 as you can see 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.239
 be last letter 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.240
 so I said that as an opel 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.919
 nel casu for sale on ebay if you know it 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.120
 deposited 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.590
 I remember 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.319
 dragged state 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:22.569
 and struck out five 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:27.659
 you see that it does not contract an extreme difficulty I will defend it under 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.960
 the ability of everyone to boston to do it 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.010
 in a way 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.139
 more or less quickly agreed so that the account is always trying 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.629
 he does not make any kind of pause at the moment in fact it was letter because 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.870
 We are endorsed by mencho the modification agreement 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.620
 we are talking about people it is important to keep in mind the number of 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.680
 tennis cards because to the debate to the deposited and take you a 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.419
 you make a movement 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:57.949
 and little strange 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.949
 but giving it a continuity there is no problem 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.110
 you can already see that the contracting 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.370
 extreme difficulty when the state 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.550
