anything above that is gravy so to speak
for<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.100> practice<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:34.450> thing<00:01:34.689> about<00:01:34.899> the

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
for that practice one thing about the

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.050 
for that practice one thing about the
planned<00:01:35.350> scan<00:01:35.680> system<00:01:36.220> it's<00:01:36.399> truly<00:01:36.790> portable

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
planned scan system it's truly portable

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.120 
planned scan system it's truly portable
so<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.540> have<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.899> capability<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.649> plug<00:01:38.890> and

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
so you have the capability to plug and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.399 
so you have the capability to plug and
play<00:01:39.340> into<00:01:39.729> several<00:01:40.240> laptops<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.229> may
