feet<00:01:56.939> most<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> units<00:01:58.500> start<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.189> at

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
feet most of the units start out at

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.740 
feet most of the units start out at
about<00:01:59.369> twelve<00:01:59.790> hundred<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.270> fifty<00:02:00.570> pounds

about twelve hundred and fifty pounds

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.109 
about twelve hundred and fifty pounds
which<00:02:01.079> make<00:02:01.259> them<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.530> easy<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.979> tow<00:02:02.189> the

which make them very easy to tow the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.359 
which make them very easy to tow the
largest<00:02:03.540> units<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.219> about

easily pull one of our units around

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.300 
easily pull one of our units around
there's<00:02:13.510> there's<00:02:13.870> some<00:02:14.050> obvious<00:02:14.530> ways<00:02:14.740> that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
there's there's some obvious ways that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.330 
there's there's some obvious ways that
you<00:02:15.610> gain<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.930> mobility<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.010> there's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
you gain this mobility and there's

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
you gain this mobility and there's
lightweight<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.000> there's<00:02:19.660> some<00:02:19.810> not<00:02:19.990> so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
lightweight and there's some not so

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.570 
lightweight and there's some not so
obvious<00:02:20.320> ways<00:02:20.860> let's<00:02:21.130> talk<00:02:21.280> about<00:02:21.400> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
obvious ways let's talk about the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.970 
obvious ways let's talk about the
obvious<00:02:21.910> ones<00:02:22.120> first<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.630> use<00:02:23.020> aluminum<00:02:23.260> yeah

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
obvious ones first you use aluminum yeah

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.040 
obvious ones first you use aluminum yeah
we<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.910> don't<00:02:25.150> know<00:02:25.300> if<00:02:25.540> there<00:02:25.720> are<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> whole<00:02:26.020> lot

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
we I don't know if there are a whole lot

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.450 
we I don't know if there are a whole lot
of<00:02:26.320> other<00:02:26.500> people<00:02:26.950> out<00:02:27.070> there<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.370> are

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
of other people out there that are

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.100 
of other people out there that are
building<00:02:27.700> travel<00:02:28.090> trailers<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.870> are<00:02:28.990> all

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
building travel trailers that are all

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.410 
building travel trailers that are all
aluminum<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:29.770> that's<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.070> way<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.340> do<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.670> we

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
aluminum but that's the way we do it we

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.840 
aluminum but that's the way we do it we
have<00:02:31.540> aluminum<00:02:31.990> frames<00:02:32.310> aluminum<00:02:33.310> cabinets

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
have aluminum frames aluminum cabinets

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.480 
have aluminum frames aluminum cabinets
even<00:02:34.600> aluminum<00:02:34.990> skin<00:02:35.350> on<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.890> sidewalls

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
even aluminum skin on the sidewalls

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.400 
even aluminum skin on the sidewalls
well<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.090> certainly<00:02:37.480> notice<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.350> know

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
well you certainly notice it you know

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.620 
well you certainly notice it you know
from<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.710> structural<00:02:39.130> standpoint<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:40.450> know

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
from a structural standpoint you know

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.300 
from a structural standpoint you know
right<00:02:40.870> right<00:02:40.900> here<00:02:41.440> you've<00:02:41.680> got<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.130> beam

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
right right here you've got the beam

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.390 
right right here you've got the beam
that<00:02:42.340> comes<00:02:42.730> right<00:02:42.910> out<00:02:43.320> absolutely<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.220> we

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that comes right out absolutely and we

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.340 
that comes right out absolutely and we
do<00:02:45.580> manufacture<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.540> weld<00:02:46.720> all<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.110> our<00:02:47.230> own

our own sidewalls and all of our

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.350 
our own sidewalls and all of our
cabinets<00:02:53.590> as<00:02:53.710> well<00:02:53.860> ok<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:54.760> what<00:02:54.940> are<00:02:54.970> some<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
cabinets as well ok so what are some of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.050 
cabinets as well ok so what are some of
the<00:02:55.570> may<00:02:56.200> be<00:02:56.260> less<00:02:56.620> obvious<00:02:56.860> things<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.850> make

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
the may be less obvious things that make

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.110 
the may be less obvious things that make
this<00:02:58.270> towable<00:02:58.840> by<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.020> smaller<00:02:59.470> vehicle<00:03:00.120> well

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
this towable by a smaller vehicle well

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120 
this towable by a smaller vehicle well
what<00:03:01.330> we've<00:03:01.480> designed<00:03:01.870> into<00:03:02.320> this<00:03:02.440> trailer<00:03:02.770> of

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
what we've designed into this trailer of

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.680 
what we've designed into this trailer of
course<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.520> can<00:03:03.670> see<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:03.850> it<00:03:04.090> slopes<00:03:04.390> both

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
course you can see that it slopes both

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.290 
course you can see that it slopes both
in<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.990> front<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.620> back<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:07.060> if<00:03:07.180> you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
in the front and in the back and if you

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.090 
in the front and in the back and if you
look<00:03:07.510> at<00:03:07.660> where<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.230> front<00:03:08.530> slope<00:03:08.830> is

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
look at where the the front slope is

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.540 
look at where the the front slope is
that<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.300> front<00:03:10.600> slope<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.260> just<00:03:11.650> about<00:03:11.860> even

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
that that front slope is just about even

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.760 
that that front slope is just about even
with<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.060> lot<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.330> your<00:03:13.510> pickup<00:03:13.930> truck<00:03:14.080> cabs<00:03:14.440> and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
with a lot of your pickup truck cabs and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.250 
with a lot of your pickup truck cabs and
a<00:03:14.830> lot<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.010> your<00:03:15.220> minivan<00:03:15.490> roofs<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:17.050> that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
a lot of your minivan roofs so that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.690 
a lot of your minivan roofs so that
allows<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.830> wind<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.340> already

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
allows the wind and it's already

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.670 
allows the wind and it's already
naturally<00:03:19.270> flowing<00:03:19.540> over<00:03:19.900> your<00:03:20.080> vehicle<00:03:20.260> to

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
naturally flowing over your vehicle to

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.940 
naturally flowing over your vehicle to
continue<00:03:21.130> its<00:03:21.310> natural<00:03:22.200> slope<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.739> over

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
continue its natural slope up and over

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.410 
continue its natural slope up and over
the<00:03:24.070> trailer<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:24.580> which<00:03:24.880> helps<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.300> with

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
the trailer which which helps you with

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.360 
the trailer which which helps you with
your<00:03:25.450> gas<00:03:25.720> mileage<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.410> also<00:03:26.590> gets<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.250> out

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
your gas mileage and it also gets it out

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.590 
your gas mileage and it also gets it out
of<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.580> wind<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:28.000> you're<00:03:28.120> not<00:03:28.239> going<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.450> get<00:03:28.540> a

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
of the wind so you're not going to get a

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.920 
of the wind so you're not going to get a
lot<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.840> fish<00:03:29.470> tailing<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.010> Road<00:03:30.430> movement

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
lot of fish tailing and Road movement

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.600 
lot of fish tailing and Road movement
another<00:03:31.930> thing<00:03:32.200> we've<00:03:32.380> done<00:03:32.590> our<00:03:33.190> trailers

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
another thing we've done our trailers

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.479 
another thing we've done our trailers
are<00:03:33.730> only<00:03:33.850> about<00:03:34.120> six<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.600> half<00:03:34.660> feet<00:03:35.020> wide

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
are only about six and a half feet wide

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.580 
are only about six and a half feet wide
so<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.640> why<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.120> important<00:03:37.660> well<00:03:37.959> what

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
so that why is that important well what

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.290 
so that why is that important well what
we've<00:03:38.739> done<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.100> for<00:03:39.250> first-time<00:03:39.700> tours<00:03:40.180> we

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
we've done is for first-time tours we

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.479 
we've done is for first-time tours we
realize<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:41.020> an<00:03:41.110> entry-level<00:03:41.410> unit<00:03:42.010> so

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
realize this is an entry-level unit so

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.670 
realize this is an entry-level unit so
our<00:03:43.000> trailer<00:03:43.480> we<00:03:43.630> didn't<00:03:43.900> make<00:03:44.020> any<00:03:44.080> wider

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
our trailer we didn't make any wider

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.270 
our trailer we didn't make any wider

that way you don't have to use extended
tow<00:03:52.780> mirrors<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.440> it's<00:03:53.860> also<00:03:54.070> very<00:03:54.220> easy<00:03:54.730> for
