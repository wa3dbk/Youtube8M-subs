00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.699 
you've got on the left
weight<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.660> get<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.900> right<00:03:04.079> it's<00:03:04.380> such<00:03:04.590> an

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
weight if you get it right it's such an

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.069 
weight if you get it right it's such an
easy<00:03:04.829> corner<00:03:05.370> but<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.180> would<00:03:06.450> say<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.660> only<00:03:06.870> get

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
easy corner but I would say you only get

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.229 
easy corner but I would say you only get
through<00:03:07.290> there<00:03:07.470> maybe<00:03:08.280> three<00:03:08.910> or<00:03:08.940> four<00:03:09.060> times

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
through there maybe three or four times

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.960 
through there maybe three or four times
out<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.690> 10<00:03:09.959> exactly<00:03:10.470> 180<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.760> very

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
out of 10 exactly 180 so it's a very

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.940 
out of 10 exactly 180 so it's a very
tricky<00:03:12.120> corner<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.380> would<00:03:13.500> say<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:13.859> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
tricky corner but I would say one of the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.319 
tricky corner but I would say one of the
most<00:03:14.040> rewarding<00:03:14.280> corners<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.239> your

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
most rewarding corners if you get your

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.479 
most rewarding corners if you get your
position<00:03:15.450> correct<00:03:16.380> on<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.620> first<00:03:16.829> part<00:03:17.100> and

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
position correct on the first part and

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.620 
position correct on the first part and
get<00:03:17.609> through<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> second<00:03:18.209> part<00:03:18.359> with<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.480> lot

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
get through the second part with a lot

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.930 
get through the second part with a lot
of<00:03:18.720> speed<00:03:18.930> down<00:03:19.380> into<00:03:19.650> man<00:03:19.829> Mansfield<00:03:20.579> corner

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
of speed down into man Mansfield corner

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.479 
of speed down into man Mansfield corner
and<00:03:21.320> downhill<00:03:22.320> corner<00:03:22.829> but<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.250> get<00:03:23.370> to

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and downhill corner but as you get to

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:24.080 
and downhill corner but as you get to
the<00:03:23.579> bottom

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
the bottom

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.970 
the bottom
the<00:03:24.390> camber<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.019> helps<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.380> sir<00:03:25.500> another

the camber so it helps you sir another
favorite<00:03:26.489> place<00:03:26.670> for<00:03:26.700> passing<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.079> very

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
favorite place for passing but it's very

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.319 
favorite place for passing but it's very
very<00:03:28.769> easy<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:29.190> lose<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.609> rear<00:03:29.790> on<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> exit

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
very easy to lose the rear on the exit

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.449 
very easy to lose the rear on the exit
see<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.660> lot<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.840> people<00:03:30.959> crash<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.769> as

the race goes on is your tire starts to

the race goes on is your tire starts to
wear<00:03:34.949> more<00:03:35.100> it's<00:03:35.280> hard<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.489> get<00:03:35.609> on<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.760> gas

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
to the corner but you do it because it's

the run up to the most famous part the

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.730 
the run up to the most famous part the
circuit<00:04:04.180> which<00:04:04.270> is<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.420> mountain<00:04:04.870> the

circuit which is the mountain the

circuit which is the mountain the
mountain<00:04:05.770> stretches<00:04:06.550> is<00:04:06.790> obviously<00:04:07.150> what

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
mountain stretches is obviously what

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.270 
mountain stretches is obviously what
cattle<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:07.720> iconic<00:04:08.110> for<00:04:08.260> but<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.710> two<00:04:08.920> corners

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
cattle is iconic for but the two corners

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.620 
cattle is iconic for but the two corners
before<00:04:09.430> we<00:04:09.700> are<00:04:09.820> really<00:04:10.180> really<00:04:10.450> difficult

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
before we are really really difficult

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.920 
before we are really really difficult
you<00:04:11.380> go<00:04:11.530> first<00:04:12.190> second<00:04:12.850> third<00:04:13.090> back<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:13.570> second

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
you go first second third back to second

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.730 
you go first second third back to second
gear<00:04:14.020> for<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.260> bottom<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.620> mountain

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
gear for the bottom of the mountain

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.010 
gear for the bottom of the mountain
again<00:04:15.250> like<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.209> said<00:04:16.360> before<00:04:16.480> you've<00:04:16.870> got<00:04:16.989> a

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
again like I said before you've got a

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.880 
again like I said before you've got a
lot<00:04:17.260> of<00:04:17.290> camber<00:04:17.680> go<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.549> inside<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.799> have

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
lot of camber go to the inside you have

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.590 
lot of camber go to the inside you have
to<00:04:20.980> be<00:04:21.070> very<00:04:21.280> careful<00:04:21.760> not<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:22.000> run<00:04:22.150> too<00:04:22.360> wide

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
to be very careful not to run too wide

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.210 
to be very careful not to run too wide
on<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.930> left<00:04:23.170> which<00:04:23.470> then<00:04:23.650> makes<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.010> left

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
on the left which then makes the left

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.740 
on the left which then makes the left
part<00:04:25.170> too<00:04:26.170> tight<00:04:26.560> on<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.770> left<00:04:27.150> run<00:04:28.150> wide<00:04:28.360> and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
part too tight on the left run wide and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.840 
part too tight on the left run wide and
it<00:04:28.840> makes<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.140> right<00:04:29.350> really<00:04:29.680> tight<00:04:29.890> so<00:04:30.190> stay

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
it makes a right really tight so stay
