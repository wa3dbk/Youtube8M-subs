00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.049
 since his first flight on June 13 at 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.690
 above airbus installations 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.190
 marignane helicopter the hb 160 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 continues its development 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.960
 yesterday Thursday, Jan 26th the helicopter has 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.310
 performed a demonstration flight 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.330
 flying over an employee parterre is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.699
 group's official 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 an opportunity to review the progress of the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.910
 successor to the dolphin family with 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.990
 its program director 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.990
 Bernard was I aspire 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.810
 we are considering the first deliveries 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.570
 2018 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.660
 in mid 2010 18 and we just started 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.400
 so the flight test program that goes 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.810
 to unfold for a few few 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.120
 years we will use three prototypes 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.140
 and a pre - production device so you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.300
 see rats miles behind me the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.879
 first own prototype that's going to be 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.430
 joined this year by a second and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.980
 next year by 1.3 third and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.680
 we will realize several hundred 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.160
 hours of flight to be able to develop 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 and then ripen all the technology 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.830
 this device before putting it in 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 service in mid 2010 860 unveiled in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
 great pump last March during the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 salon heli-expo of orlando sin a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.260
 a real technological break with its 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.610
 predecessors what the helicopterist does 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.110
 does not claim to call back 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.360
 proof is this the time of a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 interview conducted by his guillaume CEO 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 Fleury 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.409
 I am jacqueline girl yes but that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.030
 need to rehabilitate is this machine 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 to exceptional she is 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.260
 exceptional this machine with several 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 titles first of all she's very innovative 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.110
 it does not contain less than 68 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.030
 innovation 68 patent so the most 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.460
 emblematic that we see in the first 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.230
 look are the blades the blades that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.760
 reduce external noise and who 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.500
 divides by two compared to a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.680
 classic technology 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.710
 we also see the fenestron the rotor 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.630
 rear which is tilted the stabilizer 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.650
 aerodynamic is looping too 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.010
 It's a first 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.610
 and then we guess that the fuselage is in 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.350
 composite 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.330
 but beyond these innovations 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 technological it's a program that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.960
 is very innovative because it 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.890
 participated he carries the transformation 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.320
 of the society 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.869
 new tools are used 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.420
 new methods of new processes 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.090
 we do not have for example two benches 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.560
 test called helicopters 0 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.720
 one that has all the equipment 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.250
 electrical and avionics and who we 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.890
 lets test in real size is 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.140
 in true geometry 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.819
 all the helicopter systems and one 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.550
 started testing them about 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.310
 18 months and then his twin brother we 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.510
 calls the dynamic hero helicopters 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.490
 which serves us to spin on the ground 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.560
 in an enclosure pro to protect any 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.330
 the power chain of the helicopter 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.950
 from engines to boxes of 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.480
 rear rotor transmission at the time 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.730
 main Nepal and the the 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.890
 work on these very test benches 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.410
 upstream now allows us to have 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.690
 a helicopter a first prototype that 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.010
 extends in a very mature definition 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.620
 if you saw the demonstration flight 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.680
 who there he simply carried out 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.780
 after five flights and a little bit more 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.220
 three hours of cumulative flight 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.220
 it's a great pride for us 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.300
 tomorrow at the helicopter scalded 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.099
 by the crisis of the civil transport since 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.930
 three years is slowly recovering 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.879
 colors a beginning of recovery on 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.440
 which believe airbus helicopter but 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.599
 the markets have nautical civilians in 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.580
 especially its cyclic site 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.760
 it's true that we're watching right now 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.349
 a slowdown but we also see 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.690
 same time a very increase 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.130
 significant tendering of 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.480
 consultations so-called 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.760
 prospects and the current evolution of the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.540
 marc market is very promising for 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.590
 Noah 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.010
 in the very short term so we go to a 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.840
 very significant recovery and I believe 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.579
 that's a chance for us with this 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.799
 device because we are going to arrive on us 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.819
 on the market exactly at the right time 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.819
 and in the right timing 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.879
 thank you for the salvation 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.400
 the 160 thus executed yesterday his fifth 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.680
 flight helicopter airbus has by the way 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.320
 launched the design phase of a new 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.769
 heavy helicopter 8.6 successor the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.769
 super cougar
