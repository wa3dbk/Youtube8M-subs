00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.729 

I'm<00:00:43.120> playing<00:00:43.540> this<00:00:43.690> as<00:00:43.900> if<00:00:44.260> it's<00:00:44.380> in<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.620> key

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
I'm playing this as if it's in the key

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.550 
I'm playing this as if it's in the key
of<00:00:44.770> G<00:00:45.150> but<00:00:46.150> I'm<00:00:46.180> using<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:46.690> capo<00:00:47.050> at<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.230> second

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
of G but I'm using a capo at the second

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.010 
of G but I'm using a capo at the second
fret<00:00:47.739> which<00:00:48.670> transposes<00:00:49.360> up<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.630> a<00:00:49.660> which

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
fret which transposes up to a which

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.540 
fret which transposes up to a which
really<00:00:50.290> sounds<00:00:50.680> more<00:00:50.950> like<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.100> bluegrass

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
really sounds more like a bluegrass

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.420 
really sounds more like a bluegrass
fiddle<00:00:51.820> or<00:00:52.180> mandolin<00:00:52.930> and<00:00:53.110> reasoning<00:00:53.920> at<00:00:54.280> is

we<00:00:54.580> have<00:00:54.700> this<00:00:54.790> stretch<00:00:55.090> here<00:00:55.739> which<00:00:56.739> it<00:00:56.950> makes

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
we have this stretch here which it makes

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.290 
we have this stretch here which it makes
a<00:00:57.160> little<00:00:57.340> easier<00:00:57.640> with<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:57.790> capo<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.180> know

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
a little easier with the capo you know

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000 
a little easier with the capo you know
the<00:00:58.390> frets<00:00:58.600> are<00:00:58.720> closer<00:00:58.900> together<00:00:59.140> if<00:00:59.769> I<00:00:59.860> did

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
the frets are closer together if I did

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.680 
the frets are closer together if I did
down<00:01:00.160> here<00:01:00.190> it's<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.730> little<00:01:00.850> bit<00:01:01.150> arduous<00:01:01.570> on

the fright hand so you're boring at the

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.060 
the fright hand so you're boring at the
