be that hard to find it then once you
click<00:02:06.659> on<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.069> it<00:02:08.069> says<00:02:08.670> right<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:08.879> that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
click on that it says right here that

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.430 
click on that it says right here that
it's<00:02:09.450> five<00:02:09.660> point<00:02:09.959> 81<00:02:10.200> gigabytes<00:02:10.679> and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
it's five point 81 gigabytes and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's five point 81 gigabytes and
I<00:02:11.470> think<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.830> application<00:02:12.370> itself<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.760> about

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
I think the application itself is about

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.390 
I think the application itself is about
another<00:02:13.150> six<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> half<00:02:13.920> I'll<00:02:14.920> check<00:02:15.370> that

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
another six and a half I'll check that

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.710 
another six and a half I'll check that
right<00:02:15.760> now<00:02:17.880> yeah<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.030> another<00:02:19.210> six<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.690> a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
right now yeah it's another six and a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.070 
right now yeah it's another six and a
half<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.740> it's<00:02:20.860> gonna<00:02:20.950> be<00:02:21.220> about<00:02:21.790> 13<00:02:22.480> gigabytes

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
half so it's gonna be about 13 gigabytes

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.740 
half so it's gonna be about 13 gigabytes
you're<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> need<00:02:24.520> 13<00:02:25.180> gigabytes<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.720> a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
you're going to need 13 gigabytes on a

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.780 
you're going to need 13 gigabytes on a
hard<00:02:26.020> drive<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.410> order<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:26.860> install<00:02:27.580> this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
hard drive in order to install this

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.180

to<00:06:05.440> put<00:06:05.680> out<00:06:05.770> there<00:06:05.979> so<00:06:06.009> the<00:06:06.310> game<00:06:06.430> works

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.580 
to put out there so the game works
perfectly<00:06:07.090> if<00:06:07.960> you<00:06:08.080> only<00:06:08.199> you<00:06:08.289> can<00:06:08.380> change

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
perfectly if you only you can change

your<00:06:08.680> graphical<00:06:09.130> settings<00:06:09.340> from<00:06:09.759> right<00:06:09.940> here

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
your graphical settings from right here

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.620 
your graphical settings from right here
in<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.419> uh<00:06:11.340> but<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.639> scanner<00:06:12.910> doesn't<00:06:13.479> take

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
in the uh but the scanner doesn't take

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.590 
in the uh but the scanner doesn't take
that<00:06:13.780> much<00:06:14.100> under<00:06:15.100> video<00:06:15.340> card<00:06:15.610> or<00:06:15.940> your

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
that much under video card or your

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.150 
that much under video card or your
processor<00:06:17.080> so<00:06:17.259> you<00:06:17.289> should<00:06:17.680> be<00:06:17.800> able<00:06:17.889> to<00:06:17.979> run

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
processor so you should be able to run

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.879 
processor so you should be able to run
it<00:06:18.310> handy<00:06:18.990> even<00:06:19.990> if<00:06:20.169> you<00:06:20.259> have<00:06:20.350> a<00:06:20.380> holder<00:06:20.710> back

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889
