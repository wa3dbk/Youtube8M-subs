00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.940
 quite high edges in case of fall 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.460
 the screen of this leader have the 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.000
 typical 6 inches with a resolution of 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.530
 800 x 600 and 16 shades of gray the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.080
 electronic ink technology that 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.270
 uses is green vizplex with which 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.530
 we get a white and in contrast very 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.850
 good 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.640
 in the format section

 erre and without giving of my standard formats 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.659
 as the xerez 2 txt html the battery 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.450
 we can make 6000 passes with it 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.340
 of pages according to the company informs us 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.540
 and as for the weight amounts to 190 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.130
 grams that is a pretty successful weight 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.230
 in terms of the connectivity of this 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.980
 reader we find a connection 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.830

 microsd expansion cards that if not 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.890
 we see its use very necessary since the 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.020
 internal memory of the reader is 2 gigs 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.570
 more than enough space to put 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.670
 a lot of books regarding 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.260

 and yes, this reader does not play music 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.890
 The menu is very simple and intuitive is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.689
 handles perfectly with the three 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.750
 buttons that you have on the bottom 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.600

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.110
 this trackpad with which we can upload 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.920
 and go down to the right in the reader so much 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.990
 how to select

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.640
 put to life 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.870
 and now to go to the page we use 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.109
 the two buttons that we have in the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.109
 lateral 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.280
 how can you check the speed of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.280
 past page is very good 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.379
 also once inside a riverbank 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.260
 by pressing the third button in the part 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.450
 bottom a menu will be displayed 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.970
 inside the rider with different 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.160
 options 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.010
 so you can see the good contrast of the 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.800
 bit expert technology let's open a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.690

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.490
 images 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.490

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.550
 As you can see, it's pretty good 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.130
 in conclusion we are before some 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.410
 wheels the surely for reading 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.120
 which has as a strong point the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.000
 electronic ink technology that 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.040
 uses vizplex and for which it 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.290
 It confers a whiteness and in contrast very 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.489
 outstanding do not have certain 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.520
 elements such as the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.500
 wi-fi connectivity touch screen or 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.030
 the music reproduction but we think 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.580
 that are not necessary and what you want 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.400
