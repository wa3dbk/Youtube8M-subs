00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.679
 beautiful is beautiful and intense rai to yours 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.480
 majesty of beloved through room instead 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.580
 guys officially welcome you 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.410
 in the last episode of blood bene i 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.510
 dirty money on the block map 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.520
 called the Italian suburbs where a lot 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.010
 we will simply see again 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 in an empty server because nobody plays 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.630
 on this map and blood money e 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.760
 directly the servers remain 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 depopulated to make a small ride 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.690
 technician on this map which is the map 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 smaller than battlefield arline is 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.219
 was the first map I played there 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.620
 night I redeemed the game then 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 it activated and is the first map that you have 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 will practically bring Nazism up 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.920
 above these stairs and then descend from 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 that ramp and become a kind of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.180
 I go to the batman like the one placed there 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.430
 in the middle of the map then guys 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.160
 let's say periphery is the most coded map 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.289
 of absolute battlefield ie it is one 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.229
 tiny map a map that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.400
 sincerely resumes as usual the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.780
 style of play can be said not to call 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 of duty but in the sense takes over the style 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.090
 graphic of the classic periphery the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.950
 classic American ghetto in which 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.290
 certainly there are big league with 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 The shot gun placed in front of the chairs 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.890
 while they sleep and while they sell off kg 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
 pounds of cocaine 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.729
 the pile of money and girls placed at 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.630
 half of the map where precisely the two 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.420
 police factions then swat 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.570
 the bandits face each other and surely 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 in this map you guys don't expect 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.070
 absolutely to make the scores of the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.200
 madonna because it is almost impossible 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.869
 very simply the reason is due 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.119
 to the fact that the players now already 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.619
 accustomed to new weapons over power like 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.409
 He says the month trek returned to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.220
 great k 10 mpx 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.690
 we even have 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.670
 n 416 and so on unfortunately those looking for 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.190
 make a quiet game directly 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.500
 at least one positive score will find 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.649
 really difficulties in this map 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.910
 because it's really not nearly so 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.650
 possible to make a positive score but given 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.810
 a score is secondary, no need 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.550
 have fun in video games but when 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.320
 it will also happen to you to die too 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.570
 often in this map because how 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.180
 you can see the enemies the players 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.790
 they can hide wherever they are 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.920
 places everywhere where someone can 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.660
 hiding will sing the two seconds e 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.260
 kill anyone passing by 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.330
 that part 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.400
 here is the fact this has done me a lot 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.290
 distort the fact nose is that this but 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.270
 they play the first night I have 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.180
 activated the game and then left it at 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.280
 stay forever talking to guys instead 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.990
 of the shotgun that this in hand is 870 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.030
 mcs of the killer class 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.830
 obviously we will make a video also attached 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.690
 for the class of the murderer himself 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.209
 I just want to tell you that it is the rifle a 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.160
 pump in arline besides being almost 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.750
 useless in long distance maps 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.690
 and expansive bagato is a shotgun because 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.060
 shots arrive late 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.090
 many times will happen to do the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.330
 exchange coffin with other players but 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.769
 this little gadget called a shield 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.040
 with which you can also beat the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.050
 people in a violent and sarcastic way 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.570
 it certainly helps a little fun too 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.160
 with this class i think i 'm 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.840
 Finally the video because there is no water 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.370
 nothing else to show this girl 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.549
 of the size of the map that is not 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.830
 that I've skipped some pieces is great so it is 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.350
 practically a corridor is a corridor 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.750
 vertical exactly where the 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.230
 rooms the little park for children i 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.110
 drug addicts and the other building and in the end there is 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.060
 the pole spawn the bandit data 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.190
 and here is the map boys think 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.380
 a bit because of boys if he concludes 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.920
 that series of blood money the money 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.019
 dirty 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.810
 now in the next videos we will see if 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.459
 make the other modes 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.530
 directly more than the other modes 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.110
 other gameplay at home as we do 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.510
 fighters 3 and battlefield 4 maybe 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.910
 obviously I will continue the latest videos 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.739
 of the series how to make easy points for 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.660
 give my personal advice on which 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.610
 I use tactics since I do 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.560
 pro calls therefore even if they are not 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.510
 I repeat therefore I will try to give you a hand 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.160
 also to understand tactics or what 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.989
 I do to make points as much for 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.609
 those of the boys I hope this 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.810
 series has helped you have 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.250
 amused you to see it 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.110
 initially the maps for those who do not have 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.580
 still the game in hand because it is there 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.290
 playing of themes in the comments what it is 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.940
 think of this map and all the 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.740
 other maps of the game itself 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.240
 we guys see you next video vi 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.280
 I invite you to leave a like if he has you 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.280
 amused and kept you company 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.870
 kept kept company throughout 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.000
 these few minutes in all this 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.940
 help in all these few minutes of 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.889
 video commented share the video 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.960
 to avoid the 93 master to grow 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.990
 and that of boys we see each other at 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.990
 next
