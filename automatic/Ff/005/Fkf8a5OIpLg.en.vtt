00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.710 
make all the difference to someone's day
on<00:00:19.380> any<00:00:19.560> particular<00:00:19.859> day<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:21.090> become<00:00:21.359> across

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
on any particular day we become across

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.410 
on any particular day we become across
probably<00:00:22.199> over<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> thousand<00:00:23.099> customers<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
probably over a thousand customers and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.200 
probably over a thousand customers and
we<00:00:24.480> could<00:00:24.630> also<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:25.109> cross<00:00:25.349> screwing<00:00:25.769> with

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
we could also be cross screwing with

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
we could also be cross screwing with
dirty<00:00:27.210> or<00:00:27.420> crew<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.890> makes<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.279> day

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
dirty or crew and that makes the day

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.070 
dirty or crew and that makes the day
interesting<00:00:29.939> too<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.630> could<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.929> quite

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
interesting too it could be quite

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.260 
interesting too it could be quite
challenging<00:00:31.520> but<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.610> also<00:00:32.940> could<00:00:33.239> be

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
challenging but it also could be

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:43.660 
challenging but it also could be
fantastic<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.170> provide
