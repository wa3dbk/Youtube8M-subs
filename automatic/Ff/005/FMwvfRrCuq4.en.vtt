00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello hello I'm karan again and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.720
 yes here you see already unpacked mine 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.490
 pictbridge I buy in lego 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.200
 stoppel I said now 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.200
 sometimes more what I have bought everything 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 First we have the brown parts like 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.859
 i can really use it for vox where 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.600
 there is still much earth left 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.910
 a few of these palisades stone 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.769
 I'll need that, too 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.109
 then have different trees to make 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.669
 We here still very much water completely 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.010
 broken for mox so i water 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.450
 can represent 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.980
 otherwise here are a few of these 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.670
 I also like green plates very well 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.270
 for forest mox then use these 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.370
 twice eighth plates and of it too 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.180
 two more times four plates for 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 later mox else ten of this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.610
 gray stone here twice 4 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.559
 I actually use the once four 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.850
 briggs but crazy just have you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.520
 maybe I'll take that one 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.989
 do not need a clue 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.229
 otherwise we have four more here 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.890
 six black plates too 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.880
 for later max once more twice 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.549
 Eighth in such a beige color 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.470
 I can use that very well for sand 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.030
 but then I have only a few 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.270
 because there are no clear ones 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 smaller ones and five such 606 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.380
 plates in dark gray otherwise have 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.900
 we here are such once again two 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 flat brix and I do not know 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.630
 to do different things or 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 maybe someday vanish too 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 so maybe for mox too 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.430
 factory you will then look nor the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.770
 same just once use of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.930
 also quite a lot 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.189
 I believe ten of these black ones 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.409
 even at 4 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.680
 definitely for later mmogs yet 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.810
 just like the one two also 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.280
 also in black 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.250
 then 1 times 4 parts in addition to the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.580
 then previous red ones still share here 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.190
 these ground plates 108 can 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.940
 I also really need it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.470
 just like these darkened 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.250
 I have windows, so to speak 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.520
 I think ten pieces that really 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.160
 cool and very many of these 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.000
 two times two weeks flattened because he 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.720
 of which I can have a few 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.890
 use 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.970
 as well as these yes I do not know 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.520
 exactly as it is called but that is 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.500
 actually these rocket tips at the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.840
 different schnitzler would have been 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.090
 I used to have that too 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.860
 a few tens or so as well 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.980
 of those in here are now 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.810
 actually like such cylinders but of 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.820
 I do not need many then 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.950
 exactly how these water parts 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.290
 I then again, in red 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.180
 you make very good rivers as a lover 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.990
 or something like that can definitely be 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.890
 very good use 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.940
 otherwise I have five boxes found 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.320
 I am very cool too 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.510
 pleased that they were there 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.920
 I also flattened those 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.250
 stones on it you can us already 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.700
 see and I found I really awesome 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.190
 I also have these red stones in there 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.690
 It would be nonsense if I told you 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.170
 Now just let it rest here 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.340
 I do not know fit 45 1 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.350
 so four to five I have in there 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.360
 Then I have two brown ones 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.140
 seats taken which actually fit 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.030
 very well 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.920
 why want to make such a shuttle the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.090
 are then usually then are 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.590
 sometimes even just of leather and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.910
 That's why I thought it needed a good one 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.830
 color somehow red are the whole 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.010
 funny from black is still about brown 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.050
 I think that's perfect then 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.780
 ten more of these, so to speak 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.420
 diamonds i thought you can 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.989
 also use as good as treasure they are 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.489
 really cool this really very good 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.790
 otherwise a few of these 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.800
 bamboo also share for Paszek pug 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.050
 or the like 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.040
 and down here we have many more 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.360
 little things to such a bright green 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.120
 Brakes are very good for forest 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.489
 use planets box 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.950
 just like these bright green parts here 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.799
 You can also use it very well for that 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:22.260
 then recreate a few of forest 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:24.980
 this one briggs have dark gray 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.660
 I just taken that way 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.120
 for those here on every corner 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.500
 actually I had a note 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.720
 actually a use I think 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.010
 but I did not remember that 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.960
 In any case, I knew that times 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.460
 wants to take 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.960
 otherwise of the goods in such 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.700
 have a nice golden color of it 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.470
 I just took five times 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.760
 At some point, such a room should be out 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.050
 gold is supposed to exist there i just have 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.639
 times a few of those taken or 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.889
 movie tron ​​or so for example if the 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.030
 to do well 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.639
 otherwise share two of these 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.860
 because it's so far from the 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.030
 man of the Iranian battle still pack the 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.980
 came out a few years ago 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.330
 they had such guns and 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.590
 the goods were built from exactly these parts 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.750
 and I think you can do that too 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.460
 wants to use such a gun 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.320
 or because they are not 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.140
 maybe such a command center or 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.960
 So there was this reason I will 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.020
 Look again what I build from it 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.350
 and the part is the last part 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.640
 just like that here and there, I have to 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.590
 say I have no idea how this is there 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.090
 come in otherwise we have 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.740
 even then left over because I found that 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.630
 also most ingenious is the most stones 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.979
 When did you see this 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.360
 transparent stones then again 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.270
 bit grayer twice 4 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.160
 and here's this water and lava and 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.780
 here still this cover plate and that has 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.470
 just this funny shape because I have that 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.260
 still in the lego cover really awesome 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.690
 got in for free space 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.090
 because really good at taking advantage of that 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.280
 now a whole public purchase yes I am 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.539
 very happy with the things for 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.710
 next time I think I would have 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.960
 take a bit more water 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.280
 but maybe that's enough 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.930
 otherwise I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.270
 my next visit to the lego star or 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.860
 wherever next big creek walls 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.419
 are and so that 's it for this video 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.860
 I hope you enjoyed it and if so 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.930
 you liked it then press 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.580
 I like and subscribe myself and me 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.580
 would say thank you for watching
