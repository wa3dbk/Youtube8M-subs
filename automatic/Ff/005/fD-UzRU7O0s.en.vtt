difference on this transformer from all
the<00:01:19.790> original<00:01:20.689> ones<00:01:20.869> is<00:01:21.080> this<00:01:21.290> circuit

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
the original ones is this circuit

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.039 
the original ones is this circuit

breaker that is um is installed and

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.359 
breaker that is um is installed and
we're<00:01:27.049> going<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.200> short<00:01:27.500> out<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.650> transformer

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
we're going to short out the transformer

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.940 
we're going to short out the transformer
on<00:01:28.490> purpose<00:01:28.850> here<00:01:29.740> just<00:01:30.740> crossing<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.430> A's<00:01:31.700> a

post actually this one is the D post
we're<00:01:37.789> going<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:37.969> put<00:01:38.149> that<00:01:38.240> in<00:01:38.359> a<00:01:38.390> dead<00:01:38.600> short

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
we're going to put that in a dead short

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.800 
we're going to put that in a dead short
condition<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.590> ground<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.569> just<00:01:41.569> bring<00:01:41.719> it

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
condition the ground and just bring it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.219 
condition the ground and just bring it
right<00:01:41.840> up<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:45.130> there<00:01:46.130> we<00:01:46.249> go<00:01:46.429> so<00:01:46.899> your<00:01:47.899> circuit

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
right up and there we go so your circuit

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.889 
right up and there we go so your circuit
breaker<00:01:48.439> snaps<00:01:48.829> out<00:01:49.130> pops<00:01:50.119> out<00:01:50.329> on<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.630> short

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
breaker snaps out pops out on the short

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.260 
breaker snaps out pops out on the short
light<00:01:51.649> goes<00:01:51.920> on<00:01:52.149> as<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.960> can<00:01:54.139> see<00:01:54.350> here<00:01:55.270> right

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
light goes on as you can see here right

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.599 
light goes on as you can see here right
this<00:01:56.450> short<00:01:56.749> is<00:01:56.929> still<00:01:57.200> there<00:01:57.439> light<00:01:58.249> is<00:01:58.399> still

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
this short is still there light is still

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.179 
this short is still there light is still
on<00:02:00.729> right<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:01.880> off<00:02:02.060> now<00:02:02.780> if<00:02:03.319> there<00:02:03.740> was<00:02:03.859> a<00:02:03.889> short

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
on right is off now if there was a short

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.459 
on right is off now if there was a short
on<00:02:04.340> another<00:02:04.579> line<00:02:04.959> let's<00:02:05.959> go<00:02:06.139> over<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.380> this

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
on another line let's go over to this

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.300 
on another line let's go over to this
line<00:02:06.709> will<00:02:06.920> short<00:02:07.159> these<00:02:07.340> out<00:02:07.630> also<00:02:08.630> here

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
line will short these out also here

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.380 
line will short these out also here
still<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.550> would<00:02:10.700> still<00:02:10.940> show<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.330> short

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
still it would still show the short

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840 
still it would still show the short
circuit<00:02:14.390> breaker<00:02:14.600> pops<00:02:14.990> out<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:16.580> cools

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
circuit breaker pops out and it cools

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.730 
circuit breaker pops out and it cools
down<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.930> if<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.410> reset<00:02:19.090> at<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.330> point<00:02:20.740> it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
down and if you reset at this point it

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.440 
down and if you reset at this point it
will<00:02:21.920> change<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.430> back<00:02:22.790> here

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
will change this back here

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.930 
will change this back here
just<00:02:27.500> run<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.530> again<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:30.349> let's<00:02:31.349> short<00:02:31.709> this

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
just run it again and let's short this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.309 
just run it again and let's short this
goes<00:02:32.940> over<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.209> side<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.660> let's<00:02:34.050> get<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
goes over this side out let's get that

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:42.500 
goes over this side out let's get that
trip<00:02:34.560> often<00:02:35.370> here<00:02:35.550> we<00:02:35.640> go<00:02:40.130> all<00:02:41.130> right<00:02:41.510> work

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
trip often here we go all right work

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.710 
trip often here we go all right work

we're<00:02:52.620> actually<00:02:52.769> affected<00:02:56.900> once<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.140> circuit

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
we're actually affected once the circuit

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.390 
we're actually affected once the circuit
breaker<00:02:58.739> cools<00:02:59.100> down<00:02:59.510> it<00:03:00.510> can<00:03:00.690> be<00:03:00.810> reset<00:03:01.400> short

breaker cools down it can be reset short
it<00:03:02.489> one<00:03:02.640> more<00:03:02.760> time<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.299> demonstrate

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
it one more time just to demonstrate

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.390 
it one more time just to demonstrate
that<00:03:07.940> check<00:03:08.940> your<00:03:09.090> breaker<00:03:09.330> cannot<00:03:09.600> be<00:03:09.750> reset

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
that check your breaker cannot be reset

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.009 
that check your breaker cannot be reset
until<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.790> pulls<00:03:12.060> down<00:03:12.269> reaches<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> point

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
until it pulls down reaches a point

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.729 
until it pulls down reaches a point
where<00:03:13.200> it's<00:03:13.319> safe<00:03:15.049> you<00:03:16.049> could<00:03:16.170> actually<00:03:16.350> hear

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
where it's safe you could actually hear

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.900 
where it's safe you could actually hear
it<00:03:17.299> reset<00:03:18.299> itself

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.360
