00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.420
 will be taken to be no wonder you are on your screens 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.910
 gameplay with bad company 2 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.760
 because today's topic with this game 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.670
 very strongly connected today I will win you 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.699
 about the most important change in the battlefield 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920
 4 it is not associated with the return 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.529
 destructible and with the return of the commander 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.160
 and the most important aspect of dyed 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.309
 shooter 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 damage in battlefield 4 will be waiting for us 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.620
 brand new damage system 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.750
 which will be closer like so many things in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.879
 battlefield 4 to the system from the beautiful 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 games battlefield bad company 2 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.160
 let's begin to understand what 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 Battlefield 3 damage is different from damage 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 bad company 2 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.190
 two things in the first place he's an order of magnitude 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 less secondly he is different let's say 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.449
 standard assault rifle in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.989
 battlefield3 deals maximum 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.120
 Damage 25 minimum 18.4 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 in bad company 2 each rifle 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.500
 completely different damage if you choose 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.750
 average guess think met 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.090
 tsiferku 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 16.7 for maximum damage for 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.250
 minimum 14.3 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.619
 well, plus an increase of 25 percent with 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.689
 using magnum ammo is also bad 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.540
 company 2 were and trunks that have 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.020
 permanent damage done to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.250
 any distance for example 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.979
 so bad company 2 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.750
 each trunk was unique judging by 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.659
 characteristics of trunks that were 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.100
 available in alpha battlefield or Crimea 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 This chip will return with different 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.170
 characteristics in this or that class 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.770
 weapons and it pleases as most 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.420
 trunks of battlefield 3 just no soul 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.420
 because they have the same damage and 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.729
 different rate of fire that's all well 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.759
 now that battlefield 4 is waiting for us 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.250
 Damage will be approximately as in bad company 2 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.470
 when you use magnum cartridges but 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.810
 We now turn to the characteristics of different 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.390
 class I will immediately say that there is not complete 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.789
 list of weapons plus release version 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.239
 some numbers may change to 2 3 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.130
 units as it was in battlefield3 with 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.709
 somehow for what they are increased by 3 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.590
 units minimum damage and so 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.810
 battlefield 4 assault characteristics 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.430
 rifles average bulg inflict 20 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.660
 maximum 16.7 minimum carbines 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.019
 maximum 20 minimum 14.3 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:38.069
 submachine gun maximum 16.7 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:41.180
 the minimum 11.2 machine gun caliber 556 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.750
 maximum 20 minimum 16 70 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.639
 sniper rifles 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.209
 here you can divide them into two classes 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:50.370
 lightweight bolts and a fine needle 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.900
 to the lungs we will assign a scout who 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.560
 maximum causes 100 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.870
 minimum 38 sb-98 which is 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.049
 a normal maximum bolt deals 100 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.340
 minimum 56 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.850
 semi-automatic rifles which 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.609
 called dmr and cause a maximum of 43 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.609
 minimum 30 but it only works in 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:15.380
 case of fish which is certain with 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:19.260
 Cas bullpup pistol m9 deals we 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.769
 25 maximum minimum 13 9 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.760
 chinese pistol with 92 max 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.790
 causes 20 minimum 12.5 but at the same time 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.380
 he has a much higher rate of fire than that 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.359
 Italian fellow and we turn to 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.160
 the most interesting type of weapons tab 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.950
 shotguns shotgun in alpha was 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.400
 presented only by memory 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.920
 So the buckshot causes 14 maximum 5 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.430
 minimum needle cartridges 10 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.030
 maximum 7.4 minimum words 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.290
 causes 100 maximum e38 minimum 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.480
 frag 37.5 max 10 min but 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.080
 this is a direct hit splash damage 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.599
 i.e. explosion damage 0 25 damage 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.970
 waiting for the return of Jesus I recently 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.560
 built an assumption on the subject of change 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.140
 damage reduction is possible 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.900
 happened due to the disappearance of effects 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.599
 suppression since the battlefield 4 you 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.030
 can only be suppressed by an explosion or 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.769
 same machine gun in battlefield3 was high 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.049
 damage because you need to do more 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.210
 shots when you're depressed about suppressing 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.540
 it was from every bullet that hit you 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.970
 or not and could crush you any 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.310
 barrel even a gun if you suddenly 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.800
 consider the game to be casual then you 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.650
 find yourself wrong bad company 2 killed 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.320
 instantly there worked the principle if in 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.229
 You got a tattoo and a corpse, but I think on it 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.850
 all write your thoughts about 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.539
 damage reduction what are the reasons and 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.789
 consequences of this change plus wait 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:53.110
 the next issue where we look at new 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.889
 modules and modifications of the old module 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.979
 subscribe comment and post 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:02.260
 likes do not forget to send brats 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.260
 see you on the battlefield bye
