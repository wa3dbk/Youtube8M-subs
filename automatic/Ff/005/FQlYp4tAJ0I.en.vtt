video tip here at a bar above and in a
previous<00:00:12.389> post<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:13.219> had<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> idea<00:00:14.519> of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
previous post we had the idea of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820 
previous post we had the idea of
separating<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.330> sweet<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.719> sour<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.740> of

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
familiar with both we're just going to

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.630 
familiar with both we're just going to
go<00:00:53.520> through<00:00:53.760> real<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.570> brief

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
go through real just brief

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.099 
go through real just brief
characteristics<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> use

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
characteristics of it and how to use

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.950 
characteristics of it and how to use
them<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.410> cocktails<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.579> lemons<00:01:00.420> obviously

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
them in cocktails so lemons obviously

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.039 
them in cocktails so lemons obviously
yellow<00:01:01.949> flesh<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.969> have<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> pretty

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
yellow flesh you have a pretty

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
yellow flesh you have a pretty
significant<00:01:04.739> white<00:01:04.949> pith<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> inside<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
significant white pith on the inside of

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.440 
significant white pith on the inside of
it<00:01:06.030> which<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.570> contribute<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.170> bittering<00:01:08.450> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it which will contribute to bittering it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
it which will contribute to bittering it
has<00:01:09.570> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.869> bitter<00:01:10.049> note<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
has kind of a bitter note to it then you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
has kind of a bitter note to it then you
have<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> flesh<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> inside<00:01:12.320> obviously

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
have the flesh on the inside obviously

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.440 
have the flesh on the inside obviously
very<00:01:13.680> yellow<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> use<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
very yellow and when you use it the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.820 
very yellow and when you use it the
yellow<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.140> comes<00:01:16.290> through<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
yellow kind of comes through in the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.730 
yellow kind of comes through in the
drink<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> cocktail<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.180> well<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> don't

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
drink and the cocktail as well you don't

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
drink and the cocktail as well you don't
want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> bite<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.299> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
want to take a bite out of this like you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
want to take a bite out of this like you
would<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.720> apple<00:01:22.080> because<00:01:22.259> obviously<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
would an apple because obviously you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.030 
would an apple because obviously you
have<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> pretty<00:01:23.580> sour<00:01:23.850> element<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:25.040> if

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
have a pretty sour element to it if

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.679 
have a pretty sour element to it if
we're<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:26.790> familiar<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> pH

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
we're if you're familiar with the pH

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.039 
we're if you're familiar with the pH
scale<00:01:28.159> like<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.340> high<00:01:29.460> school<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.479> pH<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
scale like from high school the pH of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.760 
scale like from high school the pH of
zero<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.220> very<00:01:32.790> highly<00:01:33.030> acidic<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.380> pH<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
zero is very highly acidic and the pH of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.140 
zero is very highly acidic and the pH of
14<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:35.909> basic<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> alkaline<00:01:38.150> so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
14 is very very basic and alkaline so

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.880 
14 is very very basic and alkaline so
the<00:01:39.299> lower<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.810> towards<00:01:40.229> zero<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.740> more

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the lower you go towards zero the more

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
the lower you go towards zero the more
acidic<00:01:41.220> it's<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.150> higher<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
acidic it's going to get the higher you

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.230 
acidic it's going to get the higher you
go<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.049> 14<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.159> goes<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> basic<00:01:45.000> area

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
go up to 14 it goes into the basic area

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.010 
go up to 14 it goes into the basic area
the<00:01:46.079> acidity<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> lemon<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:48.329> typically

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the acidity on the lemon the typically

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.810 
the acidity on the lemon the typically
Rican<00:01:49.470> lemon<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> be

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
Rican lemon like this one is going to be

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.870 
Rican lemon like this one is going to be
anywhere<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:51.390> 2<00:01:51.810> point<00:01:51.990> 2<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> 2.5<00:01:52.880> some

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
anywhere from 2 point 2 to 2.5 some

bright green flesh you have much smaller
of<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.940> white<00:02:52.150> pith<00:02:52.450> I'm<00:02:52.600> not<00:02:52.720> even<00:02:52.930> sure<00:02:53.080> if<00:02:53.170> you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
of a white pith I'm not even sure if you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.590 
of a white pith I'm not even sure if you
can<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.740> camera<00:02:54.190> here<00:02:54.700> but<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.360> pith

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
can see it on camera here but the pith

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.850 
can see it on camera here but the pith
of<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.820> fruit<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:58.660> much<00:02:59.170> much

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
of the fruit is actually much much

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.130 
of the fruit is actually much much
smaller<00:03:00.190> than<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.580> lemon<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.540> see<00:03:01.810> them<00:03:01.900> side

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
smaller than a lemon and see them side

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.500 
smaller than a lemon and see them side
by<00:03:02.170> side<00:03:02.320> they're<00:03:03.150> obviously<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.330> fruit

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
by side they're obviously the fruit

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.210 
by side they're obviously the fruit
itself<00:03:04.750> actually<00:03:05.050> has<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.410> kind<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.890> green

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
itself actually has a kind of a green

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.090 
itself actually has a kind of a green
kind<00:03:06.460> of<00:03:06.610> hue<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:08.680> will<00:03:08.920> also

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
kind of hue to it and that will also

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.010 
kind of hue to it and that will also
come<00:03:09.430> through<00:03:09.460> in<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.790> cocktail<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.870> keep

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
come through in a cocktail so just keep

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.400 
come through in a cocktail so just keep
that<00:03:11.050> in<00:03:11.200> mind<00:03:11.440> when<00:03:11.620> you're<00:03:11.710> creating<00:03:11.980> drinks

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
that in mind when you're creating drinks

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.260 
that in mind when you're creating drinks
now<00:03:14.410> as<00:03:14.530> far<00:03:14.710> as<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:15.190> characteristics<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.120> it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
now as far as the characteristics of it

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.910 
now as far as the characteristics of it
you<00:03:16.450> know<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.720> bright<00:03:16.960> green<00:03:17.080> flesh<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
you know the bright green flesh the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.630 
you know the bright green flesh the
small<00:03:18.400> white<00:03:18.580> pith<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.510> have<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:20.290> much<00:03:21.040> higher

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
small white pith you have a much higher

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.450 
small white pith you have a much higher
acidity<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.650> peach<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.250> is

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
acidity to it so the peach this is

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.270 
acidity to it so the peach this is
actually<00:03:24.730> 1.8<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.510> 2.0<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.200> remember<00:03:26.620> once

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
actually 1.8 to 2.0 and remember once

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.580 
actually 1.8 to 2.0 and remember once
you<00:03:27.400> go<00:03:27.520> closer<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.540> zero<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.230> actually

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
you go closer to zero it actually

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.490 
you go closer to zero it actually
becomes<00:03:29.800> a<00:03:29.920> lot<00:03:30.100> more<00:03:30.130> sour<00:03:30.760> or<00:03:31.330> acidic<00:03:32.320> and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
becomes a lot more sour or acidic and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.030 
becomes a lot more sour or acidic and
kind<00:03:32.770> of<00:03:32.860> tart<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.820> when<00:03:34.660> you're<00:03:35.040> making

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
kind of tart so when you're making

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.900 
kind of tart so when you're making
cocktails<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.610> keep<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.060> in<00:03:37.180> mind<00:03:37.890> so

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
cocktails just keep that in mind so

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.030 
cocktails just keep that in mind so
there's<00:03:39.910> been<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.330> debate<00:03:41.020> on<00:03:41.050> which<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.680> use<00:03:41.860> in

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
there's been a debate on which to use in

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.650 
there's been a debate on which to use in
which<00:03:42.190> cocktail<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:42.940> you<00:03:43.270> know<00:03:43.360> when<00:03:43.540> you're

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
which cocktail and you know when you're

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.990 
which cocktail and you know when you're
creating<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:44.080> cocktail<00:03:44.440> from<00:03:44.560> scratch<00:03:45.000> which

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
creating a cocktail from scratch which

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.090 
creating a cocktail from scratch which
way<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.240> want<00:03:46.480> to<00:03:46.570> lean<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.530> say<00:03:47.740> try<00:03:47.980> them

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
way you want to lean and I say try them

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.650 
way you want to lean and I say try them
both<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.610> mean<00:03:49.030> they're<00:03:49.180> each<00:03:49.360> going<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.600> have

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
both I mean they're each going to have

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.380 
both I mean they're each going to have
their<00:03:49.870> own<00:03:50.050> ton<00:03:50.710> of<00:03:50.740> qualities<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:52.180> you're

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
their own ton of qualities that you're

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.570 
their own ton of qualities that you're
going<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.540> be<00:03:52.660> looking<00:03:52.930> for<00:03:53.370> every<00:03:54.370> bartender

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
going to be looking for every bartender

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.910 
going to be looking for every bartender
uses<00:03:55.300> them<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.750> different<00:03:55.930> way<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:56.260> hear<00:03:56.680> some

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
uses them in a different way I hear some

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.350 
uses them in a different way I hear some
bartenders<00:03:57.370> like<00:03:57.940> using<00:03:59.430> limes<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.910> things

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
bartenders like using limes in things

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.090 
bartenders like using limes in things
that<00:04:01.420> have<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.660> lot<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:01.960> vegetal<00:04:02.440> qualities<00:04:02.920> to

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
that have a lot of vegetal qualities to

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.510 
that have a lot of vegetal qualities to
it<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.490> like<00:04:03.820> limes<00:04:04.750> go<00:04:05.080> with<00:04:05.500> gin<00:04:05.920> limes

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
it so like limes go with gin limes

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.840 
it so like limes go with gin limes
they'll<00:04:07.120> use<00:04:07.300> it<00:04:07.510> in<00:04:07.630> tequila<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:09.640> rum

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
they'll use it in tequila and in rum

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.970 
they'll use it in tequila and in rum
which<00:04:10.600> makes<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.110> lot<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.260> sense<00:04:11.620> if<00:04:11.770> you<00:04:11.830> look

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
which makes a lot of sense if you look

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.440 
which makes a lot of sense if you look
at<00:04:12.130> some<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.490> classic<00:04:12.760> cocktails<00:04:13.390> that

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
at some of the classic cocktails that

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.570 
at some of the classic cocktails that
are<00:04:13.600> coming<00:04:13.870> out<00:04:13.990> and<00:04:14.170> how<00:04:14.920> they<00:04:15.070> balance<00:04:15.220> them

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
are coming out and how they balance them

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.550 
are coming out and how they balance them
you<00:04:15.850> know<00:04:15.970> they<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.450> an<00:04:16.600> affinity<00:04:17.049> towards

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
you know they have an affinity towards

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.690 
you know they have an affinity towards
each<00:04:18.340> other<00:04:18.730> and<00:04:19.470> lemon<00:04:20.470> you<00:04:20.650> want<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.400> clean

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
each other and lemon you want that clean

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.719 
each other and lemon you want that clean
profile<00:04:22.210> so<00:04:22.540> like<00:04:22.840> vodka<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:24.280> going<00:04:24.490> to<00:04:24.550> come

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
profile so like vodka is going to come

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.020 
profile so like vodka is going to come
through<00:04:24.940> so<00:04:25.930> as<00:04:26.350> far<00:04:27.040> as<00:04:27.100> my<00:04:27.250> preference

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
through so as far as my preference

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.020 
through so as far as my preference
I actually<00:04:28.389> prefer<00:04:28.810> to<00:04:29.080> use<00:04:29.200> both<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:30.700> try

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
I actually prefer to use both and try

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.810 
I actually prefer to use both and try
them<00:04:31.180> up<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:31.510> barium<00:04:32.220> between<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.310> two<00:04:33.520> and

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
them up in barium between the two and

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.990 
them up in barium between the two and
just<00:04:34.600> an<00:04:34.690> example<00:04:35.290> let's<00:04:36.250> let's<00:04:36.580> take<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.790> look

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
just an example let's let's take a look

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.090 
just an example let's let's take a look
at<00:04:37.090> one<00:04:37.330> specific<00:04:37.510> cocktail<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:40.000> let's<00:04:40.270> vodka

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
at one specific cocktail so let's vodka

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.830 
at one specific cocktail so let's vodka
if<00:04:42.100> you<00:04:42.400> use<00:04:42.580> lemon<00:04:42.970> juice<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.480> lemon<00:04:43.630> drop

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
if you use lemon juice it's a lemon drop

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.930 
if you use lemon juice it's a lemon drop
if<00:04:44.139> you<00:04:44.380> use<00:04:44.530> lime<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:45.460> have<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.610> different

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
if you use lime you have a different

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.220 
if you use lime you have a different
cocktail<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.480> that<00:04:46.600> one's<00:04:46.780> called<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.050> gimlet

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
cocktail and that one's called a gimlet

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.440 
cocktail and that one's called a gimlet
so<00:04:47.740> there's<00:04:48.370> essentially<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:49.030> same<00:04:49.150> thing

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
so there's essentially the same thing

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.390 
so there's essentially the same thing
but<00:04:49.960> by<00:04:50.080> substituting<00:04:50.740> out<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.100> even<00:04:51.250> a

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
but by substituting out and even a

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.210 
but by substituting out and even a
smallest<00:04:51.730> thing<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.650> citrus<00:04:54.010> you

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
smallest thing like the the citrus you

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.890 
smallest thing like the the citrus you
actually<00:04:54.610> change<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.030> cocktail<00:04:55.389> completely

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
actually change the cocktail completely

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.780 
actually change the cocktail completely
so<00:04:56.710> there<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:56.919> have<00:04:56.980> it

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
so there you have it

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.790 
so there you have it
you<00:04:58.180> know<00:04:58.360> just<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.600> quick<00:04:58.840> quick<00:04:59.560> run-through

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
you know just a quick quick run-through

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.909 
you know just a quick quick run-through
between<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.430> two<00:05:00.580> citruses<00:05:01.230> as<00:05:02.230> always<00:05:02.740> feel

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
between the two citruses as always feel

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.010 
between the two citruses as always feel

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
is actually really delving a lot deeper
