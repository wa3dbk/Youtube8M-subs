00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
take it from there but while I'm at I
noticed<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.259> a<00:01:04.290> blemish<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
noticed we have like a blemish here you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.070 
noticed we have like a blemish here you
can<00:01:05.219> see<00:01:05.399> there's<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.670> piece<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.390> tape<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
can see there's a piece of tape if I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
can see there's a piece of tape if I
were<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.470> cover<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.340> piece<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
were just to cover that a piece of a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
were just to cover that a piece of a
paper<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.870> mean<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> tape<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> wall

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
paper I mean on the tape on on the wall

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820 
paper I mean on the tape on on the wall
if<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> cover<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.590> joint

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
if I was just to cover that with joint

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.710 
if I was just to cover that with joint
compound<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.460> probably<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.120> still<00:01:15.390> stick

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
compound this probably would still stick

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
compound this probably would still stick
up<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.620> now<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> way<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.159> take<00:01:17.490> care<00:01:17.760> that<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
up so now the way we take care that is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
up so now the way we take care that is
is<00:01:18.540> actually<00:01:19.409> make<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> mess<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.880> just

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
is actually make more of a mess you just

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
is actually make more of a mess you just
cut<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.479> tip<00:01:21.810> paper<00:01:22.020> off<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> little

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
cut the tip paper off like this a little

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
cut the tip paper off like this a little
bit<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.330> you've<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.080> an

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
bit and now you've got kind of an

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.560 
bit and now you've got kind of an
indentation<00:01:25.970> but<00:01:26.970> now<00:01:27.119> we're<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> use

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
indentation but now we're going to use

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690 
indentation but now we're going to use
the<00:01:27.750> hammer<00:01:27.960> head<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> end<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the hammer head that's on the end and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.289 
the hammer head that's on the end and
we're<00:01:29.940> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> make<00:01:30.240> an<00:01:30.390> indentation<00:01:30.840> now

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.460 

now<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> looks<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.750> we've<00:01:36.900> caused<00:01:37.170> more

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
now it looks like we've caused more

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.039 
now it looks like we've caused more
damage<00:01:37.680> than<00:01:38.040> than<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.520> had<00:01:38.700> before<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.390> with

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
damage than than we had before but with

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.219

more compound down than necessary at
this<00:02:26.220> point<00:02:27.500> we<00:02:28.500> make<00:02:28.709> sure<00:02:28.890> everything's

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
this point we make sure everything's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:39.259 
this point we make sure everything's
filled<00:02:36.140> then<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.260> clean<00:02:37.530> off<00:02:37.680> your<00:02:37.709> blade<00:02:38.269> so

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
filled then you clean off your blade so

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.530 
filled then you clean off your blade so
you<00:02:39.329> have<00:02:40.519> no<00:02:41.519> lines<00:02:41.820> on<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.269> I'm<00:02:42.329> going<00:02:42.480> to

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
apply pressure to the top edge of the

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.640 
apply pressure to the top edge of the
blade<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.269> not<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.049> much<00:02:46.170> pressure<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
blade here and not as much pressure to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.270 
blade here and not as much pressure to
the<00:02:46.739> bottom<00:02:47.010> edge<00:02:47.359> and<00:02:48.859> just<00:02:49.859> pull<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.190> across

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the bottom edge and just pull it across

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.820 
the bottom edge and just pull it across
like<00:02:50.790> this

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.440 

and<00:02:55.830> then<00:02:56.100> do<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.400> opposite<00:02:56.819> from<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> bottom

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
and then do the opposite from the bottom

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.820 
and then do the opposite from the bottom
side<00:02:57.600> applying<00:02:58.020> pressure<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> bottom

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
side applying pressure on the bottom

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:10.990 
side applying pressure on the bottom
edge<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.130> not<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.550> top<00:02:59.790> edge<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:09.350> then<00:03:10.350> it's

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
edge and not the top edge and then it's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:25.890 
edge and not the top edge and then it's
smooth<00:03:12.000> right<00:03:12.270> across<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.720> middle

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.940
