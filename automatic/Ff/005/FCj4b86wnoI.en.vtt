just<00:02:19.680> see<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.660> program<00:02:22.040> can<00:02:23.040> be<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.190> warning

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
just see this program can be a warning

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.950 
just see this program can be a warning
about<00:02:23.640> strong<00:02:24.060> language<00:02:25.010> yes<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.660> now<00:02:30.810> I'm

playing the content and you see it

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.930 
playing the content and you see it
streams<00:02:32.730> perfectly<00:02:33.330> well<00:02:34.730> basically<00:02:35.730> because

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
streams perfectly well basically because

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.200 
streams perfectly well basically because

you<00:02:39.210> can<00:02:39.390> also<00:02:39.540> at<00:02:40.320> this<00:02:40.500> point<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.160> wanted

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
you can also at this point if you wanted

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.770 
you can also at this point if you wanted
to<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.720> disconnect<00:02:44.570> your<00:02:45.920> idents<00:02:46.920> cloaca

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
to you can disconnect your idents cloaca

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.150 
to you can disconnect your idents cloaca
whether<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.900> want<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.410> probably

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
whether you want to do that probably

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.640 
whether you want to do that probably
depends<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.850> speed<00:02:51.260> identity<00:02:52.260> poker<00:02:52.440> will

depends on the speed identity poker will
actually<00:02:53.040> speed<00:02:53.370> up<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.670> lot<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.910> connections

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
actually speed up a lot of connections

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.010 
actually speed up a lot of connections
because<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:56.360> because<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.510> has<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> compression

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020

because it because it has a compression
algorithm<00:02:58.560> put<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.730> if<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.880> find<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.270> a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
algorithm put in but if you find it's a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
little bit slower you can actually

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.310 
little bit slower you can actually
disconnect<00:03:02.100> at<00:03:02.580> this<00:03:02.760> point<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.840> it'll<00:03:04.110> still

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
disconnect at this point and it'll still

disconnect at this point and it'll still
carry<00:03:04.560> on<00:03:04.709> playing<00:03:04.950> however<00:03:05.880> if<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.270> wanted

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
carry on playing however if you wanted

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.240 
carry on playing however if you wanted
to<00:03:06.660> switch<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.230> another<00:03:07.260> program<00:03:07.740> you'll<00:03:08.070> have

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
to switch to another program you'll have

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.490 
to switch to another program you'll have
to<00:03:08.340> reconnect<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:09.060> because<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.480> checks<00:03:09.810> right

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
to reconnect it because it checks right

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.240 
to reconnect it because it checks right
at<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.770> beginning<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:11.220> each<00:03:11.280> program<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:13.250> BBC

at the beginning of each program the BBC
want<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.640> site<00:03:14.850> all<00:03:15.060> works<00:03:15.330> like<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.110> if

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
want the site all works like that so if

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.140 
want the site all works like that so if
you're<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.769> watch<00:03:16.860> your<00:03:17.100> program<00:03:17.489> all

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
you're going to watch your program all

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.060 
you're going to watch your program all
the<00:03:18.269> way<00:03:18.360> through<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.200> can<00:03:19.230> disconnect<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.980> if

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
the way through you can disconnect it if

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.729 
the way through you can disconnect it if
you<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.600> depending<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.050> as<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.320> say<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.620> the
