my<00:03:40.310> food<00:03:40.550> processor<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:41.209> can<00:03:41.240> also<00:03:41.420> do<00:03:41.660> this

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
my food processor you can also do this

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.180 
my food processor you can also do this
on<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:41.959> box<00:03:42.200> grater<00:03:42.319> but<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:42.709> have<00:03:42.860> one<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.040> these

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
on a box grater but I have one of these

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.000 
on a box grater but I have one of these
shredder<00:03:44.150> tools<00:03:44.720> that<00:03:45.050> goes<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.349> here<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:45.800> it's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
shredder tools that goes on here so it's

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.479 
shredder tools that goes on here so it's
very<00:03:46.250> convenient<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.510> only<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:48.590> part<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:49.190> that

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
very convenient the only in part is that

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.729 
very convenient the only in part is that
it's<00:03:50.239> somewhat<00:03:50.630> broken<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.349> have<00:03:51.620> to

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
it's somewhat broken in that I have to

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.949 
it's somewhat broken in that I have to
push<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.099> button<00:03:52.340> down<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:53.420> order<00:03:53.660> for<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.870> to

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
push this button down in order for it to

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.020 
push this button down in order for it to
work<00:03:54.020> because<00:03:54.470> normally<00:03:54.860> would<00:03:55.010> whatever<00:03:55.580> so

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
work because normally would whatever so

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.430 
work because normally would whatever so
it's<00:03:56.390> a<00:03:56.420> little<00:03:56.450> tricky<00:03:56.810> because<00:03:57.020> it<00:03:57.290> had<00:03:57.380> to

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
it's a little tricky because it had to

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.840 
it's a little tricky because it had to
use<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.620> chopstick<00:03:57.860> to<00:03:58.220> operate<00:03:58.550> my<00:03:58.670> food
