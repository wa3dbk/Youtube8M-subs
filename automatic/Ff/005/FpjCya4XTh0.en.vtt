00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.800 

okay<00:00:01.199> I<00:00:01.650> guess<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.159> showing<00:00:02.460> off<00:00:02.639> my<00:00:02.810> bank

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
okay I guess I'm showing off my bank

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.519 
okay I guess I'm showing off my bank
switching<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:04.680> my<00:00:04.859> px8<00:00:06.140> transmitter<00:00:07.140> today

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
switching with my px8 transmitter today

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.970 
switching with my px8 transmitter today
and<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.880> guess<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.420> problem<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:10.080> was<00:00:10.260> having<00:00:10.320> was

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
and I guess the problem I was having was

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:20.870 
and I guess the problem I was having was
that<00:00:14.299> my<00:00:15.299> gyro<00:00:15.750> game<00:00:16.199> channel<00:00:19.400> all<00:00:20.400> three<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that my gyro game channel all three of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.529 
that my gyro game channel all three of
my<00:00:20.970> game<00:00:21.240> positions<00:00:21.960> were<00:00:22.170> too<00:00:22.380> high<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.210> had<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
my game positions were too high I had to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.120 
my game positions were too high I had to
run<00:00:25.500> something<00:00:25.980> more<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> positive<00:00:27.330> 100

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
run something more like a positive 100

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.229 
run something more like a positive 100
zero<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> minus<00:00:30.060> 100<00:00:31.250> from<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> gear

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
zero to a minus 100 from the gear

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.620 
zero to a minus 100 from the gear
channel<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> gyro<00:00:35.219> sensor<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.000> I'm

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
channel by for the gyro sensor and I'm

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.770 
channel by for the gyro sensor and I'm
using<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.170> rudder<00:00:37.380> switch<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:39.510> switch

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
using the rudder switch to switch

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.910 
using the rudder switch to switch
between<00:00:40.110> my<00:00:40.700> flight<00:00:41.700> modes<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.510> this<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:47.600> scale

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
between my flight modes so this is scale

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
between my flight modes so this is scale
and<00:00:50.059> then<00:00:51.059> sport<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:53.030> then<00:00:54.030> 3d<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.760> can

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and then sport and then 3d and you can

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.639 
and then sport and then 3d and you can
see<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> auxiliary<00:01:00.440> Channel<00:01:01.440> right<00:01:01.620> here

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
see the auxiliary Channel right here

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.320 
see the auxiliary Channel right here
which<00:01:03.219> is<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:04.080> gyro<00:01:05.080> gear<00:01:05.500> Channel<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:07.060> now

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
which is the gyro gear Channel and now

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.910 
which is the gyro gear Channel and now

the heart position i have preset my tail

the heart position i have preset my tail
gain<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.159> yaw<00:01:27.369> rate<00:01:29.100> already<00:01:32.909> show<00:01:33.909> you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
gain and yaw rate already show you

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.760 
gain and yaw rate already show you
something<00:01:34.479> else<00:01:34.690> you<00:01:35.140> know<00:01:37.080> if<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.229> watch<00:01:38.500> my

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
something else you know if you watch my

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.169 
something else you know if you watch my
swash<00:01:39.100> plate<00:01:41.399> one<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.580> scale<00:01:42.970> mode<00:01:45.179> this

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
swash plate one of the scale mode this

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.350 
swash plate one of the scale mode this
is<00:01:46.509> must<00:01:47.050> roll<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.740> elevator<00:01:48.280> will<00:01:49.030> allow

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
is must roll of the elevator will allow

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.059 
is must roll of the elevator will allow
until<00:01:50.020> i<00:01:50.380> go<00:01:50.560> for<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:51.869> 3d<00:01:52.869> mode<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.560> gives<00:01:53.800> me

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
until i go for a 3d mode that gives me

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:00.609 
until i go for a 3d mode that gives me
more<00:01:54.340> throw<00:01:54.670> so

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.389 

skill<00:02:01.219> mode<00:02:01.460> again<00:02:01.789> where<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.979> don't<00:02:03.979> have<00:02:04.189> that

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
skill mode again where I don't have that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.040 
skill mode again where I don't have that
much<00:02:04.609> throw<00:02:05.530> number<00:02:06.530> three<00:02:06.829> demos<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:08.800> lot<00:02:09.800> more

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
much throw number three demos a lot more

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.980 
much throw number three demos a lot more
pork<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.379> then

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
pork and then

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.680 
pork and then
3d<00:02:14.690> there's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> lot<00:02:15.930> marks<00:02:16.320> over

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.840 

so<00:02:21.080> now<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.320> think<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.950> switch<00:02:22.250> between<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
so now I think of switch between the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.110 
so now I think of switch between the
three<00:02:23.090> different<00:02:23.270> flight<00:02:23.690> modes<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:25.120> find

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
three different flight modes and find

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.400 
three different flight modes and find
what<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.920> feel<00:02:27.920> most<00:02:28.220> comfortable<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:29.420> lot<00:02:30.200> where

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
what I feel most comfortable a lot where

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.670 
what I feel most comfortable a lot where
it's<00:02:30.530> most<00:02:30.770> comfortable<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.370> me<00:02:31.930> go<00:02:32.930> again<00:02:33.080> in

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
it's most comfortable to me go again in

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.800 
it's most comfortable to me go again in
the<00:02:33.830> window<00:02:34.040> there<00:02:34.400> right<00:02:35.390> here<00:02:35.570> where<00:02:35.750> it

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the window there right here where it

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.190 
the window there right here where it
says<00:02:35.870> other<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:39.350> see<00:02:39.620> worse<00:02:39.860> which<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:41.200> I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
says other you see worse which is I

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:55.350 
says other you see worse which is I
don't<00:02:42.260> know

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.290 

it<00:02:55.960> doesn't<00:02:56.380> real<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:56.770> not<00:02:56.830> that

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
it doesn't real it's not that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.150 
it doesn't real it's not that
instantaneous<00:02:58.300> when<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:59.040> change<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
instantaneous when you change the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.360 
instantaneous when you change the
swishing<00:03:00.640> between<00:03:01.000> banks

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.880 

this<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.269> nice<00:03:08.510> -<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.870> believe<00:03:09.290> I'll<00:03:09.500> be<00:03:09.530> able<00:03:09.739> to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
this is nice - I believe I'll be able to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.009 
this is nice - I believe I'll be able to
set<00:03:10.160> up<00:03:10.310> their<00:03:10.489> friend<00:03:11.590> levels<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.800> pitch<00:03:13.040> also

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
set up their friend levels of pitch also

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.010 
set up their friend levels of pitch also
anyway<00:03:15.019> thanks<00:03:15.470> for<00:03:15.530> watching
