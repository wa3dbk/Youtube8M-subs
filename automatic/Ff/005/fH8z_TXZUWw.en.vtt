00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.660
 parenthesis 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.850

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 the world championship of singing to 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.360
 cappella in which every four years 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.939
 the best teams on the planet compete 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 for world supremacy 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.640
 no American team has ever won 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.170
 all candles must open the house 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.409

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.840

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.950

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.709
