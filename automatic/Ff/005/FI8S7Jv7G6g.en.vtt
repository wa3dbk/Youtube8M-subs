00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.779
 so hello everybody I continue on 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.190
 tell about the assembly model 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.680
 and Sasha this b 40 41 and the next is 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.330
 I will show the assembly of shock absorbers by example 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.750
 front shock absorber 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.200
 how to collect it correctly the first thing 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.760
 need to make it make sure that that 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:28.770
 there are no built parts 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:35.880
 They do not have the following take a grease for 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:37.860
 ringlets and we introduce this lubricant there then 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.770
 I was a little overdone with grease 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.739
 Of course randomly from a tube if large 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.010
 knows nothing terrible because with the help 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.610
 grease also lubricate our ring 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.230
 take it so i lubricate it so the following is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.420
 set the ring here there we take 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.510
 plastic hat and also 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.100
 we set it up a little bit 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.540
 make sure that we have it all there 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:16.260
 Here again, we take our mask grease 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 ring one more and set it 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:24.510
 Now here is the following, we take as 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.490
 tighter twists it is desirable to 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.360
 did not unwind though plastic should 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.830
 unwind and insert our pins i 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:40.430
 already collected that is nothing complicated 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:43.650
 we install so we check work 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:49.430
 great next this let's take a little bit 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:57.730
 grease the tip slightly 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:02:00.320
 and take our ending plastic and 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.770
 ball cut a little thread that is 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.410
 not a new depth there by a couple of millimeters 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:15.740
 so fine now install it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:20.209
 here the lubricant will give better less friction and 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:24.040
 faster twist finally when we 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.600
 presley spins we take a rag 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.430
 we clamp 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.430
 pliers so here and twist on 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.250
 after we screwed it is necessary to measure 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.709
 distance from points to make sure that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.560
 we have a distance from the front model 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.580
 there is no need for shock absorbers 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.810
 was 29 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.810
 then dokruchivaem to 27 and 3 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.760
 the main thing is not to overdo it 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.370
 if there will be a little bit more 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.370
 less is nothing wrong so look 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.910
 20 entries 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.900
 so the following is take and filled 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:18.970
 oil that was included 35 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:21.970
 viscosity our shock absorber me and 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.970
 fill in 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.340
 so filled 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 practically 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:44.370
 so we will wait until the plan comes out 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:48.060
 bubbles that are here and continue 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.060
 further assembly
