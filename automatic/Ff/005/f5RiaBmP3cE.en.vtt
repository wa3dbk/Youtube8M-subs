goes right back down into the bucket

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
goes right back down into the bucket
inside<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> bucket<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:24.119> birdbath<00:01:24.869> de-icer

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
inside the bucket is a birdbath de-icer

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.080 
inside the bucket is a birdbath de-icer
and<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.580> small<00:01:27.240> Harbor<00:01:28.140> Freight<00:01:28.380> pump<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and a small Harbor Freight pump and you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.950 
and a small Harbor Freight pump and you
can<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> front<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.630> waters

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
can see from the front that the waters

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
can see from the front that the waters
my<00:01:39.960> birds<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.439> getting<00:01:40.560> water<00:01:40.920> because

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
my birds are getting water because

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.330 
my birds are getting water because
you're<00:01:41.610> dripping<00:01:41.939> water<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.570> front<00:01:43.340> so

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you're dripping water down the front so

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.940 
you're dripping water down the front so
anyway<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.140> pretty<00:01:46.140> effective<00:01:46.259> design

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
anyway it's a pretty effective design

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.240 
anyway it's a pretty effective design
it's<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> five-gallon<00:01:48.450> bucket<00:01:49.250> that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it's actually a five-gallon bucket that

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
it's actually a five-gallon bucket that
will<00:01:50.430> hold<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.850> three<00:01:51.299> days<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.720> water<00:01:51.930> for

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
will hold about three days of water for

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.380 
will hold about three days of water for
these<00:01:52.350> guys<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:56.340> nice<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.880> can't<00:01:57.240> get

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
these guys so it's nice if you can't get

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
these guys so it's nice if you can't get
out<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:57.750> first<00:01:58.259> thing<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> morning

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
out there first thing in the morning

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.090 
out there first thing in the morning
every<00:01:59.340> morning<00:01:59.670> and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.940 

the<00:02:04.100> idea<00:02:04.520> with<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.290> situation<00:02:06.290> like<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:06.710> you

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the idea with a situation like this you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.180 
the idea with a situation like this you
have<00:02:06.980> to<00:02:07.400> keep<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.630> water<00:02:09.229> clean<00:02:09.619> otherwise

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
have to keep the water clean otherwise

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.400 
have to keep the water clean otherwise
the<00:02:10.490> pump<00:02:10.760> will<00:02:10.910> get<00:02:11.090> clogged<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:15.020> have<00:02:15.140> four

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the pump will get clogged we have four

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.180 
the pump will get clogged we have four
roosters<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.280> kind<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.580> tough<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:18.190> you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
roosters so this is kind of tough so you

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.270 
roosters so this is kind of tough so you
want<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.700> have<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> good<00:02:20.270> overhang<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.350> keep<00:02:21.590> any

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
want to have a good overhang to keep any

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.230 
want to have a good overhang to keep any
feathers<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.420> poop<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.140> litter<00:02:24.440> out<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:25.700> as

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
feathers and poop and litter out and as

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.680 
feathers and poop and litter out and as
much<00:02:26.420> dirt<00:02:26.720> as<00:02:26.900> possible<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:28.150> might<00:02:29.150> even<00:02:29.390> add<00:02:29.660> a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
much dirt as possible I might even add a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.520 
much dirt as possible I might even add a
little<00:02:29.990> cheese<00:02:30.680> cloth<00:02:31.210> wrap<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.720> pump<00:02:33.140> so

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
little cheese cloth wrap to the pump so

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.830 
little cheese cloth wrap to the pump so
that<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.890> acts<00:02:34.160> as<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.400> filter<00:02:34.760> but<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.690> hasn't

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
that it acts as a filter but it hasn't

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.570 
that it acts as a filter but it hasn't
become<00:02:36.050> an<00:02:36.290> issue<00:02:36.380> yet<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.070> I've<00:02:37.190> had<00:02:37.400> this

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
become an issue yet and I've had this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.680 
become an issue yet and I've had this
running<00:02:37.820> now<00:02:38.120> for<00:02:38.890> about<00:02:39.890> four<00:02:40.190> days<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.880> if<00:02:41.540> it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
running now for about four days so if it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.450 
running now for about four days so if it
becomes<00:02:41.960> an<00:02:42.170> issue<00:02:42.260> I'll<00:02:42.680> deal<00:02:42.920> with<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.220> but

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
becomes an issue I'll deal with it but

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.370 
becomes an issue I'll deal with it but
that's<00:02:44.120> one<00:02:44.420> design<00:02:44.920> flow<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.950> can<00:02:46.220> see<00:02:47.380> but

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
that's one design flow I can see but

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.380 
that's one design flow I can see but
it's<00:02:48.530> really<00:02:48.710> nice<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.640> buckets<00:02:50.030> keep<00:02:50.240> the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
it's really nice the buckets keep the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.560 
it's really nice the buckets keep the
chickens<00:02:50.750> away<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:52.310> water<00:02:52.580> they<00:02:53.030> found<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:53.450> no

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
chickens away the water they found it no

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.670 
chickens away the water they found it no
problem<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:55.660> I've<00:02:56.660> got<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> three<00:02:57.230> day<00:02:57.410> supply

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
problem and I've got a three day supply

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.570 
problem and I've got a three day supply
of<00:02:57.920> heated<00:02:58.459> water<00:02:59.350> that's<00:03:00.350> about<00:03:00.530> 25<00:03:01.130> degrees

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
of heated water that's about 25 degrees

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.810 
of heated water that's about 25 degrees
outside<00:03:02.740> it's<00:03:03.740> a<00:03:03.800> bit<00:03:03.950> warmer<00:03:04.280> than<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.610> in

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
outside it's a bit warmer than that in

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:12.370 
outside it's a bit warmer than that in
the<00:03:04.910> coop<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.830> see<00:03:07.130> what<00:03:07.280> my<00:03:11.380> theranos

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
the coop and I see what my theranos

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.449 
the coop and I see what my theranos
reading<00:03:12.739> about<00:03:12.980> 40<00:03:13.580> degrees<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:16.160> thing's

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
reading about 40 degrees so this thing's

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.520 
reading about 40 degrees so this thing's
doing<00:03:16.850> its<00:03:16.970> job<00:03:17.209> it's<00:03:17.930> right<00:03:18.110> where<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.350> want

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
doing its job it's right where you want

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.740 
doing its job it's right where you want
the<00:03:18.650> water<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:24.980> my<00:03:25.670> upstate<00:03:26.540> New

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
the water and that is my upstate New

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.140 
the water and that is my upstate New
York<00:03:26.780> heated<00:03:27.709> chicken<00:03:28.640> water<00:03:31.150> they'll

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
York heated chicken water they'll

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.729 
York heated chicken water they'll
probably<00:03:32.300> be<00:03:32.540> an<00:03:32.630> evolving<00:03:33.110> design<00:03:33.500> just

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
probably be an evolving design just

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.320 
probably be an evolving design just
because<00:03:34.100> I'm<00:03:34.280> an<00:03:34.400> engineer<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.090> like<00:03:35.180> to

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
because I'm an engineer and I like to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.870 
because I'm an engineer and I like to
tweak<00:03:35.570> things<00:03:35.800> but<00:03:36.800> as<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.430> works<00:03:37.610> really

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
tweak things but as is it works really

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.560 
tweak things but as is it works really
well<00:03:38.050> hope<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.200> enjoyed<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.970> take<00:03:40.970> care<00:03:41.239> and
