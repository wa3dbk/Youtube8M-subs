about adduction add to bring back hand

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.460 
about adduction add to bring back hand
to<00:00:28.439> bring<00:00:28.619> back<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.100> so<00:00:30.000> how's<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.020> workout

to bring back in so how's this workout

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.799 
to bring back in so how's this workout
and<00:00:31.529> Sprint's<00:00:32.130> attracted<00:00:32.550> field<00:00:32.790> well<00:00:33.720> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and Sprint's attracted field well the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.240 
and Sprint's attracted field well the
whole<00:00:33.930> thing<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.140> adduction<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.830> that<00:00:35.070> when

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
whole thing with adduction is that when

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
whole thing with adduction is that when
there's<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.879> room<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> move<00:00:36.629> up<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
there's very little room to move up and

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.890 
there's very little room to move up and
down<00:00:37.379> so<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.040> you're<00:00:38.190> down<00:00:38.400> here<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.480> hip

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
down so if you're down here the hip

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.760 
down so if you're down here the hip
flexors<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:41.210> very<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:43.110> room<00:00:43.199> to<00:00:43.470> help<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
flexors are very little room to help you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.180 
flexors are very little room to help you
out<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.850> what's<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.210> next<00:00:45.449> best<00:00:45.720> thing<00:00:46.190> instead

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
out so what's my next best thing instead

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.600 
out so what's my next best thing instead
of<00:00:47.340> trying<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.699> live<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.720> we<00:00:49.110> bring<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.220> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of trying to live if we bring it in you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.430 
of trying to live if we bring it in you
notice<00:00:50.790> that<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.390> comes<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.200> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
notice that it all comes in you get a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.750 
notice that it all comes in you get a
greater<00:00:52.770> range<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.190> movement<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.700> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
greater range of movement which is the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.670 
greater range of movement which is the
whole<00:00:53.910> point<00:00:54.120> when<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.450> sprint<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.260> how<00:00:55.530> much

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
whole point when you sprint is how much

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.729 
whole point when you sprint is how much
room<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.790> things<00:00:57.000> move<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.809> better<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.620> more

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
room can things move the better the more

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.209 
room can things move the better the more
room<00:00:58.950> things<00:00:59.160> move<00:00:59.399> too<00:00:59.700> fast<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.420> so

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
room things move too fast we can go so

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
room things move too fast we can go so
once<00:01:02.219> again<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.450> here

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
once again if I'm are really here

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
once again if I'm are really here
there's<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.739> much<00:01:05.009> I<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.190> do<00:01:05.430> here<00:01:05.670> because

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
there's not much I can do here because

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.999 
there's not much I can do here because
hip<00:01:06.420> flex<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.750> technically<00:01:07.229> passionately

engaged<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:09.060> my<00:01:09.210> next<00:01:09.540> best<00:01:09.750> thing<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.259> do<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
engaged so my next best thing to do is

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.510 
engaged so my next best thing to do is
instead<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.060> trying<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.690> do<00:01:12.899> this<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:13.860> when

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
instead of trying to do this here when

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480 
instead of trying to do this here when
his<00:01:14.610> leg<00:01:14.759> is<00:01:14.910> back<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.600> add<00:01:16.170> duck<00:01:16.649> bring<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
his leg is back here add duck bring it

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.130 
his leg is back here add duck bring it
back<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.789> the<00:01:17.880> surface<00:01:18.330> now<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:19.020> people

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
back to the surface now a lot people

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.389 
back to the surface now a lot people
don't<00:01:19.289> like<00:01:19.440> things<00:01:19.590> come<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.039> midline

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
don't like things come to the midline

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.120 
don't like things come to the midline
but<00:01:20.820> once<00:01:21.180> again<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> next<00:01:22.619> best

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but once again it's the next best

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
but once again it's the next best
movement<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:24.450> things<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:25.380> you've<00:01:25.500> already

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
don't think the bicycles are already

don't think the bicycles are already
here<00:01:31.709> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.720> something<00:01:34.170> me

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
here you know how can I do something me

here you know how can I do something me
add<00:01:35.819> that<00:01:35.880> rotation<00:01:36.300> rotation<00:01:36.899> is<00:01:37.080> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
add that rotation rotation is the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
add that rotation rotation is the
biggest<00:01:37.410> thing<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.830> how<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.099> work<00:01:38.160> first

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
biggest thing so how does it work first

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:47.449 
biggest thing so how does it work first
start<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:45.649> stop<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:46.979> knees<00:01:47.039> there's

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
start so my stop was on my knees there's

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.370 
start so my stop was on my knees there's
not<00:01:47.610> much<00:01:47.789> room<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.390> me<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> come<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.259> unless

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
not much room for me to come here unless

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
not much room for me to come here unless
I<00:01:49.590> stand<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.069> so<00:01:50.729> once<00:01:50.940> again<00:01:51.060> what's<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.330> next

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I stand up so once again what's the next

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.010 
I stand up so once again what's the next
best<00:01:51.750> thing

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
best thing

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.919 
best thing
bring<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:53.030> now<00:01:54.030> you're<00:01:54.179> just<00:01:54.390> twisting

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
bring it in now you're just twisting

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:10.050 
bring it in now you're just twisting
rotation<00:01:55.500> motion<00:02:06.920> why<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.130> make<00:02:08.310> continuous

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
rotation motion why not make continuous

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.120 
rotation motion why not make continuous
movement<00:02:10.660> instead<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.260> stopping<00:02:11.470> reversing

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
movement instead of stopping reversing

00:02:12.130 --> 00:03:12.960 
movement instead of stopping reversing
why<00:02:12.610> not<00:02:12.819> make<00:02:13.030> continuous

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:04:05.350 

so<00:03:33.850> we<00:04:02.230> do<00:04:03.230> doesn't<00:04:04.010> coincide<00:04:04.250> with<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.150> body

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
so we do doesn't coincide with the body

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:15.530 
so we do doesn't coincide with the body
position<00:04:08.140> same<00:04:09.140> thing

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.860 

once<00:04:16.079> again<00:04:16.519> I'm<00:04:17.519> already<00:04:17.880> cramped<00:04:18.750> up

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
once again I'm already cramped up

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.440 
once again I'm already cramped up
cramped<00:04:19.650> up<00:04:24.440> versus
