00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
I've said it before but I use a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.410 
I've said it before but I use a
straightener<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.640> my<00:01:59.729> hair<00:01:59.909> every<00:02:00.090> morning

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
straightener on my hair every morning

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.030
