00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.939 
like I guess I'll elaborate a little bit
more<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.619> actually

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
more about what this is this is actually

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.720 
more about what this is this is actually
a<00:00:19.980> star<00:00:20.250> craft<00:00:20.550> mod<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.260> they're<00:00:22.260> trying<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
a star craft mod and they're trying to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.259 
a star craft mod and they're trying to
to<00:00:23.730> build<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.390> full-blown<00:00:25.609> mod<00:00:26.609> for<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> game

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
to build a full-blown mod for the game

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.120 
to build a full-blown mod for the game
so<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.769> be<00:00:28.890> free-to-play

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
so it's it's going to be free-to-play

so it's it's going to be free-to-play
you<00:00:29.490> don't<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> pay<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.710> but<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you don't have to pay for it but the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.040 
you don't have to pay for it but the
entire<00:00:32.279> game<00:00:32.640> would<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.880> modded<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:34.020> just

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
entire game would be modded so not just

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
entire game would be modded so not just
circlings<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.010> you'll<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.309> all<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.579> units

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
different stretch goals and stuff but it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.209 
different stretch goals and stuff but it
would<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.460> than<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.670> Marines<00:00:45.710> Zerg<00:00:46.710> or

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
