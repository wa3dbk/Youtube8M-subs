00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.060 

I<00:00:14.320> think<00:00:15.390> if<00:00:16.390> I<00:00:16.599> have<00:00:16.810> a<00:00:16.840> heritage<00:00:17.529> at<00:00:17.830> all

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
I think if I have a heritage at all

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.880 
I think if I have a heritage at all
because<00:00:18.759> I'm<00:00:19.060> still<00:00:19.390> relatively<00:00:19.869> young<00:00:20.080> in<00:00:20.470> in

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
because I'm still relatively young in in

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.370 
because I'm still relatively young in in
the<00:00:21.130> world<00:00:21.340> of<00:00:21.599> heritage<00:00:22.599> brands<00:00:22.900> and

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
the world of heritage brands and

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.210 
the world of heritage brands and
obviously<00:00:24.099> I'm<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.400> first<00:00:24.640> one<00:00:24.910> so<00:00:25.390> I<00:00:25.919> think<00:00:26.919> I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
obviously I'm the first one so I think I

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.679 
obviously I'm the first one so I think I
think<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.550> thing<00:00:27.579> is<00:00:27.849> with<00:00:28.000> Paul<00:00:28.150> Smith<00:00:28.449> is

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
think the thing is with Paul Smith is

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.689 
think the thing is with Paul Smith is
that<00:00:28.900> I've<00:00:28.989> always<00:00:29.169> tried<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.619> have<00:00:29.949> very

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
that I've always tried to have very

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.780 
that I've always tried to have very
wearable<00:00:31.240> clothes<00:00:31.599> but<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.250> in<00:00:33.430> lovely

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
wearable clothes but and in lovely

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.420 
wearable clothes but and in lovely
quality<00:00:34.120> but<00:00:34.780> always<00:00:35.350> with<00:00:35.680> a<00:00:35.710> sense<00:00:36.010> of<00:00:36.160> humor

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
quality but always with a sense of humor

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.520 
quality but always with a sense of humor
a<00:00:36.879> little<00:00:37.210> secret<00:00:37.690> hiding<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.320> there

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
a little secret hiding in there

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.030 
a little secret hiding in there
somewhere<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.519> bright<00:00:40.089> colored<00:00:40.600> jacket<00:00:41.079> a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
somewhere so a bright colored jacket a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.100 
somewhere so a bright colored jacket a
bright<00:00:42.910> colored<00:00:43.239> lining<00:00:43.540> in<00:00:43.659> a<00:00:43.750> serious

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
bright colored lining in a serious

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.040 
bright colored lining in a serious
jacket<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.309> it's<00:00:46.120> always<00:00:46.360> described<00:00:46.899> as

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
jacket so it's always described as

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.420 
jacket so it's always described as
classic<00:00:47.379> with<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.530> twist<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:48.010> I<00:00:48.070> suppose

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
classic with a twist and I suppose

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.540 
classic with a twist and I suppose
there's<00:00:48.730> no<00:00:48.789> better<00:00:49.090> way<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.360> drive<00:00:49.930> it<00:00:50.110> really

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.170 

I<00:00:54.700> think<00:00:55.510> for<00:00:55.690> me<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.980> my<00:00:57.219> design<00:00:58.149> is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
I think for me because my design is

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.819 
I think for me because my design is
relatively<00:00:59.460> classic<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.989> fact<00:01:02.469> that<00:01:02.590> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
relatively classic the fact that the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.829 
relatively classic the fact that the
customer<00:01:03.250> can<00:01:03.280> find<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.699> little<00:01:03.820> secret<00:01:04.449> in<00:01:04.659> an

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
customer can find a little secret in an

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.399 
customer can find a little secret in an
unusual<00:01:05.170> button<00:01:05.710> or<00:01:05.920> buttonhole<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:07.510> special

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
unusual button or buttonhole a special

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.030 
unusual button or buttonhole a special
lining<00:01:08.920> that<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.150> humor<00:01:10.840> aspect<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:11.860> or

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
lining that the humor aspect of it or

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.340 
lining that the humor aspect of it or
the<00:01:12.220> little<00:01:12.400> surprise<00:01:13.300> aspect<00:01:13.900> of<00:01:14.050> it<00:01:14.200> is

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
the little surprise aspect of it is

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.999 
the little surprise aspect of it is
what's<00:01:15.540> helped<00:01:16.540> me<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:17.200> know<00:01:17.229> continue<00:01:17.590> to

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
what's helped me you know continue to

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.649 
what's helped me you know continue to
grow<00:01:18.220> over<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.610> years<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.090> albeit<00:01:19.630> very

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
grow over the years and albeit very

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.710 
grow over the years and albeit very
steadily

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.070 

I<00:01:23.840> think

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
I think

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.580 
I think
it<00:01:25.200> keeps<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:27.060> relevant<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> industry

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it keeps a very relevant in the industry

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
it keeps a very relevant in the industry
and<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:29.100> youthful<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:30.060> I've<00:01:30.570> got<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> very

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and and youthful because I've got a very

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.950 
and and youthful because I've got a very
curious<00:01:31.850> mind<00:01:32.850> i'm<00:01:33.120> very<00:01:33.360> interested<00:01:33.600> in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
curious mind i'm very interested in

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.340 
curious mind i'm very interested in
things<00:01:34.290> i'm<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:35.720> latch<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.320> i

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
things i'm very latch on in the way i

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.280 
things i'm very latch on in the way i
think<00:01:37.470> about<00:01:37.800> things<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.870> what<00:01:39.870> I've<00:01:40.020> managed

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
think about things and what I've managed

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
think about things and what I've managed
to<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> respect<00:01:41.190> my<00:01:41.550> more<00:01:41.940> mature

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
to do is respect my more mature

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.000 
to do is respect my more mature
customers<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.170> take<00:01:43.350> care<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.590> them<00:01:43.800> nicely

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
customers and take care of them nicely

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.710 
customers and take care of them nicely
but<00:01:44.520> also<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> balance<00:01:45.900> right<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.410> the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
but also get the balance right of the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.340 
but also get the balance right of the
young<00:01:48.720> clothes<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.950> jeans<00:01:49.980> lines<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
young clothes like jeans lines and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.540 
young clothes like jeans lines and
trainers<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:52.830> I've<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.190> sort<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
trainers and so I've got this sort of

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.730 
trainers and so I've got this sort of
balance<00:01:53.910> between<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:55.080> mature<00:01:55.260> more

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
balance between the more mature more

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
balance between the more mature more
classical<00:01:56.610> clothes<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.420> youthful<00:01:57.780> ones

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
classical clothes and the youthful ones

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.469 
classical clothes and the youthful ones
and<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.620> think<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.220> seems<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.550> work<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.970> think

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and I think that seems to work I think

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.420 
and I think that seems to work I think
because<00:02:00.630> I'm<00:02:00.990> very<00:02:01.200> curious<00:02:01.500> person<00:02:01.800> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
because I'm very curious person and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.660 
because I'm very curious person and
because<00:02:03.060> I'm<00:02:03.330> always<00:02:03.510> very<00:02:04.410> I've<00:02:05.220> been<00:02:05.250> close

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
because I'm always very I've been close

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
because I'm always very I've been close
to<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.970> music<00:02:06.240> industry<00:02:06.870> since<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.320> about

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
to the music industry since I was about

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.609 
to the music industry since I was about
18<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.420> know<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> lot<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> bands<00:02:10.050> myself

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
18 and know a lot of the bands myself

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.960 
18 and know a lot of the bands myself
and<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> know<00:02:13.500> because<00:02:13.709> I'm<00:02:13.950> lateral<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.490> tend

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and so I know because I'm lateral I tend

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.550 
and so I know because I'm lateral I tend
to<00:02:15.060> not<00:02:15.270> go<00:02:15.480> down<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.840> obvious<00:02:16.110> route<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.530> I

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
to not go down the obvious route I I

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.710 
to not go down the obvious route I I
think<00:02:17.520> going<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.060> obvious<00:02:18.360> route<00:02:18.540> or

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
think going down the obvious route or

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.570 
think going down the obvious route or
looking<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.080> magazines<00:02:19.400> looking<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
looking at magazines looking what the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.420 
looking at magazines looking what the
people<00:02:20.910> are<00:02:21.090> doing<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:22.980> really

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
people are doing it is just really

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.970 
people are doing it is just really
disappointing<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.740> can<00:02:25.860> get

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
disappointing and I think you can get

and channels like the luxury channel and

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.740 
and channels like the luxury channel and
like<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.950> whole<00:02:39.980> e-commerce<00:02:40.489> side<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.569> life

like the whole e-commerce side of life

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.110 
like the whole e-commerce side of life
and<00:02:42.109> of<00:02:42.349> course<00:02:42.590> blogs<00:02:42.950> Twitter's<00:02:43.400> etc<00:02:43.939> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
and of course blogs Twitter's etc I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.780 
and of course blogs Twitter's etc I
think<00:02:44.359> they<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.840> all<00:02:45.310> okay<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.579> moderation

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
think they are all okay in moderation

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.300 
think they are all okay in moderation
and<00:02:47.569> I<00:02:47.750> think<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.109> danger<00:02:48.319> is<00:02:48.620> if<00:02:48.799> people<00:02:48.829> get

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
and I think the danger is if people get

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.610 
and I think the danger is if people get
hooked<00:02:49.519> on<00:02:49.819> them<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.180> they<00:02:51.170> will<00:02:51.379> stop

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
hooked on them and they will stop

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.530 
hooked on them and they will stop
looking<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.250> seeing<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.909> the<00:02:53.060> creativity

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
looking and seeing and the creativity

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.979 
looking and seeing and the creativity
will<00:02:54.500> will<00:02:54.890> change<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.640> everything<00:02:56.629> will

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
will will change and everything will

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.569 
will will change and everything will
become<00:02:57.170> too<00:02:57.560> similar<00:02:57.829> if<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.099> don't<00:02:58.280> watch<00:02:58.430> it

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
become too similar if we don't watch it

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.220 
become too similar if we don't watch it
