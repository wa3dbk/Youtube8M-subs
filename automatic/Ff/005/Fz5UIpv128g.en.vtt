00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260 
feature film that was actually just two
episodes<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> show<00:01:53.549> cut<00:01:53.790> together<00:01:53.939> with

one<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:54.570> scenes<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.259> thrown<00:01:55.530> into<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.909> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
one or two scenes and thrown into it and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.980 
one or two scenes and thrown into it and
I<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.119> people<00:01:57.450> were<00:01:57.540> probably<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.869> little

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I think people were probably a little

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.310 
I think people were probably a little
bit<00:01:58.170> burned<00:01:58.439> by<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.960> kind<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
bit burned by that so they kind of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
bit burned by that so they kind of
stayed<00:02:01.740> away<00:02:01.770> from<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.250> Batman<00:02:02.579> movie<00:02:02.969> but
