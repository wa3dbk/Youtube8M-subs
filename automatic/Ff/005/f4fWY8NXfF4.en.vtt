games I'd love to see that games like
counter-strike<00:02:24.480> source<00:02:25.480> would<00:02:26.200> be<00:02:26.349> awesome

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
counter-strike source would be awesome

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.179

glad because they defeat is one of my

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.130 
glad because they defeat is one of my
favorite<00:02:32.829> games<00:02:32.939> especially<00:02:33.939> from<00:02:34.510> valve<00:02:34.750> so

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
favorite games especially from valve so

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.160 
favorite games especially from valve so
to<00:02:35.200> get<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.939> chance<00:02:36.939> and<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.359> reason<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.870> go<00:02:37.989> back

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
to get a chance and a reason to go back

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.050 
to get a chance and a reason to go back
and<00:02:38.200> replay<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.680> some<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.099> that<00:02:39.220> it's<00:02:39.909> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and replay it some of that it's a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.399 
and replay it some of that it's a
awesome<00:02:40.299> thing<00:02:41.790> but<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.939> i<00:02:43.060> said<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.450> runs

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
awesome thing but like i said it's runs

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.229 
awesome thing but like i said it's runs
great<00:02:44.680> there's<00:02:45.010> no<00:02:45.190> slow<00:02:45.489> down<00:02:45.670> at<00:02:45.819> all<00:02:45.909> what

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
great there's no slow down at all what

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.119 
great there's no slow down at all what
actually<00:02:46.599> runs<00:02:46.780> faster<00:02:47.170> than<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.319> did<00:02:47.530> on<00:02:47.560> my<00:02:47.650> pc

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
actually runs faster than I did on my pc

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.710 
actually runs faster than I did on my pc
which<00:02:48.370> makes<00:02:48.579> sense<00:02:48.730> because<00:02:48.879> the<00:02:49.269> imac<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.690> a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
which makes sense because the imac is a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.089 
which makes sense because the imac is a
lot<00:02:50.010> faster<00:02:51.010> machine<00:02:51.760> than<00:02:51.940> my<00:02:52.090> old<00:02:52.269> pc<00:02:52.450> was

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
lot faster machine than my old pc was

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.930 
lot faster machine than my old pc was
the<00:02:54.099> only<00:02:54.220> thing<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.489> was<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.609> little<00:02:54.790> tricky

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
the only thing that was a little tricky

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.390 
the only thing that was a little tricky
was<00:02:55.180> getting<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.739> display<00:02:56.739> correctly<00:02:57.129> on

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
was getting it to display correctly on

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.490 
was getting it to display correctly on
the<00:02:57.489> widescreen<00:02:57.879> display<00:02:58.299> that's<00:02:58.930> not<00:02:59.230> like

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the widescreen display that's not like

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.500 
the widescreen display that's not like
an<00:02:59.620> imac<00:02:59.889> problem<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:00.700> has<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.269> do<00:03:01.389> with

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
an imac problem that just has to do with

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.809 
an imac problem that just has to do with
using<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.840> widescreen<00:03:02.170> monitor<00:03:02.739> but<00:03:03.430> once<00:03:03.700> I

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
using a widescreen monitor but once I

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.429 
using a widescreen monitor but once I
figured<00:03:04.090> out<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.389> can<00:03:04.629> just<00:03:05.170> switch<00:03:05.409> the

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
figured out that you can just switch the

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.330 
figured out that you can just switch the
display<00:03:05.739> mode<00:03:06.129> to<00:03:06.280> 16<00:03:06.639> by<00:03:06.819> 9<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.299> then<00:03:08.310> apply<00:03:09.310> a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
display mode to 16 by 9 and then apply a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.399 
display mode to 16 by 9 and then apply a
resolution<00:03:09.819> via<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.689> it<00:03:10.989> wasn't<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.319> big

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
resolution via that it wasn't a big

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.490 
resolution via that it wasn't a big
problem<00:03:12.389> so<00:03:13.389> I've<00:03:13.480> been<00:03:13.599> playing<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:14.290> also

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500

played<00:03:59.620> about<00:04:00.129> half<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.729> and<00:04:00.940> then<00:04:01.030> for

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
played about half of it and then for

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.909 
played about half of it and then for
whatever<00:04:01.449> reason<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:02.019> just<00:04:02.049> put<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.530> down<00:04:02.560> and

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
never got to play it again and then I

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.869 
never got to play it again and then I
ended<00:04:04.959> up<00:04:05.079> downgrading<00:04:05.889> from<00:04:05.919> vista<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:06.849> XP

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
ended up downgrading from vista to XP

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.629 
ended up downgrading from vista to XP
just<00:04:07.449> cuz<00:04:07.569> my<00:04:07.720> machine<00:04:08.049> was<00:04:08.199> so<00:04:08.349> slow<00:04:08.639> that's

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
just cuz my machine was so slow that's

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.849 
just cuz my machine was so slow that's
no<00:04:10.060> fault<00:04:10.299> of<00:04:10.510> vistas<00:04:11.109> it's<00:04:11.290> just<00:04:11.500> I<00:04:11.650> had<00:04:11.799> a

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
no fault of vistas it's just I had a

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.300 
no fault of vistas it's just I had a
slow<00:04:12.040> machine<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:13.139> sew<00:04:14.139> and<00:04:14.530> games<00:04:15.220> for

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
slow machine and sew and games for

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.789 
slow machine and sew and games for
windows<00:04:15.519> live<00:04:15.819> only<00:04:16.030> works<00:04:16.299> under<00:04:16.659> vista<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.769> I

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
windows live only works under vista so I

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.920 
windows live only works under vista so I
couldn't<00:04:18.130> really<00:04:18.280> finish<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.909> until<00:04:19.120> recently

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
couldn't really finish it until recently

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.500 
couldn't really finish it until recently
when<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.109> put<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.190> be<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> boot<00:04:22.000> camp<00:04:22.210> on<00:04:22.389> my

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
when I put this to be a boot camp on my

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.000 
when I put this to be a boot camp on my
imac<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.409> I've<00:04:23.500> been<00:04:23.590> going<00:04:23.830> back<00:04:23.950> and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
imac so I've been going back and

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.379 
imac so I've been going back and
replaying<00:04:24.460> through<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:24.940> I'm<00:04:25.000> almost<00:04:25.240> to

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
replaying through that and I'm almost to

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.100 
replaying through that and I'm almost to
the<00:04:25.479> end<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.750> think

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
the end I think

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.589 
the end I think
like<00:04:26.199> two<00:04:26.319> levels<00:04:26.680> left<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:27.669> it's<00:04:28.449> been

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
like two levels left but it's been

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.540 
like two levels left but it's been
running<00:04:28.780> pretty<00:04:28.960> good<00:04:29.199> i'm<00:04:29.560> happy<00:04:30.250> with<00:04:30.370> it

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
running pretty good i'm happy with it

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.830 
running pretty good i'm happy with it
obviously<00:04:30.939> like<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.210> said<00:04:31.389> that's<00:04:31.479> an<00:04:31.629> older

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
obviously like I said that's an older

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.800 
obviously like I said that's an older
game<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.349> it<00:04:32.500> should<00:04:32.710> run<00:04:32.860> well<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:34.120> haven't

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
game so it should run well I haven't

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.179 
game so it should run well I haven't
tried<00:04:34.900> out<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.139> multiplayer<00:04:35.650> really<00:04:36.009> much

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
that kind of looks down on their games

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.230 
that kind of looks down on their games
for<00:04:58.629> windows<00:04:59.370> stuff<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.550> seems<00:05:00.759> like<00:05:00.909> most<00:05:01.090> of

achievements like I said they're

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.850 
achievements like I said they're
integrating<00:06:58.180> with<00:06:58.330> day<00:06:58.720> of<00:06:58.780> defeat<00:06:59.110> so

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
integrating with day of defeat so

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.500 
integrating with day of defeat so
they're<00:07:00.580> really<00:07:00.700> stepping<00:07:01.030> it<00:07:01.150> up<00:07:01.300> and

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
they're really stepping it up and

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.960 
they're really stepping it up and
because<00:07:02.050> of<00:07:02.080> that<00:07:02.170> I<00:07:02.290> think<00:07:02.610> Microsoft<00:07:03.610> has<00:07:03.820> to

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
because of that I think Microsoft has to

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.520 
because of that I think Microsoft has to
do<00:07:04.090> the<00:07:04.210> same<00:07:04.390> on<00:07:04.420> their<00:07:04.780> end<00:07:04.960> with<00:07:05.140> games<00:07:05.350> for

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
do the same on their end with games for

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.180 
do the same on their end with games for
windows<00:07:05.620> live<00:07:05.920> but<00:07:06.850> because<00:07:07.450> you<00:07:07.960> know

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
windows live but because you know

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.010
