00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.270
 then we come to the nest hut 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.189
 eagle so the highest in europe 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.330
 should be able to see this look 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.360
 beautiful hole 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.940
 this cabin 1.22 m with the bridge 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.560
 Himalayan or sanding to be able to 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.680
 to access 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.420
 so totally secure almost new 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.689
 because on the 22nd of July we wiped a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.240
 kano tornado that made fall between 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.810
 other this beautiful being on which was 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.020
 attached the old climb good so here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.930
 the rise fell and there the winds have 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.280
 exceeded 130 km / hour and the arts 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.649
 see where they have fallen 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.809
 finally minutes so the eagle's nest has been 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.180
 saved so the tree is very solid 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.300
 it is a plane tree of 250 years a plane tree 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.640
 from east and you can now 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.739
 ride with a new a new bridge 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 Himalayans made by the hut in 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.940
 the air that allows to access very 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 easily if you do not feel dizzy 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 sure at the eagle nest hut so you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.479
 go up with me we go up 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.840
 together this is the environment you have 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.600
 big channel right next to the orchards a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 little bit further and we are on a 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 island so totally surrounded by water with 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 all animals right on the left 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.299
 the ducks the geese and so that's the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.810
 climb is very simple when we do not have 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.369
 dizziness 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.119
 we arrive you have a small 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.619
 gate with a padlock is a code 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.450
 you ride quietly without harness 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.430
 without harness meaning because without anything at all 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.829
 we go from small boards to small 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.930
 boards everything is secure with a net 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.490
 so no problem 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.100
 you go up you have to lower your head with 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.220
 small support cables go up 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.689
 quietly from step to step of tree 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.630
 in tree is a kind of path 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.210
 adventure to access the hut the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.259
 highest of europe which is the hut 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 Eagle's nest we continue see we see 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.520
 well the beech tree that fell on the 22 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.780
 July 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.329
 for now it's sure it warms up a 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.509
 it does not allow you to be cold 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.799
 winter when it's at least two 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.730
 in November on everything so we 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.980
 ride quietly 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.110
 there you see I go up with a hand ago 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.489
 no problem after that is sure if you 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.430
 have the vertigo you will understand that he 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.129
 avoid this hut rather choose 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.940
 the barrel hut that you can go 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.620
 see also video 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.260
 so we get the beings to be supportive 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.670
 who weathered the storm 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.010
 we then go on the old course 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.989
 who had not moved 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.810
 so who is with small of 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:45.980
 little aso to not slip that is 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:55.069
 very well secured we ride more and 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:56.599
 the more we arrive at 18 m 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.750
 arrives under the cabin so we go 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.769
 land directly under the terrace of the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.560
 eagle's nest you even have a pigeon 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.440
 coffee are put under the cabin so that does not 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.370
 denatures not campaign there 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.949
 raises the hatch hop and the magnificent 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.879
 we arrive on the terrace 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:21.500
 the adq adan we have you a terrace 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.419
 splendid because you are above 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.769
 trees 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:28.449
 so we see a little bit higher up 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:32.180
 bar the wind turbines that are off 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:35.319
 then the whole canopy the top of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.319
 trees of the castle park 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.739
 there we are above the farm 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.160

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.560
 have the water underneath you have all the 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.180
 surrounding countryside that we see 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.250
 much better winter because winter 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.379
 there are fewer leaves but that is 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.389
 very pretty and and people here you are at 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.180

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.639
 dry toilets with the sawdust 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.129
