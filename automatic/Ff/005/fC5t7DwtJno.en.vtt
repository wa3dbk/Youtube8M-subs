model number is LNC six seven six zero b
seven<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:49.160> basically<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> was

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
seven one and basically what this was

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.389 
seven one and basically what this was
doing<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.140> spinning<00:00:56.129> or

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
doing is it was not spinning or

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.720 
doing is it was not spinning or
agitating<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.460> whenever<00:00:59.460> this

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
agitating and so whenever this

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.479 
agitating and so whenever this

particular maytag product is not
spinning<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.090> agitating<00:01:03.870> then<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.500> need<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
spinning or agitating then we need to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
spinning or agitating then we need to
get<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> bottom<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> figure<00:01:06.090> out

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
get to the bottom of this and figure out

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.440 
get to the bottom of this and figure out
what's<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:07.049> it

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
what's going on with it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.000 
what's going on with it
usually<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:10.229> happens<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.860> these

usually what happens with these

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
usually what happens with these
particular<00:01:11.610> products<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> set

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
particular products and I'm going to set

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.800 
particular products and I'm going to set
this<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.650> its<00:01:13.799> side<00:01:14.450> usually<00:01:15.450> what

this thing down on its side usually what

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.640 
this thing down on its side usually what
happens<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.650> underneath<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
happens this is the underneath of it

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
happens this is the underneath of it
usually<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:19.830> happens<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> pump

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
usually what happens is is that the pump

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.460 
usually what happens is is that the pump
which<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.100> sitting<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> pump<00:01:25.229> right

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
which I have sitting here the pump right

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.230 
which I have sitting here the pump right
here<00:01:25.530> has<00:01:25.920> something<00:01:26.189> stuck<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
here has something stuck in it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.310 
here has something stuck in it
and<00:01:27.829> is<00:01:28.829> preventing<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.430> spinning

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
and is preventing it from spinning

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.929 
and is preventing it from spinning
another<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.680> happens<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.579> lot<00:01:32.820> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
another thing that happens is a lot of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
another thing that happens is a lot of
people<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.659> particular<00:01:33.869> model<00:01:34.530> in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
people have this particular model in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.580 
people have this particular model in
their<00:01:35.040> garage<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> wintertime

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
their garage and in the wintertime

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
their garage and in the wintertime
whenever<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.400> freezing<00:01:38.820> cold<00:01:38.850> outside<00:01:39.299> in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
whenever it's freezing cold outside in

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.020 
whenever it's freezing cold outside in
areas<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> United<00:01:41.189> States<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.670> around<00:01:41.790> the

areas of the United States or around the
world<00:01:42.240> where<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> freezes<00:01:43.189> what<00:01:44.189> happens<00:01:44.610> is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
world where it freezes what happens is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.670 
world where it freezes what happens is
is<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> water<00:01:45.360> actually<00:01:45.689> freezes<00:01:46.439> solid

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
is the water actually freezes solid

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
is the water actually freezes solid
block<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.369> ice<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.240> pump<00:01:48.570> prevent

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
block of ice in this pump prevent

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
block of ice in this pump prevent
preventing<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.890> spin<00:01:50.130> around<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.240> what

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
preventing it to spin around so what

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.270 
preventing it to spin around so what
happens<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.200> motor<00:01:52.439> ends<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.890> spinning

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
happens is your motor ends up spinning

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.330 
happens is your motor ends up spinning
but<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.299> doesn't<00:01:54.630> spin<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.740> doesn't<00:01:56.070> allow<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
but it doesn't spin it doesn't allow the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.600 
but it doesn't spin it doesn't allow the
belt<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.909> turn<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.689> pump<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.920> because

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
belt to turn the pump or this because

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.600 
belt to turn the pump or this because
the<00:01:59.820> pump<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.360> working<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.829> what<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.399> want

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the pump is not working so what we want

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.010 
the pump is not working so what we want
to<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.149> want<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.420> check<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:06.020> see

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to do is we want to check this and see

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310 
to do is we want to check this and see
if<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.350> spinning

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.930 

so<00:02:12.320> we<00:02:12.470> spin<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.800> around<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.340> we<00:02:13.400> can<00:02:13.550> see<00:02:13.760> that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
so we spin it around and we can see that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.860 
so we spin it around and we can see that
it's<00:02:14.090> spinning<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.700> whole<00:02:16.910> drum<00:02:17.240> when

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
it's spinning the the whole drum when

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.260 
it's spinning the the whole drum when
you<00:02:17.990> turn<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.320> counterclockwise<00:02:19.270> whenever

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
you turn it counterclockwise whenever

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.060 
you turn it counterclockwise whenever
you<00:02:20.390> turn<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.690> clockwise<00:02:20.840> you'd<00:02:21.830> probably

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
you turn it clockwise you'd probably

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.620 
you turn it clockwise you'd probably
have<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.700> someone<00:02:23.000> else<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.270> help<00:02:23.480> you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
have to get someone else to help you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.400 
have to get someone else to help you
look<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.950> got<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.220> check<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.640> see<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
look but you got to check and see if the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.840 
look but you got to check and see if the
agitator<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.220> spinning

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
agitator is spinning

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.490 
agitator is spinning
if<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.270> agitator<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.930> spinning<00:02:30.290> when<00:02:30.410> you

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
if the agitator is spinning when you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.920 
if the agitator is spinning when you
turn<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.830> clockwise<00:02:31.300> it'll<00:02:32.300> turn<00:02:32.420> back<00:02:32.720> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
turn it clockwise it'll turn back and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.230 
turn it clockwise it'll turn back and
forth<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:34.280> drum<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.060> whole

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
forth and the drum and the whole

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.090 
forth and the drum and the whole
agitator<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.050> everything<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.620> spinning<00:02:36.980> when

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
agitator and everything is spinning when

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.330 
agitator and everything is spinning when
you<00:02:37.190> turn<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.550> o'clock<00:02:38.120> or<00:02:38.420> counterclockwise

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you turn it o'clock or counterclockwise

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.890 
you turn it o'clock or counterclockwise
then<00:02:40.340> your<00:02:40.520> transmissions<00:02:41.240> good<00:02:41.590> okay

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.500 

I've<00:02:45.710> already<00:02:46.010> diagnosed<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.970> one<00:02:47.180> as<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
I've already diagnosed this one as the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.000 
I've already diagnosed this one as the
pump<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.960> here's<00:02:48.830> the<00:02:49.010> pump<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.000> basically

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
pump and here's the pump so basically

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:03.960 
pump and here's the pump so basically
what<00:02:52.010> we<00:02:52.160> do<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.460> we<00:02:52.610> get<00:02:52.730> a<00:03:01.690> we<00:03:02.690> get<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.870> 3/8<00:03:03.380> inch

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
what we do is we get a we get a 3/8 inch

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.080 
what we do is we get a we get a 3/8 inch
screw<00:03:04.970> or<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.450> 3/8<00:03:05.990> inch<00:03:06.320> socket<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.010> we<00:03:07.880> take

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
screw or a 3/8 inch socket and we take

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.290 
screw or a 3/8 inch socket and we take
these<00:03:08.300> three<00:03:08.600> screws<00:03:08.870> out<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:10.300> usually

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
these three screws out and usually

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.690 
these three screws out and usually
they're<00:03:11.480> they're<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.560> from<00:03:13.010> here<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.580> have

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
they're they're in from here so you have

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.180 
they're they're in from here so you have
to<00:03:13.820> take<00:03:14.150> one<00:03:15.020> two<00:03:15.290> three<00:03:15.680> four<00:03:15.980> five

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
to take one two three four five

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.190 
to take one two three four five
sixteenths<00:03:16.820> off<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.270> then<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.660> comes<00:03:17.959> off

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
sixteenths off and then this comes off

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.530 
sixteenths off and then this comes off
and<00:03:18.530> then<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.520> got<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.730> pull<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:20.090> hose<00:03:20.300> off

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
and then you got to pull this hose off

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.410 
and then you got to pull this hose off
and<00:03:20.780> then<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.530> drain<00:03:21.770> hose<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.940> drain<00:03:23.180> hoses

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
and then the drain hose the drain hoses

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.449 
and then the drain hose the drain hoses
up<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:23.900> here<00:03:24.230> but<00:03:24.590> it'll<00:03:24.800> also<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:25.190> connected

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
up in here but it'll also be connected

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.130 
up in here but it'll also be connected
to<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.850> other<00:03:25.940> side<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.300> external<00:03:26.870> part<00:03:27.080> of

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
to the other side the external part of

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.410 
to the other side the external part of
the<00:03:27.230> pump<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.400> take<00:03:28.670> these<00:03:28.850> screws<00:03:29.209> out

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
the pump so you take these screws out

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.920 
the pump so you take these screws out
here<00:03:30.430> with<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.550> 3/8<00:03:32.020> socket<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:34.780> you'd<00:03:35.780> have

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
here with the 3/8 socket and you'd have

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.270 
here with the 3/8 socket and you'd have
to<00:03:35.990> remove<00:03:36.260> your<00:03:36.590> belt<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:38.470> then<00:03:39.470> this<00:03:40.040> whole

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
to remove your belt and then this whole

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.690 
to remove your belt and then this whole
pump<00:03:40.550> just<00:03:40.730> comes<00:03:41.000> right<00:03:41.060> out<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.390> there<00:03:41.600> and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
pump just comes right out of there and

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.970 
pump just comes right out of there and
whenever<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:44.030> pump<00:03:44.270> comes<00:03:44.510> out<00:03:44.690> of<00:03:44.810> there

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
whenever this pump comes out of there

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.310 
whenever this pump comes out of there
you<00:03:45.980> just<00:03:46.190> replace<00:03:46.550> it<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.930> only<00:03:48.140> bad<00:03:48.290> thing

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
you just replace it the only bad thing

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.220 
you just replace it the only bad thing
is<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.920> like<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.190> said<00:03:49.250> Maytag<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:50.240> no<00:03:50.840> longer

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
is is like I said Maytag is no longer

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.600 
is is like I said Maytag is no longer
producing<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:53.030> product<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.459> might

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
producing this product and so it might

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.130 
producing this product and so it might
be<00:03:55.760> kind<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:55.970> hard<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.270> find<00:03:56.450> one<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.780> these<00:03:56.930> as

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
be kind of hard to find one of these as

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.220 
be kind of hard to find one of these as
a<00:03:57.170> as<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:57.830> salvage<00:03:58.340> part<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:58.880> it's<00:03:59.870> probably

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
a as a salvage part and it's probably

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.590 
a as a salvage part and it's probably
pretty<00:04:00.650> expensive<00:04:01.160> if<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.550> try<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.820> get<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> om

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
pretty expensive if you try to get a om

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.170 
pretty expensive if you try to get a om
part<00:04:02.959> for<00:04:03.170> this<00:04:03.320> but<00:04:04.250> anyway<00:04:04.550> once<00:04:04.790> again<00:04:05.030> this

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
part for this but anyway once again this

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.890 
part for this but anyway once again this
is<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.360> maytag<00:04:05.840> product<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.560> Admiral<00:04:06.980> and

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
is a maytag product this is Admiral and

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.650 
is a maytag product this is Admiral and
I<00:04:08.900> hope<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.320> learned<00:04:09.500> something<00:04:09.800> from<00:04:09.980> this

I hope you learned something from this
that's<00:04:11.660> how<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:11.870> change<00:04:12.140> out<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.410> pump<00:04:12.709> and

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
that's how you change out a pump and

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.770 
that's how you change out a pump and
that's<00:04:13.100> how<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.940> know<00:04:13.970> diagnose<00:04:14.540> why

that's how you you know diagnose why

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.150 
that's how you you know diagnose why
it's<00:04:14.989> not<00:04:15.200> spinning<00:04:15.640> thanks<00:04:16.640> for<00:04:16.790> watching
