00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
little distress flip by using the

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.470 
little distress flip by using the
blowtorch<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:07.350> can<00:00:07.529> see<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.859> just<00:00:08.069> holding<00:00:08.340> it

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
blowtorch you can see is just holding it

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.370 
blowtorch you can see is just holding it
keeps<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.660> moving

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
keeps it moving

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.190 
keeps it moving
very<00:00:10.620> smooth<00:00:11.010> motions<00:00:11.780> he's<00:00:12.780> already<00:00:12.990> done

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
very smooth motions he's already done

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.480

most of the night stand you can see here
so<00:00:20.490> we're<00:00:20.609> gonna<00:00:20.699> start<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.270> side<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so we're gonna start on this side and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
so we're gonna start on this side and
start<00:00:22.650> at<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> top<00:00:23.090> like<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.300> fire<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> little

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
it was out pretty quickly do anything to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.420 
it was out pretty quickly do anything to
stay<00:00:30.060> Heat<00:00:31.009> nope<00:00:33.440> yes<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:35.160> pretty

good well it burns you can see it keeps
it<00:00:49.050> moving<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> nice<00:00:49.590> motion<00:00:50.210> it's<00:00:51.210> not

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it moving in a nice motion it's not

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
it moving in a nice motion it's not
perfect<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:55.440> don't<00:00:55.469> want<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.860> hold<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.190> where

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
perfect you don't want to hold it where

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just want the edge of the flame the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.060 
just want the edge of the flame the
technique<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:03.809> been<00:01:03.930> used<00:01:04.080> before<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.890> we

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
