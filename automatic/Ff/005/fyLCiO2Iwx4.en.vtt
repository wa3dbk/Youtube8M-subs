swallowing difficulties there's a chance
that<00:00:41.239> those<00:00:41.480> liquids<00:00:41.960> could<00:00:42.170> end<00:00:42.320> up<00:00:42.410> in<00:00:42.589> their

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
that those liquids could end up in their

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.240 
that those liquids could end up in their
lungs<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.850> thickened<00:00:44.269> liquids<00:00:44.719> help<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.710> make

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
lungs the thickened liquids help to make

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.430 
lungs the thickened liquids help to make
the<00:00:46.399> fluid<00:00:46.579> flow<00:00:46.969> more<00:00:47.180> slowly<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.899> allow<00:00:48.379> the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
the fluid flow more slowly and allow the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.470 
the fluid flow more slowly and allow the
patient<00:00:48.739> more<00:00:49.160> control<00:00:49.579> over<00:00:49.610> those<00:00:49.969> liquids

patient more control over those liquids
so<00:00:50.629> it's<00:00:50.750> really<00:00:50.960> important<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:51.770> the

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
so it's really important that the

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.470 
so it's really important that the

consistency in Australia we have three

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.170 
consistency in Australia we have three

different levels of fluid thickness we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.619 
different levels of fluid thickness we

thick these different thicknesses are

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.090 
thick these different thicknesses are
quite<00:01:08.539> important<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.380> they're<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.619> little<00:01:09.830> bit

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
quite important and they're a little bit

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.070 
quite important and they're a little bit
like<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.640> medication<00:01:11.570> where<00:01:11.720> you've<00:01:11.810> got<00:01:11.960> to<00:01:12.050> be

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
like a medication where you've got to be

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.469 
like a medication where you've got to be
sure<00:01:12.380> that<00:01:12.590> you've<00:01:12.710> got<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:13.039> right<00:01:13.220> dose<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
sure that you've got the right dose the

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.929 
sure that you've got the right dose the
patients<00:01:15.050> with<00:01:15.470> difficulty<00:01:16.009> swallowing<00:01:16.190> the

patients with difficulty swallowing the

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.450 
patients with difficulty swallowing the
correct<00:01:17.299> thickness<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:18.409> not<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:18.979> much<00:01:19.189> a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
correct thickness is not so much a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.480 
correct thickness is not so much a
matter<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.420> choice<00:01:20.780> as<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.170> necessity<00:01:21.830> it's

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
matter of choice as a necessity it's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.010 
matter of choice as a necessity it's
important<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.060> they<00:01:23.270> have<00:01:23.299> this<00:01:23.659> for<00:01:23.900> their

thicken water in a mildly thick
consistency<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.190> nectar<00:01:44.930> now<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.680> best

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
consistency for nectar now it's the best

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.430 
consistency for nectar now it's the best
results<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.400> actually<00:01:47.730> place<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.750> powder<00:01:49.050> in

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
results you actually place the powder in

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.980 
results you actually place the powder in
the<00:01:49.620> bottom<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.070> glass<00:01:50.250> first<00:01:50.900> so<00:01:51.900> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the bottom of the glass first so it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.690

actually<00:02:12.480> does<00:02:12.840> thicken<00:02:13.200> quite<00:02:13.410> rapidly<00:02:16.430> okay

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
actually does thicken quite rapidly okay

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.410 
actually does thicken quite rapidly okay
now<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.750> doesn't<00:02:19.020> click<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.440> overtime<00:02:19.950> and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
now it doesn't click on overtime and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.730 
now it doesn't click on overtime and
there<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.690> doesn't<00:02:21.960> change<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> taste<00:02:22.530> or<00:02:22.710> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
there it doesn't change the taste or the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.430 
there it doesn't change the taste or the
odor<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> product<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> same

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
odor of the product and it's the same

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.110 
odor of the product and it's the same
amount<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:26.280> powder

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
amount of powder

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.420 
amount of powder
whether<00:02:28.020> you're<00:02:28.170> thickening<00:02:28.500> water<00:02:28.770> juice

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
whether you're thickening water juice

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.950 
whether you're thickening water juice
fizzy<00:02:30.120> drinks<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.130> forth<00:02:32.600> it<00:02:33.600> doesn't

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
fizzy drinks and so forth it doesn't

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.950 
fizzy drinks and so forth it doesn't
lump<00:02:34.170> either<00:02:34.380> as<00:02:34.590> you'll<00:02:34.740> see<00:02:34.920> now<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.660> it

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
lump either as you'll see now and it

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.400 
lump either as you'll see now and it
does<00:02:37.110> become<00:02:37.230> transparent

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.960 

okay<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.430> see<00:02:42.580> that's<00:02:42.760> already

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
okay so you can see that's already

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.790 
okay so you can see that's already
working<00:02:43.150> now<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:44.050> getting<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.470> its<00:02:44.620> right

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
working now and getting to its right

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.410 
working now and getting to its right
consistency<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:48.430> use<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> foot<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.090> can<00:02:49.300> use

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
consistency I do use a foot you can use

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.880 
consistency I do use a foot you can use
a<00:02:49.450> fork<00:02:49.720> or<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> spoon<00:02:49.960> but<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.380> prefer<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.680> use<00:02:50.860> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
a fork or a spoon but I prefer to use a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.260 
a fork or a spoon but I prefer to use a
fork<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.370> find<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:51.820> gives<00:02:52.000> better<00:02:52.180> results

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
fork I find it just gives better results

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:12.390 
fork I find it just gives better results
but<00:02:53.020> it's<00:02:53.110> entirely<00:02:53.440> up<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.620> you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.789 

you

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.369 

so<00:03:19.799> now<00:03:19.950> we're<00:03:20.219> demonstrating<00:03:20.870> using<00:03:21.870> apple

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
so now we're demonstrating using apple

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.199 
so now we're demonstrating using apple
juice<00:03:22.620> making<00:03:23.219> up<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.519> moderately<00:03:24.180> thick

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
juice making up a moderately thick

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.890 
juice making up a moderately thick
consistency<00:03:25.109> or<00:03:25.260> honey<00:03:25.469> consistency<00:03:26.900> so

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
consistency or honey consistency so

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.869 
consistency or honey consistency so
again<00:03:28.469> grab<00:03:28.829> your<00:03:29.010> scope<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.400> make<00:03:29.549> sure<00:03:29.760> you

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
again grab your scope and make sure you

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.300 
again grab your scope and make sure you
place<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.930> powder<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.829> shaker

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
place that the powder in the shaker

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.330 
place that the powder in the shaker
first<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.060> for<00:03:33.900> moderately<00:03:34.620> thick<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:34.980> for

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
first and for moderately thick it's for

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.470 
first and for moderately thick it's for
small<00:03:35.969> scoops<00:03:37.790> again<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.000> make<00:03:39.150> sure<00:03:39.180> you

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
small scoops again just make sure you

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.379 
small scoops again just make sure you
level<00:03:39.659> them<00:03:39.870> all<00:03:40.049> as<00:03:40.230> well<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.209> get<00:03:42.359> a

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
level them all as well you just get a

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:50.690 
level them all as well you just get a
better<00:03:42.569> outcome<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:46.170> there's<00:03:46.379> four<00:03:49.549> four<00:03:50.549> at

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
better outcome so there's four four at

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.170 
better outcome so there's four four at
the<00:03:50.909> apple<00:03:51.450> juice<00:03:51.980> 200<00:03:52.980> mils<00:03:53.159> again<00:03:53.519> I<00:03:56.180> submit

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
the apple juice 200 mils again I submit

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.559 
the apple juice 200 mils again I submit
on

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:12.569 

and<00:04:02.349> if<00:04:02.470> give<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.769> good<00:04:02.890> shake<00:04:09.629> okay<00:04:11.579> pull

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
and if give it a good shake okay pull

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.160 
and if give it a good shake okay pull
that<00:04:12.730> into<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.060> glass<00:04:13.269> you'll<00:04:13.659> sit<00:04:13.870> there<00:04:14.049> are

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
that into the glass you'll sit there are

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.789 
that into the glass you'll sit there are
no<00:04:14.260> lumps<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:16.720> does<00:04:16.930> actually<00:04:17.139> take<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.500> couple

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
no lumps it does actually take a couple

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.020 
no lumps it does actually take a couple
of<00:04:17.949> minutes<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.310> come<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.669> its<00:04:18.820> right

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
of minutes to come to its right

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.400 
of minutes to come to its right
consistency

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.129 

so<00:04:26.410> I've<00:04:26.500> looked<00:04:26.620> at<00:04:26.830> mixing<00:04:27.160> up<00:04:27.310> 200<00:04:27.820> mil

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
so I've looked at mixing up 200 mil

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.480 
so I've looked at mixing up 200 mil
amounts<00:04:29.139> of<00:04:29.290> volumes<00:04:29.680> now<00:04:30.130> we're<00:04:30.280> going<00:04:30.400> to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
amounts of volumes now we're going to

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.220 
amounts of volumes now we're going to
look<00:04:30.610> at<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.760> larger<00:04:31.120> quantity<00:04:31.270> one<00:04:31.960> later

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
look at a larger quantity one later

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.260 
look at a larger quantity one later
we're<00:04:32.889> going<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.160> use<00:04:33.250> apple<00:04:33.610> juice<00:04:33.639> and<00:04:34.120> I'm

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
we're going to use apple juice and I'm

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.939 
we're going to use apple juice and I'm
going<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.540> mix<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.930> up<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.260> mod<00:04:35.530> with<00:04:35.740> bit

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
going to mix it up to a mod with bit

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.390 
going to mix it up to a mod with bit
consistency<00:04:36.729> or<00:04:36.940> nectar<00:04:37.270> consistency<00:04:38.400> for

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
consistency or nectar consistency for

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.670 
consistency or nectar consistency for
mildly<00:04:40.000> thick<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.510> one<00:04:40.630> later<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:41.080> use<00:04:41.229> too

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
mildly thick and one later you use too

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.760 
mildly thick and one later you use too
sorry<00:04:42.280> 10<00:04:42.639> scoops<00:04:43.419> but<00:04:44.229> I've<00:04:44.380> pre<00:04:44.590> measured

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
sorry 10 scoops but I've pre measured

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.340 
sorry 10 scoops but I've pre measured
them<00:04:45.040> already<00:04:45.250> for<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.930> same<00:04:46.930> principle

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
them already for you same principle

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.960 
them already for you same principle
applies<00:04:47.620> are<00:04:47.889> place<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.220> in<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.400> jug<00:04:48.580> first

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
applies are place it in the jug first

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.439 
applies are place it in the jug first
before<00:04:49.389> adding<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.840> fluid<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:52.030> we'll<00:04:52.300> grab

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
before adding the fluid so we'll grab

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.320 
before adding the fluid so we'll grab
the<00:04:52.600> stick<00:04:52.840> blender<00:04:53.169> this<00:04:53.290> time<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.330> I'll

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
the stick blender this time and I'll

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.490 
the stick blender this time and I'll
start<00:04:55.630> pouring<00:04:56.050> in<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.320> fluid<00:04:58.169> and<00:04:59.169> then

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
start pouring in the fluid and then

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.909 
start pouring in the fluid and then
start

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.399 

so<00:05:08.460> give<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.669> a<00:05:08.789> good<00:05:08.969> mix<00:05:09.270> with<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.169> stick

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
so give it a good mix with the stick

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:18.050 
so give it a good mix with the stick
blender

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.840 

now<00:05:19.740> juices<00:05:20.740> will<00:05:20.920> actually<00:05:21.250> take<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.520> little

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
now juices will actually take a little

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.520 
now juices will actually take a little
bit<00:05:22.030> longer<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:23.020> get<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.380> right

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
bit longer and to get to the right

bit longer and to get to the right
consistency<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.490> thicken<00:05:25.290> so<00:05:26.290> don't<00:05:26.470> panic

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
consistency and thicken so don't panic

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.500 
consistency and thicken so don't panic
if<00:05:26.889> it<00:05:27.040> doesn't<00:05:27.310> look<00:05:27.430> right<00:05:27.639> to<00:05:27.910> start<00:05:28.300> with

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
if it doesn't look right to start with

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.810 
if it doesn't look right to start with
just<00:05:29.500> make<00:05:29.710> sure<00:05:29.980> that<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.460> actually

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
just make sure that it is actually

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.990 
just make sure that it is actually
thoroughly<00:05:31.060> mixed<00:05:31.510> through<00:05:35.639> that<00:05:36.639> should<00:05:36.880> be

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
thoroughly mixed through that should be

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.770 
thoroughly mixed through that should be
right<00:05:37.180> now<00:05:41.400> take<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.430> out<00:05:42.840> right<00:05:43.840> here

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
right now take that out right here

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.309 
right now take that out right here
according<00:05:46.780> to<00:05:47.050> a<00:05:47.140> glass

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:59.459 

and<00:05:50.499> you'll<00:05:51.039> see<00:05:51.219> there<00:05:51.399> are<00:05:51.460> no<00:05:51.610> lumps<00:05:58.469> thanks

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:01.079 
and you'll see there are no lumps thanks
Lisa<00:05:59.649> for<00:05:59.919> showing<00:06:00.189> us<00:06:00.309> how<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.520> thicken<00:06:00.909> up

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.089 
Lisa for showing us how to thicken up

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:03.089 
Lisa for showing us how to thicken up
the<00:06:01.330> different<00:06:01.899> consistencies<00:06:02.649> so<00:06:02.889> now<00:06:03.039> we

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
the different consistencies so now we

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.399 
the different consistencies so now we
have<00:06:03.369> a<00:06:03.399> mildly<00:06:03.819> thick<00:06:04.149> a<00:06:04.389> moderately<00:06:05.259> thick

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
have a mildly thick a moderately thick

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.609 
have a mildly thick a moderately thick
and<00:06:05.860> an<00:06:06.399> extremely<00:06:07.029> thick<00:06:07.330> I'm<00:06:08.080> going<00:06:08.319> to<00:06:08.469> use

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:08.619 
and an extremely thick I'm going to use

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:10.439 
and an extremely thick I'm going to use
the<00:06:08.830> fork<00:06:09.099> to<00:06:09.339> show<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.580> what<00:06:10.300> those

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
the fork to show you what those

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.469 
the fork to show you what those
consistencies<00:06:11.319> look<00:06:11.559> like<00:06:11.909> so<00:06:12.909> the<00:06:13.059> mildly

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
consistencies look like so the mildly

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.749 
consistencies look like so the mildly
thick<00:06:13.839> flows<00:06:14.439> very<00:06:14.710> quickly<00:06:15.099> through<00:06:15.580> the

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
thick flows very quickly through the

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.820 
thick flows very quickly through the
fork<00:06:17.189> and<00:06:18.189> if<00:06:18.309> I<00:06:18.430> tip<00:06:18.669> it<00:06:18.899> you<00:06:19.899> can<00:06:20.110> see<00:06:20.409> that<00:06:20.439> it

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
fork and if I tip it you can see that it

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.299 
fork and if I tip it you can see that it
flows<00:06:21.219> slower<00:06:22.089> than<00:06:22.330> water<00:06:22.740> but<00:06:23.740> it<00:06:23.889> still<00:06:24.129> has

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:25.959 
quite a good flow on it it would be easy

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.760 

this<00:06:56.960> flows<00:06:57.319> very<00:06:57.919> slowly<00:06:58.900> and<00:06:59.900> using<00:07:00.289> a<00:07:00.379> spoon

this flows very slowly and using a spoon

this flows very slowly and using a spoon
would<00:07:01.250> be<00:07:01.400> the<00:07:01.550> easiest<00:07:01.940> way<00:07:02.180> to<00:07:02.210> drink<00:07:02.659> this

so<00:07:08.120> one<00:07:08.300> of<00:07:08.330> the<00:07:08.479> nice<00:07:08.659> things<00:07:08.690> about<00:07:09.110> thicken

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
so one of the nice things about thicken

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.290 
so one of the nice things about thicken
up<00:07:09.680> clear<00:07:09.979> is<00:07:10.250> that<00:07:10.400> you<00:07:10.460> can<00:07:10.699> thicken<00:07:10.909> up<00:07:11.150> your

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
up clear is that you can thicken up your

up clear is that you can thicken up your
favorite<00:07:11.720> drink<00:07:11.960> if<00:07:12.169> you<00:07:12.259> happen<00:07:12.530> to<00:07:12.560> be<00:07:12.740> out

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
favorite drink if you happen to be out

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.469 
favorite drink if you happen to be out
