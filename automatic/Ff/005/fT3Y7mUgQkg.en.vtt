00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

now<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> first<00:00:52.860> thing<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> keep<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.399> mind<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
now the first thing to keep in mind is

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
now the first thing to keep in mind is
that<00:00:53.910> Macs<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.660> Apple<00:00:55.110> products<00:00:55.559> are

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that Macs and Apple products are

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.090 
that Macs and Apple products are
marketed<00:00:56.719> marketed<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:57.870> premium<00:00:58.530> products

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
and as such they command a premium price

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.929 
and as such they command a premium price
now<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> terms<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
now think of it kind of in the terms of

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
now think of it kind of in the terms of
Chevy<00:01:06.930> Chrysler<00:01:07.470> Ford<00:01:07.710> versus<00:01:08.250> Audi<00:01:08.430> Mercedes

Chevy Chrysler Ford versus Audi Mercedes

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.539 
Chevy Chrysler Ford versus Audi Mercedes
BMW<00:01:09.600> etc<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.560> all<00:01:10.650> do<00:01:10.830> fundamentally<00:01:11.400> the

BMW etc they all do fundamentally the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
BMW etc they all do fundamentally the
same<00:01:11.760> thing<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.600> costs<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> whole<00:01:13.290> heck<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
same thing but one costs a whole heck of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.249 
same thing but one costs a whole heck of
a<00:01:13.799> lot<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.340> there's<00:01:15.000> always<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> cachet

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a lot more there's always a cachet
