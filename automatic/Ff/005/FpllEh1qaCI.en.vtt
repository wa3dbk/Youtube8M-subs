just<00:01:54.850> about<00:01:55.240> actually<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:55.960> that's<00:01:56.410> what

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
just about actually and that's what

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.380 
just about actually and that's what
makes<00:01:56.860> this<00:01:57.040> an<00:01:57.220> interesting<00:01:57.580> proposition

that<00:04:18.850> will<00:04:19.030> also<00:04:19.120> mean<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.750> hike<00:04:20.440> in<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.650> price

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
that will also mean a hike in the price

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.330 
that will also mean a hike in the price
of<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.160> car<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.390> wait<00:04:22.720> for<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.440> India<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.190> be

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340
