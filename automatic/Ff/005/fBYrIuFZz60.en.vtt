00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.590
 dance guys here and today I'm here with 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.930
 this new video where exactly from 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.600
 title you can read that will show you a 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.570
 bit my classes is true that an episode 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.270
 I had already done this kind of time 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.020
 ago but that video just lira a 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.030
 video where I show my classics 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.760
 or more for ice core has closed anyway 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.530
 to go always alone in such domain 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.540
 instead these are just the classes 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.340
 and those were the drawers you can ar where 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.680
 to play it seriously but really 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.500
 series at high levels precisely with 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.900
 these qualities give up the classic me 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.300
 that is, I keep when I play these here 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.159
 so this is robbie's widows 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.129
 I'll explain this guys well 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.280
 as is the fault is my favorite is 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.900
 the weapon in my opinion more beautiful and stronger 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.350
 of the game that is really a weapon 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.690
 really hallucinating with silencer e 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.430
 quick charger and really a bomb 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:19.070
 I don't know why it's not yet 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.770
 so much used there are people who 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.610
 they used it but still use it 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.899
 it is not yet that weapon we say one 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.049
 person but around now indexes 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.939
 what is your favorite weapon or otherwise 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.070
 what is the Rome so more than it does what you use 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.550
 to make the hundred plus one would tell you for 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.360
 example is massa mct would say 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.070
 n 94 would say pdv would not tell you one 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.140
 scorpion flight I don't know yet why 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.610
 maybe because we are only in March 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.290
 so the game still has to be 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.030
 discovered in its majority however there 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.610
 I can assure you guys used the way 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.710
 with no three charges of the rapid 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.600
 inflexible and ghost I miss with 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.850
 light because really very strong then 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.550
 with sacal and dexterity that's why the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.930
 scorpion evo already shoots very fast if 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.410
 then you put that dexterity into it 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.960
 as you read from here it aims faster afterwards 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.970
 the ride really a bomb then how 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.860
 second weapon guys and wait for a 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.710
 moment as they favored boys use 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.020
 you don't see me playing with that much 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:25.330
 with this weapon but me when I don't register 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.060
 so when I'm not playing to do 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.010
 gameplay I always use only this weapon if 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.870
 see that it puts a pdv as secondary 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.870
 to do the trick shots where I was I would like 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.550
 I would like to become at least not say 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.610
 good but decent publisher I gave that 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.560
 I really suck though seeing 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.900
 various gameplay also of the fans where it makes you 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.670
 see what the walruses do have it 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.980
 all but the last one is the last one 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.170
 fill with electric shocks is 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.959
 really really beautiful use with 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.580
 laser sight because anyway from the 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.570
 long forget to make trips from 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.970
 long distance good one thousand stabia 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.489
 it would be a stable apple and then cc more 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.230
 ballistic ball that I don't know what to put on 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.750
 that is to say, I must use it 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.640
 this gpu obviously since it puts a 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.530
 pdv as secondary must have 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.989
 then magician light so as not to make me 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.270
 bad when it's hot and one always ex 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.239
 precisely because the trick shot we say or 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.590
 fake shakes i use the semtex to do 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.090
 the trick shot here is when not 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.910
 I go looking for destroy but I go into 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.250
 domain with a talk sniper I take off 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.370
 this one here and I put the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.910
 I should put a gun here 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.620
 terzano boys use this the pdv 57 is 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.370
 true that the weakened and if it is not 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.090
 also a lot the year made more 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.910
 sucks in the sense that it has a recoil more to 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.380
 a greater recoil in the year also 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.560
 weakened from the point of view 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.640
 of strength who has it with a few strokes 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.110
 however, I believe if many people ask themselves the 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.880
 rapids charge problem o 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.959
 tormented charge of I can tell you that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.670
 charged and tormented and much much better 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.380
 and then as it is always this inflexible 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.790
 phantom seeks dexterity and c4 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.060
 obviously in the domain 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.400
 the c4 cannot miss with its beauty 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.750
 girl and this second have identical 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.280
 they are also from the point of view of the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.440
 loaders increased quick i 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.630
 I prefer the quick charger 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.340
 I don't know why but with the ms mc it gives me 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.380
 really bother seeing her load in a 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.270
 slow mode ie the call mm there are 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.100
 much toto programs to snore everything 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.190
 so I need the charger 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.650
 quick here and last weapon guys 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.740
 use a mp 7 is the weapon you have me 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.510
 recommended in many comments ie 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.950
 in comments in private messages why 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.990
 many of you tell me it really is 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.760
 a bomb and now just pretend this 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.090
 video I want to go immediately to the domain 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.650
 find it because also seeing from 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.390
 rows really looks like a strong rome 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.000
 so I'm looking forward to using it 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.070
 obviously I always use these almost that is 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.080
 I can't make others because I do n't 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.450
 has more loan points I can't block 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.020
 more pits and videos for formations e 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.410
 dexterity even if I am happy here and 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.720
 no boys so I always use c4 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.100
 extracted inflexible phantom cicadas but 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.890
 let's say it's in this weapon here where 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.920
 in the pvv in place of ghost you can 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.900
 put even light shrapnel 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.200
 because anyway if you already have god 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.600
 already write a twin or mmc 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.530
 to go out like that, he actually considers you 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.060
 one can say a change in the sense 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.220
 that makes no sense so you have two 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.730
 the same even if I end up doing them 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:43.130
 so however I would also recommend one 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:45.120
 pdv with light and anti-splinter or 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.040
 we say that he must not inflexible 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.450
 missing if you want to make slides 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.510
 very high so he considers me 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.130
 inflexible and I will read inflexible e 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.340
 anti-shatter not necessarily like a 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.020
 ghost if you have already put us on the mmc 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.030
 however guys i hope this 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.300
 video you enjoyed it if so maybe 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.860
 let me like it and we will see nothing 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.860
 at the next video, hello guys
