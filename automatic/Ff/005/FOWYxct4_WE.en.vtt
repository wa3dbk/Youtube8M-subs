hey everybody It's Me Margaret when it

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.150 
hey everybody It's Me Margaret when it
comes<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.960> things<00:00:10.170> like<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.410> three<00:00:10.769> needle<00:00:10.950> bind

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
comes to things like a three needle bind

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.360 
comes to things like a three needle bind
off<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.940> knitting<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.509> can<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.980> I

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
off and knitting I can do it but I

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.910 
off and knitting I can do it but I
discovered<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.719> achieve<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> exact<00:00:16.800> same

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
discovered I can achieve the exact same

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.130 
discovered I can achieve the exact same
thing<00:00:17.400> with<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> crochet<00:00:17.880> hook<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.690> that's

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
thing with a crochet hook and that's

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.220 
thing with a crochet hook and that's
what<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.410> tutorial<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.340> today

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.870 

so<00:00:28.230> I've<00:00:28.500> taken<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.949> off<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.100> machine<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
so I've taken it off the machine and the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.700 
so I've taken it off the machine and the
first<00:00:30.119> thing<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.510> really<00:00:30.720> need<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.200> know<00:00:31.230> is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
first thing you really need to know is

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.240 
first thing you really need to know is
that<00:00:32.450> it<00:00:33.450> needs<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.890> sides

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that it needs to have right sides

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.510 
that it needs to have right sides
together<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> here's<00:00:37.379> my<00:00:37.530> working<00:00:37.830> yarn<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
together so here's my working yarn I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
together so here's my working yarn I
think<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.850> probably<00:00:39.030> best<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.780> flipped<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
think it probably best if I flipped it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.420 
think it probably best if I flipped it
like<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:42.769> yes<00:00:44.090> okay<00:00:45.090> here's<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.840> deal<00:00:46.430> your

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
like that yes okay here's the deal your

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.240 
like that yes okay here's the deal your
waste<00:00:47.670> yarn<00:00:48.030> naturally<00:00:48.690> curves<00:00:49.050> under<00:00:49.250> which

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
waste yarn naturally curves under which

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.490 
waste yarn naturally curves under which
will<00:00:50.970> be<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.269> our<00:00:51.300> advantage<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:51.960> it'll

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
will be to our advantage because it'll

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.189 
will be to our advantage because it'll
get<00:00:52.710> itself<00:00:53.040> out<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> way<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:54.540> want<00:00:54.839> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
get itself out of the way we want to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
get itself out of the way we want to
join<00:00:56.150> this<00:00:57.150> row<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.720> here<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:59.030> caught

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
join this row right here that is caught

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.490 
join this row right here that is caught
in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> waste<00:01:00.809> yarn

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
in the waste yarn

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.029 
in the waste yarn
see<00:01:01.710> how<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.160> middle<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
see how it's in the middle you have the

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.800 
see how it's in the middle you have the
waste<00:01:05.250> yarn<00:01:05.489> here<00:01:05.910> and<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.240> stitch<00:01:06.509> right

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
waste yarn here and the stitch right

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.499 
waste yarn here and the stitch right
here<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.470> waste<00:01:07.710> yarn<00:01:07.950> again<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:09.300> is

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
here and then waste yarn again this is

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.719 
here and then waste yarn again this is
the<00:01:09.660> road<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.899> we<00:01:10.350> want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.800> join<00:01:11.039> in<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the road that we want to join in all the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
the road that we want to join in all the
way<00:01:11.850> around<00:01:12.890> now<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.460> case<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> addi

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
way around now in this case the addi

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.639 
way around now in this case the addi
king<00:01:16.680> size<00:01:16.979> has<00:01:17.369> 46<00:01:18.360> needles<00:01:18.930> which<00:01:19.229> means

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
king size has 46 needles which means

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.749 
king size has 46 needles which means
that<00:01:20.250> an<00:01:20.820> even<00:01:21.509> number<00:01:21.869> gives<00:01:22.229> each<00:01:22.560> stitch<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that an even number gives each stitch a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.790 
that an even number gives each stitch a
partner<00:01:25.190> so<00:01:26.990> we're<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.289> be<00:01:28.410> joining

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
partner so we're going to be joining

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.539 
partner so we're going to be joining
them<00:01:30.409> side<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.439> side<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> directly<00:01:32.400> across

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
them side by side and directly across

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.530 
them side by side and directly across
all<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:34.189> now<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.330> a<00:01:36.360> J

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
all the way now I'm going to use a J

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.120 
all the way now I'm going to use a J
crochet<00:01:39.540> hook<00:01:39.840> which<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.340> six<00:01:41.729> millimeter

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
crochet hook which is a six millimeter

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
crochet hook which is a six millimeter
it's<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> little<00:01:44.759> big<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.720> Caron

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it's really a little big for this Caron

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.590 
it's really a little big for this Caron
simply<00:01:46.409> soft<00:01:46.590> yarn<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
simply soft yarn but I want it to be a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.800 
simply soft yarn but I want it to be a
little<00:01:49.110> looser<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:51.630> want<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
little looser because you don't want to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
little looser because you don't want to
be<00:01:51.900> tight<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> will<00:01:52.770> kind<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.159> bow<00:01:53.520> your

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
be tight or it will kind of bow your

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
be tight or it will kind of bow your
seam<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:54.990> don't<00:01:55.110> want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.560> now

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
seam and we don't want to do that now

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.679 
seam and we don't want to do that now
the<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.909> thing<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:58.159> untie

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
the first thing I'm going to do is untie

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.130 
the first thing I'm going to do is untie
my<00:02:00.689> join<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:01.799> where<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:03.020> added<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
my join here that's where I added the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.800 
my join here that's where I added the
waste<00:02:04.380> yarn<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.119> want<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> loose

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
waste yarn and I want to get it loose

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.340 
waste yarn and I want to get it loose
from<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.259> working<00:02:07.829> yarn<00:02:07.940> okay<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
from my working yarn okay but this is a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.550 
from my working yarn okay but this is a
stitch<00:02:11.090> okay<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.600> had<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:13.140> if<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.440> had

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
stitch okay if I had not if I had

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470 
stitch okay if I had not if I had
continued<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.430> would<00:02:14.579> just<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> stitch

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
continued on it would just be a stitch

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.699 
continued on it would just be a stitch
like<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:17.190> I'm<00:02:17.280> gonna<00:02:17.430> treat<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.850> as<00:02:18.060> such

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
like this so I'm gonna treat it as such

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.830 
like this so I'm gonna treat it as such
pretending<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:19.739> I'm<00:02:20.130> sticking<00:02:20.850> my<00:02:21.090> crochet

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
pretending like I'm sticking my crochet

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.569 
pretending like I'm sticking my crochet
hook<00:02:21.989> in<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.470> stitch<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:23.040> I'm<00:02:23.160> really<00:02:23.340> just

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
hook in the stitch what I'm really just

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.270 
hook in the stitch what I'm really just
wrapping<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.150> over<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:25.010> looking<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

yarn<00:05:43.760> even<00:05:44.330> if<00:05:44.450> i<00:05:44.539> loom<00:05:44.810> knit<00:05:45.110> AddThis<00:05:46.479> there

yarn even if i loom knit AddThis there

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.129 
yarn even if i loom knit AddThis there
is<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:47.960> bind<00:05:48.320> off<00:05:48.590> that<00:05:49.130> I<00:05:49.250> have<00:05:49.430> seen<00:05:49.960> for<00:05:50.960> loom

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
is a bind off that I have seen for loom

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.990 
is a bind off that I have seen for loom
knitting<00:05:51.380> that<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:52.160> pretty<00:05:52.460> much<00:05:52.520> this

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
knitting that it is pretty much this

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.900 
knitting that it is pretty much this
very<00:05:53.330> thing<00:05:53.660> but<00:05:54.169> it's<00:05:54.620> very<00:05:54.860> awkward<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.639> do

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
very thing but it's very awkward to do

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.090 
very thing but it's very awkward to do
and<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:58.990> think<00:05:59.990> you<00:06:00.289> don't<00:06:00.440> have<00:06:00.800> as<00:06:00.950> much

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
and I think you don't have as much

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.700 
and I think you don't have as much
control<00:06:01.370> over<00:06:01.760> your<00:06:02.300> stitch<00:06:02.630> sizing<00:06:03.289> although

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
control over your stitch sizing although

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.920 
control over your stitch sizing although
I've<00:06:03.860> seen<00:06:04.160> experts<00:06:04.789> do<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:05.150> just<00:06:05.389> beautifully

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
I've seen experts do it just beautifully

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.040 
I've seen experts do it just beautifully
so<00:06:06.590> it<00:06:06.680> may<00:06:06.830> just<00:06:07.039> be<00:06:07.130> me<00:06:07.570> another<00:06:08.570> advantage

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
so it may just be me another advantage

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.409 
so it may just be me another advantage
