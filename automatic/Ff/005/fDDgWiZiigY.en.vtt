bring<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> rubidium<00:01:06.170> here<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
bring on the rubidium here it is is that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
bring on the rubidium here it is is that
it<00:01:08.610> well<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> might<00:01:09.509> not<00:01:09.750> look<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.229> much

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
it well it might not look like much

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.350 
it well it might not look like much
Richard<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.039> it's<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> highly<00:01:11.580> reactive<00:01:11.729> metal

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
Richard but it's a highly reactive metal

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
Richard but it's a highly reactive metal
it's<00:01:12.570> sealed<00:01:12.899> in<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.200> glass<00:01:13.440> tube<00:01:13.740> under

it's sealed in this glass tube under
argon<00:01:14.430> atmosphere<00:01:14.580> conditions<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.539> for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
argon atmosphere conditions just for

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
argon atmosphere conditions just for
safety<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.649> what's<00:01:16.799> gonna<00:01:16.890> happen<00:01:17.009> when

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
safety right so what's gonna happen when

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.950 
safety right so what's gonna happen when
you<00:01:17.640> drop<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> water<00:01:18.210> well<00:01:18.750> imagine

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you drop that in the water well imagine

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.420 
you drop that in the water well imagine
if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.320> will<00:01:19.440> letting<00:01:19.860> off<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> hand<00:01:20.280> grenade

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
if you will letting off a hand grenade

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.180 
if you will letting off a hand grenade
in<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> bathtub<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.780> oh<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.440> have<00:01:22.799> that

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
in a bathtub right oh I'm off have that

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.770 
in a bathtub right oh I'm off have that
okay<00:01:23.640> good<00:01:23.970> luck<00:01:28.190> okay<00:01:29.190> tickle<00:01:29.630> drop<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
okay good luck okay tickle drop the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
okay good luck okay tickle drop the
rubidium<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.830> water<00:01:34.759> two<00:01:35.759> grams<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
rubidium in the water two grams of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.969 
rubidium in the water two grams of
rubidium<00:01:36.630> will<00:01:36.960> only<00:01:37.110> react<00:01:37.590> when<00:01:37.830> our

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
rubidium will only react when our

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
rubidium will only react when our
specially<00:01:38.429> designed<00:01:38.819> vial<00:01:39.270> dissolves<00:01:40.050> in<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
specially designed vial dissolves in the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
specially designed vial dissolves in the
water<00:01:40.289> which<00:01:41.039> gives<00:01:41.250> John<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> few<00:01:41.819> crucial

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
water which gives John a few crucial

00:01:42.119 --> 00:02:00.730 
water which gives John a few crucial
seconds<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.229> our<00:01:43.350> safety<00:01:43.679> zone

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.710 

that<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.670> only<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.030> Brainiac<00:02:03.540> do

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
that is more like it only on Brainiac do

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.170 
that is more like it only on Brainiac do
you<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.080> kind<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.760> science<00:02:05.760> but<00:02:06.150> I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
you get that kind of science but I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.760 
you get that kind of science but I
believe<00:02:06.510> we<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:07.050> one<00:02:07.260> better<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.680> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
believe we can get one better there is

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
believe we can get one better there is
one<00:02:07.980> more<00:02:08.160> alkali<00:02:08.610> metal<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.119> legally

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
one more alkali metal with the legally

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
one more alkali metal with the legally
rules<00:02:09.990> yes<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.619> should<00:02:10.740> cesium<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> emperor

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
rules yes or should cesium the emperor

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.850 
rules yes or should cesium the emperor
of<00:02:12.000> alkali<00:02:12.420> metals<00:02:12.750> particularly<00:02:13.200> nasty<00:02:13.500> to

of alkali metals particularly nasty to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.790 
of alkali metals particularly nasty to
go<00:02:14.010> up<00:02:14.100> at<00:02:14.220> any<00:02:14.340> time<00:02:14.460> that's<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.630> oh<00:02:15.810> yes

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
go up at any time that's it oh yes

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.770 
go up at any time that's it oh yes
I<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.640> already<00:02:17.820> now<00:02:18.150> what's<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.450> gonna

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
I like it already now what's that gonna

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.380 
I like it already now what's that gonna
do<00:02:19.050> when<00:02:19.650> instr<00:02:20.010> would<00:02:20.190> imagine<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.120> depth

Randolph may I leave to speak you okay
John<00:02:27.780> go<00:02:28.020> free<00:02:36.470> as<00:02:37.470> our<00:02:37.680> cesium<00:02:38.280> sinks<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
John go free as our cesium sinks in the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.030 
John go free as our cesium sinks in the
water<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.660> rapid<00:02:40.050> generation<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.800> hydrogen

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
water the rapid generation of hydrogen

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.950 
water the rapid generation of hydrogen
gas<00:02:41.400> should<00:02:42.120> produce<00:02:42.390> quite<00:02:43.020> an<00:02:43.200> explosion

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:03:01.530 

and<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.710> does

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.699 

magnificent<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.470> concludes

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
magnificent and I think that concludes

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.920 
magnificent and I think that concludes
today's<00:03:04.400> experiment<00:03:05.090> there<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.600> should<00:03:05.900> say

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
today's experiment there is a should say

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.350 
today's experiment there is a should say
one<00:03:06.410> more<00:03:06.620> even<00:03:07.069> more<00:03:07.310> reactive<00:03:07.670> metal

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
one more even more reactive metal

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.360 
one more even more reactive metal
Frankie<00:03:09.200> but<00:03:09.709> for<00:03:09.860> some<00:03:10.040> reason<00:03:10.280> they

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
Frankie but for some reason they

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.860 
Frankie but for some reason they
wouldn't<00:03:10.610> let<00:03:10.700> us<00:03:10.819> have<00:03:10.850> any<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:11.720> we

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
wouldn't let us have any of that we

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.470 
wouldn't let us have any of that we
still<00:03:12.020> play<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.530> today's<00:03:12.830> lesson<00:03:13.150> never<00:03:14.150> mixed

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
still play of today's lesson never mixed

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.650 
still play of today's lesson never mixed
