give the team some credit but obviously

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.830

such a ridiculous amount of kills and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
such a ridiculous amount of kills and
that<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.960> spawn<00:00:34.260> points<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.739> black<00:00:34.890> ops

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
that is the spawn points and black ops

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
that is the spawn points and black ops
which<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> discuss<00:00:35.790> later<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
which I want to discuss later but as you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
which I want to discuss later but as you
can<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.829> video<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.219> being<00:00:38.460> spread<00:00:38.700> out

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
can see this video is being spread out

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.479 
can see this video is being spread out
because<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.329> 20<00:00:39.660> minutes<00:00:40.219> but<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
because it's like 20 minutes but I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.700 
because it's like 20 minutes but I
actually<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.690> got<00:00:42.780> sent<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> message<00:00:43.530> with

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
actually just got sent a message with

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.430 
actually just got sent a message with
this<00:00:43.829> I'm<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.190> holy<00:00:44.579> shit<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> crazy

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
this I'm like holy shit that is a crazy

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860 
this I'm like holy shit that is a crazy
score<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> watch<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.660> just

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
score and then I watch it and it's just

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.830 
score and then I watch it and it's just
absolute<00:00:49.620> spawn<00:00:49.980> trapping<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.120> don't<00:00:51.780> know

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
absolute spawn trapping and I don't know

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.510 
absolute spawn trapping and I don't know
I<00:00:51.899> mean<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.199> guess<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.829> takes<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I mean I guess it takes a lot of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.250 
I mean I guess it takes a lot of
collaborative<00:00:54.030> effort<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.750> applaud<00:00:55.050> them

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
collaborative effort and I applaud them

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380 
collaborative effort and I applaud them
on<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.890> mean<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.340> realizing<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.149> I'm

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
on that I mean for realizing this I'm

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.639 
on that I mean for realizing this I'm
not<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.780> blaming<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> players<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.620> much

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
not really blaming the players as much

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.760 
not really blaming the players as much
as<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.550> am<00:00:59.670> blaming<00:01:00.020> call<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> duty<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.410> black

as I am blaming call of duty and black
ops<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> treyarch<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.910> general<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
ops and treyarch in general because I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
ops and treyarch in general because I
mean<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.189> they're<00:01:05.430> shutting<00:01:05.760> off

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
mean as you can see they're shutting off

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.020 
mean as you can see they're shutting off
just<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.960> few<00:01:07.500> specific<00:01:08.010> spawn<00:01:08.520> points<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
just a few specific spawn points and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.469 
just a few specific spawn points and
they're<00:01:09.119> not<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.600> doing<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.080> else<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
they're not really doing much else I

they're not really doing much else I
don't<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.229> mean<00:01:13.409> I'm<00:01:13.560> sure<00:01:13.860> you'll

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
don't know and I mean I'm sure you'll

don't know and I mean I'm sure you'll
you<00:01:14.880> guys<00:01:15.090> will<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.630> video<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.259> your<00:01:16.409> sub

you guys will see this video in your sub

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
you guys will see this video in your sub
boxes<00:01:17.280> shortly<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:19.619> game<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
boxes shortly but this game is

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.179 
boxes shortly but this game is
absolutely<00:01:20.880> ridiculous<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
absolutely ridiculous and I think it's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.670 
absolutely ridiculous and I think it's
just<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.810> Treyarch<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.080> needs<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> fix

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just that Treyarch really needs to fix

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.760 
just that Treyarch really needs to fix
this<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.549> mean<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> game<00:01:28.350> one

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this because I mean I was in a game one

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.170 
this because I mean I was in a game one
time<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.369> were<00:01:29.460> getting<00:01:29.700> spawn<00:01:29.939> trapped

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
time and we were getting spawn trapped

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
time and we were getting spawn trapped
like<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.420> joined<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> game<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.950> wasn't

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
like I joined the game and it wasn't

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.980 
like I joined the game and it wasn't
like<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.369> bed<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> mean<00:01:33.659> there's<00:01:33.840> still

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
like this bed but I mean there's still

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.090 
like this bed but I mean there's still
some<00:01:34.350> 11<00:01:34.650> 150<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.619> 11<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.740> something

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
some 11 150 and like 11 or something

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.640 
some 11 150 and like 11 or something
which<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.369> still<00:01:38.640> ridiculous<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.299> mean<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.840> 501

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
which is still ridiculous I mean but 501

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
which is still ridiculous I mean but 501
and<00:01:40.890> eight<00:01:41.040> kills<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.520> mean<00:01:41.670> something<00:01:42.060> needs

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and eight kills I mean something needs

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.020 
and eight kills I mean something needs
to<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.360> addressed<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.820> can

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to be addressed I think that if you can

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.630 
to be addressed I think that if you can
just<00:01:45.630> very<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.829> spawn<00:01:47.130> points<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.520> mean

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
just very up the spawn points I mean

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
just very up the spawn points I mean
they<00:01:47.759> don't<00:01:47.850> always<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.689> spawn<00:01:49.020> back<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
they don't always have to spawn back in

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.980 
they don't always have to spawn back in
the<00:01:49.619> same<00:01:49.950> corner<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:51.090> even<00:01:51.720> in

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the same corner I think even in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.440 
the same corner I think even in
demolition<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.740> spawn<00:01:53.040> them<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.450> little

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
demolition you can spawn them in little

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
demolition you can spawn them in little
random<00:01:55.020> places<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.799> mean<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.040> guess<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.700> would

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
random places I mean I guess it would

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.330 
random places I mean I guess it would
throw<00:01:57.030> off<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.360> dynamic<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.990> little<00:01:58.290> bit<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
throw off the dynamic a little bit but I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
throw off the dynamic a little bit but I
mean<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.820> have<00:01:59.969> like<00:02:00.180> literally<00:02:00.479> only<00:02:00.840> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
mean to have like literally only to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.010 
mean to have like literally only to
spawn<00:02:01.710> points<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.930> they

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
spawn points right here and when they

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.920 
spawn points right here and when they
switch<00:02:04.320> sides<00:02:04.590> you'll<00:02:04.890> see<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:06.780> is

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
switch sides you'll see it this is

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300 
switch sides you'll see it this is
absolutely<00:02:07.290> ridiculous<00:02:07.350> i<00:02:07.829> actually<00:02:08.129> saw

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
absolutely ridiculous i actually saw

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.360 
absolutely ridiculous i actually saw
someone<00:02:08.700> post<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.360> video<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> spawn

but um you'll see that just them
spawning<00:02:18.260> right<00:02:18.500> there<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.800> guy<00:02:18.950> can

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
spawning right there this guy can

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.800

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
spawning and getting killed I mean that

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.509 
spawning and getting killed I mean that
absolutely<00:02:23.450> needs<00:02:23.629> to<00:02:23.720> be<00:02:23.840> addressed<00:02:24.370> if<00:02:25.370> you

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
absolutely needs to be addressed if you

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.030 
absolutely needs to be addressed if you
guys<00:02:25.640> would<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:25.879> like<00:02:26.209> maybe<00:02:27.050> like<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.769> or

whatever<00:02:28.550> said<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.030> around<00:02:29.299> because<00:02:29.690> i<00:02:29.959> really

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
whatever said it around because i really

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.320 
whatever said it around because i really
think<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.709> treyarch<00:02:31.310> should<00:02:31.580> see<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
think that treyarch should see this and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.020 
think that treyarch should see this and
see<00:02:32.450> how<00:02:32.690> ridiculous<00:02:33.319> this<00:02:33.620> score<00:02:34.489> is<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.910> how

destroyed<00:03:12.079> I<00:03:12.140> mean<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.590> sped<00:03:12.860> up<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.220> it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
destroyed I mean this is sped up so it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.420 
destroyed I mean this is sped up so it
does<00:03:13.549> kind<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.209> look<00:03:14.810> more<00:03:15.400> drastic<00:03:16.400> than

does kind of like look more drastic than
it<00:03:16.639> is<00:03:16.790> but<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.630> is<00:03:17.810> still<00:03:18.109> absolutely

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
it is but it is still absolutely

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.309 
it is but it is still absolutely
ridiculous<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.400> definitely<00:03:19.579> think<00:03:19.940> that

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
ridiculous and I definitely think that

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.870 
ridiculous and I definitely think that
someone<00:03:21.319> should<00:03:21.350> bring<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:22.100> like<00:03:22.609> JD

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
someone should bring this to like JD

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.910 
someone should bring this to like JD
2020s<00:03:23.569> attention<00:03:24.079> or<00:03:24.290> if<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.530> would<00:03:24.650> tweet

him or something because I mean this
score<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.980> kind<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.370> like<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.239> mean<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.780> is

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
like the the killfeed was literally just

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.970 
like the the killfeed was literally just
all<00:04:56.450> gunship<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.169> he<00:04:57.290> was<00:04:57.410> just<00:04:57.560> pointing<00:04:57.710> in

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
all gunship and he was just pointing in

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.780 
all gunship and he was just pointing in
at<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.550> same<00:04:58.790> place<00:04:59.090> so<00:05:00.460> again<00:05:01.460> if<00:05:01.580> you<00:05:01.669> would

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
at the same place so again if you would

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.000 
at the same place so again if you would
like<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.300> don't<00:05:02.780> know<00:05:02.870> what's<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:03.470> best<00:05:03.500> way<00:05:03.830> to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
like I don't know what's the best way to

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.730 
like I don't know what's the best way to
get<00:05:04.340> this<00:05:04.490> around<00:05:04.850> maybe<00:05:05.630> favorite<00:05:06.200> or<00:05:06.440> like

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
get this around maybe favorite or like

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.469 
get this around maybe favorite or like
but<00:05:07.040> then<00:05:07.220> it<00:05:07.580> kind<00:05:07.880> of<00:05:07.940> gets<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.210> wrong

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
but then it kind of gets the wrong

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.450 
but then it kind of gets the wrong
impression<00:05:08.690> if<00:05:09.260> you're<00:05:09.410> favoriting<00:05:10.280> and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
impression if you're favoriting and
