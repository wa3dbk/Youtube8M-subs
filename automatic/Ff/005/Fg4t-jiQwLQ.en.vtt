00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello a few days ago I was in Berlin and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.960
 besides being very cold, it provides many 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
 typical dishes of your kitchen in berlin 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.529
 one of the most classic is curry 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.480
 works that is a sausage that usually 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.340
 bring tomato sauce and curry I do not have 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 no idea how they do it and also I have not 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.810
 could get the original sausage 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.029
 I bought some coals cooked bours 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.550
 but I'm going to try it for the sauce 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.610
 Tomato put the tomatoes in the blender 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.130
 an onion four cloves of garlic salt and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.960
 pepper and beat it well and fry it 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.760
 in a pan that has plenty of oil 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.980
 extra virgin olive you must have 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 careful because it splashes so eolo 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.420
 cover runs you move immediately and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.560
 I'll let fry over low heat about 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.060
 20 minutes 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.160
 I always like to experience 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.530
 making myself the curry 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.170
 Obviously you can buy it made in 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.650
 a coffee grinder I'm going to grind turmeric 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.309
 cilantro sweet paprika cumin 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.140
 an anise star a bay leaf 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.690
 a pair of three cardamom seeds 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.730
 nails and salt the braskem and the cardamom 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.920
 I just did not like it was the feeling 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.000
 that is like cologne too 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.000
 aromatic for my taste 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.500
 once well ground we put it on the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.800
 tomato with the help of a sieve in case 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.230
 perhaps some piece has remained unmilled 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.160
 we stir well and this we are going to leave 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.160
 about 10 more minutes 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.070
 we take the sausages in abundant water 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.590
 boiling for about 5 minutes and what 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.370
 let's go with potato chips like that 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.370
 that we chop them 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.840
 and fry them in plenty of oil 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.370
 and the sausages are ready 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.370
 and we're going to serve it sliced 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.510
 for you 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.460
 next to the potatoes that we drain well 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.610
 and tomato sauce can 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.110
 Sprinkle over with curry but I 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.370
 I leave it so good I hope that I have 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.370
 liked a hug until then 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.569
 to
