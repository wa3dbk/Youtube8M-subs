00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
don't know

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.930 
don't know
I<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.660> think<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.380> probably<00:02:13.650> because<00:02:13.980> back

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I I think it's probably because back

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.100 
I I think it's probably because back
then<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.510> thought<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.880> only<00:02:17.880> by<00:02:18.270> manga<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
then I thought that only by manga that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
then I thought that only by manga that
were<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.560> ten<00:02:19.920> dollars<00:02:20.310> each<00:02:20.520> what's<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.420> good

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
were like ten dollars each what's a good

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.360 
were like ten dollars each what's a good
deal<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.320> was<00:02:22.500> like<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.040> twelve

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
deal and this was like this is twelve

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.390 
deal and this was like this is twelve
dollars<00:02:23.790> 99<00:02:24.210> cents<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.200> think<00:02:25.830> that's<00:02:26.160> why<00:02:26.370> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
dollars 99 cents so I think that's why I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.730 
dollars 99 cents so I think that's why I
put<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.820> off<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.480> could<00:02:28.350> really<00:02:28.500> get<00:02:28.680> a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
put it off because I could really get a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.500 
put it off because I could really get a
