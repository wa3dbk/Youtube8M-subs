you've<00:01:42.180> seen<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.570> i<00:01:42.630> did<00:01:43.020> use<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.950> by

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you've seen here i did use little by

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.910 
you've seen here i did use little by
little<00:01:44.360> on<00:01:45.360> these<00:01:45.689> lower<00:01:45.990> ones<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.500> use<00:01:46.799> them

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
little on these lower ones so use them

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.889 
little on these lower ones so use them
accurately<00:01:47.520> make<00:01:48.180> sure<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.659> just

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
accurately make sure that you don't just

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.069 
accurately make sure that you don't just
click<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.619> always<00:01:50.520> hit<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.970> 100<00:01:51.659> k<00:01:51.869> 1

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
click one and always hit on the 100 k 1

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
click one and always hit on the 100 k 1
or<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.350> 50<00:01:52.740> k<00:01:52.890> 1<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.369> sure<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.670> do

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
or the 50 k 1 and make sure that you do

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
or the 50 k 1 and make sure that you do
have<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> level<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.750> actually<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.170> able<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
have the level to actually be able to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.289 
have the level to actually be able to
use<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> higher<00:01:55.829> ones<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.180> only

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
use the higher ones because the only

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.510 
use the higher ones because the only
thing<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.659> different<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.649> you're

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
thing that's different is that if you're

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
thing that's different is that if you're
a<00:01:59.549> lower<00:01:59.729> level<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.180> won't<00:02:00.360> allow<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.840> do

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
a lower level it won't allow you to do

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.770 
a lower level it won't allow you to do
the<00:02:01.200> higher<00:02:01.619> ones<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.189> were<00:02:02.570> which<00:02:03.570> will

the higher ones which were which will

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.020 
the higher ones which were which will
take<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.200> less<00:02:04.409> time<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.369> getting

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
take you less time to be like getting

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.449 
take you less time to be like getting
the<00:02:06.149> free<00:02:06.299> experience<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.280> isn't
