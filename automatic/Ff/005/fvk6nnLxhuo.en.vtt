smart and clever game there's no two
ways<00:00:18.359> about<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.840> I'm<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.080> know<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> place<00:00:19.410> fast

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
ways about it I'm you know a place fast

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.679 
ways about it I'm you know a place fast
it's<00:00:20.189> very<00:00:20.279> simple<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.060> mean<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.390> could<00:00:21.510> teach

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
it's very simple I mean you could teach

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.060 
it's very simple I mean you could teach
this<00:00:21.869> game<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.170> anybody<00:00:22.590> pretty<00:00:22.800> quickly<00:00:22.980> I

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
this game to anybody pretty quickly I

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.019 
this game to anybody pretty quickly I
mean<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> could<00:00:23.400> kind<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.609> think<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.880> is

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
mean you could kind of think this is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.550 
mean you could kind of think this is
kind<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> gateway<00:00:24.510> game<00:00:24.810> almost<00:00:25.350> although

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
kind of a gateway game almost although

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.140 
kind of a gateway game almost although
it<00:00:26.010> does<00:00:26.189> get<00:00:26.340> pretty<00:00:26.430> crunchy<00:00:26.699> there's<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.000> lot

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
it does get pretty crunchy there's a lot

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
it does get pretty crunchy there's a lot
to<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.349> card

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
to think about and a lot of card

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
to think about and a lot of card
combinations<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> only<00:00:29.340> showed<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> couple<00:00:29.760> back

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
combinations I only showed a couple back

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.460 
combinations I only showed a couple back
to<00:00:30.420> MIT<00:00:30.570> we're<00:00:30.720> still<00:00:30.929> fairly<00:00:31.050> new<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to MIT we're still fairly new at the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.350 
to MIT we're still fairly new at the
game<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.279> sure<00:00:32.520> there's<00:00:32.700> even<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:32.969> stuff

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
game so I'm sure there's even more stuff

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.760 
game so I'm sure there's even more stuff
we<00:00:33.510> haven't<00:00:33.660> thought<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.320> think<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.620> lot

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
we haven't thought of so I think a lot

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.170 
we haven't thought of so I think a lot
of<00:00:37.800> people<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.129> really<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.940> quite

feels like to us ie plays very different
very<00:00:49.680> different<00:00:50.010> mechanics<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> has<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
very different mechanics but it has the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
very different mechanics but it has the
same<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> overall<00:00:52.680> feel<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.340> get

straightforward set collection playing
cards<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.820> think<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> problem<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.150> us<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.420> this

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
cards I think the problem for us of this

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.840 
cards I think the problem for us of this

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
at all um you know this is clearly meant

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.550 
at all um you know this is clearly meant
for<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.299> different<00:02:54.750> type<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.900> player<00:02:55.230> than<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
for a different type of player than the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.289 
for a different type of player than the
type<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:56.010> are<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.700> that's<00:02:56.880> why<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.150> game

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
type we are so that's why this game

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.339 
type we are so that's why this game
really<00:02:57.540> isn't<00:02:57.690> for<00:02:57.870> us<00:02:57.900> but<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.140> could

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
really isn't for us but I could

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.960 
really isn't for us but I could
certainly<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.799> why<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.040> works<00:02:59.579> well<00:02:59.790> for<00:02:59.819> a

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
certainly see why it works well for a

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.460 
certainly see why it works well for a
lot<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.180> players<00:03:00.329> you<00:03:00.569> can<00:03:00.840> blame<00:03:01.019> bring<00:03:01.379> it

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
lot of players you can blame bring it

lot of high-stakes action and there's a
lot<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.040> think<00:03:08.160> about<00:03:08.430> there's<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.670> lot<00:03:08.700> of

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
lot to think about there's a lot of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.699

strategizing<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.049> can't<00:03:10.379> do<00:03:10.470> too<00:03:10.680> much

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
strategizing you can't do too much

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.470 
strategizing you can't do too much
because<00:03:11.040> your<00:03:11.640> stuff<00:03:11.849> can<00:03:12.000> always<00:03:12.329> get

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
because your stuff can always get

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.390 
because your stuff can always get
assassinated<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.739> know<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.950> whole<00:03:13.980> push

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
assassinated but you know the whole push

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.250 
assassinated but you know the whole push
and<00:03:14.610> play<00:03:14.819> between<00:03:15.060> oh<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.629> want<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.019> make<00:03:16.110> my

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
and play between oh I want to make my

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.330 
and play between oh I want to make my
guilt<00:03:16.470> stronger<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:17.129> can<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.310> more

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
guilt stronger so they can do more

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.910 
guilt stronger so they can do more
powerful<00:03:17.819> stuff<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.900> do<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.350> one<00:03:19.650> makes

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
powerful stuff but do that one makes

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.259 
powerful stuff but do that one makes
them<00:03:20.069> targets<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.519> assassinations<00:03:21.180> and

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
them targets for assassinations and

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.750 
them targets for assassinations and
trading<00:03:21.690> into<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.620> law<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:23.549> know<00:03:23.579> is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
trading into the law you know is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.160 
trading into the law you know is
preventing<00:03:24.239> me<00:03:24.329> from<00:03:24.359> actually<00:03:24.870> scoring

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
preventing me from actually scoring

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.259 
preventing me from actually scoring
victory<00:03:25.500> points<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.310> know<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.819> the

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
victory points so you know that the the

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.059 
victory points so you know that the the
push-pull<00:03:27.780> between<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.380> very<00:03:28.620> very<00:03:28.859> nice

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
push-pull between that is very very nice

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.870 
push-pull between that is very very nice
if<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:30.359> want<00:03:30.630> an<00:03:31.069> interactive<00:03:32.069> game<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.519> so
