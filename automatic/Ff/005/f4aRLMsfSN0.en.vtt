without something that affects me

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.070 
without something that affects me
when<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.190> try<00:02:10.490> them<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.850> my<00:02:11.270> tire<00:02:11.480> pressure<00:02:11.780> you

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
when I try them is my tire pressure you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.170 
when I try them is my tire pressure you
don't<00:02:12.290> have<00:02:12.620> enough<00:02:12.980> when<00:02:13.490> you<00:02:13.580> go<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.790> to<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
don't have enough when you go to to the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.670 
don't have enough when you go to to the
G<00:02:14.330> turn<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.290> put<00:02:15.380> all<00:02:15.500> your<00:02:15.620> weight

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
G turn and you can put all your weight

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.380 
G turn and you can put all your weight
down<00:02:15.920> your<00:02:16.100> front<00:02:16.340> tire<00:02:16.550> it's<00:02:16.819> just<00:02:17.239> going<00:02:17.330> to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
down your front tire it's just going to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.720 
down your front tire it's just going to
buckle<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.680> know<00:02:18.800> even<00:02:19.010> if<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:19.400> fine

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
buckle so you know even if it's fine

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.160 
buckle so you know even if it's fine
when<00:02:19.940> you're<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.180> riding<00:02:20.480> normally<00:02:20.870> having

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
when you're just riding normally having

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.260 
when you're just riding normally having
low<00:02:21.380> pressure<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.160> G<00:02:22.340> turn<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.819> lot<00:02:23.090> more

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
low pressure the G turn is a lot more

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.360 
low pressure the G turn is a lot more
pressure<00:02:23.540> on<00:02:23.660> your<00:02:23.810> front<00:02:24.020> wheel<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.040> want

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
pressure on your front wheel so you want

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.640 
pressure on your front wheel so you want
to<00:02:25.430> have<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:25.790> enough<00:02:26.330> but<00:02:27.050> at<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.290> same<00:02:27.440> time

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
to have just enough but at the same time

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.559 
to have just enough but at the same time
not<00:02:27.950> too<00:02:28.190> much<00:02:28.370> because<00:02:29.180> if<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.330> have<00:02:29.420> too

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
not too much because if you have too

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.570 
not too much because if you have too
much<00:02:29.690> it's<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.930> lot<00:02:30.080> harder<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.350> balance<00:02:30.580> once

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
much it's a lot harder to balance once

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.280 
much it's a lot harder to balance once
you're<00:02:31.760> good<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.900> know<00:02:32.989> once<00:02:33.200> you've

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
you're good with you know once you've

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.810 
you're good with you know once you've
cheated<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.709> couple<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.980> manual<00:02:34.280> pads<00:02:34.489> and

little curve islands you can kind of

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.380 
little curve islands you can kind of
