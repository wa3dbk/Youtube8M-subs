okay<00:00:08.910> we're<00:00:09.030> going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.210> cover<00:00:09.360> questions

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
okay we're going to cover questions

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.300 
okay we're going to cover questions
about

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.310 
about

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.390 
about
authors<00:00:11.610> chisels<00:00:12.060> a<00:00:12.620> mortise<00:00:13.620> chisel<00:00:13.650> I'm

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
authors chisels a mortise chisel I'm

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.700 
authors chisels a mortise chisel I'm
gonna<00:00:14.580> try<00:00:15.270> and<00:00:15.330> show<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.690> here<00:00:16.080> should<00:00:16.530> have

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
gonna try and show you here should have

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.359 
gonna try and show you here should have
three<00:00:17.690> cutting<00:00:18.690> edges<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.830> obvious<00:00:20.130> one<00:00:20.280> at

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
three cutting edges the obvious one at

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.540 
three cutting edges the obvious one at
the<00:00:20.460> end<00:00:20.660> but<00:00:21.660> also<00:00:21.950> along<00:00:22.950> each<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.430> these

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
the end but also along each of these

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.320 
the end but also along each of these
sides<00:00:23.940> here<00:00:24.529> needs<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.860> polished<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.150> both

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
sides here needs to be polished on both

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.499 
sides here needs to be polished on both
phases<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.290> create<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> sharp<00:00:29.070> edge<00:00:29.450> now<00:00:30.450> the

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
phases to create a sharp edge now the

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.450 
phases to create a sharp edge now the
reason<00:00:30.930> for<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:31.950> you're

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
reason for that is that as you're

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.690 
reason for that is that as you're
cutting<00:00:33.300> into<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> mortise<00:00:34.400> you're<00:00:35.400> not<00:00:35.490> just

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
cutting into the mortise you're not just

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.640 
cutting into the mortise you're not just
cutting<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:36.000> through<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.050> angle<00:00:37.530> of

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
cutting down through it but the angle of

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.700 
cutting down through it but the angle of
the<00:00:37.770> bevel<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.130> also<00:00:38.600> sliding<00:00:39.600> along<00:00:39.720> so<00:00:40.530> if

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the bevel is also sliding along so if

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.280 
the bevel is also sliding along so if
these<00:00:41.010> leading<00:00:41.760> edges<00:00:42.150> are<00:00:42.300> sharp<00:00:42.329> they'll

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
these leading edges are sharp they'll

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.230 
these leading edges are sharp they'll
cut<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.860> leave<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> nice<00:00:44.280> clean<00:00:44.640> side<00:00:44.970> on<00:00:45.150> the

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
cut and leave a nice clean side on the

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.110 
cut and leave a nice clean side on the
mortise<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:46.470> will<00:00:46.740> reduce<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.760> amount<00:00:47.850> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
mortise which will reduce the amount of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.580 
mortise which will reduce the amount of
effort<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.690> need<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.900> put<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.380> make

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
effort that you need to put in to make

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.240 
effort that you need to put in to make
the<00:00:49.710> cut<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.130> also<00:00:51.680> leave<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> nice<00:00:52.950> clean

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
the cut and also leave a nice clean

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.910 
the cut and also leave a nice clean
finish<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:54.210> well

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
finish as well

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
finish as well
so<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.160> order<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> achieve<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:58.500> sharpen

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so in order to achieve that you sharpen

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.660 
so in order to achieve that you sharpen
the<00:00:59.280> tool<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.730> normal<00:01:00.240> working<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> back

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
the tool as normal working on the back

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.509 
the tool as normal working on the back
and<00:01:02.670> working<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:04.019> bevel<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.369> can

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and working on the bevel which you can

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.940 
and working on the bevel which you can
do<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> honing<00:01:06.810> guide<00:01:06.930> rich<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> kills

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
do with a honing guide rich it kills

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.859 
do with a honing guide rich it kills
number<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:08.850> guides<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.330> perfect<00:01:09.750> for

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
number one and two guides of perfect for

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.219 
number one and two guides of perfect for
these<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:14.929> using<00:01:15.929> a<00:01:16.079> little

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
these so you can see using a little

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.789 
these so you can see using a little
benchmark<00:01:16.859> just<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> set<00:01:18.179> the<00:01:19.130> projection<00:01:24.799> we

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
benchmark just to set the projection we

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.480 
benchmark just to set the projection we
can<00:01:25.950> drop<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.999> just<00:01:28.189> hone<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> way

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
can drop that on and just hone the way

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.480 
can drop that on and just hone the way
and<00:01:29.819> repeat<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> same<00:01:30.960> angle<00:01:31.289> every<00:01:31.499> time<00:01:33.170> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
and repeat the same angle every time the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.169 
and repeat the same angle every time the
sides<00:01:35.749> you<00:01:36.749> do<00:01:36.960> by<00:01:37.549> laying<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.819> chisel

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
sides you do by laying the chisel

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.260 
sides you do by laying the chisel
sideways<00:01:39.990> onto<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.889> honing<00:01:41.189> medium<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
sideways onto the honing medium as you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
sideways onto the honing medium as you
would<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.630> doing<00:01:43.109> the<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.469> but<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.189> apply

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
would for doing the back but you apply

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
would for doing the back but you apply
all<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> pressure<00:01:45.560> over<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.840> back<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
all the pressure over the back of the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
all the pressure over the back of the
chisel<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:50.100> side<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.399> you've<00:01:50.549> already

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
chisel the side that you've already

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.699 
chisel the side that you've already
polished<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:53.149> leaning<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.299> side<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
polished so leaning on that side you

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.459 
polished so leaning on that side you
just<00:01:55.920> work<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.340> edge<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.079> put<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.289> nice

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
just work that edge and put a nice

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.109 
just work that edge and put a nice
polish<00:01:58.859> on<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.609> that<00:01:59.789> will<00:01:59.880> give<00:01:59.999> you<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
polish on it and that will give you a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.379 
polish on it and that will give you a
nice<00:02:00.299> sharp<00:02:00.600> cutting<00:02:00.840> edge<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.289> side<00:02:02.389> now

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
nice sharp cutting edge on the side now

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.139 
nice sharp cutting edge on the side now
I'll<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.109> do<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.499> quick<00:02:05.280> demonstration<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
I'll just do a quick demonstration to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.279 
I'll just do a quick demonstration to
show<00:02:06.359> you<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> mean<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:08.000> action<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
show you what I mean in action and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.910 
show you what I mean in action and
hopefully<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.470> make<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> bit

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
hopefully that will make it a bit

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.970 
hopefully that will make it a bit
clearer<00:02:12.380> okay<00:02:13.380> I've<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.530> brought<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
clearer okay I've just brought the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.559 
clearer okay I've just brought the
camera<00:02:14.430> down<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.790> bench<00:02:15.000> level<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.330> now

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
camera down to bench level and if I now

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.580 
camera down to bench level and if I now
place<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.439> chisel<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.090> next<00:02:21.390> cut

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:42.569 

and<00:02:26.590> then<00:02:26.739> chopped<00:02:27.040> down<00:02:34.139> and<00:02:35.139> again<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:42.400> can

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
and then chopped down and again you can

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.679 
and then chopped down and again you can
see<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.379> we<00:02:44.799> cut<00:02:45.069> down<00:02:45.480> we're<00:02:46.480> also

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
see that as we cut down we're also

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.530 
see that as we cut down we're also
coming<00:02:47.200> back<00:02:47.939> towards<00:02:48.939> the<00:02:49.060> direction<00:02:49.480> that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
coming back towards the direction that

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.360 
coming back towards the direction that
we're<00:02:49.689> coming<00:02:49.840> from<00:02:50.109> so<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.889> bevel<00:02:51.250> is

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
we're coming from so the bevel is

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.140 
we're coming from so the bevel is
pushing<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.909> chisel<00:02:53.249> along<00:02:54.249> the<00:02:54.669> work<00:02:54.879> as

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
pushing the chisel along the work as

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:04.409 
pushing the chisel along the work as
well<00:02:55.359> as<00:02:55.510> down<00:02:55.810> into<00:02:56.230> it<00:03:01.799> as<00:03:02.799> we<00:03:02.980> do<00:03:03.159> that<00:03:03.430> these

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:04.419 
well as down into it as we do that these

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:10.050 
well as down into it as we do that these
side<00:03:04.840> edges<00:03:05.079> of<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:06.689> chisel<00:03:08.280> are<00:03:09.280> shaving

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
side edges of the chisel are shaving

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.589 
side edges of the chisel are shaving
along<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.980> insides<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.969> mortise<00:03:13.299> almost

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
along the insides of the mortise almost

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.229 
along the insides of the mortise almost
like<00:03:13.719> a<00:03:13.750> plane<00:03:14.669> so<00:03:15.669> that<00:03:17.040> face<00:03:18.040> there<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.699> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
like a plane so that face there is the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.780 
like a plane so that face there is the
one<00:03:19.389> that<00:03:19.419> we're<00:03:19.659> creating<00:03:20.310> each<00:03:21.310> time<00:03:21.639> we

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
one that we're creating each time we

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.319 
one that we're creating each time we
make<00:03:21.969> a<00:03:22.000> cut<00:03:22.650> using<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.859> sides<00:03:24.189> of<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.609> the

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
make a cut using the sides of the the

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:35.280 
make a cut using the sides of the the
chisel<00:03:31.919> when<00:03:32.919> you're<00:03:33.069> cutting<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.430> mortise<00:03:34.290> you

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
chisel when you're cutting a mortise you

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.420 
chisel when you're cutting a mortise you
work<00:03:35.530> from<00:03:35.769> one<00:03:36.729> end<00:03:36.909> to<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.060> other<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.430> then

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
work from one end to the other and then

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.379 
work from one end to the other and then
you<00:03:39.549> can<00:03:39.729> come<00:03:39.970> back<00:03:40.209> down<00:03:40.479> this<00:03:40.720> way

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
you can come back down this way

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:50.939 
you can come back down this way
reversing<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.479> chisel<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:50.319> will<00:03:50.560> blow<00:03:50.739> out

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
reversing the chisel this will blow out

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.719 
reversing the chisel this will blow out
because<00:03:51.069> there's<00:03:51.250> nothing<00:03:51.400> supporting<00:03:51.819> it

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
because there's nothing supporting it

00:03:53.729 --> 00:04:00.179 
because there's nothing supporting it
but<00:03:55.560> hopefully<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.709> can<00:03:56.739> see<00:03:56.919> that<00:03:58.889> as<00:03:59.889> we

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
but hopefully you can see that as we

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:05.009 
but hopefully you can see that as we
progress<00:04:00.479> we<00:04:01.479> can<00:04:01.629> just<00:04:03.750> continue<00:04:04.750> chopping

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
progress we can just continue chopping

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:14.399 
progress we can just continue chopping
down<00:04:05.349> through<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.949> waste

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.479 

which<00:04:15.409> just<00:04:15.650> gets<00:04:15.890> gradually<00:04:18.280> decimated<00:04:19.280> more

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
which just gets gradually decimated more

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.420 
which just gets gradually decimated more
and<00:04:19.669> more<00:04:23.710> but<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:24.830> don't<00:04:25.009> need<00:04:25.100> to<00:04:25.220> leave

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
and more but we don't need to leave

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:46.120 
and more but we don't need to leave
everything<00:04:25.789> out<00:04:26.169> as<00:04:27.169> we<00:04:27.470> go<00:04:44.740> when<00:04:45.740> we<00:04:45.770> get<00:04:46.009> to

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
everything out as we go when we get to

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.370 
everything out as we go when we get to
where<00:04:46.280> we<00:04:46.400> started<00:04:46.820> from<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.960> can<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.229> we've

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
where we started from you can see we've

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.920 
where we started from you can see we've
got<00:04:48.410> an<00:04:48.620> awful<00:04:48.860> lot<00:04:48.949> deeper<00:04:49.190> than<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.580> first

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
got an awful lot deeper than the first

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.870 
got an awful lot deeper than the first
couple<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:50.990> cuts<00:04:51.259> which<00:04:51.440> were<00:04:51.620> fairly<00:04:51.919> small

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.870 

and<00:04:55.880> then<00:04:56.509> we<00:04:56.630> can<00:04:56.810> start<00:04:57.370> squaring<00:04:58.370> up<00:04:58.639> on<00:04:58.789> the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
and then we can start squaring up on the

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:07.390 
and then we can start squaring up on the
end<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:05.270> as<00:05:05.630> you<00:05:06.020> can<00:05:06.169> see<00:05:06.349> we<00:05:06.560> just<00:05:06.590> walked

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
end so as you can see we just walked

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.550 
end so as you can see we just walked
backwards<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:07.970> forwards<00:05:08.300> down<00:05:08.509> until<00:05:09.320> we<00:05:09.440> end

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
backwards and forwards down until we end

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.189 
backwards and forwards down until we end
up<00:05:09.680> with<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.830> nice<00:05:09.919> square<00:05:10.520> bottom<00:05:10.849> mortise<00:05:11.240> all

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
up with a nice square bottom mortise all

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.260 
up with a nice square bottom mortise all
of<00:05:12.440> this<00:05:12.530> nut<00:05:12.740> can<00:05:12.889> be<00:05:13.009> flicked<00:05:13.280> out<00:05:13.460> at<00:05:14.030> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
of this nut can be flicked out at the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:26.040 
of this nut can be flicked out at the
end

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.110
