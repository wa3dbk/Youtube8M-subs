 only she brings twice with two men 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.130
 and there is a famous scene in the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.190
 book that even was the scene is that 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.860
 shocked the public power in the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.080
 emma bovary river is with one of its 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.680
 lovers inside a carriage they 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.860
 They're having sex and the carriage is moving. 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.960
 wildly and cushion the coachman walks 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.260
 with the carriage through the streets of the city without 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.720
 parking for hours and hours 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.060
 of course they are having sex 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.510
 inside the carriage but the author does not use 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.300
 no time the word sex 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.580
 Fluvial had the ambition to build 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.790
 an extremely objective and 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.520
 realistic after an ambulance and was 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.890
 published every form of writing 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.480
 novels has changed forever he is a 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.470
 author who has influenced generations and 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.050
 generations 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.610
 he was an obsessive by the way he 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.090
 I was hours and hours weeks 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.640
 months to complete is is a page one 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.290
 chapter he wanted to find the word 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.740
 just a perfect score phrasing 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.320
 ideal 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.210
 he is very economical in the words he is 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.450
 very words do not apologize is too much 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.060
 in metaphors and is 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.370
 impressive the way he controls 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.890
 builds the details how to eliminate 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.080
 details of this provincial 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.040
 he is describing the details of 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.920
 landscape of the characters of the psychological 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.910
 of the characters mainly of the ema 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.250
 goal that is the protagonist that is the anti 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.830
 heroin and software also has a 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.459
 eroni that never goes beyond the point of 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.670
 political poking in the science of 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.750
 religion, but it is always subtle and 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.260
 light irony that never crosses the point 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.650
 I just loved reading this novel. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.900
 I had very contradictory feelings. 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.970
 in relation to a silly girl and her husband 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.840
 This is the other characters. 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.630
 I felt the movement of attraction in me 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.110
 and repulsion by these characters 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 I think this comes from the fact that the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.750
 gustavo roberto does not really judge the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.930
 characters shows the contradictions and 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.840
 the two sides of each personality 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.250
 imma sweeps in many history 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.760
 romances and there they made love and 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.860
 world and the reality that he is doing 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.820
 also a critique of these novels 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.820
 are in vogue at the time their heroes 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.420
 and full of flourishes and idealizations 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.540
 because avaÃ­ is heavily influenced by 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.870
 these novels and she always feels 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.120
 unsatisfied 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.500
 It seems like she 's an eternal woman . 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.600
 dissatisfaction with her husband with people 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.859
 to the city where she lives with her 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.109
 way of life 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.569
 with the clothes she wears with the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.789
 objects that are inside her house and 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:30.479
 my strong bittersweet 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:35.460
 this feeling of constant magnet 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.879
 dissatisfaction and misfortune lion madame 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.340
 bovary is an incredible book that 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:45.599
