00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.919 
I know I've always had issues with that
so<00:01:57.119> you're<00:01:58.119> gonna<00:01:58.239> do<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.539> you're<00:01:58.659> just<00:01:58.840> gonna

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
so you're gonna do is you're just gonna

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.010 
so you're gonna do is you're just gonna
fold<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.349> lengthwise<00:01:59.560> in<00:02:00.159> half<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.810> you're

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
fold it lengthwise in half and you're

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.190 
fold it lengthwise in half and you're
going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.259> wrap<00:02:02.439> it<00:02:02.469> around<00:02:02.619> I<00:02:03.989> like<00:02:04.989> to<00:02:05.110> have

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
going to wrap it around I like to have

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.809 
going to wrap it around I like to have
it<00:02:05.319> meet<00:02:05.469> in<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.619> front<00:02:05.890> because<00:02:06.700> that's

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
it meet in the front because that's

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.270 
it meet in the front because that's
easier<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.569> then<00:02:08.170> you're<00:02:08.799> going<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.009> take

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
easier and then you're going to take

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.150 
easier and then you're going to take
your<00:02:09.429> chemo<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.170> you're<00:02:11.170> gonna<00:02:11.889> wrap<00:02:12.100> it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
your chemo and you're gonna wrap it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.970 
your chemo and you're gonna wrap it
around<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:13.120> your<00:02:14.019> hemo<00:02:14.440> should<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.739> long

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
around on your hemo should be long

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.910 
around on your hemo should be long
enough<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> wrap<00:02:15.639> around<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.000> twice<00:02:16.920> and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
enough to wrap around you twice and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.990 
enough to wrap around you twice and
you're<00:02:18.100> probably<00:02:18.190> going<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.489> want<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> have<00:02:18.880> it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
you're probably going to want to have it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.910 
you're probably going to want to have it
up<00:02:19.150> here<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.630> down<00:02:19.900> here

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
up here and down here

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.370 
up here and down here
just<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.360> keeps<00:02:22.630> itself<00:02:22.930> contained

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.699 

and<00:02:26.380> can<00:02:26.530> make<00:02:26.680> sure<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.950> doesn't<00:02:27.099> fall<00:02:27.220> off

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
and can make sure it doesn't fall off

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.630 
and can make sure it doesn't fall off
and<00:02:29.709> if<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> cross<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.520> back

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
and if you have a cross in the back

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.040 
and if you have a cross in the back
that's<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.880> little<00:02:31.060> easier<00:02:31.360> because<00:02:31.480> you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
that's a little easier because you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.180 
that's a little easier because you
figure<00:02:32.290> that's<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.530> place<00:02:32.770> where<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.040> gonna

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
figure that's the place where it's gonna

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.180 
figure that's the place where it's gonna
separate<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.790> least<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:37.180> gonna<00:02:37.300> tie<00:02:37.540> that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
separate the least so I'm gonna tie that

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.460 
separate the least so I'm gonna tie that
in<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.400> bow<00:02:39.580> just<00:02:40.270> easier<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.910> fix<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.660> as

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
in a bow just easier and just fix it as

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.550 
in a bow just easier and just fix it as
you<00:02:44.620> go<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:45.130> might<00:02:45.250> want<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> pull<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.760> tighter

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.740 

and<00:02:49.100> for<00:02:49.760> those<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.150> who<00:02:50.270> are<00:02:50.390> doing<00:02:50.660> this

it should come down here and use a

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.240 
it should come down here and use a
mirror<00:03:40.519> if<00:03:40.880> you've<00:03:41.180> got<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> little<00:03:41.690> more<00:03:41.810> back

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.719 
mentioned this is the synthetic oh
that's<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.050> bloomers<00:06:13.430> and<00:06:16.129> this<00:06:17.129> I<00:06:17.340> think<00:06:17.400> is

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
that's the bloomers and this I think is

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.999 
that's the bloomers and this I think is
very<00:06:17.789> cool<00:06:18.740> this<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:20.129> the<00:06:21.259> analogy<00:06:22.259> bond<00:06:22.439> which

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
very cool this is the analogy bond which

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.640 
very cool this is the analogy bond which
is<00:06:23.039> oops<00:06:23.819> the<00:06:24.389> full<00:06:24.779> piece<00:06:25.770> which<00:06:26.550> would<00:06:26.789> just

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
is oops the full piece which would just

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.040 
is oops the full piece which would just
go<00:06:28.650> over<00:06:28.680> like<00:06:29.639> this<00:06:29.909> if<00:06:30.210> I<00:06:30.599> wasn't<00:06:30.810> wearing

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
go over like this if I wasn't wearing

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.200 
go over like this if I wasn't wearing
this<00:06:31.289> again<00:06:32.089> oops

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
this again oops

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.929 
this again oops
this<00:06:33.539> way<00:06:33.689> and<00:06:34.250> you<00:06:35.250> would<00:06:35.339> just<00:06:35.400> tie<00:06:35.729> it<00:06:35.789> down

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:37.939 
this way and you would just tie it down

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:42.110 
this way and you would just tie it down
obviously<00:06:38.939> I<00:06:39.270> didn't<00:06:39.629> do<00:06:39.750> this<00:06:40.909> this<00:06:41.909> time

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
obviously I didn't do this this time

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.029 
obviously I didn't do this this time
