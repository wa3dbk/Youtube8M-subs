00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.639 

then<00:02:00.549> instead<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.509> doing<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.990> guy<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.290> do<00:02:02.500> a

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
then instead of doing this guy I do a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.660 
then instead of doing this guy I do a
d-shaped<00:02:04.470> G<00:02:05.470> chord<00:02:05.860> d<00:02:06.340> e<00:02:06.369> f<00:02:06.820> g<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:09.039> an<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.310> root

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.900 
d-shaped G chord d e f g with an a root
I<00:02:10.950> had<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:11.980> little<00:02:12.250> sus<00:02:12.610> for<00:02:13.060> there<00:02:14.459> with<00:02:15.459> an<00:02:15.640> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
I had a little sus for there with an a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.479 
I had a little sus for there with an a
string<00:02:16.300> there<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.959> I'm<00:02:17.349> not<00:02:17.620> playing<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.040> D

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
string there and I'm not playing that D

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.490 
string there and I'm not playing that D
string<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:21.150> then<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.180> kind<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.959> changed<00:02:23.349> this

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
string and then I kind of changed this

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.589 
string and then I kind of changed this
this<00:02:24.040> guy<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.489> bit

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
this guy a little bit

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.369 
this guy a little bit
I<00:02:27.370> guess<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.579> I<00:02:29.000> guess<00:02:29.299> that's<00:02:29.540> basically<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.110> do

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
I guess I I guess that's basically I do

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.309 
I guess I I guess that's basically I do
that<00:02:30.879> before<00:02:31.879> so<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.329> guess<00:02:32.569> I<00:02:32.689> don't<00:02:32.719> change<00:02:33.140> it

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
that before so I guess I don't change it

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.130 
that before so I guess I don't change it
and<00:02:34.069> I<00:02:34.189> just<00:02:34.430> uh<00:02:34.640> hit<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.090> little<00:02:35.480> love<00:02:35.689> G

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:38.230 
this is Dean here again it's another
five<00:07:33.879> so<00:07:34.879> you<00:07:35.569> know<00:07:35.779> I<00:07:36.219> think<00:07:37.219> my<00:07:37.580> corn<00:07:37.909> theory

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
five so you know I think my corn theory

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.329 
five so you know I think my corn theory
is<00:07:38.389> probably<00:07:38.599> going<00:07:38.930> to<00:07:38.990> be<00:07:39.050> kinda<00:07:39.770> off<00:07:39.949> on

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:40.339 
is probably going to be kinda off on

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:42.489 
is probably going to be kinda off on
that<00:07:40.520> one<00:07:40.580> it's<00:07:40.969> probably<00:07:41.689> some<00:07:41.900> weird<00:07:42.139> slash

00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:42.499 
that one it's probably some weird slash

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:46.659 
that one it's probably some weird slash
chord<00:07:43.360> um<00:07:44.360> you<00:07:45.020> know<00:07:45.169> like<00:07:45.199> this<00:07:45.979> would<00:07:46.249> be<00:07:46.430> I

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:46.669 
chord um you know like this would be I

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:52.439 
chord um you know like this would be I
guess<00:07:47.060> this<00:07:47.389> would<00:07:47.539> be<00:07:47.599> like<00:07:48.259> a<00:07:49.749> D<00:07:50.749> sharp<00:07:51.740> six

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:52.449 
guess this would be like a D sharp six

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:58.360 
guess this would be like a D sharp six
/g<00:07:53.949> you<00:07:54.949> know<00:07:55.099> I<00:07:55.249> mean<00:07:55.490> who's<00:07:55.939> to<00:07:56.210> say<00:07:57.370> things

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.370 
/g you know I mean who's to say things

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.040 
/g you know I mean who's to say things
can<00:07:58.639> get<00:07:58.729> a<00:07:58.789> little<00:07:58.849> weird<00:07:59.180> chord<00:07:59.659> wise<00:07:59.839> so

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.050 
can get a little weird chord wise so

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.490 
can get a little weird chord wise so
that<00:08:00.169> anyway<00:08:00.770> so<00:08:00.800> there's<00:08:01.249> that
