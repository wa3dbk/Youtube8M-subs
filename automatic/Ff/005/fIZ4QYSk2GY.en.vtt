instance<00:00:38.489> let's<00:00:38.910> take<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> look<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.629> Nexus<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
instance let's take a look at Nexus and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
instance let's take a look at Nexus and
Matthew<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.280> reason<00:00:41.550> why<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
Matthew the reason why I look at the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
Matthew the reason why I look at the
low-rated<00:00:42.570> informs<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
low-rated informs is because there is a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.860 
low-rated informs is because there is a
lot<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> market<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.780> are
