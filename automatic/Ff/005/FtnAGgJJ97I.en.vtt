great um um it doesn't matter either but
only<00:01:21.659> downside<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> how<00:01:22.200> about<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> has

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
only downside I how about it that has

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.399 
only downside I how about it that has
lost<00:01:23.130> split<00:01:23.490> ends<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.990> because

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
lost split ends I think this because

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
lost split ends I think this because
when<00:01:25.979> i<00:01:26.040> got<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> install<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.000> lady<00:01:27.299> didn't
