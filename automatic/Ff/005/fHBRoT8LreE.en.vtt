00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.760 
smudge here on the corner um not sure
how<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.060> made<00:05:09.450> it<00:05:09.600> through<00:05:09.810> quality<00:05:10.260> but<00:05:12.770> but

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
how that made it through quality but but

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.010 
how that made it through quality but but
it<00:05:13.980> definitely<00:05:14.430> feels<00:05:14.910> good<00:05:15.060> in<00:05:15.420> my<00:05:15.450> hand<00:05:15.840> it

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
it definitely feels good in my hand it

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.870 
it definitely feels good in my hand it
does<00:05:16.200> definitely<00:05:17.070> remind<00:05:17.370> me<00:05:17.490> of<00:05:18.980> of<00:05:19.980> a<00:05:20.190> g3<00:05:20.700> a

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
does definitely remind me of of a g3 a

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.420 
does definitely remind me of of a g3 a
little<00:05:21.810> bit<00:05:21.960> let's<00:05:22.200> see<00:05:22.320> if<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.530> will<00:05:22.620> power<00:05:22.860> on

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.070 

I'm<00:05:26.430> going<00:05:26.550> to<00:05:26.610> I'm<00:05:27.300> pretty<00:05:27.510> sure<00:05:27.750> that<00:05:27.930> I've

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
I'm going to I'm pretty sure that I've

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.010 
I'm going to I'm pretty sure that I've
read<00:05:28.290> that<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.860> battery<00:05:29.160> is<00:05:29.310> not<00:05:29.580> removable

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
read that the battery is not removable

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.210 
read that the battery is not removable
that<00:05:31.020> would<00:05:31.110> explain<00:05:31.380> why<00:05:31.500> it's<00:05:31.950> already

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
that would explain why it's already

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.090 
that would explain why it's already
installed<00:05:33.530> and<00:05:34.530> while<00:05:34.740> we're<00:05:34.890> waiting<00:05:35.070> for

there there are a couple of variations

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.260 
there there are a couple of variations
this<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:53.790> 64<00:05:54.450> gigabyte<00:05:55.100> variation<00:05:56.100> has<00:05:56.640> a

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
this is the 64 gigabyte variation has a

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.330 
this is the 64 gigabyte variation has a

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
feels good in my hand

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.830 
feels good in my hand
it<00:06:18.210> looks<00:06:18.840> nice<00:06:19.880> the<00:06:20.880> branding<00:06:21.390> is<00:06:21.540> very

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
it looks nice the branding is very

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.930 
it looks nice the branding is very
subtle<00:06:22.230> it's<00:06:22.680> it's<00:06:23.120> understated<00:06:25.790> let's<00:06:26.790> just

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
subtle it's it's understated let's just

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.230 
subtle it's it's understated let's just
pop<00:06:27.150> the<00:06:27.300> back<00:06:27.450> off<00:06:27.690> and<00:06:27.900> see<00:06:29.120> what<00:06:30.120> we<00:06:30.210> look

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
pop the back off and see what we look

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:39.170 
pop the back off and see what we look
like<00:06:30.570> I<00:06:30.690> don't<00:06:30.750> need<00:06:37.580> I'm<00:06:38.580> also<00:06:38.730> trying<00:06:39.030> a

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
like I don't need I'm also trying a

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.280 
like I don't need I'm also trying a
different<00:06:39.210> background<00:06:40.730> to<00:06:41.780> to<00:06:42.780> try<00:06:42.990> not<00:06:43.140> to

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
different background to to try not to

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.900 
different background to to try not to
wash<00:06:43.530> out<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:43.800> phone<00:06:44.070> but<00:06:44.250> also<00:06:44.490> try<00:06:44.700> not<00:06:44.730> to

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
wash out the phone but also try not to

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.090 
wash out the phone but also try not to
overpower<00:06:45.360> the<00:06:45.660> phone<00:06:45.870> tell<00:06:46.770> me<00:06:46.860> what<00:06:47.040> you

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
overpower the phone tell me what you

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.760 
overpower the phone tell me what you
think<00:06:47.340> about<00:06:47.430> this<00:06:49.190> this<00:06:50.190> background<00:06:51.770> but

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
think about this this background but

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.620 
think about this this background but
yeah<00:06:52.890> so<00:06:53.130> so<00:06:53.550> the<00:06:53.670> so<00:06:53.880> the<00:06:54.030> battery<00:06:54.450> is

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
yeah so so the so the battery is

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.350 
yeah so so the so the battery is
definitely<00:06:55.380> embedded<00:06:56.030> but<00:06:57.030> you<00:06:57.180> have<00:06:57.390> your

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
definitely embedded but you have your

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.590 
definitely embedded but you have your
micro<00:07:00.360> sd<00:07:00.750> and<00:07:01.020> a<00:07:01.080> couple<00:07:01.290> of<00:07:01.440> SIM<00:07:01.590> card<00:07:01.830> slots

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
micro sd and a couple of SIM card slots

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.090 
micro sd and a couple of SIM card slots
so<00:07:03.600> it<00:07:03.690> looks<00:07:03.810> like<00:07:03.870> similan<00:07:04.470> he<00:07:04.590> says<00:07:04.860> I<00:07:04.890> know

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
so it looks like similan he says I know

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.270 
so it looks like similan he says I know
if<00:07:05.250> you<00:07:05.310> can<00:07:05.460> see<00:07:05.640> this<00:07:06.740> only<00:07:07.740> how<00:07:07.980> well<00:07:08.130> this

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
if you can see this only how well this

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.580 
if you can see this only how well this
is<00:07:08.370> going<00:07:08.580> to<00:07:08.640> focus<00:07:08.790> but<00:07:09.060> sim<00:07:09.300> one<00:07:09.540> says<00:07:09.870> to<00:07:10.140> g4

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
is going to focus but sim one says to g4

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.690 
is going to focus but sim one says to g4
2g<00:07:11.250> 3G<00:07:11.670> 4G<00:07:12.170> and<00:07:13.170> sim<00:07:13.440> 2<00:07:13.620> just<00:07:13.830> says<00:07:13.950> 2g<00:07:14.370> so<00:07:14.610> I'm

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:14.700 
2g 3G 4G and sim 2 just says 2g so I'm

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.540 
2g 3G 4G and sim 2 just says 2g so I'm
assuming<00:07:14.940> if<00:07:15.270> you<00:07:15.780> needed<00:07:15.990> a<00:07:16.440> second<00:07:16.920> phone<00:07:17.190> to

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
assuming if you needed a second phone to

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.090 
assuming if you needed a second phone to
make<00:07:17.670> phone<00:07:17.880> calls<00:07:18.120> you<00:07:18.270> could<00:07:18.420> use<00:07:18.650> that<00:07:19.650> it's

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.100 
make phone calls you could use that it's

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.880 
make phone calls you could use that it's
interesting<00:07:20.310> too<00:07:20.730> that<00:07:20.910> the<00:07:21.060> the<00:07:21.530> the<00:07:22.530> speaker

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890 
interesting too that the the the speaker

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.980 
interesting too that the the the speaker
grille<00:07:23.250> seems<00:07:24.180> to<00:07:24.360> be<00:07:24.450> all<00:07:24.570> the<00:07:24.660> way<00:07:24.690> across

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
grille seems to be all the way across

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.510 
grille seems to be all the way across
but<00:07:25.830> if<00:07:25.920> you<00:07:26.010> look<00:07:26.160> on<00:07:26.280> the<00:07:26.400> back<00:07:26.550> it's<00:07:26.910> covered

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 
but if you look on the back it's covered

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.040 
but if you look on the back it's covered
and<00:07:29.520> then<00:07:30.030> the<00:07:30.240> speaker<00:07:30.480> is<00:07:30.600> just<00:07:30.750> on<00:07:30.900> one<00:07:31.020> side

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
and then the speaker is just on one side

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.120 
and then the speaker is just on one side
that<00:07:31.260> seems<00:07:32.000> kind<00:07:33.000> of<00:07:33.560> I'm<00:07:34.560> sure<00:07:34.590> it's<00:07:34.860> just<00:07:35.010> a

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.130 
that seems kind of I'm sure it's just a

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.390 
that seems kind of I'm sure it's just a
style<00:07:35.460> design<00:07:36.120> decision<00:07:36.990> but<00:07:37.500> anyway<00:07:37.740> video

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 
style design decision but anyway video

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.650
