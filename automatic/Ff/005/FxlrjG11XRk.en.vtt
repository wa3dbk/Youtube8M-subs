here and we're looking at the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.839 
here and we're looking at the
conversions<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> opt-ins<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.490> viral

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
conversions and the opt-ins for viral

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.450 
conversions and the opt-ins for viral
hosts<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.360> viral<00:00:12.750> URL<00:00:13.110> two<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> sites

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
hosts and viral URL two of the sites

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.140 
hosts and viral URL two of the sites
that<00:00:14.580> I'm<00:00:14.730> involved<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.830> now<00:00:16.830> ultimately

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
that I'm involved with now ultimately

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.000 
that I'm involved with now ultimately
the<00:00:18.150> whole<00:00:18.300> goal<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.840> using<00:00:19.140> list<00:00:19.470> builders<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the whole goal of using list builders is

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.890 
the whole goal of using list builders is
to<00:00:20.160> get<00:00:20.279> people<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.670> take<00:00:21.240> action<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.779> your

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
to get people to take action on your

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.920 
to get people to take action on your
site<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> click<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:24.029> not<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.779> any

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
site so a click is is not really of any

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.900 
site so a click is is not really of any
value<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> only<00:00:26.039> valuable<00:00:26.490> thing<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
value to you the only valuable thing is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
value to you the only valuable thing is
if<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> person<00:00:27.539> gives<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.900> their<00:00:28.500> personal

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
if the person gives you their personal

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
if the person gives you their personal
email<00:00:29.220> address<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.119> follow<00:00:30.269> up<00:00:30.480> with

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
email address so you can follow up with

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.669 
email address so you can follow up with
them<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> put<00:00:31.080> them<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.289> your<00:00:31.320> sales<00:00:31.590> funnel

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
so we looked at these stats in the last

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.510 
so we looked at these stats in the last
video<00:00:34.260> which<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.800> linked<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.100> below<00:00:35.370> this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
video which are linked to below this

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.900 
video which are linked to below this
video<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.890> now<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.280> want<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.670> let's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
video so now what we want to do is let's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.190 
video so now what we want to do is let's
just<00:00:39.090> take<00:00:39.239> some<00:00:39.420> random<00:00:39.750> looks<00:00:39.930> at<00:00:40.050> some

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
just take some random looks at some

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.310 
just take some random looks at some
other<00:00:41.270> emails<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> second<00:00:43.110> i'm<00:00:43.200> going

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
other emails and in a second i'm going

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.540 
other emails and in a second i'm going
to<00:00:43.410> show<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> site<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> i<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.280> sending

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
these people to so here we have viral

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.889 
these people to so here we have viral
URL<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.789> viral<00:00:48.059> hosts<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> i'm

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
URL and we have viral hosts and i'm

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.910 
URL and we have viral hosts and i'm
going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.320> block<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.710> other

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
going to have to block out the other

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610 
going to have to block out the other
ones<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> middle<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> opt-in<00:00:52.410> data

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
ones in the middle so on the opt-in data

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.729 
ones in the middle so on the opt-in data
you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.760> viral<00:00:54.059> hosts<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:55.020> 21

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you can see that viral hosts got 21

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.369 
you can see that viral hosts got 21
opt-ins<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.520> very<00:00:57.480> high<00:00:57.660> opt-in<00:00:58.050> rate<00:00:58.199> so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
opt-ins a very high opt-in rate so

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.849 
opt-ins a very high opt-in rate so
that's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.859> opt-ins<00:00:59.250> from<00:00:59.430> one<00:00:59.579> mailing

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
that's a lot of opt-ins from one mailing

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.660 
that's a lot of opt-ins from one mailing
you<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> remember<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.640> our

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
you have to remember that with our

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
services you can mail every three days

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
services you can mail every three days
so<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> really<00:01:06.510> grow<00:01:06.689> very<00:01:06.960> powerful

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
so you can really grow very powerful

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.570 
so you can really grow very powerful
list<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> make<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> lot<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> money<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.340> these

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
list to make a lot of money with these

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090 
list to make a lot of money with these
okay<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.689> let's<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.170> another<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.650> look

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
okay so then let's have another I look

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.170 
okay so then let's have another I look
at<00:01:11.220> another<00:01:11.400> random<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.330> well<00:01:12.450> I

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
at another random one here as well I

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.310 
at another random one here as well I
guess<00:01:15.180> there's<00:01:15.360> no<00:01:15.479> viral<00:01:15.840> hosts<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
guess there's no viral hosts in this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.429 
guess there's no viral hosts in this
list<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.860> only<00:01:17.220> VAR<00:01:17.460> URL<00:01:17.869> you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:18.900> see<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
list is only VAR URL you can see that it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.140 
list is only VAR URL you can see that it
comes<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:20.100> high<00:01:20.220> octane<00:01:20.580> percent<00:01:20.970> in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
comes out for high octane percent in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.149 
comes out for high octane percent in
giving<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.450> most<00:01:21.689> options<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.290> well<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:24.140> then

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
giving the most options as well and then

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.109 
giving the most options as well and then
let's<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.340> look<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:26.700> before<00:01:26.970> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
let's just look at one more before I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.789 
let's just look at one more before I
show<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.479> actual<00:01:28.020> landing<00:01:28.320> page<00:01:28.530> used

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
show you that actual landing page used

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.539 
show you that actual landing page used
for<00:01:29.009> these<00:01:29.390> okay<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:31.009> viral<00:01:32.009> URL<00:01:32.340> here

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
for these okay so we have viral URL here

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.539 
for these okay so we have viral URL here
but<00:01:32.729> no<00:01:32.880> viral<00:01:33.240> hosts<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.820> statistics<00:01:37.549> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
but no viral hosts and the statistics it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.370 
but no viral hosts and the statistics it
completely<00:01:39.299> smashed<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> other<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
completely smashed as the other the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
completely smashed as the other the
other<00:01:40.409> competitors<00:01:41.400> they're<00:01:42.329> not

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
like traffic's appear here it automates

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.340 
like traffic's appear here it automates
that<00:03:19.350> mailing<00:03:20.190> out<00:03:20.400> process<00:03:20.819> for<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:22.230> then

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
that mailing out process for you so then

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.039 
that mailing out process for you so then
I<00:03:22.590> had<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.100> friend<00:03:23.459> come<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.940> me<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.359> he<00:03:24.870> runs

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
I had a friend come to me and he runs

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.250 
I had a friend come to me and he runs
this<00:03:25.260> site<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:26.389> he<00:03:27.389> asked<00:03:27.660> me<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:28.079> I

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
this site here and he asked me if I

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.309 
this site here and he asked me if I
would<00:03:28.319> please<00:03:28.620> promote<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:30.660> page<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.200> him

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
would please promote this page for him

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.660 
would please promote this page for him
which<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.500> basically<00:03:31.950> like<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.190> squeeze<00:03:32.489> page

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
which is basically like a squeeze page

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.339 
which is basically like a squeeze page
as<00:03:32.849> well<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.450> has<00:03:33.599> an<00:03:33.720> attention-grabbing

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
as well it has an attention-grabbing

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.800 
as well it has an attention-grabbing
video<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.099> has<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.670> big<00:03:35.880> flashing<00:03:36.180> join<00:03:36.510> free

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
video and has a big flashing join free

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.110 
video and has a big flashing join free
button<00:03:37.319> that<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.160> click<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.670> new<00:03:38.790> sign<00:03:39.000> up

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
button that you click in the new sign up

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.009 
button that you click in the new sign up
so<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:40.849> mean<00:03:41.849> probably<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.569> would<00:03:42.660> convert

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
so I mean probably it would convert

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.720 
so I mean probably it would convert
better<00:03:43.200> if<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.799> header<00:03:43.980> was<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> lot<00:03:44.430> smaller

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
better if the header was a lot smaller

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.330 
better if the header was a lot smaller
if<00:03:45.419> we're<00:03:45.599> going<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.870> talk<00:03:46.019> about<00:03:46.169> it<00:03:46.380> this

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
if we're going to talk about it this

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.670 
if we're going to talk about it this
wasn't<00:03:47.579> here<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:47.970> not<00:03:48.150> needed<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.680> instead

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
wasn't here it's not needed and instead

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.080 
wasn't here it's not needed and instead
of<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:49.889> flashing<00:03:50.160> button<00:03:50.549> here<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:50.940> had

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
of this flashing button here just had

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.059 
of this flashing button here just had
the<00:03:51.209> opt-in<00:03:51.540> form<00:03:51.810> right<00:03:51.989> here<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:52.799> people

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
the opt-in form right here so people

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.430 
the opt-in form right here so people
don't<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> click<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.639> another<00:03:53.940> page<00:03:54.440> so

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
don't have to click to another page so

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.839 
don't have to click to another page so
it's<00:03:55.560> not<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.739> highest<00:03:56.069> converting<00:03:56.519> squeeze

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
it's not the highest converting squeeze

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.909 
it's not the highest converting squeeze
page<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.269> I've<00:03:57.359> seen<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:57.959> honest<00:03:58.260> but<00:03:58.769> it

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919

you to mail so obviously they are not in
sync<00:05:18.690> time<00:05:19.259> so<00:05:19.530> they<00:05:19.620> go<00:05:19.740> out<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:20.039> different

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
sync time so they go out in different

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.129 
sync time so they go out in different
categories<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.360> here's<00:05:21.539> another<00:05:21.750> one<00:05:21.960> but

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139

this was only just sent out so it's not

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.399 
this was only just sent out so it's not

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
about 30 minutes ago but we will have a

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.409 
about 30 minutes ago but we will have a
quick<00:05:29.009> look<00:05:29.039> so<00:05:29.520> once<00:05:29.699> again<00:05:29.789> it's<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.180> same

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419

quick look so once again it's the same
email<00:05:30.780> copy<00:05:31.469> and<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:32.430> sent<00:05:32.699> out<00:05:32.909> and<00:05:33.180> there's

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
email copy and it sent out and there's

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.040 
email copy and it sent out and there's
viral<00:05:33.810> hosts<00:05:34.110> there<00:05:34.259> again<00:05:34.530> an<00:05:35.810> opt-in<00:05:36.810> data

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
viral hosts there again an opt-in data

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.899 
viral hosts there again an opt-in data
we<00:05:37.469> can<00:05:37.590> see<00:05:37.860> that<00:05:38.039> it's<00:05:38.159> already<00:05:38.280> got<00:05:38.669> two

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
we can see that it's already got two

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.330 
we can see that it's already got two
options<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.479> half<00:05:39.659> an<00:05:39.810> hour<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.159> it's<00:05:41.280> the

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
options in half an hour so and it's the

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.999 
options in half an hour so and it's the
only<00:05:41.490> disability<00:05:42.449> that<00:05:42.539> has<00:05:42.690> got<00:05:42.840> opt-ins<00:05:43.110> so

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
only disability that has got opt-ins so

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.510 
only disability that has got opt-ins so
far<00:05:44.810> so<00:05:45.810> as<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:45.960> can<00:05:46.110> see<00:05:46.289> viral<00:05:46.500> hosts<00:05:46.949> very

far so as you can see viral hosts very

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.909 
far so as you can see viral hosts very
powerful<00:05:47.969> VAR<00:05:48.570> URL<00:05:48.840> very<00:05:49.199> powerful<00:05:49.620> now<00:05:49.740> I

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
powerful VAR URL very powerful now I

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.260 
powerful VAR URL very powerful now I
haven't<00:05:50.130> looked<00:05:50.310> at<00:05:50.460> any<00:05:50.550> of<00:05:50.699> these<00:05:50.820> stats<00:05:51.090> but

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
haven't looked at any of these stats but

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.670 
haven't looked at any of these stats but
let's<00:05:51.449> have<00:05:51.570> a<00:05:51.599> look<00:05:51.780> at<00:05:51.930> this<00:05:52.289> one<00:05:52.530> because

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
let's have a look at this one because

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.820 
let's have a look at this one because
I'd<00:05:52.860> assume<00:05:53.190> that<00:05:53.370> viral<00:05:53.669> URL<00:05:54.000> is<00:05:54.120> listed<00:05:54.150> here

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
I'd assume that viral URL is listed here

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.939 
I'd assume that viral URL is listed here
it<00:05:55.830> is<00:05:56.039> there<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.430> is<00:05:56.460> okay<00:05:57.590> let's<00:05:58.590> look<00:05:58.710> at<00:05:58.860> the

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
it is there it is okay let's look at the

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.279 
it is there it is okay let's look at the
opportune<00:05:59.219> data<00:05:59.509> well<00:06:00.509> there<00:06:00.659> you<00:06:00.690> go<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:01.050> mean

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
opportune data well there you go I mean

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.110 
opportune data well there you go I mean
I<00:06:01.349> hadn't<00:06:01.560> even<00:06:01.650> looked<00:06:01.830> at<00:06:01.979> this<00:06:02.130> an<00:06:02.340> opt-in<00:06:02.639> 7

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
I hadn't even looked at this an opt-in 7

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.300 
I hadn't even looked at this an opt-in 7
at<00:06:03.599> a<00:06:03.659> very<00:06:03.900> high<00:06:03.960> conversion<00:06:04.560> rate<00:06:04.710> so<00:06:05.219> you

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
at a very high conversion rate so you

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.399 
at a very high conversion rate so you
can<00:06:05.550> see<00:06:05.699> that<00:06:05.729> viral<00:06:06.180> URL<00:06:06.569> com<00:06:06.990> and<00:06:07.229> borrow
