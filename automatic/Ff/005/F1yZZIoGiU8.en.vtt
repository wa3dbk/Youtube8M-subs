00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
about the sound so I created quite a few

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.310 
about the sound so I created quite a few
parts<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.800> I<00:03:15.860> graded<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.489> exhaust<00:03:17.170> which<00:03:18.170> is<00:03:18.290> a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
parts so I graded the exhaust which is a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.960 
parts so I graded the exhaust which is a
stainless<00:03:18.739> manifold<00:03:19.160> exhaust<00:03:19.459> led<00:03:19.640> over<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
stainless manifold exhaust led over to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.020 
stainless manifold exhaust led over to
exhaust<00:03:20.300> itself<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:22.370> wheels<00:03:22.610> as<00:03:22.820> well<00:03:23.000> as

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
exhaust itself and the wheels as well as

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.360 
exhaust itself and the wheels as well as
as<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.540> did<00:03:23.840> with<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.080> steer<00:03:24.350> motions<00:03:24.680> now<00:03:24.800> NSX

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
as I did with the steer motions now NSX

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.750 
as I did with the steer motions now NSX
R<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.000> that's<00:03:26.480> really<00:03:27.310> accentuated<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
R and that's really accentuated the the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.740 
R and that's really accentuated the the
overall<00:03:29.060> driving<00:03:29.420> experience<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.070> NSX

overall driving experience of the NSX

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.300 
overall driving experience of the NSX
top<00:03:32.750> speed<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.500> would<00:03:33.739> be<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:33.890> hundred<00:03:34.040> and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
top speed it would be a hundred and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.340 
top speed it would be a hundred and
seventy<00:03:34.580> five<00:03:35.090> miles<00:03:35.360> an<00:03:35.570> hour<00:03:35.690> could<00:03:36.260> be<00:03:36.320> a

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
you are driving the car itself so I'm

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.860 
you are driving the car itself so I'm
looking<00:04:08.459> forward<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.910> seeing<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.480> footage

once<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.260> has<00:04:10.349> been<00:04:10.500> completed<00:04:11.209> in<00:04:12.209> terms<00:04:12.510> of

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
once it has been completed in terms of

once it has been completed in terms of
value<00:04:12.959> when<00:04:13.560> I<00:04:13.590> bought<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> car<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.520> believe<00:04:15.150> it

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
value when I bought the car I believe it

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.090 
value when I bought the car I believe it
has<00:04:15.750> doubled<00:04:16.049> in<00:04:16.169> value<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.680> can<00:04:16.919> get

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
has doubled in value so if you can get

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.159 
has doubled in value so if you can get
your<00:04:17.160> hands<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.549> one<00:04:17.790> now<00:04:18.660> would<00:04:18.900> be<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.079> time

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
your hands on one now would be the time

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.550 
your hands on one now would be the time
to<00:04:19.560> get<00:04:19.680> one<00:04:19.739> because<00:04:20.570> I'm<00:04:21.570> pretty<00:04:22.049> much<00:04:22.260> glad

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
that I bought when I did because I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:45.730 
that I bought when I did because I
wouldn't<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.330> able<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.540> afford<00:04:24.690> one<00:04:24.810> now
