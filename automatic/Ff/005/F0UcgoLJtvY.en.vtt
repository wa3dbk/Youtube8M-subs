00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.480
 Hello everyone, I will collect today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.710
 computer without this old stuff 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.650
 computers here will need only 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 for work and no extra power here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.170
 not required therefore quite fit here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.840
 it is an old iron and so from what will 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.869
 collect the motherboard will be here 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.310
 installed mtsk 9 dam on chipset 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.710
 nforce 570 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 I want to say that initially on this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.930
 motherboard has been installed 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.029
 radiator 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 flat radiator which is in operation 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.190
 heated to 90 degrees so i 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.090
 replaced with a cooler shot from here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.879
 video cards 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.100
 but now he also needs replacement because 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.640
 that the fan here fell apart this 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.860
 the fan no longer rotates and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.980
 so Iâ€™ll replace it with one 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.949
 Here is a radiator is a samopal completely 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.890
 copper radiator so self-made 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.590
 Of course, he looks less 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.340
 more attractive than this one 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.960
 cools more efficiently processor here 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.560
 athlon 64 3 800 plus sock installed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.930
 pulling 2 2 gigahertz is an old processor 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.930
 dual-core to work quite fit 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:25.950
 I will install two operational strips 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.810
 unix total capacity will be 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 one and a half gigabyte one 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 gigabyte 2 to 512 megabytes of course yes 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.200
 one and a half guide is not enough 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.030
 there is nothing more memory 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 and at the moment I only have 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.670
 Here is this memory will be the hard drive 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.860
 installed in western digital 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.640
 WAX, this is now not letting them out. blue 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.149
 winchester in very good condition 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.130
 practically unused 320 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.570
 gigabyte will be enough for 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.390
 graphics card work naturally need here 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.750
 candy so maybe weaker because for 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.099
 work is a palit graphics card 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.200
 radeon 4 650 of course yes graphics card here 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.959
 could be set weaker 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.410
 I have nothing else but here 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:22.349
 this 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.800
 on quite fit and even thermal grease 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.580
 I will use titanium 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 I prefer to use 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.940
 domestic manufacturer is CPT-8 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.780
 efficiency 19 axel 3 but unfortunately they me 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.120
 have ended 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.620
 from what I found it was this one 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.549
 titan think amiss and the latest 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.830
 from you this wild power mod is perfectly 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.660
 wild looking this micro you 400 watts 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.290
 I got this power supply already in 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.870
 idle without a cooler 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.920
 here the diode broke a schottky and surrendered 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.200
 capacitors 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.239
 but I already repaired it all 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.880
 now working condition cooler i 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.110
 replaced more precisely put even two 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.019
 cooler one inside 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.269
 one outside and here it is grill grate 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.860
 and I was not therefore just questions 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.040
 such plastic stuff 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.989
 why such a wild decision why are there two 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 fan 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.400
 I want to say I prefer to bet 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.190
 cooler glacialtech ball bearing you and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.569
 they are reliable enough and and good 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.579
 expect with minimal noise but to 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.049
 Unfortunately, these cooler I ran out and 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.579
 from what was 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:41.190
 This here such here nouneym they 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:44.160
 low speed very freedom and this 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.049
 gave the cooler stand on blowing and so I 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.190
 put two to at least increase 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.540
 power flow and it's not 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.049
 ball bearing you and cooler and it's on 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.870
 sleeve sleeves are not very reliable and 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.599
 therefore, 2 will be much safer and at least 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.769
 their rotation speed will increase more accurately 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.450
 not the speed of rotation but the flow will come out 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.470
 so that's quite aerial 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.169
 wild decision 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.989
 of course yes it is absolutely wildest 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.060
 Looks like use it I am not 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.239
 I recommend this exclusivity but 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.520
 what I had gathered here is such a block 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.650
 power soldered 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.419
 satosha wire to connect 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.900
 Winchester from the case of such 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.960
 the body is nothing supernatural the most 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.450
 normal body the only thing here is not 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.979
 there was fluoride 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.530
 photon only they were absent here 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.930
 me unfortunately brass bushings too 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.830
 ended so I put such here 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.050
 insulators in height they are exactly one 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.630
 into one like photonic bushings which 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.960
 put in the case and here are the screws 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.930
 pastor and if you think what you say 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.800
 more precisely that the motherboard I have not 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.870
 will contact with to 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 I can tell you that contact will be fine 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.520
 through the silencer quints and so proceed to 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.440
 computer assembly assembled all the cables 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.229
 stacked radiator on the chipset replace 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.510
 cooler here I am such a fan 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.360
 mulberry transparent with LED 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.280
 backlit but the impeller is made of 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.219
 black opaque plastic 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.990
 how did it happen but this cooler 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.560
 resulted from repairing another 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.409
 scooter 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.810
 brought me somehow zalman 9 500 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.419
 whom 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.640
 the impeller fell off this sleeve 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.919
 trying and and glue with super glue but all 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.169
 this garbage did not last long 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.169
 fell off so I just took bought 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.030
 here is such a transparent cooler pulled out 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.849
 from here impeller and set 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.430
 respectively , driving 2 500 to 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.860
 didn't disappear found yourself 92 millimeter 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.919
 cooler and put the impeller with 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.460
 yes, this is how this frame turned out 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.919
 with the power supply I figured that's removed 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.740
 it's all mega cooler on and post madness 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.439
 one normal fan all now 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.250
 should work no problem here yet 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:21.719
 there are two sinful graves of the river 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.840
 practical application they do not 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:27.750
 bear to perform here only decorative 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.300
 role as such plugs under the case at 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.150
 I was not instead of plugs I just 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:37.169
 put this model flights which 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.580
 serves as stubs 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.789
 it remains to check the performance 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:46.680
 computer though honored is checked sorry 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:50.060
 let's turn on all the workers now 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.539
 computer will have a second life 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:58.169
 went to load it only remained 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:01.279
 operating system and this computer 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.279
 still work
