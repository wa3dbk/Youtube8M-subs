what led to me

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.520 
what led to me
developing<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> speaker<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
engineers and immanence the main thing

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.280 
engineers and immanence the main thing
we<00:01:35.550> focused<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.899> wanted

which is an issue with a lot of speakers

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.280 
which is an issue with a lot of speakers
they<00:02:21.060> don't<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.329> they<00:02:21.750> don't<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.019> tight

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.009 
they don't have they don't have a tight
low<00:02:22.500> end<00:02:22.709> they<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.430> lot<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.730> mush<00:02:24.239> you

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
know an overwhelming low end so this

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.420

nothing else like it on the market the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.930 
nothing else like it on the market the
real<00:03:51.840> kicker<00:03:52.049> with<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.379> thing<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.700> neo

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
real kicker with this thing it's a neo

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.940 
real kicker with this thing it's a neo
it's<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.989> neo<00:03:55.170> magnet<00:03:55.709> so<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.340> weight<00:03:56.609> is<00:03:57.950> it's

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
it's a neo magnet so the weight is it's

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.699 
it's a neo magnet so the weight is it's
nothing<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.549> weighs<00:03:59.760> a<00:04:00.150> little<00:04:00.510> over<00:04:00.690> 7<00:04:01.200> pounds

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
nothing it weighs a little over 7 pounds

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.280 
nothing it weighs a little over 7 pounds
to<00:04:02.190> put<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.459> in<00:04:02.579> perspective<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.840> speakers

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290

weighed<00:04:07.109> almost<00:04:07.319> 20<00:04:07.829> pounds<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.879> it's<00:04:09.620> less

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
weighed almost 20 pounds so it's less

than<00:04:10.829> half<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.040> weight<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.909> it's<00:04:12.060> easy<00:04:12.359> on<00:04:12.450> the

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
than half the weight so it's easy on the

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:28.710 
than half the weight so it's easy on the
shoulders<00:04:12.989> you'll<00:04:13.200> love<00:04:13.379> packing<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.859> around
