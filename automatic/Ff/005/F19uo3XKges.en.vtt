00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
like that guy and I figured it out

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.220 
like that guy and I figured it out
cuz<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.050> wasn't<00:02:07.290> shifting<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.890> all<00:02:08.400> I<00:02:09.230> figured

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
cuz I wasn't shifting at all I figured

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.170 
cuz I wasn't shifting at all I figured
out<00:02:11.600> xuxa<00:02:12.600> came<00:02:13.350> out<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> little<00:02:13.800> bit<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:15.000> goes

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
out xuxa came out a little bit it goes

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.340 
out xuxa came out a little bit it goes
back<00:02:15.510> there<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.660> think<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.140> everything
