how<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.670> serve<00:00:05.910> faster<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.479> tennis<00:00:06.840> I<00:00:07.130> get<00:00:08.130> that

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
how to serve faster in tennis I get that

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.119 
how to serve faster in tennis I get that
question<00:00:08.549> asked<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.540> me<00:00:09.750> all<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.440> time<00:00:10.469> by<00:00:10.920> my

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129 
question asked of me all the time by my

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.420 
question asked of me all the time by my
students<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.789> I<00:00:12.719> tell<00:00:12.959> them<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.199> it<00:00:13.770> takes<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
students and I tell them that it takes a

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.790 
students and I tell them that it takes a
lot<00:00:14.520> of<00:00:14.549> practice<00:00:14.969> okay<00:00:15.660> but<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> ingredients

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
lot of practice okay but the ingredients

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.609 
lot of practice okay but the ingredients
most<00:00:17.640> important<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.619> legs<00:00:19.999> the<00:00:20.999> grip<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
most important are the legs the grip and

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.519 
most important are the legs the grip and
the<00:00:22.619> racket<00:00:23.070> speed<00:00:23.429> okay<00:00:24.329> so<00:00:24.779> one<00:00:25.349> of<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the racket speed okay so one of the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.339 
the racket speed okay so one of the
ingredients<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.880> learning<00:00:27.839> how<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> serve

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
ingredients in learning how to serve

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
ingredients in learning how to serve
harder<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.089> using<00:00:30.089> your<00:00:30.239> legs<00:00:30.480> as<00:00:30.720> Springs

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
harder is using your legs as Springs

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.590 
harder is using your legs as Springs
that<00:00:32.009> gives<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> tremendous<00:00:32.880> amount<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that gives you a tremendous amount of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
that gives you a tremendous amount of
velocity<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.560> racket<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.070> thus<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
velocity on your racket and thus a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.110 
velocity on your racket and thus a
harder<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.510> faster<00:00:36.570> serve<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.190> I'll<00:00:38.640> let<00:00:38.850> Kirk

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
harder or faster serve so I'll let Kirk

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
harder or faster serve so I'll let Kirk
demonstrate<00:00:39.570> you'll<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> people

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
demonstrate you'll see a lot of people

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
demonstrate you'll see a lot of people
when<00:00:41.280> they<00:00:41.399> don't<00:00:41.609> serve<00:00:41.910> hard<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.690> don't

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
when they don't serve hard they don't

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
when they don't serve hard they don't
bend<00:00:43.260> their<00:00:43.530> legs<00:00:43.769> their<00:00:44.039> legs<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.460> very

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
bend their legs their legs are very

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.340 
bend their legs their legs are very
stiff<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.359> swing<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.199> their

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
stiff and they swing just from their

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
stiff and they swing just from their
upper<00:00:46.680> body<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:47.969> don't<00:00:48.210> generally

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
upper body see so they don't generally

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.959 
upper body see so they don't generally
have<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> strong<00:00:49.350> serve<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.460> demonstrate<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
have a strong serve so demonstrate a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.779 
have a strong serve so demonstrate a
server<00:00:51.870> without<00:00:52.199> bending<00:00:52.859> your<00:00:53.100> knees<00:00:53.429> okay

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
server without bending your knees okay

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.860 
server without bending your knees okay
right<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> face<00:00:56.399> too

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
right there and they make that face too

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.660 
right there and they make that face too
anyway<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.649> serve<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.370> going<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
anyway so that serve is not going to be

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.869 
anyway so that serve is not going to be
hard<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.289> learn<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.160> bend<00:01:02.429> your<00:01:02.699> knees

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
hard but if you learn to bend your knees

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
hard but if you learn to bend your knees
after<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.660> toss<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> ball<00:01:04.320> you've<00:01:04.620> become<00:01:04.980> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
after you toss the ball you've become a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.940 
after you toss the ball you've become a
spring<00:01:05.550> or<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> cat<00:01:06.600> ready<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.230> pounce<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.770> its

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
spring or a cat ready to pounce on its

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
spring or a cat ready to pounce on its
prey<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.820> you're<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> faster

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
prey then you're going to have a faster

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.600 
prey then you're going to have a faster
serve

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
serve

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.520

watch<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:11.790> Kirk<00:01:12.030> bends<00:01:12.329> and<00:01:12.689> now<00:01:13.200> he's<00:01:13.409> going

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
watch how Kirk bends and now he's going

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.609 
watch how Kirk bends and now he's going
to<00:01:13.590> jump<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.840> accelerate<00:01:15.840> his<00:01:16.110> racket

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to jump up and accelerate his racket

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
to jump up and accelerate his racket
through<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> ball<00:01:17.630> driving<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> legs

in<00:01:19.939> again<00:01:20.939> an<00:01:21.060> analogy<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.280> baseball<00:01:23.280> in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
in again an analogy I use is baseball in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.870 
in again an analogy I use is baseball in
baseball<00:01:24.270> pitchers<00:01:25.049> pitch<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:25.799> 95<00:01:26.430> miles<00:01:26.729> an

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
baseball pitchers pitch at 95 miles an

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.149 
baseball pitchers pitch at 95 miles an
hour<00:01:27.000> sometimes<00:01:27.329> but<00:01:27.960> most<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> power<00:01:28.829> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
hour sometimes but most of the power and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.210 
hour sometimes but most of the power and
pitching<00:01:29.549> comes<00:01:30.149> from<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> legs<00:01:30.930> okay<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
pitching comes from the legs okay the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
pitching comes from the legs okay the
other<00:01:32.250> thing<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.969> will<00:01:33.390> never<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
other thing that you will never have a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.950 
other thing that you will never have a
fast<00:01:34.619> serve<00:01:35.219> if<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.659> use<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
fast serve if you don't use a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.010 
fast serve if you don't use a
continental<00:01:37.770> grip<00:01:38.000> okay<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.869> could

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
continental grip okay you can you could

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.600 
continental grip okay you can you could
probably<00:01:40.259> hit<00:01:40.649> it<00:01:40.680> fast<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.219> it's<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.399> going

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
probably hit it fast but it's not going

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.850 
probably hit it fast but it's not going
to<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.969> very<00:01:42.240> often<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.079> must<00:01:43.530> remember

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
to go in very often so you must remember

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.240 
to go in very often so you must remember
that<00:01:44.640> on<00:01:45.000> any<00:01:45.450> serve<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.170> become<00:01:46.469> a<00:01:46.500> top<00:01:46.860> tennis

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that on any serve to become a top tennis

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.969 
that on any serve to become a top tennis
player<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.060> must<00:01:48.450> learn<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> Continental

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
player you must learn the Continental

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.880 
player you must learn the Continental
grip<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:51.090> absolute<00:01:51.570> okay<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
grip that's an absolute okay and the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.590 
grip that's an absolute okay and the
last<00:01:53.070> thing<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.729> say<00:01:53.909> about<00:01:54.180> hitting<00:01:54.539> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
last thing I want to say about hitting a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.020 
last thing I want to say about hitting a
faster<00:01:54.960> serve<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.890> most<00:01:56.520> people<00:01:56.640> think

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
faster serve is that most people think

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.510 
faster serve is that most people think
of<00:01:57.210> faster<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.930> they<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> stronger<00:01:59.070> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
of faster so they think of stronger so

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.039 
of faster so they think of stronger so
what<00:01:59.700> they<00:01:59.820> tend<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.719> want<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
what they tend to do when they want to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.380

finger<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.629> racket<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.680> he<00:02:23.890> was<00:02:24.040> able<00:02:24.580> to

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
finger on the racket so he was able to

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.940

he<00:02:27.160> couldn't<00:02:27.550> squeeze<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:28.330> he<00:02:28.510> wanted<00:02:28.930> to
