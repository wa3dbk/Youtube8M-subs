00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.750 
lose but at the same time you're not
really<00:03:39.080> being<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.470> active<00:03:40.100> force<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.640> you

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
really being that active force that you

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.630 
really being that active force that you
need<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.120> be<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:41.480> order<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.870> win<00:03:42.160> now<00:03:43.160> if<00:03:43.459> you

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
need to be in order to win now if you

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.790 
need to be in order to win now if you
win<00:03:43.760> by<00:03:43.910> say<00:03:44.150> 30<00:03:44.570> CS<00:03:44.900> imma<00:03:45.110> kill<00:03:45.290> that's<00:03:45.560> much

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
win by say 30 CS imma kill that's much

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.710 
win by say 30 CS imma kill that's much
better<00:03:46.040> that's<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.550> difference<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.940> 900<00:03:47.570> gold

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
better that's a difference of 900 gold

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.050 
better that's a difference of 900 gold
or<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.140> but<00:03:48.800> even<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.250> isn't<00:03:49.550> enough<00:03:49.820> to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
or so but even that isn't enough to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.150 
or so but even that isn't enough to
carry<00:03:50.270> a<00:03:50.360> game<00:03:50.690> your<00:03:51.290> direct<00:03:51.650> opponent<00:03:52.040> will

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
carry a game your direct opponent will

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.680 
carry a game your direct opponent will
still<00:03:52.520> be<00:03:52.700> able<00:03:52.820> to<00:03:53.000> beat<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:53.450> duels

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
still be able to beat you in duels

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.199 
still be able to beat you in duels
probably<00:03:54.290> as<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.800> 900<00:03:55.400> goal<00:03:55.520> difference<00:03:55.820> really

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
probably as a 900 goal difference really

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.900 
probably as a 900 goal difference really
isn't<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:56.690> much<00:03:57.070> now<00:03:58.070> let's<00:03:58.310> say<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.489> beat<00:03:58.730> my

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
isn't that much now let's say I beat my

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.390 
isn't that much now let's say I beat my
opponent<00:03:58.940> by<00:03:59.420> five<00:03:59.750> kills<00:04:00.170> 50<00:04:00.650> CS<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.160> take

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
opponent by five kills 50 CS and take

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.580 
opponent by five kills 50 CS and take
their<00:04:01.610> tower<00:04:01.820> in<00:04:02.120> Lane<00:04:02.330> that's<00:04:03.050> going<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.470> be<00:04:03.560> a

their tower in Lane that's going to be a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.250 
their tower in Lane that's going to be a
difference<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.130> about<00:04:04.720> 3,000<00:04:05.720> gold<00:04:05.900> if<00:04:06.140> you

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
difference of about 3,000 gold if you

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.229 
difference of about 3,000 gold if you
account<00:04:06.560> for<00:04:06.620> debt<00:04:06.890> streets<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.489> factor<00:04:08.150> in
