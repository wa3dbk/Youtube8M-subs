can see um show you the browser is very

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.160 
can see um show you the browser is very
smooth<00:02:07.429> it's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.519> very<00:02:08.819> usable<00:02:09.539> room<00:02:09.780> even

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
smooth it's a very usable room even

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.190 
smooth it's a very usable room even
though<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.829> an<00:02:10.979> alpha<00:02:11.430> version<00:02:12.200> but

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
though this is like an alpha version but

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020 
though this is like an alpha version but
everything<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.860> pretty<00:02:14.099> much<00:02:14.190> working<00:02:14.519> Wi-Fi

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
everything is pretty much working Wi-Fi

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.530 
everything is pretty much working Wi-Fi
is<00:02:15.090> working<00:02:15.209> bluetooth<00:02:16.079> is<00:02:16.319> working<00:02:16.829> just<00:02:17.540> a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
is working bluetooth is working just a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.960 
is working bluetooth is working just a
slightly<00:02:19.170> laggy<00:02:19.709> but<00:02:19.920> um<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.730> one<00:02:20.940> doesn't

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
slightly laggy but um this one doesn't

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.009 
slightly laggy but um this one doesn't
have<00:02:22.310> let<00:02:23.310> me<00:02:23.400> see<00:02:23.640> here<00:02:23.849> no<00:02:25.340> no<00:02:26.340> Wi-Fi<00:02:26.760> uh<00:02:27.019> no

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
have let me see here no no Wi-Fi uh no

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.120 
have let me see here no no Wi-Fi uh no
overclocking<00:02:28.349> but<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:28.829> can<00:02:28.950> go<00:02:29.069> to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
overclocking but you can go to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.930 
overclocking but you can go to
performance<00:02:30.500> okay<00:02:32.900> processor<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:35.430> I've<00:02:35.670> got

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
performance okay processor and I've got

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.629 
performance okay processor and I've got
it<00:02:36.060> set<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.540> interactive<00:02:37.230> X<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.799> maximum

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
it set it at interactive X and maximum

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.319 
it set it at interactive X and maximum
frequencies<00:02:39.269> only<00:02:39.799> one<00:02:40.799> gig<00:02:41.069> but<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.400> think<00:02:41.730> in

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
frequencies only one gig but I think in

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.569 
frequencies only one gig but I think in
the<00:02:42.420> future<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.989> should<00:02:43.170> have<00:02:43.350> a

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
the future we should have a

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.670 
the future we should have a
overclockable<00:02:44.579> kernels<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.359> maybe<00:02:46.139> you<00:02:46.500> can

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
overclockable kernels and maybe you can

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.920 
overclockable kernels and maybe you can
run<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.920> at<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:47.489> point<00:02:47.670> two<00:02:48.150> or<00:02:48.329> one<00:02:48.480> point<00:02:48.690> 4

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
run it at one point two or one point 4

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.920 
run it at one point two or one point 4
gigahertz<00:02:49.400> overclock<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.670> should<00:02:51.420> run<00:02:51.690> much

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
gigahertz overclock it should run much

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.559 
gigahertz overclock it should run much
smoother<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.799> mean<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.639> by<00:02:53.790> itself<00:02:54.239> it's

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
smoother but I mean just by itself it's

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.650 
smoother but I mean just by itself it's
actually<00:02:55.230> pretty<00:02:55.530> smooth<00:02:56.389> other<00:02:57.389> than<00:02:57.600> that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
actually pretty smooth other than that

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.900 
actually pretty smooth other than that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.870 
it's a full ICS experience you can get
let<00:03:02.910> me<00:03:03.000> check<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.799> check<00:03:04.799> their<00:03:05.160> face<00:03:05.670> on

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
let me check the check their face on

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.449 
let me check the check their face on
lock<00:03:06.120> real<00:03:06.540> quick<00:03:07.519> then<00:03:08.519> face<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.090> lock<00:03:09.299> oh

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
lock real quick then face on lock oh

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.640 
lock real quick then face on lock oh
there<00:03:11.459> isn't<00:03:11.639> face<00:03:12.000> on<00:03:12.209> lock<00:03:12.389> so<00:03:13.049> let<00:03:13.260> me<00:03:13.319> set

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
there isn't face on lock so let me set

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:23.970 
there isn't face on lock so let me set
it<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.950> real<00:03:14.160> quick<00:03:14.959> here<00:03:16.880> okay<00:03:17.880> there<00:03:18.329> we<00:03:18.419> go

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.869 

let's<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.580> Lighting's<00:03:26.000> kind<00:03:26.090> of<00:03:26.360> off<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.730> can

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
let's the Lighting's kind of off you can

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.850 
let's the Lighting's kind of off you can
try<00:03:29.090> yourself<00:03:29.300> but<00:03:29.930> actually<00:03:30.319> let<00:03:30.560> me<00:03:30.650> do<00:03:30.830> it

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
try yourself but actually let me do it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.720 
try yourself but actually let me do it
real<00:03:31.069> call<00:03:31.250> be<00:03:31.400> right<00:03:31.550> back<00:03:32.980> so<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.010> got<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.489> set

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
real call be right back so I got it set

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.470 
real call be right back so I got it set
up<00:03:34.879> but<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.629> seems<00:03:35.900> like<00:03:36.110> it's<00:03:36.290> not<00:03:37.480> working

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
up but it seems like it's not working

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.759 
up but it seems like it's not working
that<00:03:38.510> well<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.870> think<00:03:39.080> it's<00:03:39.349> because<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
that well I think it's because the

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.520 
that well I think it's because the
processor<00:03:40.340> is<00:03:40.370> way<00:03:40.790> too<00:03:40.849> slow<00:03:41.330> armed<00:03:41.989> with

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
processor is way too slow armed with

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.100 
processor is way too slow armed with
overclocked<00:03:43.220> face<00:03:43.519> unlock<00:03:44.090> should<00:03:44.510> work<00:03:44.780> much

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
overclocked face unlock should work much

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.030 
overclocked face unlock should work much
better<00:03:46.959> let<00:03:47.959> me<00:03:48.080> see<00:03:48.290> if<00:03:48.349> there's<00:03:48.590> any<00:03:48.799> other

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
better let me see if there's any other

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:57.300 
better let me see if there's any other
