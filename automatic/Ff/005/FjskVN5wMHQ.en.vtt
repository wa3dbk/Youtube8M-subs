00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
going to be in the game I think it's

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280 
going to be in the game I think it's
actually<00:01:30.550> more<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:31.150> do<00:01:31.300> with<00:01:31.420> discussion

actually more to do with discussion

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.420 
actually more to do with discussion
generation<00:01:32.770> they<00:01:32.890> want<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.100> get<00:01:33.160> people

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
generation they want to get people

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.040 
generation they want to get people
talking<00:01:33.790> about<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.270> game<00:01:34.450> which<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.900> exactly

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
talking about the game which is exactly

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.350 
talking about the game which is exactly
what<00:01:35.860> they're<00:01:36.040> doing<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.430> don't<00:01:37.000> think<00:01:37.090> it's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
what they're doing I don't think it's

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.310 
what they're doing I don't think it's
necessarily<00:01:37.840> going<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.080> be<00:01:38.140> anything

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
necessarily going to be anything

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.900 
necessarily going to be anything
specific<00:01:38.920> saying<00:01:39.160> this<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.640> what<00:01:39.790> you're

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
specific saying this is what you're

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.070 
specific saying this is what you're
getting<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> game<00:01:40.390> we've<00:01:40.720> seen<00:01:40.930> before

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
getting in the game we've seen before

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.719 
getting in the game we've seen before
that<00:01:41.380> they<00:01:41.470> put<00:01:41.650> things<00:01:41.890> out<00:01:42.010> there<00:01:42.220> images

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
that they put things out there images

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.600 
that they put things out there images
artwork<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:44.020> never<00:01:44.229> materializes<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:45.580> I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
artwork and it never materializes so I

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.250 
artwork and it never materializes so I
don't<00:01:46.240> think<00:01:46.420> this<00:01:46.600> is<00:01:46.660> any<00:01:46.900> direct

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
don't think this is any direct

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
don't think this is any direct
indication<00:01:47.710> of<00:01:47.920> what<00:01:48.040> you're<00:01:48.160> necessarily

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
indication of what you're necessarily

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.920 
indication of what you're necessarily
going<00:01:48.760> to<00:01:48.850> see<00:01:48.970> in<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.150> game<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:49.510> think<00:01:49.840> it's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
going to see in the game I think it's

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
going to see in the game I think it's
much<00:01:50.080> more<00:01:50.320> kind<00:01:50.619> of<00:01:50.770> marketing<00:01:51.190> exercise<00:01:51.520> of

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
much more kind of marketing exercise of

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.100 
much more kind of marketing exercise of
trying<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.150> get<00:01:52.210> people<00:01:52.450> discussing<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.960> game

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
trying to get people discussing the game

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.359 
trying to get people discussing the game
which<00:01:53.259> let's<00:01:53.440> face<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:54.009> not<00:01:54.340> very

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
which let's face it is not very

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.969 
which let's face it is not very
difficult<00:01:54.580> to<00:01:55.060> do<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:56.259> propeller<00:01:56.619> there<00:01:56.860> a

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
difficult to do the propeller there a

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.139 
difficult to do the propeller there a
lot<00:01:57.160> of<00:01:57.220> people<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.520> already<00:01:57.640> been<00:01:57.880> saying

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
lot of people have already been saying

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.910 
lot of people have already been saying
that<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.570> size<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.110> doesn't<00:01:59.380> relate<00:01:59.649> to<00:01:59.890> a

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
that the size of it doesn't relate to a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
submarine it would be too small props

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.480 
submarine it would be too small props
too<00:02:01.660> small<00:02:01.960> at<00:02:02.080> such<00:02:02.259> etc<00:02:02.770> it's<00:02:03.130> entirely

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
too small at such etc it's entirely

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.400 
too small at such etc it's entirely
possible<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.300> one<00:02:04.660> thing<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:04.960> I<00:02:05.020> do<00:02:05.080> think

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
possible and one thing that I do think

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.960 
of thing that mean does go done before
well<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.619> think<00:02:08.770> about<00:02:08.890> okay<00:02:09.280> they<00:02:09.729> haven't

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
well you think about okay they haven't

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.700 
well you think about okay they haven't
told<00:02:10.090> us<00:02:10.240> but<00:02:10.420> what<00:02:10.570> would<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:10.840> interesting<00:02:10.990> ok

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
told us but what would be interesting ok

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.840 
told us but what would be interesting ok
I<00:02:11.740> mean<00:02:11.830> if<00:02:12.070> they<00:02:12.190> were<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.430> have<00:02:12.580> naval

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
I mean if they were going to have naval

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.340 
I mean if they were going to have naval
combat<00:02:13.000> how<00:02:13.240> would<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.510> work<00:02:13.570> in<00:02:13.990> terms<00:02:14.200> of

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
combat how would that work in terms of

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.690 
combat how would that work in terms of
gameplay<00:02:14.590> mechanics<00:02:15.220> how<00:02:15.340> would<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:15.550> actually

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
gameplay mechanics how would it actually

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.640 
gameplay mechanics how would it actually
work<00:02:16.060> how<00:02:16.240> did<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.420> relate<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.960> game<00:02:17.140> think

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
work how did it relate to the game think

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.870 
work how did it relate to the game think
about<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.920> that's<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.490> kind<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.670> thing<00:02:18.819> I'm

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
about that that's the kind of thing I'm

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.610 
about that that's the kind of thing I'm
interested<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.480> mean<00:02:20.080> could<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.319> be<00:02:20.470> for

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
interested in I mean could it be for

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.350 
interested in I mean could it be for
example<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:21.010> torpedo<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.700> they<00:02:21.819> do<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.150> some

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
example a torpedo if they do have some

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.550 
example a torpedo if they do have some
kind<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.569> naval<00:02:22.900> missile<00:02:23.200> people<00:02:23.470> have

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
kind of naval missile people have

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.020 
kind of naval missile people have
suggested<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:24.100> could<00:02:24.130> be<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.430> there<00:02:24.850> are

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
suggested it could be that there are

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.610 
suggested it could be that there are
torpedoes<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:26.020> you<00:02:26.080> can<00:02:26.200> drop<00:02:26.410> from

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
torpedoes that you can drop from

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.930 
torpedoes that you can drop from
vehicles<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.460> image<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.790> see

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
vehicles like this in the image you see

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.910 
vehicles like this in the image you see
here<00:02:28.150> while<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> helicopter<00:02:28.840> drop<00:02:29.710> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
here while you have a helicopter drop it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.350 
here while you have a helicopter drop it
into<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.280> water<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.819> as<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.060> hits<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.330> water

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
into the water and as it hits the water

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.210 
into the water and as it hits the water
it<00:02:31.600> becomes<00:02:31.720> live<00:02:32.170> some<00:02:32.680> kind<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:32.920> locking

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it becomes live some kind of locking

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.370 
it becomes live some kind of locking
feature<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:34.420> anyway<00:02:34.690> just<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.080> couple<00:02:35.260> of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
feature so anyway just a couple of

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.900 
feature so anyway just a couple of
thoughts<00:02:35.500> today<00:02:35.740> guys<00:02:36.010> but<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.400> had<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.790> put
