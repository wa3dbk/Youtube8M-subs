between there so you got to go through
and<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.250> feel<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:44.610> those<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.000> I've<00:00:45.420> quickly

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and to feel all those in I've quickly

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.310 
and to feel all those in I've quickly
cut<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.280> styled<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.850> only<00:00:48.510> door<00:00:48.899> fairly

short<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.950> i<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> toddlers<00:00:51.120> with

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
short because i like the toddlers with

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.970 
short because i like the toddlers with
the<00:00:51.449> short<00:00:51.690> hair<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.649> looks<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the short hair I think it just looks a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.529 
the short hair I think it just looks a
bit<00:00:53.070> more<00:00:53.129> realistic<00:00:53.579> compared<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.390> having

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
bit more realistic compared to having

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
bit more realistic compared to having
and<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.410> toddlers<00:00:55.710> would<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.370> long<00:00:56.550> hair

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and the toddlers would really long hair

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.599 
and the toddlers would really long hair
pattern<00:00:58.250> that's<00:00:59.250> her<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.960> um<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:02.070> thought<00:01:02.489> I'd

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
pattern that's her and um I thought I'd

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.609 
pattern that's her and um I thought I'd
show<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.760> how<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> hair<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
sock with rice and heats it up in the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.609 
sock with rice and heats it up in the
microwave<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.240> minutes

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
microwave for about one to two minutes

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.749 
microwave for about one to two minutes
that<00:01:58.619> keeps<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> head<00:01:59.070> nice<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.280> warm<00:01:59.579> and

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759

the<00:02:01.590> rice<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.250> actually<00:02:02.430> will<00:02:02.810> make

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the rice because it actually will make

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
the rice because it actually will make
your<00:02:03.990> hair<00:02:04.280> smell<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:06.119> how<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:07.310> warm<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.399> my

your hair smell that's how I warm up my
heads<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.060> sort<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.599> what<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> use<00:02:10.080> when<00:02:10.349> I'm

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
