 matifying the brand ares of oneself I 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.840
 you had already talked about fanatics 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.580
 it's really a super serum if you 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.250
 have shiny skin and then 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.580
 I apply a day cream of the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.980
 Mark 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.350
 hydra flora and that is organic so when 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.590
 goes into the cage game reapply my 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.270

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.780
 as a medium that I have since the year 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.250

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.200
 good with my tan my tan complexion 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.850
 right now then I apply my 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.080
 corrector d at revlon so always 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.010
 a shade more than I put 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.590
 usually because I have 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.560
 yes during the holidays inquiry and I 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.480
 come and melt it all with a brush of 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.920
 technical g uro I recommend you 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.870
 we often ask that they pass 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.850
 order for me the best ones are 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.650
 really the real technique without hesitation 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.780
 I then apply my powder from 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.720
 make up for ever and then I go 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.130
 applied from the browser to the hollow but plays 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.110
 to dig a little but play well 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.330
 only on the front where I would have bronze 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.430
 and of course then I apply some 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.130
 blush so in peach tones a little 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.240
 little and I just apply it 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.100
 on my cheekbones 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.510
 then I go to the leiter so I 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.410
 apply there at the top of my cheekbones 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.170
 all delicately 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.100
 then I will take a beige lighthouse 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.710
 iridescent 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.630
 for starters I'm going to apply on 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.370
 all the eyelid mobile so well in 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.760
 from the inside corner to the corner 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.530
 external and then I'll go back through 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.030
 on it with a Belgian blush 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 but this time not iridescent at all 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.630
 to really step up and I'm not going 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.180
 stop coming to come and go 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.760
 identify each time there I take the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.959
 nooner lighthouse which is a ride I'm going 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.459
 to put me back in the hollow of my 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.130
 eyelids so that's going to be a makeup 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.890
 very discreet for a wedding we thought 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.560
 make a smoky black momentum something 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.110
 really very natural and discreet of 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.390
 game apply it several times as I 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.330
 told you we're going to go we'll do 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.989
 Come on, we're not going to say that 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.220
 should put beige and dark 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.740
 until we have a result 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.900
 that we want then we applied 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.690
 mascara up and down me this is the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.580
 too faced that I love for months and 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.840
 then I apply a gloss from nyx 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.190
 I will put you the reference in 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.380
 the info because I remember it more 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.020
 it would be too good there are sub 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.790
 beige a little bit and then I come 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.400
 draw my eyebrows with the kit to 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.240
 eyebrows from elf in the shade the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.010
 clearer and here is the result 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.900
 then we go to hair with the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.310
 stim mates from l'oréal objects that 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.930

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.590
 water that so you fill it with 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.080
 your cock and then you do 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.900
 heat to the desired temperature me 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.790

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.620
