it<00:00:28.070> everywhere<00:00:29.300> but<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> don't<00:00:30.539> think<00:00:30.750> there's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it everywhere but I don't think there's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500 
it everywhere but I don't think there's
a<00:00:30.990> car<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.470> exists<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.820> unless<00:00:33.180> it's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
a car that exists like this unless it's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.220

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
on a racetrack which I think it is I

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.389

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the hill but it doesn't matter to me you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.820 
the hill but it doesn't matter to me you
want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.409> why<00:02:07.759> because

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
want to know why because

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.890 
want to know why because
the<00:02:09.860> front<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.220> car<00:02:10.490> can<00:02:10.940> act<00:02:11.360> as<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.660> heel

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
the front of the car can act as a heel

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.630 
the front of the car can act as a heel
so<00:02:12.380> he<00:02:12.560> doesn't<00:02:12.710> lose<00:02:12.920> any<00:02:13.130> balance

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
so he doesn't lose any balance

whichever you want to call it you also i

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.970 
whichever you want to call it you also i
was<00:03:09.230> ankle<00:03:09.650> articulation<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.620> only<00:03:12.709> place

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
was ankle articulation so the only place

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.890 
was ankle articulation so the only place
he<00:03:13.130> doesn't<00:03:13.490> have<00:03:13.640> articulation<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.660> he
