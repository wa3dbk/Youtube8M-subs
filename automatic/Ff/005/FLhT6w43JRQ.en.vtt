 reached 85 chamomile who has magnificent 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.980
 yellow it's really a very color 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.989
 practical for dart because we do not 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 not necessarily everywhere I have 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.440
 then the hue 84 that the turkey to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.440
 mantles 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.039
 she is beautiful too she pulls a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.600
 little here on the mint and it's really 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.210
 a very trendy color for this 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.729
 spring-summer 2015 I then catane 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 for the euro 83 which is a blue she 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.110
 is called myosotis and is slightly 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.600
 metallized I find it very very put my 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.160
 favorite on the 5 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.209
 I then have table 82 which is 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.569
 the poppies attack and the injury 81 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:23.369
 who reaches Phrygian often sees 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.709
 fuzzy colors that gives the pep for 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.660
 the spring-summer 2015 I love them 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.099
 I really do the alternations moment 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.080
 I really like putting them in manicure 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:32.190
 very simple where is the art like the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.849
 two that I'm going to show you everything from 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.319
 Following the first tutorial is inspired by 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.580
 bottles of arizona that I find 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.289
 really beautiful 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.000
 I think above all a base and a 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.560
 white polish so as to bring out 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.929
 the colors thereafter 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.520
 I then use the hue 84 of 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.470
 latest live beauty and I pose it on 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.470
 all my nails I let dry then 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.390
 for the next step which is the one 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.610
 branches of the tree I take a 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.170
 brown varnish a tooth cure and I have 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.800
 more than to draw thin branches on 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.800
 one of my roles 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.829
 I then take the head 79 and I 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.629
 pose by small dots three ends 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.959
 branches so as to make 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.790
 little cherry blossoms finally 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.950
 I use to reach 80 to bring a 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.239
 second color to the flowers I mail it 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.530
 by small dot that I pulled then 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.620
 to make them look more like 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.040
 petals I finalize with top coat and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.040
 It's over 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.230
 the second if everything was a gradient 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.000
 very colorful where I also start 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.799
 with a white base you will also have 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.989
 need a sponge of this type 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.480
 I start by asking the dull cam have 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.980
 put on a plasticized surface I trace 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.750
 a pretty thick line and I 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.400
 then repeat the same thing with the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.650
 poppy hue that I'm just asking to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.629
 side I ask them on the last one he 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.910
 then just tap my fingernail to 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.129
 get it down and think about moving 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.870
 lightly sponge on the nail to 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.480
 not have big demarcation and that 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.920
 it's really a nice gradient 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.480
 I start again on the same angle I 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.890
 really prefer to put two layers on 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 chacon for this opaque 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.130
 now I have the surplus of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.730
 varnish with a cotton swab and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.920
 remover 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.390
 and finally I finish putting on top coat 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.420
 on each nail for the varnish 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.920
 chains longer and it's over 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.660
