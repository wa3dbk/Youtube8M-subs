00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 There are four new smartphones from archos 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.649
 to admire in barcelona here we have 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.990
 now all in stock I'll go with you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.750
 From the left you start with the biggest one 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.990
 the 64 xenon this is my new one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.340
 Favorite schnitzel music 6.4 inches ips 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.810
 display 199 euro available from april the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 But sometimes I find an announcement for this 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.170
 of course there is of course also clear 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.580
 that you do not do it all the finest 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.580
 For example, what does that get 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.560
 Display resolution 120 x 1280, it relates to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.219
 pixel is not a new rekorde on 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.200
 completely clear 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.260
 but as you can easily see 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.090
 First, very good contrasts ips and it 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070
 is still very readable everything 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.719
 so i believe for all i say 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.730
 would like to have a large display 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.110
 but he is a little purse 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 I think a nice solution to that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.629
 especially motto processor mediatek 13 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.870
 gigahertz and above all things it is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.440
 dual sim as with almost all devices of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.539
 archos that at least come without the lte 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 are then always with dual sim and in 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.359
 the case I can also again on the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.589
 I like the back 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.659
 that's really good 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.030
 on the one hand the very nice idea here 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.189
 these mechanical buttons on the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 shift back because if I do that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.670
 device with one hand at least keep up 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.350
 I always have the left on the left anyway 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.299
 index finger here in the area that is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 So quickly turned on and off 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.960
 it is a bit problematic 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.520
 but with rightful encounter because 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.780
 I have to stop with the somehow 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.310
 thumb therefore easy to get used to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.750
 keep simple link with left with 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.159
 operate right when most 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.490
 probably anyway I think 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.500
 times 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.759
 and the other of this metallic effect 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.930
 I hope I can do this now 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.490
 a little bit easy with these 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.750
 I like the light conditions 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.000
 extremely good, although of course 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.920
 But plastic is even one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 structure tries that one time 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.049
 a bit to the microphone I hold 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.049
 Hope you hear something 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 So he really has it handy 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.470
 structured so that does not just look that way 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.060
 that's how it feels 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.910
 terrific and united is natural 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.650
 also very valuable with it and always man 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.170
 can also make the back off me 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.790
 have replaceable battery 2800 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.860
 milliard hours at the place 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.740
 four gigabytes of internal memory and all 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.380
 are expandable with memory cards with 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.270
 up to 64gb 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.370
 which I also briefly mention 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.710
 should be the start also for all me 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.760
 I think I have killed here now 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.760
 let's just do it with the next 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.530
 that's the 50 helium 4g that's it 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.030
 always with all devices of rechargeable batteries 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.650
 is about native android 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.300
 that means there is nothing changed now 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.400
 been on the surface as you can see 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.690
 So basically nexus devices offer 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.610
 Receiving archos and me from google 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.200
 directly and accordingly she that he 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.940
 namely great with the updates 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.100
 most are coming here now 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.380
 android 4 2 or 4 3 but one said 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.750
 apart from the very small ones there 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.120
 not sure yet that all definitely 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.890
 android 44 kitkat are getting and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.030
 even before anything has an appointment 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.400
 I think that's what I think 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.440
 In fact, in June, it should be 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.330
 so far that then android 4 4 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.519
 delivered has just a bit 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.080
 to the specifications here from the 50th 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.690
 helium 4 g 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.540
 there is something to do with the first one 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.820
 lte 4g gets said already everything 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.390
 therefore, in the case, exceptionally, no 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.690
 dual core 5 inch frosted glass again with 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.450
 720 x 480 pixel snapdragon 400 processor 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.790
 that is four cores 1 2 gigahertz 1 gb 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.920
 Memory eight gigabytes in the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.870
 fall and expandable again 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.870
 the data memory by means of card 8 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.940
 megapixel camera and two megapixels 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.959
 camera on the front and now comes the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.550
 Price and I think that's right 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.370
 Chic for down with this one 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.030
 Design price I think is terrific 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.370
 namely 229 euros without a contract included 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.870
 Steer with all the trimmings for his 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.120
 That's what a nice design is 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.739
 Everything offers what you have inclusive 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.820
 I believe that you have a fight message and 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.050
 Above all, I would like to ask again 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.480
 demonstrate that though all of them 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.390
 relatively thin and shallow and small 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.040
 Nevertheless, very sturdily built there are so 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.020
 Definitely not from one 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.270
 cheap device or rather talk so 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.090
 also that makes in very good first 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.090
 impression that 50-year-old 4g so now 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.130
 we come to the smallest 540 b shows 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.920
 Eni this is my little friend 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.120
 I really love that 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.000
 ergonomically writes has only a 4 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.970
 inch display so that's the iphone 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.590
 category 480 800 pixels at the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.959
 opportunity but that's just right 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.380
 nice narrow is great in the hand 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.550
 pleasantly small flat easily sees find 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.080
 I'm also very good at something like that 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.000
 stereo speakers here above and below 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.320
 built so that for the music lovers 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.370
 So I like it completely 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.130
 excellent and above all things 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.290
 I like the price 130 euro scarce 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.640
 should cost and start now 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.890
 March be available 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.260
 Well, of course, now only a dual has a good one 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.360
 core processor with 1.3 gigahertz and now 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.690
 five instead of eight megapixel camera my 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.220
 God 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.440
 but most of all, I wanted her 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.830
 show again even if it makes sense 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.190
 Has 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.630
 because you have the times but briefly show the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.980
 I find it exciting at this point 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.240
 and most of all you should maybe too 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.669
 I need two here 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.850
 different sim-cards sizes namely 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:06.330
 The big so the mini is also with 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.490
 umts-support 3g up here the 2g 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.710
 the small micro card is only then 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.850
 for gsm that means there you have to 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.980
 then according to already equal 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.620
 Justify that you use the device 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.150
 can this at 130 euro I think can 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.160
 one as necessary, again in 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.900
 appropriate conversion of the seaport 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.250
 So invest really chic 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.800
 I really like history at the moment 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.540
 very good 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.470
 and last but not least, my special one 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.600
 friend over here the 50 c oxygen because 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.040
 That's one of the first I have to 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.830
 say I just had one 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.919
 first of all almost the first one in now 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.600
 rather randomly from the chronological sequence 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.190
 core processor that means I have eight 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.620
 No, and now I have my mobile phone 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.310
 no longer built from eight cores 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.030
 with a total of 17 gigahertz are the 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.130
 clocked 5 inch display ips unfortunately 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.410
 god's not full hd my god oh well 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.970
 but there I can say the price 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.870
 The price also comforts 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.980
 bit because with 229 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.560
 euro non-binding price recommendation 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.090
 ie that means street price is 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.260
 probably so fast around the 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.610
 200 euros are 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.030
 that's why i think so too 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.430
 with 720p loose live again this 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.740
 Again, this native android like you 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.100
 knows time as is already shown 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.330
 have 2000 milliamps battery and 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.830
 Above all, things are very good for me here 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.080
 like this is this optics the 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.550
 Construction with this knew here and that 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:33.100
 is just x 74 mm flat 240 grams 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.180
 So a real crispbread and by the way 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.530
 where I just need the very here 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.600
 of course, say 8 megapixels again 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.170
 Camera on the back 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.610
 Of course you almost have to 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.320
 say and here I just want to 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.660
 but demonstrate because it's just so thin 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.830
 is that this thing is simply stable 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.780
 So if that's me this way 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.430
 connect the one sees there expresses itself 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.640
 nothing is astute about that 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.690
 also built very solid from 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.000
 the quality 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.980
 here again that said no lte that 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.750
 Lisa Beyer had this exception for that 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.590
 I'm duell corp but again here 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.720
 the dual cell hsdpa that is up to 42 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.470
 megabit per second in the download in 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.860
 umts-netzen so that was now that the 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.940
 quadriga here from archos in the fall 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.940
 the mobile world congress in barcelona
