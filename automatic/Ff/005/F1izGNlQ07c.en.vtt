directly above our heads are the
vertical<00:01:40.860> 2x4<00:01:41.640> members<00:01:42.420> we've<00:01:42.600> installed

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
vertical 2x4 members we've installed

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.929

the lower quarter of the trusses from

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
the lower quarter of the trusses from
breaking<00:01:49.439> okay<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.490> these

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
breaking okay and then you have these

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.429 
breaking okay and then you have these
these<00:01:51.180> parallel<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.960> these<00:01:52.110> perpendicular

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
these parallel are these perpendicular

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
these parallel are these perpendicular

the<00:02:07.590> most<00:02:07.799> exciting<00:02:08.369> thing<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:08.640> happened

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the most exciting thing that's happened

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
the most exciting thing that's happened
is<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.720> overhead<00:02:10.049> track<00:02:10.350> system<00:02:10.799> has

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
is that the overhead track system has

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.640 
is that the overhead track system has
been<00:02:11.160> installed<00:02:11.810> about<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> month<00:02:13.290> after<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
blocking that was put in rough rainy

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.979 
blocking that was put in rough rainy
they<00:02:21.129> first<00:02:21.489> had<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.849> lay<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.209> out<00:02:22.330> again<00:02:22.720> and

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
they first had to lay it out again and

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.080 
they first had to lay it out again and
mark<00:02:23.319> on<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.709> floor<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.250> location<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:24.879> bolt

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
mark on the floor the location of a bolt

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.600 
mark on the floor the location of a bolt
holes<00:02:25.360> then<00:02:26.200> they<00:02:26.349> used<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.709> neat<00:02:26.950> little<00:02:27.159> laser

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
holes then they used a neat little laser

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.030 
holes then they used a neat little laser
level<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> shot<00:02:28.569> plumb<00:02:29.049> line<00:02:29.349> straight<00:02:30.010> up

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
level that shot plumb line straight up

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.250 
level that shot plumb line straight up
this<00:02:30.700> allowed<00:02:31.060> us<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.269> mark<00:02:31.629> where<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:31.900> bolt

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
this allowed us to mark where the bolt

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.080 
this allowed us to mark where the bolt
holes<00:02:32.560> should<00:02:32.890> fall<00:02:33.099> on<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> ceiling<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
holes should fall on the ceiling the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.059 
holes should fall on the ceiling the
goal<00:02:34.299> then<00:02:34.780> we<00:02:34.959> could<00:02:35.110> lift<00:02:35.319> up<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> piece<00:02:35.890> of

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
goal then we could lift up the piece of

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.550 
goal then we could lift up the piece of
track<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.849> made<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.750> up<00:02:37.870> with<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.080> previous

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
track and made it up with a previous

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.009 
track and made it up with a previous
section<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.879> used<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.239> marks<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:40.720> had<00:02:40.840> just

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
section we used the marks we had just

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.720 
section we used the marks we had just
made<00:02:41.200> on<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.470> ceiling<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> position<00:02:42.610> the

made on the ceiling to position the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.180 
made on the ceiling to position the
bracket<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.870> we<00:02:44.260> secured<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.860> into<00:02:45.099> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
bracket and we secured it into the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.830 
bracket and we secured it into the
blocking<00:02:45.640> we<00:02:45.790> had<00:02:45.909> seen<00:02:46.120> them<00:02:46.239> install<00:02:46.599> on<00:02:46.810> our

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
blocking we had seen them install on our

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.470 
blocking we had seen them install on our
first<00:02:47.170> visit<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.489> work<00:02:48.700> seemed<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.060> go<00:02:49.180> pretty

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
first visit the work seemed to go pretty

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.360 
first visit the work seemed to go pretty
smoothly<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.290> wasn't<00:02:50.470> long<00:02:50.739> before<00:02:50.769> we

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
smoothly and it wasn't long before we

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.990 
smoothly and it wasn't long before we
were<00:02:51.489> putting<00:02:51.760> up<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.090> last<00:02:52.299> couple<00:02:52.480> sections

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
were putting up the last couple sections

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.729 
were putting up the last couple sections
this<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.329> unit<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.780> runs<00:02:56.049> on<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> track

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
this is the unit that runs on the track

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.250 
this is the unit that runs on the track
there's<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.519> motor<00:02:57.849> and<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.239> big<00:02:58.480> rechargeable

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
there's a motor and a big rechargeable

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.349 
there's a motor and a big rechargeable
battery<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.799> housing<00:03:00.160> up<00:03:00.280> there<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:01.180> way

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
battery in the housing up there the way

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.809 
battery in the housing up there the way
I<00:03:01.390> understand<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.379> is<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:02.760> there's<00:03:03.760> a

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
I understand this is that there's a

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.550 
I understand this is that there's a
charger<00:03:04.329> here<00:03:04.599> that's<00:03:04.840> plugged<00:03:05.140> into<00:03:05.349> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
charger here that's plugged into the

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.610 
charger here that's plugged into the
wall<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.099> then<00:03:06.670> wires<00:03:07.180> run<00:03:07.569> from<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.079> charger

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
wall and then wires run from the charger

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.220 
wall and then wires run from the charger
up<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.310> these<00:03:09.459> contacts<00:03:10.209> alongside<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.989> track

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
up to these contacts alongside the track

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.650 
up to these contacts alongside the track
so<00:03:11.950> when<00:03:12.129> the<00:03:12.250> unit<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.760> backed<00:03:13.120> up<00:03:13.329> into<00:03:13.510> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
so when the unit is backed up into the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.750 
so when the unit is backed up into the
corner<00:03:14.049> those<00:03:14.230> contacts<00:03:14.829> will<00:03:15.069> charge<00:03:15.400> up<00:03:15.609> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
corner those contacts will charge up the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.970 
corner those contacts will charge up the
battery<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.329> then<00:03:16.989> when<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.260> unit<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.709> out<00:03:17.829> of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
battery and then when the unit is out of

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.250 
battery and then when the unit is out of
the<00:03:18.069> track<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.819> same<00:03:19.269> battery<00:03:19.750> provides

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
the track that same battery provides

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.830 
the track that same battery provides
power<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.459> turntables<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.359> the<00:03:22.450> switches

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
power to the turntables and the switches

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.930 
power to the turntables and the switches
so<00:03:22.989> there's<00:03:23.169> no<00:03:23.410> power<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:24.370> runs<00:03:24.639> through

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
so there's no power that runs through
