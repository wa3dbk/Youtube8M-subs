00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
gardens and and when I was first

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.870 
gardens and and when I was first
learning<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.590> stuff<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.430> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
learning about this stuff I just got so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.970 
learning about this stuff I just got so
interested<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.600> how<00:00:36.840> different<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.649> then

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
interested in how different it was then

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.720 
interested in how different it was then
kind<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> conventional<00:00:39.809> gardening

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
kind of the conventional gardening

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.910 
kind of the conventional gardening
paradigm<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> grew<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.379> like<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
paradigm that I grew up with like like I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.130 
paradigm that I grew up with like like I
learned<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> organic<00:00:44.640> gardening<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.210> we

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
learned in organic gardening that we

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.950 
learned in organic gardening that we
don't<00:00:46.320> view<00:00:46.559> Athens<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.250> pests<00:00:47.910> or<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.629> bad

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
don't view Athens as pests or as as bad

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200 
don't view Athens as pests or as as bad
things<00:00:49.350> necessarily<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.910> think<00:00:51.120> of

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
things necessarily we really think of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
things necessarily we really think of
them<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.600> indication<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.289> whichever

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
them as an indication that whichever

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
them as an indication that whichever
plants<00:00:53.670> they're<00:00:53.820> attacking<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.539> unhealthy

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
plants they're attacking are unhealthy

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.250 
plants they're attacking are unhealthy
and<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.190> they're<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> telling<00:00:56.940> us<00:00:57.260> which

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and so they're kind of telling us which

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.840 
and so they're kind of telling us which
plants<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.710> unhealthy<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> giving<00:00:59.550> us<00:00:59.640> clues

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
plants are unhealthy and giving us clues

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.930 
plants are unhealthy and giving us clues
as<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.120> why<00:01:00.300> they<00:01:00.480> might<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.660> unhealthy<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
as to why they might be unhealthy and so

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.009 
as to why they might be unhealthy and so
it's<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> whole<00:01:03.510> different<00:01:03.750> paradigm

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it's just this whole different paradigm

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
it's just this whole different paradigm
with<00:01:04.470> organic<00:01:04.890> gardening<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.489> how<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> how<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
in the plans so that the aphids don't

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
in the plans so that the aphids don't
want<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> eat<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.220> of
