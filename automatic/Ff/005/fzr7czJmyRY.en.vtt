00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.869
 pvo in the somali community has been baffled by a report 

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:06.550
 from the mjd 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.690
 according to the report, some sixty somali men are addicted to groningen 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.159
 and they cause nuisance 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.640
 about three hundred somalis live in groningen, so that means almost that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.970
 all somali men would cause problems that means me too 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.670
 I succeeded that the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.290
 and it struck me I am not me and I have I think I am not 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.290
 that dutchbat that said bishop is not there again 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.990
 then it is possible that those figures are incorrect 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.630
 after the magic i don't know i am there i also read it so i ask at 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.540
 these invite the municipality and and ideas 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 to explain to us why they come side by side 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.570
 it is a fact that some somalis can turn but have difficulty 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.870
 found in Dutch society 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.450
 they get a difficult job and often do not finish their education 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.390
 the mjd wants to help the group with a so-called activate links project 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.040
 it will focus primarily on adult men in the first instance 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.750
 we also focus a group of about 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.670
 forty to fifty men 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.600
 in dear neighborhoods 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 that also cause nuisance to public spaces 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.710
 Immediately afterwards we also want to work with people we can motivate 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.390
 to give them a future perspective in the Netherlands 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.479
 and lord the peasant somalis you can become cat like the means has 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.260
 and it's a plan to lift and 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.720
 and it has been removed in principle 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.010
 but it is often combined with alcohol 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.210
 and then sat naturally and problems and inconvenience 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.820
 which according to the anwb distinguishes the somalis from other minorities 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.610
 is that they are also organized in the Netherlands in creams you hear all of life 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.710
 long with the same color 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.910
 So at that time comes in the Netherlands appeals to your own background 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.240
 and what consequences does that have for the somali in Groningen 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.290
 for somalis, that means that the overarching background is different 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.530
 have to help have to support 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 and all this within the context in which they themselves do not have enough money and that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.220
 that is not so the ordinary no family members but the ict together 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.650
 I bank at the moment, people still go crazy and stand wherever they go 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.749
 such and look they have to live the municipality is on the city view 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:22.659
 the regular institutions here together with community the problem 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.169
 have to resolve 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.609
 it was a matter of interpretation 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.329
 we really want to cooperate with the swan community
