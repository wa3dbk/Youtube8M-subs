00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
picture of the front of the meter and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.149 
picture of the front of the meter and
I'd<00:01:17.080> like<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.470> zoom<00:01:17.710> in<00:01:17.920> on<00:01:18.070> all<00:01:18.670> around<00:01:19.659> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I'd like to zoom in on all around the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.620 
I'd like to zoom in on all around the
2.5<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.750> meter<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.820> could<00:01:28.210> have<00:01:28.330> gotten

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
2.5 on the meter and I could have gotten

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.029 
2.5 on the meter and I could have gotten
closer<00:01:29.220> here's<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.369> full<00:01:31.060> frame<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:32.039> that

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
closer here's a full frame of that

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.320 
closer here's a full frame of that
picture<00:01:34.530> could<00:01:35.530> have<00:01:35.649> gotten<00:01:35.860> closer<00:01:36.570> but

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
picture could have gotten closer but

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.460 
picture could have gotten closer but
didn't<00:01:40.330> really<00:01:40.569> need<00:01:40.929> to<00:01:40.990> because<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:44.200> is

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
didn't really need to because this is

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:54.100 
didn't really need to because this is
the<00:01:44.710> picture<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:46.020> 1080p<00:01:47.850> unmagnified

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.310 

up<00:01:54.710> till<00:01:54.980> now<00:01:55.030> everything<00:01:56.030> had<00:01:56.210> been<00:01:56.390> handheld

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
up till now everything had been handheld

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.050 
up till now everything had been handheld
I<00:01:58.030> now<00:01:59.030> have<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.570> camera<00:02:00.320> on<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.560> tripod<00:02:00.790> and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.490 

again<00:02:05.060> this<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.450> another<00:02:05.870> full<00:02:06.290> frame<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.869> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
again this is another full frame and the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.970 
again this is another full frame and the
JPEGs<00:02:10.009> are<00:02:10.220> about<00:02:10.520> Oh<00:02:12.310> over<00:02:13.310> seven<00:02:13.730> make<00:02:14.980> JPEG

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
JPEGs are about Oh over seven make JPEG

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.610 
JPEGs are about Oh over seven make JPEG
so<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.760> quite<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.570> few<00:02:17.870> pixels<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.990> I<00:02:21.140> decided

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
so it's quite a few pixels and I decided

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.020 
so it's quite a few pixels and I decided
to<00:02:22.420> zoom<00:02:23.420> in<00:02:23.690> and<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> video<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.760> guy

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
to zoom in and do a video of this guy

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.920 
to zoom in and do a video of this guy
working<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.840> tower<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:31.330> it's<00:02:32.330> not<00:02:32.690> hard

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
working on the tower and it's not hard

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.670 
working on the tower and it's not hard
to<00:02:33.170> hear<00:02:34.209> what's<00:02:35.209> going<00:02:35.300> on<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.350> very

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
to hear what's going on and it's very

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.000 
to hear what's going on and it's very
easy<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.280> see<00:02:37.700> what's<00:02:37.970> going<00:02:38.330> on<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.980> all<00:02:39.980> I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
easy to see what's going on and all I

00:02:40.010 --> 00:03:08.300 
easy to see what's going on and all I
did<00:02:40.190> was<00:02:40.580> zoom<00:02:41.450> in

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.760

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
capacitor and from this angle and here

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.590 
capacitor and from this angle and here
it<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.660> just<00:03:52.020> too<00:03:52.410> easy
