00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
dog this is a boring science video it's

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.070 
dog this is a boring science video it's
all<00:00:03.870> about<00:00:04.140> science<00:00:05.779> science<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:06.960> more

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
all about science science and more

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.610 
all about science science and more
science

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
science

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.690 
science
so<00:00:08.099> stop<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.910> less<00:00:09.179> here<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.130> the<00:00:11.130> class<00:00:11.400> and

so stop and less here and the class and

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.940 
so stop and less here and the class and
we're<00:00:11.790> supposed<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.090> be<00:00:12.210> watching<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.690> video

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
we're supposed to be watching this video

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.800 
we're supposed to be watching this video
so<00:00:13.950> stop<00:00:16.340> ok<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> my<00:00:18.000> simple<00:00:18.480> machine

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
so stop ok so this is my simple machine

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.240 
so stop ok so this is my simple machine
project<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:20.730> wheel<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.210> axle<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.250> it's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
project the wheel and axle and then it's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
project the wheel and axle and then it's
the<00:00:23.369> wheel<00:00:23.550> axle<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> nail<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the wheel axle in the nail and this is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.490 
the wheel axle in the nail and this is
the<00:00:28.230> pulley<00:00:29.210> it's<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.289> water

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the pulley it's kind of just a water

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.700 
the pulley it's kind of just a water
bone<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.859> toilet<00:00:32.160> paper<00:00:32.340> rolls<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:34.530> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
bone the toilet paper rolls and this is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.240 
bone the toilet paper rolls and this is
the<00:00:34.829> inclined<00:00:35.280> plane<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> police

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the inclined plane and so the police

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.549 
the inclined plane and so the police
gonna<00:00:38.370> lift<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> car<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.690> gonna<00:00:39.870> go

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
gonna lift the car up and it's gonna go

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.639 
gonna lift the car up and it's gonna go
down<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> pop<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> balloon<00:00:42.350> okay<00:00:43.350> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
down here and pop the balloon okay so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.709 
down here and pop the balloon okay so
probably<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> few<00:00:45.059> runs

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
so that's my science project don't like

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.280 
so that's my science project don't like
it<00:03:30.760> because<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.419> not<00:03:31.720> likable<00:03:32.349> okay<00:03:33.129> bye
