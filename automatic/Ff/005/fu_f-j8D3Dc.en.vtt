00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello everybody my name is jerry 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 and I am the expert fugee and today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 I will simply do 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.260
 opening the box and you 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.519
 present the items inside the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 box for the new finepix s1600 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.980
 so this is an optical zoom box of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.290
 36.6 with 16 megapixels of resolution or 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.920
 6 with a stabilizer was integrated 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:43.230
 also with a 3 inch acl screen so 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.860
 without further delay we open the box 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:53.340
 I reproach them here a little and opens 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.530
 Then we see the manual 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.239
 of instruction as well as maps of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.690
 guarantee the instructions for the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.379
 service and if this is the version for them 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.199
 United States 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.790
 here only inside for canada 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.780
 also but each region where we will see 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 an exemplary dispute for the menus 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.689
 is linked to karachi maps according to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.230
 the need 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:30.910
 I know to open it 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:33.160
 the pullman and that's it and we see here the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.320
 service card for the united states and 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.790
 Canada in both English languages 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.100
 French 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.190
 the ex-kursaal international for the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.220
 service 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.770
 the registration as well as the terms of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.140
 the guarantee is such that it as well as 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.120
 English instruction manuals 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 French in that here because we are 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.680
 in Canada 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.190
 but again the textbooks are going 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.430
 see a difference depending on what 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.660
 region you are so here is the lot the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:13.260
 manuals so a separator here and in 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:20.920
 the box here we have the cap for 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:23.770

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.900
 as well as a lanyard to keep it at 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.550
 housing community about the father 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.610
 so here we have the cover as well as the 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.260
 little winner under the tipp thongs he 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.500

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.570
 takes 3 batteries in double format on you 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.160
 certainly encourage you to get 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.160
 rechargeable batteries ni-mh the most 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.450
 high possible the possible guen clown 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.290
 give you the maximum of which 2 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:03.400
 two taken by charge here I have the train station 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.900
 the thong is a last for 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.440
 the shot and that's with the crazy logo of 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:21.400
 film and fasteners here for the side of 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:23.769
 casing and the casing night but we 're going 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.930
 open it when you go to see here that a 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:32.230
 perennial it's just to make sure that 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:40.500
 the device does so by opening it one goes 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:44.680
 rip the wine the device yes but 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.880
 this is the case so on the back we 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.980
 have here so protector to keep 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.980
 the raw milk is clean and 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.050
 protected during transport 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.880
 and we will put the batteries so here 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.620
 the compartment where we see the 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:10.880
 policy for the three batteries so the most 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:15.230
 at the top the least arrow is still the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.980
 more is here and there taken for the card 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.430

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:26.840
 elmer and if I do not crack I got 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:29.600
 here and somewhere far away even you the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.540
 the series is animated from the camera to 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.479
 to do too much parents 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.970
 so here is a class card 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:43.930
 iv is suggested the minimum for 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.270

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.389
 touch 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.120
 off and on we'll see the setting 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.330
 languages ​​and date 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.850
