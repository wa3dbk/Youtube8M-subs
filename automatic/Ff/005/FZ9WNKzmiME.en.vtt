somewhere<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.750> since<00:00:36.989> we're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> be

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
somewhere but since we're going to be

somewhere but since we're going to be
applying<00:00:37.500> applying<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> entire

applying applying it to the entire
domain<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.590> should<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.100> work<00:00:41.250> no

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
domain it's it should just work no

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.300 
but we'll start from the beginning here
so<00:01:28.140> expand<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:29.100> domain<00:01:29.430> oh<00:01:29.610> you

okay and since I want it deployed to all
of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> computers<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:36.530> basically<00:01:37.530> since<00:01:37.950> now

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
of the computers or basically since now

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.649 
of the computers or basically since now
the<00:01:38.520> policy<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.299> we're<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.600> be

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the policy that we're going to be

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.350 
the policy that we're going to be
editing<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> user<00:01:40.470> preference<00:01:41.009> so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
editing it's a user preference so

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.429 
editing it's a user preference so
technically<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:42.990> applying<00:01:43.259> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
technically it's going to be applying to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499

on that side so now what we want to do

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.400 
on that side so now what we want to do
is<00:03:20.220> switch<00:03:20.400> over<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.640> common<00:03:20.940> tab<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.480> by

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
noticed that a lot of our policies we

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.680 
noticed that a lot of our policies we
had<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.920> start<00:03:32.100> doing<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.489> switch<00:03:32.820> there<00:03:33.090> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
had to start doing that switch there and
