just<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.850> start<00:00:06.060> plugging<00:00:06.359> just<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.779> few

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
just going to start plugging just a few

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.680 
just going to start plugging just a few
little<00:00:07.290> pots<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.830> first<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.700> Hurley's<00:00:09.059> really

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
little pots of first to Hurley's really

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.320 
little pots of first to Hurley's really
early<00:00:09.960> ones<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.670> not<00:00:11.820> going<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> are

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
early ones so I'm not going to are

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.850 
early ones so I'm not going to are
usually<00:00:12.570> plucked<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.870> 30<00:00:13.110> late<00:00:13.380> if<00:00:13.500> box<00:00:13.679> that's

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
usually plucked in 30 late if box that's

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.070 
usually plucked in 30 late if box that's
a<00:00:13.950> 25<00:00:14.370> liter<00:00:14.670> pot<00:00:14.910> well<00:00:15.630> this<00:00:15.780> time<00:00:15.990> I'm

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
a 25 liter pot well this time I'm

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.870 
a 25 liter pot well this time I'm
actually<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> plug<00:00:16.800> them<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.070> 15<00:00:17.640> liter

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
actually going to plug them in 15 liter

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.480 
actually going to plug them in 15 liter
pots<00:00:18.210> which<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.720> can<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.869> you're<00:00:19.080> quite

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
pots which as you can see you're quite

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
pots which as you can see you're quite
quite<00:00:20.490> shallow<00:00:21.080> because<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.289> found<00:00:22.529> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
quite shallow because what I found is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.620 
quite shallow because what I found is
that<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.250> pulled<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.730> me<00:00:24.000> big<00:00:24.330> pots

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that when I pulled up me big pots

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.720 
that when I pulled up me big pots
there's<00:00:25.470> nothing<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> first<00:00:26.220> sort<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.550> six

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
there's nothing in the first sort of six

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.519 
there's nothing in the first sort of six
inches<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.180> they<00:00:27.539> only<00:00:27.660> sort<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> really

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
inches so they only sort of really

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.070 
inches so they only sort of really
produced<00:00:28.859> potatoes<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.660> wherever<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> tops

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
produced potatoes from wherever the tops

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.170 
produced potatoes from wherever the tops
bottom<00:00:31.859> six<00:00:32.099> inches<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> pot<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
bottom six inches of the pot so I

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850 
bottom six inches of the pot so I
thought<00:00:33.450> there's<00:00:33.600> no<00:00:33.630> point<00:00:33.719> wasting<00:00:34.170> compost

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
thought there's no point wasting compost

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.010 
thought there's no point wasting compost
so<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> try<00:00:36.239> some<00:00:36.450> smaller<00:00:36.750> parts

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so I'm going to try some smaller parts

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.299 
so I'm going to try some smaller parts
shallower<00:00:37.410> pots<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.890> instead<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.160> putting

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
shallower pots and instead of putting

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.670 
shallower pots and instead of putting
two<00:00:38.520> potatoes<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> put

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
two potatoes in I'm just going to put

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.069 
two potatoes in I'm just going to put
one<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.360> hopefully<00:00:42.570> because

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
one in so and then hopefully because

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.990 
one in so and then hopefully because
that's<00:00:43.350> small<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> tip<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> whole<00:00:44.640> plant

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
that's small a bit a tip the whole plant

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
that's small a bit a tip the whole plant
out<00:00:45.239> roots<00:00:45.600> intact<00:00:46.070> take<00:00:47.070> me<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.340> potato

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
out roots intact take me on potato

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.360 
out roots intact take me on potato
that's<00:00:47.940> ready<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.960> bottom<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.620> then

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that's ready from the bottom and then

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.819 
that's ready from the bottom and then
hopefully<00:00:50.640> replumb<00:00:51.320> replumb<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.530> plant

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
hopefully replumb replumb that plant

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.260 
hopefully replumb replumb that plant
again<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.550> what's<00:00:53.789> got<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> little

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
again that's what's got all the little

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.689 
again that's what's got all the little
tiny<00:00:54.480> babies<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.280> should<00:00:56.460> still

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
tiny babies up on and it should still

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.189 
tiny babies up on and it should still
grow<00:00:56.969> because<00:00:57.270> usually<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.660> empty<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> big

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
grow because usually when empty the big

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.220 
grow because usually when empty the big
pot<00:00:58.440> out<00:00:59.030> you<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> few<00:01:00.449> big<00:01:00.660> issue<00:01:00.840> arms<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
pot out you get a few big issue arms and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.360 
pot out you get a few big issue arms and
then<00:01:01.320> you've<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.530> millions<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.100> tiny

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
then you've got millions of little tiny

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.090 
then you've got millions of little tiny
ones<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> would<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.500> matured<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.680> proper

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
ones that would have matured into proper

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.719 
ones that would have matured into proper
eating<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:06.210> way<00:01:06.420> thoughtfully<00:01:07.729> it'll

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
eating one this way thoughtfully it'll

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.030 
eating one this way thoughtfully it'll
end<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.210> better<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.780> anyway<00:01:10.049> well<00:01:10.890> have

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
end up a bit better so anyway well have

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
end up a bit better so anyway well have
a<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.210> gonna<00:01:12.390> use<00:01:12.689> is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
a go so what I'm just gonna use is

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
a go so what I'm just gonna use is
mistake<00:01:13.890> bitter<00:01:14.189> tears<00:01:14.490> I've<00:01:14.700> got<00:01:14.820> Charlotte

mistake bitter tears I've got Charlotte
here<00:01:15.509> I've<00:01:15.810> been<00:01:15.930> cheating<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.680> about

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
here I've been cheating these for about

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.130 
here I've been cheating these for about
a<00:01:16.979> month<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.150> been<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> cold<00:01:18.720> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
a month well it's been that cold that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.070 
a month well it's been that cold that
there's<00:01:19.950> nothing<00:01:20.250> appeared<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.000> still<00:01:21.270> still

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there's nothing appeared but still still

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.010 
there's nothing appeared but still still
no<00:01:22.259> sprouts<00:01:22.650> appear<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> doesn't<00:01:23.580> matter

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
no sprouts appear so it doesn't matter

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
no sprouts appear so it doesn't matter
no<00:01:25.020> big<00:01:25.259> deal<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.040> gonna<00:01:26.250> use<00:01:26.460> Bob

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
no big deal I'm just gonna use Bob

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.940 
no big deal I'm just gonna use Bob
standard<00:01:27.090> compost

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.499 
standard compost
this<00:01:28.950> stuff's<00:01:29.220> actually<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.939> big<00:01:30.240> John

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this stuff's actually got a big John

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.940 
this stuff's actually got a big John
Innes<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> wouldn't<00:01:31.350> usually<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.770> for

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
Innes in it I wouldn't usually go for

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.859 
Innes in it I wouldn't usually go for
that<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> was<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> bit<00:01:32.549> expensive<00:01:34.159> well

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
that because it was a bit expensive well

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.700 
that because it was a bit expensive well
you<00:01:36.869> taught<00:01:37.049> me<00:01:37.170> other<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you taught me other to get out the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.280 
you taught me other to get out the
sensor<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.369> early<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.110> I'm<00:01:40.200> gonna

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
sensor this early on so what I'm gonna

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.710 
sensor this early on so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.740> gonna<00:01:40.829> fill<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> pot<00:01:43.070> about<00:01:44.070> what

the<00:02:04.890> soil<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.399> eaters<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:06.390> work<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.750> I'm

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the soil to get eaters to work so I'm

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.520 
the soil to get eaters to work so I'm
going<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.020> use<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> fast-acting<00:02:08.929> soluble<00:02:09.929> well

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
going to use a fast-acting soluble well

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.410 
going to use a fast-acting soluble well
it's<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.739> granular<00:02:11.190> fertilizer<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's a granular fertilizer but it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.850 
it's a granular fertilizer but it
although<00:02:12.860> it'll<00:02:13.860> break<00:02:14.099> down<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> lot<00:02:14.670> quicker

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
although it'll break down a lot quicker

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.290 
although it'll break down a lot quicker
then<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.099> sort<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.340> double<00:02:17.550> strength<00:02:18.000> when

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
then it's a sort of double strength when

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.860 
then it's a sort of double strength when
it's<00:02:18.450> cold

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
it's cold

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.979 
it's cold
spuds<00:02:19.200> go<00:02:19.440> off<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.480> that's<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.959> looks

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
spuds go off and that's what it looks

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.289 
spuds go off and that's what it looks
like<00:02:22.380> granular<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.700> quite<00:02:23.880> strong

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
like granular to it it's quite strong

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.400 
like granular to it it's quite strong
it's<00:02:24.830> 10<00:02:25.830> 12<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.700> 18<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.269> NP<00:02:27.780> care<00:02:28.080> scale

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
it's 10 12 and 18 on the NP care scale

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.750 
it's 10 12 and 18 on the NP care scale
so<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.590> sort<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.950> double<00:02:29.599> nitrogen<00:02:31.760> nearly

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
so you sort of double nitrogen nearly

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.339 
so you sort of double nitrogen nearly
triple<00:02:33.269> in<00:02:33.420> your<00:02:33.540> potash<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.200> should

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
triple in your potash so it should

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.900 
triple in your potash so it should
should<00:02:34.620> benefit<00:02:35.010> petite<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:35.489> being<00:02:35.670> quite

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
should benefit petite as being quite

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.910 
should benefit petite as being quite
strong<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.239> potash<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.560> I'm<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.739> going<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
strong in potash so I'm just going to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.819 
strong in potash so I'm just going to
put<00:02:38.069> one<00:02:38.099> out<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:39.090> one<00:02:40.079> of<00:02:40.140> these<00:02:40.290> pots<00:02:40.560> which

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
put one out in one of these pots which

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.630 
put one out in one of these pots which
is<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.280> 15<00:02:41.819> liters<00:02:43.190> I'll<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.310> give<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.489> a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
is about 15 liters I'll just give it a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.059 
is about 15 liters I'll just give it a
good<00:02:44.730> mix<00:02:44.790> in<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:49.049> I'm<00:02:49.380> only<00:02:49.470> going<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.769> put<00:02:49.890> one

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
good mix in so I'm only going to put one

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.550 
good mix in so I'm only going to put one
preserver<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:51.019> and<00:02:52.019> we'll<00:02:52.140> see<00:02:52.260> how<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.440> gets

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
preserver in and we'll see how it gets

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.729 
preserver in and we'll see how it gets
on<00:02:52.829> really<00:02:53.810> did<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.900> mind<00:02:55.079> pulling<00:02:55.440> them<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
on really did you mind pulling them a

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.250 
on really did you mind pulling them a
bit<00:02:55.860> too<00:02:56.010> early<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.489> then<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.700> end<00:02:56.849> up<00:02:57.230> with<00:02:58.230> a

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
bit too early and then you end up with a

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.780 
bit too early and then you end up with a
little<00:02:58.500> really<00:02:58.860> pathetic<00:02:58.980> yield<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.609> at<00:02:59.700> least

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
little really pathetic yield so at least

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.819 
little really pathetic yield so at least
if<00:02:59.940> we<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.120> do<00:03:00.660> more<00:03:00.900> little<00:03:01.319> pots<00:03:01.560> than<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
if we just do more little pots than the

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.030 
if we just do more little pots than the
morning<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> waster<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.900> pot<00:03:04.230> rather<00:03:04.709> than

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
morning in a waster one pot rather than

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.449 
morning in a waster one pot rather than
two<00:03:05.340> potatoes<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.090> anyway<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.920> turn<00:03:08.130> sweet

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
because there's there's just too much of

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.050 
because there's there's just too much of
a<00:04:01.260> risk<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.590> frost<00:04:01.710> so<00:04:02.160> I'm<00:04:02.490> just<00:04:02.610> trying<00:04:02.760> these

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
a risk of frost so I'm just trying these

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.150 
a risk of frost so I'm just trying these
at<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.360> end<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.600> February<00:04:03.950> people<00:04:04.950> about<00:04:05.100> a

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
at the end of February people about a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.830 
at the end of February people about a
six<00:04:05.430> week<00:04:05.580> head<00:04:05.850> start<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.240> see<00:04:06.390> what<00:04:06.570> happens

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
six week head start and see what happens

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.970 
six week head start and see what happens
so<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.610> new<00:04:08.610> trial<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.180> these<00:04:09.330> pots

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
so a new trial in these pots

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.110 
so a new trial in these pots
another<00:04:10.980> thing<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.220> can<00:04:11.400> do<00:04:11.580> but<00:04:11.700> you've<00:04:11.880> seen

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
another thing you can do but you've seen

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
two at the bottom and then because he he

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.170 
two at the bottom and then because he he
knows<00:04:22.620> as<00:04:22.800> well<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.490> support<00:04:23.820> only<00:04:23.940> get

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
knows as well but you support only get

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.210 
knows as well but you support only get
sort<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.420> halfway<00:04:24.600> up<00:04:24.930> its<00:04:25.680> fill<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:25.980> pot

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
sort of halfway up its fill this pot

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.370 
sort of halfway up its fill this pot
halfway<00:04:26.610> up<00:04:26.760> but<00:04:27.030> all<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.240> us<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.600> see<00:04:27.840> potatoes

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
halfway up but all of us to see potatoes

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.870 
halfway up but all of us to see potatoes
then<00:04:28.530> then<00:04:28.650> fill<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.070> pot<00:04:29.280> right<00:04:29.460> up<00:04:29.700> so

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
then then fill the pot right up so

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.610 
then then fill the pot right up so
you're<00:04:30.000> gonna<00:04:30.090> get<00:04:30.300> four<00:04:30.960> plants<00:04:31.320> but<00:04:31.590> you

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
you're gonna get four plants but you

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.710 
you're gonna get four plants but you
should<00:04:31.860> get<00:04:31.980> potatoes<00:04:32.610> all<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.300> way<00:04:33.420> up<00:04:33.600> you

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
should get potatoes all the way up you

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.660 
should get potatoes all the way up you
say<00:04:33.920> because<00:04:34.920> like<00:04:35.040> I<00:04:35.130> said<00:04:35.190> if<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.430> plant

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
say because like I said if you plant

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.490 
say because like I said if you plant
them<00:04:35.730> in<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.000> first<00:04:36.360> Earl<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.140> only<00:04:37.290> end

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
them in the first Earl is the only end

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.870 
them in the first Earl is the only end
up<00:04:37.590> being<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:37.920> bottom<00:04:38.130> half<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:38.760> think

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
up being in the bottom half so I think

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.030 
up being in the bottom half so I think
you<00:04:39.000> just<00:04:39.030> waste<00:04:39.390> in<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.660> top<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.040> so

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
you just waste in the top of it so

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.410 
you just waste in the top of it so
that's<00:04:41.220> another<00:04:41.430> way<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:41.610> can<00:04:41.820> do<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.000> but<00:04:42.330> I'm

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
that's another way you can do it but I'm

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.640 
that's another way you can do it but I'm
going<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.600> strain<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.810> with<00:04:42.960> shallower<00:04:43.350> pots

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
going to strain it with shallower pots

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.110 
going to strain it with shallower pots
just<00:04:43.800> put<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.640> we'll<00:04:44.760> see<00:04:44.910> how<00:04:45.000> we

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
just put you on it and we'll see how we

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.020 
just put you on it and we'll see how we
get<00:04:45.210> on<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:47.070> that's<00:04:47.220> about<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.430> folks<00:04:47.730> first

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
get on so that's about it folks first

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.550 
get on so that's about it folks first
bit<00:04:48.240> of<00:04:48.300> planting<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:48.930> year<00:04:49.170> just<00:04:49.410> trying

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
bit of planting of this year just trying

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.500 
bit of planting of this year just trying
a<00:04:49.770> few<00:04:49.800> I'm<00:04:50.250> gonna<00:04:50.400> grade<00:04:50.610> four<00:04:50.880> pots<00:04:51.180> of<00:04:51.390> these

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
a few I'm gonna grade four pots of these

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.630 
a few I'm gonna grade four pots of these
but<00:04:52.350> say<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.800> someone's<00:04:53.070> table<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.370> get<00:04:53.460> on

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
but say that someone's table to get on

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.970 
but say that someone's table to get on
in<00:04:54.570> about<00:04:54.810> ninety<00:04:55.170> days<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.590> see<00:04:55.710> if<00:04:55.770> we<00:04:55.890> get

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
in about ninety days and see if we get
