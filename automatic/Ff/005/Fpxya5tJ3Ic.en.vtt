00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 Start of the twentieth edition at the Nürburgring twice around the clock 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.430
 will be 180 vehicles and just under 600 drivers 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.579
 or just fight for the arrive 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.459
 Let's dare a little sport in our statistics 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.679
 11 manufacturers from four nations are represented in the Eifel 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.479
 is driven in five rating classes this hung a total of 17 classes 

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:21.480
 divided 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.810
 in the hit list of makes for BMW with 35 classes 7 4 4 b and fort 32 and that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.340
 on 20 of every weather condition, the best vehicles 24 hours Zacher 3400 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.220
 The record comes from the year 1990 driven by Giger like 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.240
 Glock and Schwegler with 3600 25 kilometers in the 143 and 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.360
 1 behind it ranks the BMW i3 25 by Udo Schneider Prince Poldi of Bavaria 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.360
 and Franz Engstler 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.020
 the last group a few meters to the start 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 here too, as in the other two groups, the Denic sits down 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.620
 fastest car in front SAS is the Honda Civic Vitek from Rosberg showed and 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.290
 create 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.950
 Incidentally, Peter Seitel is the most successful pilot together with Jürgen Hübner 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.230
 Fun tire marathons the two could so far 8 class victories for themselves 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.300
 record 24-hour races 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 There is only one equal to a horny 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.300
 during the traditional at a lawsuit the driver especially at night 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.050
 24 hours more time for me the greatest fascination of the child 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.790
 24-hour race is for me the biggest such chaotic immediately 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.670
 again 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.640
 because after years of experience I did not put together for age » 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.440
 and we certainly have the most experience at the start anyway 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.410
 Advantage over other teams or 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.990
 Imagine now the more the Olympic Thought Euro amount was 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.200
 As far as he could get there that was important but otherwise 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.420
 Olympic thought to have fun 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 Car parts food and income pretty important 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.299
 Werthmann must and wants to become a marathon 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.689
 Of course today we are of course just asking the question would have its bitter 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.659
 History but the Gelderner is good because others otherwise understated 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.829
 Per cent my friend Karl Zeller just said fun with the thing and lives with it 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.019
 Uncertain the atmosphere or you stay home I think you have to go for the job 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.210
 We are doing very well here 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.829
 but you should be healthy 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.239
 just how powerful is the band when I join them in the round 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.089
 looked 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:42.629
 I can only count on the worst and they are not exactly sure 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.849
 the holiday village make a good impression in the double sense of the word but always 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.659
 a few cameras in the car percent off and I think we'll see you after 24 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.809
 Hours again Sorin the circle 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.809
 Manz munteres but still prefer to tell about these topics 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.969
 Franz Engstler dtm-pilot are namely problems on the curbs 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.589
 August once across the track 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.989
 This leads to a beautiful only had 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.620
 Already in training Poldi had a good start for us 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.019
 Finance had its hands full and that groups for the the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.269
 Recover title on Saturday morning 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.999
 Poldi and Engstler both at sorry it brake systems from the German 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.179
 touring car championship desired 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.499
 big problems when I look at an offshoot this August 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.999
 deep 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.289
 I love you 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.249
 So still lies in the lead of the Opel Omega distribution center Schmidt 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.929
 But the weather situation does not change and you're up as a scammer 

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:46.929
 profiled rain tires approached 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.450
 no chance the omega has on the profileless slicks each takes over 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:54.419
 guide 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.419
 he can drive much faster 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.479
 three years in a row so from 1989 to 1991 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.649
 by the way, the BMW vehicles at the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.050
 89 was the Swiss Team 90 then in the troop and last year against a
