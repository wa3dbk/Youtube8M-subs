00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.990 

first<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:02.010> all<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.750> will<00:00:03.750> notice<00:00:03.990> that<00:00:04.410> I

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.000 
first of all you will notice that I

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.780 
first of all you will notice that I
truncated<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.509> body<00:00:06.750> mesh<00:00:07.580> that<00:00:08.580> way

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
truncated the body mesh that way

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.930 
truncated the body mesh that way
experimenting<00:00:09.780> will<00:00:10.320> be<00:00:10.679> much<00:00:10.860> fast<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.429> also

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
experimenting will be much fast and also

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.270 
experimenting will be much fast and also
it<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.750> necessary<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.799> section<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
it is necessary in the section that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.859 
it is necessary in the section that
follows<00:00:14.660> in<00:00:16.369> this<00:00:17.369> video<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.970> will<00:00:18.029> show<00:00:18.210> what<00:00:18.840> I

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
follows in this video I will show what I

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.609 
follows in this video I will show what I
did<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.529> get<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> better<00:00:20.010> fit<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.939> skirt<00:00:21.180> I

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
did to get a better fit of the skirt I

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.140 
did to get a better fit of the skirt I
used<00:00:22.619> two<00:00:23.100> methods<00:00:23.550> which<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.240> will<00:00:24.539> go<00:00:24.720> into

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
used two methods which I will go into

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
used two methods which I will go into
there<00:00:27.150> might<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.420> other<00:00:27.750> perhaps<00:00:28.320> better<00:00:28.680> ways

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
there might be other perhaps better ways

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.260 
there might be other perhaps better ways
to<00:00:30.349> do<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.830> any<00:00:32.250> suggestion<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.059> might

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to do this and any suggestion you might

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
to do this and any suggestion you might
have<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.750> very<00:00:33.960> welcome<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:35.460> method

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
have this very welcome the first method

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
have this very welcome the first method
I<00:00:36.030> used<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.660> keeping<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.170> mind<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.559> blender

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
I used with keeping in mind that blender

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.330 
I used with keeping in mind that blender
will<00:00:38.940> push<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> skirt<00:00:40.379> outlet<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.040> cloth

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
will push the skirt outlet in the cloth

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.020 
will push the skirt outlet in the cloth
simulation<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.300> type<00:00:42.510> anyway<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:44.030> with

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
simulation of this type anyway this with

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:54.200 
simulation of this type anyway this with
the<00:00:45.180> rig<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.879> resting<00:00:47.879> position<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:53.399> noted

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the rig in the resting position I noted

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.790 
the rig in the resting position I noted
down<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.050> x<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.920> z<00:00:56.219> x<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.300> z<00:00:57.570> dimensions<00:00:58.350> to

mind that in object mode y and c you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.370 
mind that in object mode y and c you
have<00:01:09.840> changed<00:01:10.619> places<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:12.299> did<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> same<00:01:13.140> for

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
have changed places I I did the same for

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.830 
have changed places I I did the same for
the<00:01:14.130> body<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> reference<00:01:16.520> next<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.670> went<00:01:18.630> into

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the body as a reference next I went into

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.910 
the body as a reference next I went into
edit<00:01:19.350> mode<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:21.380> i<00:01:23.390> scaled<00:01:24.439> both<00:01:25.439> body<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
edit mode and i scaled both body and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.719 
edit mode and i scaled both body and
skirt<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.299> point<00:01:27.930> 95<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:29.009> entering<00:01:29.520> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
skirt down to point 95 by entering this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.440 
skirt down to point 95 by entering this
value<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.479> keyboard<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> scaling<00:01:31.740> mode<00:01:32.450> after

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
value on keyboard and scaling mode after

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.530 
value on keyboard and scaling mode after
this<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.920> read<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.400> simulation<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.270> baked

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
this I read it the simulation and baked

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.090 
this I read it the simulation and baked
it

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.880 

now<00:01:44.100> using<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.630> same<00:01:45.840> procedure<00:01:46.260> i<00:01:48.740> scaled<00:01:49.740> up

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
now using the same procedure i scaled up

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.200 
now using the same procedure i scaled up
only<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.490> body<00:01:50.790> who<00:01:51.330> x<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:51.960> y<00:01:52.610> by<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.910> type

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
only the body who x and y by a type

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.280 
only the body who x and y by a type
value<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:55.790> 1.05<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:59.090> quite<00:02:00.090> difficult<00:02:00.290> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
value of 1.05 it is quite difficult to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.190 
value of 1.05 it is quite difficult to
measure<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.800> gap<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.760> baked<00:02:03.000> Persian<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
measure the gap in the baked Persian and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.250 
measure the gap in the baked Persian and
it<00:02:04.590> varies<00:02:05.190> also<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.870> matter<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
it varies also so it is a matter of

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.100 
it varies also so it is a matter of
trial<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.800> error<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> right<00:02:08.850> values

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:20.020 

1.05<00:02:13.550> appeared<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:16.980> too<00:02:17.340> much<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.300> found

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
1.05 appeared to be too much so I found

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.000 
1.05 appeared to be too much so I found
1.02<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.810> best<00:02:22.050> result<00:02:24.650> there<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.800> Luke

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
1.02 as the best result there is Luke

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.970 
1.02 as the best result there is Luke
how<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:27.410> will<00:02:28.410> turn<00:02:28.440> out<00:02:29.450> if<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.110> nothing

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
how this will turn out if you nothing

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
how this will turn out if you nothing
happens<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.430> course<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:33.000> frame<00:02:33.959> one<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:35.000> onto

happens of course on frame one on onto

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.390 
happens of course on frame one on onto
again<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.810> pushes<00:02:37.230> out<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.190> can

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
again it pushes out and now can you can

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.560 
again it pushes out and now can you can
see<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.790> thickness<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.489> of<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:42.300> skirt

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
see the thickness of the of the skirt

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.720 
see the thickness of the of the skirt

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
addicts still it has improved a lot

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:15.730 
addicts still it has improved a lot
since<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.790> previous<00:03:06.390> phase<00:03:08.989> what<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.110> also<00:03:10.320> did

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.530 

is<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:21.110> second<00:03:21.500> method<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.920> are<00:03:22.190> used<00:03:22.540> which

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
is the second method I are used which

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.600 
is the second method I are used which
was<00:03:25.450> adding<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:27.490> solidify<00:03:29.500> modifier<00:03:30.610> to

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
was adding a solidify modifier to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.320 
was adding a solidify modifier to
discuss<00:03:32.060> tech<00:03:35.020> again<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.260> was<00:03:36.530> already

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330

solidified<00:03:38.950> with<00:03:39.950> three<00:03:40.310> millimeters<00:03:40.910> and

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
solidified with three millimeters and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.970 
solidified with three millimeters and
now<00:03:41.300> there<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.960> another<00:03:42.050> layer<00:03:42.730> added<00:03:43.730> which

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
now there is another layer added which

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.230 
now there is another layer added which
means<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.130> there<00:03:46.460> are<00:03:46.490> now<00:03:46.850> three<00:03:47.300> layers

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
means that there are now three layers

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.740 
means that there are now three layers
and<00:03:50.240> there<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:50.780> no<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.050> layers<00:03:51.380> attitude<00:03:52.220> mesh

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
and there is no the layers attitude mesh

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.230 
and there is no the layers attitude mesh
however<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:54.080> is<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.710> rather<00:03:54.920> low<00:03:55.250> poly<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:55.940> it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
however it is a rather low poly and it

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.190 
however it is a rather low poly and it
did<00:03:56.420> it's<00:03:56.600> not<00:03:56.780> much<00:03:57.020> of<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.320> problem<00:03:58.750> what<00:03:59.750> it

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
did it's not much of a problem what it

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
did it's not much of a problem what it
will<00:04:00.950> show<00:04:01.730> though<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:03.590> some<00:04:04.580> artifacts<00:04:05.270> and

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
will show though is some artifacts and

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.420 
will show though is some artifacts and
one<00:04:07.220> of<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.490> layers<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:08.090> peeking<00:04:08.690> through<00:04:09.430> now

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
one of the layers is peeking through now

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.560 
one of the layers is peeking through now
this<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.450> an<00:04:11.750> area<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:12.710> the<00:04:13.070> skirt<00:04:13.570> where

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
this is in an area of the skirt where

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.330 
this is in an area of the skirt where
one<00:04:14.930> would<00:04:15.200> expect<00:04:16.180> wrinkles<00:04:17.180> anyway<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:18.680> I

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
one would expect wrinkles anyway so I

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.870 
one would expect wrinkles anyway so I
have<00:04:19.940> decided<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.510> keep<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.320> way<00:04:21.880> let's

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
have decided to keep it that way let's

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.590 
have decided to keep it that way let's
start<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.660> simulation<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:29.000> as<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.330> can<00:04:29.570> see

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
start the simulation and as you can see

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.250 
start the simulation and as you can see
in<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:31.640> front<00:04:32.950> it<00:04:33.950> looks<00:04:34.480> acceptable<00:04:35.480> i<00:04:35.810> would

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
in the front it looks acceptable i would

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:46.350 
in the front it looks acceptable i would
think<00:04:37.480> let's<00:04:38.480> also<00:04:38.690> have<00:04:39.080> a<00:04:39.140> new<00:04:39.350> girl<00:04:39.560> back

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:59.800 

also<00:04:47.360> acceptable

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.300 

um<00:05:00.310> five<00:05:01.310> millimeter<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:03.169> rather<00:05:03.530> much<00:05:03.889> for

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
um five millimeter is a rather much for

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.240 
um five millimeter is a rather much for
a<00:05:04.340> denim<00:05:04.760> skirt<00:05:04.790> but<00:05:05.300> Allah<00:05:05.930> bernal<00:05:06.230> if<00:05:07.070> it

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
a denim skirt but Allah bernal if it

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.350 
a denim skirt but Allah bernal if it
doesn't<00:05:07.580> rain<00:05:07.760> who<00:05:07.970> cares<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:09.520> also<00:05:10.520> we<00:05:11.030> all

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
doesn't rain who cares and also we all

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.110 
doesn't rain who cares and also we all
have<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.840> keep<00:05:12.050> in<00:05:12.200> mind<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.950> final<00:05:13.400> usage<00:05:13.910> of

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
have to keep in mind the final usage of

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.940 
have to keep in mind the final usage of
the<00:05:14.300> whole<00:05:14.480> project<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.230> that<00:05:15.260> will<00:05:15.560> not<00:05:15.770> be

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
the whole project and that will not be

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.080 
the whole project and that will not be
in<00:05:16.130> close-up<00:05:17.710> besides<00:05:18.710> with<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.610> frame<00:05:19.850> rate

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
in close-up besides with the frame rate

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.810 
in close-up besides with the frame rate
of<00:05:20.300> 25<00:05:20.930> nobody's<00:05:21.590> likely<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:22.160> see<00:05:22.370> details

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
of 25 nobody's likely to see details

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.900 
of 25 nobody's likely to see details
like<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.139> so<00:05:24.139> with<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.440> in<00:05:24.620> mind<00:05:24.650> let's<00:05:25.100> go

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
like that so with that in mind let's go

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:34.900 
like that so with that in mind let's go
to<00:05:26.480> the<00:05:26.690> final<00:05:27.470> result<00:05:27.919> I<00:05:32.500> quickly<00:05:33.500> made<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:34.160> UV

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
to the final result I quickly made a UV

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.360 
to the final result I quickly made a UV
map<00:05:35.180> using<00:05:35.650> cylindrical<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:36.830> rep<00:05:37.100> and

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
map using cylindrical and rep and

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.060 
map using cylindrical and rep and
texture<00:05:38.150> painted<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:38.720> with<00:05:39.470> one<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:39.889> the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
texture painted it with one of the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.420 
texture painted it with one of the
default<00:05:40.700> textures<00:05:41.060> of<00:05:41.180> blender<00:05:41.570> I<00:05:42.430> thankful

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
default textures of blender I thankful

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.879 
default textures of blender I thankful
for<00:05:43.910> now<00:05:44.060> the<00:05:44.120> result<00:05:44.720> is<00:05:44.900> what<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.530> said

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
for now the result is what I said

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:55.010 
for now the result is what I said
exactly<00:05:46.880> acceptable

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.719 

at<00:05:55.620> least<00:05:56.539> from<00:05:57.539> front<00:05:57.930> side<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.160> back<00:05:59.430> view

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:13.249 

what<00:06:02.729> about<00:06:02.819> the<00:06:03.120> top<00:06:03.300> view<00:06:08.479> ouch<00:06:12.050> there's<00:06:13.050> an

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
what about the top view ouch there's an

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:20.930 
what about the top view ouch there's an
issue<00:06:13.379> you<00:06:14.000> as<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.270> can<00:06:15.449> see<00:06:17.360> there<00:06:18.360> is<00:06:18.509> a<00:06:19.940> wide

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
issue you as you can see there is a wide

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.260 
issue you as you can see there is a wide
gap<00:06:21.360> in<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:22.319> front<00:06:23.300> not<00:06:24.300> so<00:06:24.539> much<00:06:25.139> in<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.530> bed

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
gap in the front not so much in the bed

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.270 
gap in the front not so much in the bed
but<00:06:27.270> especially<00:06:27.960> in<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.560> front<00:06:28.830> I<00:06:30.889> want<00:06:31.889> to

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
but especially in the front I want to

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.969 
but especially in the front I want to
try<00:06:32.909> a<00:06:33.240> lattice<00:06:33.750> modifier<00:06:34.020> to<00:06:34.620> give<00:06:34.830> the

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
try a lattice modifier to give the

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.260 
try a lattice modifier to give the
models<00:06:35.370> a<00:06:35.550> bit<00:06:35.759> of<00:06:36.139> the<00:06:37.139> tummy<00:06:37.880> after<00:06:38.880> all<00:06:39.000> she

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
models a bit of the tummy after all she

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.200 
models a bit of the tummy after all she
can<00:06:39.449> afford<00:06:39.569> it<00:06:42.470> if<00:06:43.470> and<00:06:44.280> when<00:06:44.340> I<00:06:44.490> succeed<00:06:45.000> in

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
can afford it if and when I succeed in

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.680 
can afford it if and when I succeed in
this<00:06:45.360> I'll<00:06:45.659> get<00:06:46.020> back<00:06:46.199> to<00:06:46.259> you<00:06:47.360> but<00:06:48.360> it<00:06:48.509> might

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
this I'll get back to you but it might

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.629 
this I'll get back to you but it might
be<00:06:48.840> a<00:06:48.870> while<00:06:48.990> because<00:06:49.469> after<00:06:50.069> a<00:06:50.099> month<00:06:50.400> of

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
be a while because after a month of

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.390 
be a while because after a month of
playing<00:06:51.030> and<00:06:51.360> yes<00:06:51.650> sometimes<00:06:52.650> struggling

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
playing and yes sometimes struggling

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.809 
playing and yes sometimes struggling
with<00:06:53.610> the<00:06:53.729> simulation<00:06:54.360> I<00:06:55.250> definitely<00:06:56.250> need<00:06:56.789> a

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 
with the simulation I definitely need a

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:05.480 
with the simulation I definitely need a
Brit<00:06:57.180> breath<00:06:57.780> of<00:06:57.990> fresh<00:06:58.169> air<00:06:59.810> so<00:07:00.810> I<00:07:01.819> think<00:07:04.490> this

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
Brit breath of fresh air so I think this

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.499 
Brit breath of fresh air so I think this
is<00:07:05.699> all<00:07:05.880> for<00:07:06.210> now<00:07:07.370> hope<00:07:08.370> you<00:07:08.940> have<00:07:09.090> found<00:07:09.330> this

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:09.509 
is all for now hope you have found this

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.459 
is all for now hope you have found this
video<00:07:10.139> useful<00:07:10.409> and<00:07:11.479> if<00:07:12.479> so<00:07:12.719> I<00:07:12.960> would<00:07:13.080> greatly

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:13.469 
video useful and if so I would greatly

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:15.649 
video useful and if so I would greatly
