00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
almost needs a verbal tutorial like this

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
almost needs a verbal tutorial like this
to<00:00:15.389> explain<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.960> cuz<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> hard<00:00:16.920> thing<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
to explain it cuz it's a hard thing to

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910 
to explain it cuz it's a hard thing to
write<00:00:17.580> about<00:00:17.730> because<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.539> subjective<00:00:19.260> when

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
write about because it's subjective when

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.400 
write about because it's subjective when
I'm<00:00:20.010> talking<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.580> reasons<00:00:21.029> why<00:00:21.410> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
I'm talking about the reasons why the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.849 
I'm talking about the reasons why the
it's<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.980> subjective<00:00:23.220> kind<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.119> thing<00:00:24.859> matched

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it's a subjective kind of thing matched

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.400 
it's a subjective kind of thing matched
always<00:00:26.580> felt<00:00:26.970> tight<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.779> me<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.349> I

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
always felt tight to me you know what I

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.749 
always felt tight to me you know what I
mean<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.769> played<00:00:30.080> thirty<00:00:31.080> years<00:00:31.590> probably<00:00:32.070> yeah

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
mean I played thirty years probably yeah

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.620 
mean I played thirty years probably yeah
maybe<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.329> last<00:00:33.540> 28<00:00:34.410> years<00:00:34.559> matched<00:00:35.630> not

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
maybe the last 28 years matched not

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.450 
maybe the last 28 years matched not
really<00:00:36.870> knowing<00:00:37.079> any<00:00:37.350> better<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.829> that's

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
really knowing any better just that's

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.030 
really knowing any better just that's
kind<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> grew<00:00:39.000> up<00:00:39.059> playing<00:00:39.710> but<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.829> my

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
kind of how I grew up playing but as my

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360 
kind of how I grew up playing but as my
senses<00:00:41.340> kind<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> became<00:00:42.090> more<00:00:42.450> acute<00:00:43.370> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
senses kind of became more acute you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
senses kind of became more acute you
know<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> started<00:00:45.059> paying<00:00:45.239> attention<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
know and I started paying attention to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.840 
know and I started paying attention to
movement<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.610> economy<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> motion<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
movement and an economy of motion I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.000 
movement and an economy of motion I
started<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.170> look<00:00:52.170> at<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> things<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.920> are

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
started to look at the things that are

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.270 
started to look at the things that are
holding<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.520> back<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.320> little<00:00:55.320> bit<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.800> what

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
holding me back a little bit and what

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.170 
holding me back a little bit and what
that<00:00:56.460> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.789> brought<00:00:57.000> me<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> grip<00:00:57.899> I

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
that kind of brought me to the grip I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.920 
that kind of brought me to the grip I
started<00:01:01.520> realizing<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> matched<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.660> kind

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
started realizing that matched was kind

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.420 
started realizing that matched was kind
of<00:01:03.989> getting<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.320> my<00:01:04.439> way<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.070> not

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
of getting in my way a little bit not

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.380 
of getting in my way a little bit not
only<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.330> felt<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:08.390> tight

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
only that but I felt kind of like tight

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.219 
only that but I felt kind of like tight
mm-hmm<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.189> know<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.360> imagine<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.110> was

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
mm-hmm you know like like imagine I was

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
mm-hmm you know like like imagine I was
kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.500> wrapped<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.580> thought<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
kind of wrapped up like this I thought I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.320 
kind of wrapped up like this I thought I
came<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> couldn't<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.350> anywhere<00:01:17.330> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
came here I couldn't go anywhere and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
came here I couldn't go anywhere and
conversely<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.590> kind<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.860> hold<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
conversely when I would kind of hold the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
conversely when I would kind of hold the
sticks<00:01:20.700> even<00:01:21.570> though<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> couldn't<00:01:21.990> play<00:01:22.229> but

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
sticks even though I couldn't play but

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.950 
sticks even though I couldn't play but
when<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> could<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.130> hold<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> sticks

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
when I could just hold the sticks

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.580 
when I could just hold the sticks
traditional<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.110> felt<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> openness<00:01:27.470> kind<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
traditional I felt this openness kind of

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.330 
traditional I felt this openness kind of
take<00:01:28.829> over<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:30.079> was<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.110> open<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.250> know

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
take over like I was just open you know

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.429 
take over like I was just open you know
the<00:01:32.579> duct<00:01:33.540> tape<00:01:33.780> would<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.200> come<00:01:34.380> off

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the duct tape would kind of come off

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
the duct tape would kind of come off
just<00:01:35.070> been<00:01:35.250> holding<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.759> even<00:01:36.119> though<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> had

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
just been holding it even though I had

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.440 
just been holding it even though I had
no<00:01:36.630> functionality<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.729> then<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.329> other

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
no functionality and then the other

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.789 
no functionality and then the other
thing<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> noticed<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.590> far<00:01:40.740> as

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
thing I noticed you know as far as

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.539 
thing I noticed you know as far as
timing<00:01:41.220> even<00:01:41.670> matches<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.689> linear

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
timing even matches a very linear

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.080 
timing even matches a very linear
movement<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:46.170> really<00:01:47.100> try<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> place<00:01:47.759> all

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
movement and I really try to place all

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
movement and I really try to place all
my<00:01:48.119> note<00:01:48.689> attacks<00:01:49.909> purposefully<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.299> then

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
my note attacks purposefully so then

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.020 
my note attacks purposefully so then
each<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.649> almost<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.130> archery<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.820> know

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
each it's almost like archery you know

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
each it's almost like archery you know
you're<00:01:54.210> hitting<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.020> red<00:01:55.590> dot<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> center

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you're hitting the red dot in the center

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.819 
you're hitting the red dot in the center
you<00:01:56.909> don't<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> mean<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.719> red<00:01:57.930> dots<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.469> big

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
you don't I mean the red dots this big

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.830 
you don't I mean the red dots this big
so<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.250> don't<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.850> hit<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.210> center<00:02:00.509> of

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
so you don't have to hit the center of

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.679 
so you don't have to hit the center of
the<00:02:00.960> center<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.100> wiggle<00:02:02.670> room<00:02:02.909> right

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the center you have a wiggle room right

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.830 
the center you have a wiggle room right
a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:03.990> bit<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.649> yeah<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.630> since<00:02:06.630> I'm

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
a little bit but yeah but since I'm

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.859 
a little bit but yeah but since I'm
trying<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> hit<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.500> exactly<00:02:08.459> where<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> want<00:02:09.629> it

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
trying to hit it exactly where I want it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.010 
trying to hit it exactly where I want it
each<00:02:10.020> time<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.910> noticed<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.180> would<00:02:12.420> match

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
each time I noticed that would match

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.340 
each time I noticed that would match
so<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.940> economical<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.180> linear<00:02:15.900> that

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
so it's so economical and linear that

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.200 
so it's so economical and linear that
the<00:02:16.530> note<00:02:17.160> would<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.580> there<00:02:17.760> kind<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.090> before

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
the note would get there kind of before

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.540 
the note would get there kind of before
of<00:02:18.630> my<00:02:18.810> brain<00:02:19.110> wanted<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.190> wanted<00:02:20.490> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
of my brain wanted it to if I wanted to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.920 
of my brain wanted it to if I wanted to
lay<00:02:20.790> back<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.080> almost<00:02:22.290> needed<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:24.330> distance

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
lay back so I almost needed the distance

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.080 
lay back so I almost needed the distance
that<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.920> stick<00:02:26.190> travel<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.030> take<00:02:27.240> longer
