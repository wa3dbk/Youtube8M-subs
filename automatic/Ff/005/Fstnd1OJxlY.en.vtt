hey<00:00:00.810> everyone<00:00:01.260> its<00:00:01.439> Thomas<00:00:01.920> here<00:00:02.159> today<00:00:02.909> I'm

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey everyone its Thomas here today I'm

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.120 
hey everyone its Thomas here today I'm
going<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.810> explain<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.529> pretty<00:00:04.770> advanced

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
going to explain a pretty advanced

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.460 
going to explain a pretty advanced
concept<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:06.180> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> be<00:00:06.540> using<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
concept we're going to be using the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.180 
concept we're going to be using the
ultrasonic<00:00:08.160> sensor<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:09.300> power<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.500> motor<00:00:10.679> so

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
ultrasonic sensor to power the motor so

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.850 
ultrasonic sensor to power the motor so
the<00:00:12.059> ultrasonic<00:00:12.840> sensor<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> read

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the ultrasonic sensor is going to read

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.840 
the ultrasonic sensor is going to read
in<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> distance<00:00:14.610> value<00:00:16.100> so<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.820> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
in the distance value so if it is a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.609 
in the distance value so if it is a
certain<00:00:18.210> distance<00:00:18.539> away<00:00:18.630> from<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> wall<00:00:19.020> that

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
certain distance away from the wall that

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.349 
certain distance away from the wall that
distance<00:00:20.100> will<00:00:20.279> Bend<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.520> will<00:00:21.000> then<00:00:21.180> be

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
distance will Bend that will then be

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.470 
distance will Bend that will then be
driving<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.529> power<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> motors<00:00:24.060> for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
driving the power for the motors for

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.400 
driving the power for the motors for
your<00:00:24.600> robot<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.769> if<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:27.480> haven't<00:00:27.900> used<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
your robot so if you haven't used the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.950 
your robot so if you haven't used the
ultrasonic<00:00:28.920> sensor<00:00:29.220> before<00:00:29.400> or<00:00:29.970> really

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
ultrasonic sensor before or really

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.190 
ultrasonic sensor before or really
understand<00:00:31.940> motor<00:00:32.940> basics<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.660> would<00:00:33.899> review

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
understand motor basics I would review

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610 
understand motor basics I would review
my<00:00:34.380> videos<00:00:35.090> but<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> guys<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.930> excel<00:00:37.350> in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
my videos but if you guys do excel in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.709 
my videos but if you guys do excel in
those<00:00:37.860> areas<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:39.059> might<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.450> something

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
those areas this might be something

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.600 
those areas this might be something
worth<00:00:40.079> learning<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:41.190> definitely<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
worth learning and it's definitely a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.299 
worth learning and it's definitely a
really<00:00:41.850> cool<00:00:42.149> exercise<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.890> first<00:00:44.129> thing

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
really cool exercise so the first thing

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.790 
really cool exercise so the first thing
that<00:00:44.550> we're<00:00:44.670> gonna<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:46.200> usually<00:00:46.379> start

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that we're gonna do is we usually start

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
that we're gonna do is we usually start
on<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.370> common<00:00:48.300> pallet<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.870> today<00:00:49.079> we're

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
on this common pallet but today we're

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
on this common pallet but today we're
gonna<00:00:49.379> upgrade<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> complete<00:00:50.399> pallet<00:00:50.760> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
gonna upgrade to the complete pallet so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.110 
gonna upgrade to the complete pallet so
we<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.539> some<00:00:51.719> more<00:00:51.899> advanced<00:00:53.000> actions

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
we can do some more advanced actions

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.900 
we can do some more advanced actions
so<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:55.410> we're<00:00:55.559> first<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.610> we're

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so what we're first gonna do is we're

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.340 
so what we're first gonna do is we're
gonna<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> loop<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.190> within<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.000> loop

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
gonna have a loop and within that loop

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.600 
gonna have a loop and within that loop
the<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:04.680> thing<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.040> want<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.400> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the first thing that we want to do is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.539 
the first thing that we want to do is
read<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.450> freaks<00:01:06.810> ultrasonic<00:01:07.380> data<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
read in all freaks ultrasonic data so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.980 
read in all freaks ultrasonic data so
we're<00:01:09.450> gonna<00:01:10.010> use<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> ultrasonic<00:01:11.610> sensor

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
we're gonna use the ultrasonic sensor

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.980 
we're gonna use the ultrasonic sensor
and<00:01:13.850> we're<00:01:14.850> gonna<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.600> centimeters

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and we're gonna put it in centimeters

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.830 
and we're gonna put it in centimeters
for<00:01:16.530> today<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:18.380> we're<00:01:19.380> gonna<00:01:19.439> put<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.830> 250

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
for today and we're gonna put this 250

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.090 
for today and we're gonna put this 250
that<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:21.960> before<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:25.049> we're<00:01:25.590> gonna<00:01:25.680> be

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that was before so now we're gonna be

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.140 
that was before so now we're gonna be
running<00:01:26.520> motors<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.829> output<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
running motors with that output so the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
running motors with that output so the
output<00:01:30.540> for<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> sensor<00:01:31.320> which<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
output for the sensor which is the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
output for the sensor which is the
distance<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.240> input<00:01:33.750> for

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
distance is going to be the input for

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.510 
distance is going to be the input for
the<00:01:34.049> motor<00:01:34.290> which<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.340> power<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.520> we're

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the motor which is the power so we're

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.969 
the motor which is the power so we're
gonna<00:01:38.610> click<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.119> drop<00:01:39.659> down<00:01:39.689> menu<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.860> on

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
gonna click this drop down menu here on

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.940 
gonna click this drop down menu here on
the<00:01:41.340> left<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> icon<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.649> there<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.799> lot

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the left of the icon and there are a lot

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.880 
the left of the icon and there are a lot
of<00:01:43.979> different<00:01:44.659> complicated<00:01:45.659> inputs<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.649> but

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of different complicated inputs here but

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.899 
of different complicated inputs here but
the<00:01:47.009> only<00:01:47.130> one<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.490> we're<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.790> be

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the only one that we're going to be

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
the only one that we're going to be
worrying<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.320> today<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> power<00:01:49.829> which

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
worrying about today is the power which

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
worrying about today is the power which
we've<00:01:50.280> used<00:01:50.490> before<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.060> we're<00:01:51.630> gonna<00:01:51.720> take

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
we've used before so we're gonna take

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.719 
we've used before so we're gonna take
the<00:01:52.670> output<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.899> ultras<00:01:55.729> ultrasonic

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the output of the ultras ultrasonic

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
the output of the ultras ultrasonic
sensor<00:01:57.060> plug<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> into<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.290> power<00:01:58.469> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
sensor plug it into the power so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
sensor plug it into the power so
whatever<00:01:59.909> distance<00:02:00.210> away<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:01.200> robot<00:02:01.530> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
whatever distance away your robot is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.209 
whatever distance away your robot is
from<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.490> wall<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.090> object<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:04.770> will<00:02:04.890> be<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
from a wall and object that will be the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.570 
from a wall and object that will be the
corresponding<00:02:05.820> power<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:07.009> right<00:02:08.009> now<00:02:08.190> if

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
corresponding power so right now if

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.040 
corresponding power so right now if
we're<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.090> far<00:02:09.360> away<00:02:09.539> from<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:10.140> wall<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
we're really far away from a wall the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.309 
we're really far away from a wall the
the<00:02:13.050> row

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the row

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.170 
the row
we'll<00:02:13.829> drive<00:02:14.310> really<00:02:14.519> quickly<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:14.969> if<00:02:15.060> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
we'll drive really quickly and if it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.459 
we'll drive really quickly and if it
gets<00:02:15.239> closer<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.719> closer<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.019> closer<00:02:16.260> I'll

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
gets closer and closer and closer I'll

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.899 
gets closer and closer and closer I'll
slow<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.099> as<00:02:17.249> you<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.489> close<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
slow down so as you get close to the

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.000 
slow down so as you get close to the
wall<00:02:18.060> it'll<00:02:18.480> gradually<00:02:18.659> slow<00:02:19.019> down<00:02:19.049> however

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
wall it'll gradually slow down however

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.069 
wall it'll gradually slow down however
we<00:02:20.430> want<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:21.150> eventually<00:02:21.480> get<00:02:21.749> out<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.989> this

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
we want it to eventually get out of this

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.929 
we want it to eventually get out of this
loop<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:22.950> we're<00:02:23.099> gonna<00:02:23.189> control<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.760> route

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
loop so we're gonna control the route

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.050 
loop so we're gonna control the route
the<00:02:24.599> loop<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.590> sensor<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.639> sensor

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
the loop with a sensor and that sensor

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.990 
the loop with a sensor and that sensor
will<00:02:27.450> be<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.689> ultrasonic<00:02:28.230> sensor<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.280> once

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
will be the ultrasonic sensor so once

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.199 
will be the ultrasonic sensor so once
the<00:02:30.150> robot<00:02:30.480> gets<00:02:31.760> we're<00:02:32.760> gonna<00:02:32.879> switch<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
the robot gets we're gonna switch it to

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.550 
the robot gets we're gonna switch it to
centimeters<00:02:33.450> having<00:02:33.930> had<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.049> before

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
centimeters having had it before

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.440 
centimeters having had it before
less<00:02:35.010> than<00:02:35.450> 10<00:02:36.450> cm<00:02:36.659> centimeters<00:02:37.439> away<00:02:38.450> this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
less than 10 cm centimeters away this

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.539 
less than 10 cm centimeters away this
program<00:02:39.989> will<00:02:40.169> exit<00:02:40.439> out<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.709> loop<00:02:41.340> and

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
program will exit out of the loop and

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.300 
program will exit out of the loop and
the<00:02:42.590> robot<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.859> stop<00:02:44.129> moving<00:02:44.419> so<00:02:45.419> that's

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
the robot will stop moving so that's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.360 
the robot will stop moving so that's
pretty<00:02:47.310> much<00:02:47.549> how<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:47.909> power<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:49.079> robot<00:02:49.709> with

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
pretty much how you power a robot with

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.789 
pretty much how you power a robot with
an<00:02:50.519> ultrasonic<00:02:51.060> sensor<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.629> how<00:02:52.349> you<00:02:52.409> can

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
an ultrasonic sensor and how you can

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.610 
an ultrasonic sensor and how you can
gradually<00:02:53.400> slow<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.810> robot<00:02:55.260> with<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
gradually slow down that robot with the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.500 
gradually slow down that robot with the
ultrasonic<00:02:56.250> sensor<00:02:56.280> data<00:02:56.669> and<00:02:56.879> now<00:02:57.359> we're

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
ultrasonic sensor data and now we're

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.059 
ultrasonic sensor data and now we're
just<00:02:57.659> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.930> show<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.139> a<00:02:58.230> quick<00:02:58.469> video<00:02:58.650> of

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
just going to show you a quick video of

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.169 
just going to show you a quick video of
that<00:02:59.730> robot<00:03:00.120> working<00:03:00.599> in<00:03:00.870> action
