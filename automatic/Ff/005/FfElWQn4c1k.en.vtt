00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.200
 to play especially in the art of making them 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.690
 old-fashioned friends like my 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.330

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.789
 the old chain g star for bobby then 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.289
 I know there are some who 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.579
 already knew at the time and therefore 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.280
 well I hope that at or already a small 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.379
 series you will please you 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.960
 feed that makes me a lot 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 pleasure 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.949
 fuck you it makes me very happy 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 frankly take it back right now 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.860
 when I was watching a lot I was watching 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.560
 a lot of old videos on my 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.770
 lover doing the rolling is bugged judge in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.299
 devil x9 kind bisnode 3 and it made me 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 given a fucking urge to join a 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.030
 matter of but really a trick of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.080
 sick and so I tell myself why not 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.549
 resume this series springs on 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.369
 twitter for those who follow me on 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.350
 twitter again that's what does 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.280
 do not follow me frankly bam follow 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.470
 me it's better 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.060
 and those who do not have a good twitter 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.540
 it's a shame because it's really 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.369
 a very very useful tool you could 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.770
 to be aware of everything but everything but 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.850
 of all my activity brief they said 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 here I am reading on twitter 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.830
 shooting a surprise video and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.439
 maybe a recovery of an old 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.240
 series is here I imitated frac lease 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.159
 it's true take a rpg is not very 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.680
 smart in the secondary because 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.470
 it's long enough to go out way recovery 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.250
 of an old series and so bah there I 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.909
 did not get an answer because I'm 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.970
 all by yourself on twitter no jm no it's 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.470
 already 100 web was almost 180 me 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.660
 follow on twitter I think the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.400
 majority then would people go south 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.180
 but the majority of people come 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.540
 just fucked up my chain could 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.310
 a lot of bullets in the name it's me where 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.319
 I deny them in baroud the guy there I do not 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.120
 was going when fucking baroud and there by 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.920
 against chris shouting that it's okay 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.160
 all benefit me if they have yeah 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.319
 but he has a painting 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.040
 yes so you have because 180 that's 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.799
 really good 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.150
 and so here I would have recognized in 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.640
 did the baky people who knew me 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.780
 already because I already knew about 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.360
 the old chain the stars for bobby 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.680
 because only those can you can 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.940
 so know this series shit ah the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.510
 game is due to wait clinic the country 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.739
 job before killing him bontempi and I 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.810
 find it really interesting when we 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.450
 dangerous for this very first episode 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.269
 for this return neither callies killed the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.040
 a machine that stinks of a small drone 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.190
 scrambling for them all to break them 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.600
 balls I 'll play fast to your 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.290
 momentum I'm going to pick up the bars 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.220
 we'll have fun I say that but 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.829
 I do not know anything about flash 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.150
 just 15.8 from the first of the game 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.470
 it is the most important voltage fund 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.030
 even if we lose the most 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.290
 important in these series there during 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.810
 this series there it will be really fun 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.390
 also I intend to do I intend to do 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.810
 an ad about the full 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.609
 blur on crysis 2 so I'm really 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.319
 sorry friends I do not do you a thing 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.859
 kind like in vikings caltoros guard 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.579
 this game drunk me I stop everything not this 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.290
 play me drunk 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 yes I prefer to be honest with you I 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.310
 had it said way of a third episode 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.260
 no fourth that I got tired a little 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.530
 little because here I do not want to 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.060
 to play 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.190
 frankly I think I'm dying 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.480
 really do not want to play it and play a 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.239
 game you do not want to play 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.889
 it's really not great at all and it's 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.489
 why do we do low instead of you 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.769
 propose a regular series on crysis 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.170
 by playing it reluctantly I would say I 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.489
 prefer to offer you a series so on 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.859
 the reinforcements of is so this series there 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.109
 because she could be very 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.340
 interesting little drama of scrambling to 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.389
 the old true that I charge nickel 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.900
 I would have to get some mules 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:23.220
 where you then that you took too 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.800
 look for predator type did you see dad 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.080
 I say that anelka or yes more than 100 that 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.220
 pleases 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.110
 shit I have more balls I have nothing 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.909
 I have no more ammunition so we're going 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.979
 mudworms and my passion was needed 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.669
 although I 'm dying and yeah I'm going 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.889
 replace haye 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.979
 I will replace in quotation marks low 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.190
 the plateau on francky the blue plaid on 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.680
 crysis 2 so by this series because 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.180
 it did not play well to make 2 and a series 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.130
 on call of it really does not hurt 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.099
 knowing that you have all come on 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.389
 my chain through call of duty 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.990
 damn good luck then that but 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.460
 it had not missed at all that's 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.570
 and so here I have you a little bit 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.820
 the device then as for the 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.200
 full blur that you tell me I was 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.830
 paradoxical but where do you say he gives up 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.020
 not yet 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.520
 well yes and yet I would tend 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.740

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.940
 I really want to play it will be 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.640

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.880

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.080
