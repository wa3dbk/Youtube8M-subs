different browsers render different
websites<00:01:04.019> differently<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:04.769> they

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
websites differently because they

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.240 
websites differently because they
interpret<00:01:05.610> what's<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> page<00:01:06.330> differently

now<00:01:08.250> while<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> find<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> great

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
now while I find this to be a great

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.890 
now while I find this to be a great
academic<00:01:10.170> exercise<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.659> useful<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> want

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
academic exercise and useful if you want

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
academic exercise and useful if you want
to<00:01:13.049> tweak<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.650> website<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> its<00:01:14.460> fullest

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to tweak your website to its fullest

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
to tweak your website to its fullest
it's<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.619> practical<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's really not very practical if you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
it's really not very practical if you
have<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.180> more<00:01:18.330> than<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.540> few<00:01:18.720> pages<00:01:19.340> for

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
have to put up more than a few pages for

have to put up more than a few pages for
that<00:01:20.490> we're<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> our<00:01:21.210> next

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that we're going to go to our next

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
that we're going to go to our next
option<00:01:22.200> our<00:01:22.470> next<00:01:22.680> option<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
option our next option is to have a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
option our next option is to have a
program<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.570> creates<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> website<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.380> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
program that creates the website for you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
program that creates the website for you
and<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.729> out<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> fact

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and what you get out of this is the fact

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
and what you get out of this is the fact
that<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.990> website<00:01:28.140> gets<00:01:28.500> created<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.979> lot

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that your website gets created a lot

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
that your website gets created a lot
faster<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:30.960> results<00:01:31.110> as

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
faster you can see your results as

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.310 
faster you can see your results as
you're<00:01:31.770> typing<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.900> you<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.110> create

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
you're typing and you can create

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.280 
you're typing and you can create
visually<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> downside<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:36.990> they

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
visually the downside to this is they

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.520 
visually the downside to this is they
still<00:01:37.770> produce<00:01:38.640> web<00:01:39.630> code<00:01:39.900> that's<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.290> quite

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
still produce web code that's not quite

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370 
still produce web code that's not quite
as<00:01:40.799> perfect<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> could<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.140> sometimes<00:01:43.140> it's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
as perfect as it could be sometimes it's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
as perfect as it could be sometimes it's
bloated<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.100> especially<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> case<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
bloated and especially in the case of a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630 
bloated and especially in the case of a
program<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:45.869> Microsoft<00:01:46.470> Word<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.280> really

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
program like Microsoft Word it's really

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210

template and from this template you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.719 
template and from this template you
could<00:01:57.060> use<00:01:57.240> option<00:01:57.780> 3<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:59.189> content

it<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> work<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.450> define<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:11.069> basic

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it to work in and you define the basic

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.010 
it to work in and you define the basic
look<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.239> but

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
look of it but

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.380 
look of it but
in<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> back<00:02:13.500> end<00:02:13.800> you'll<00:02:14.220> use<00:02:14.520> something<00:02:15.240> to

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
in the back end you'll use something to

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.710 
in the back end you'll use something to
define<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.200> goes<00:02:17.160> where<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.150> you'll<00:02:18.540> have

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
define what goes where so you'll have

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.750 
define what goes where so you'll have
your<00:02:18.840> template<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.500> shows<00:02:19.770> your<00:02:20.490> header
