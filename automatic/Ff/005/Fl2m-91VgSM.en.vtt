00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 dear friends I recently made a list 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.130
 top 10 best fat burners for 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.109
 to lose weight 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:25.320
 now the first lesson is a list of five 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:29.760
 fat burner is the first part of the video 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.550
 I start the lesson with 10 places that is from 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.540
 the most more or less weak 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 escalating to the strongest and on 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.809
 first place in our hit parade with us 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:49.070
 there will be caffeine and guarana and a little bit 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.860
 I will explain why caffeine and guarana 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.750
 These are substances that are drugs that are 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.079
 help of course to accelerate the metabolism 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.250
 in the body there are metabolic processes and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.640
 I actively melt it I give it 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.880
 drug last place not because 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.420
 they are so ineffective he in our 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.020
 Top 10 are the most effective but as I have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.520
 said 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.390
 from last place to movie 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.740
 waiting for fat but you need to know the dosage 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.080
 dosage should be large 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 guarana is also a very strong stimulant 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.860
 which also contains caffeine mainly 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.860
 caffeine works there and give the last 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.909
 place because not everyone 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.430
 who wants to lose weight 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.400
 especially if it is old age or 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 a lot of weight you have hypertension usually 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.590
 i.e. high blood pressure 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.429
 and caffeine from guarana will not give you 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.020
 use them because caffeine 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.939
 raises blood pressure you 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.859
 it will be bad to become 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.509
 you will not be able to use the data 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:05.439
 drugs but for those people like who 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.090
 low fat mass 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.940
 blood pressure ones can 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.690
 use caffeine loosely on the ninth 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.830
 place in our parade l-carnitine he 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.819
 weaker than caffeine but I give him the ninth 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 honorable ninth place because he 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:31.250
 perfectly safe for men and for 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:36.049
 women and for any age it doesn't matter 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.500
 you are 20 years old or you are 60 or 70 years old 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.959
 it is absolutely safe and harmless 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.530
 no side effects additive exactly 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.549
 so we will have l-carnitine on 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.480
 ninth place l-carnitine burns well 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:57.470
 fat it belongs to the linden tropics series then 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.739
 eat it breaks down fatty molecules 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.470
 takes them to the bloodstream and then 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.769
 when we train and then these fatty 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.109
 acid splitting gives us energy here 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.430
 so we lose weight that is such 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.870
 process but as I told you already and you 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.829
 probably understood 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.010
 without physical exertion or store not 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.430
 works if caffeine works 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.250
 l-carnitine is not, but because of its safety 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.150
 ninth place in eighth place 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.090
 we will have methionine this amino acid 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.130
 part of the protein is a good drug 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.370
 which you can buy at the pharmacy 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:45.140
 I tested him very often my wife 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.540
 he was put on methionine 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.319
 time if you know how to apply it 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.240
 correct that is, that he did not inflict 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.180
 some serious consequences 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.090
 do not need to exceed the dosage because 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.560
 need to know yet this medicinal 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.260
 although the drug belongs to a number 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.220
 amino acids and it needs to be combined 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.940
 to combine with other 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.850
 amino acids in normal dosages 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.790
 mityanin he grows muscle mass and he 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.970
 the most important thing at the same time it burns 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.970
 fat let it breaks down fat 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.700
 the main thing is fighting internal fat so 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.610
 sometimes called fat 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.550
 deposited on internal organs 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.480
 and sometimes inside the internal organs 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.330
 especially liver suffers liver 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.180
 clogged with neutral fat 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.820
 using methionine this problem 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.970
 eliminated and so eighth 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.919
 methionine on the 7th place we also have 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.910
 medical drug called 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.160
 ok watermelon is we will have a blocker 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.040
 carbohydrate 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.790
 when a person eats can't hold back 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.630
 his appetite if he went through there 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.390
 carbohydrate meal then it can 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.810
 drink and how is the base of this drug is not 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.840
 allows you to digest glucose that is 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.900
 blocks glucose and also a little sleep and 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.190
 lowers blood glucose 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.530
 well basically it's a carbohydrate blocker 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:27.110
 many high level athletes 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.919
 use this drug to 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.580
 lose weight 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:38.800
 that is, you have no excess carbohydrates 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:42.740
 You can normally lose weight but I think that 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.330
 take such a drug is inappropriate 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:50.669
 easier to go on a diet a little 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.680
 spare carbs add protein and we 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.870
 repeat the same process why 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.949
 spend money and apply that 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.990
 strictly medical medicine 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.979
 that's why we gave him this 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.610
 here is the sixth place we will have 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:11.310
 lindaksa is sometimes also called 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.689
 reduxin such a drug is not to be confused with 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.139
 redux light 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:17.460
 it is more to sports nutrition 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.830
 include a 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:27.990
 reduksin its active substance 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:31.860
 sibutramine this drug is anorectic 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.490
 that is, the drug in order to reduce 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:39.719
 strongly reduce body weight is prescribed 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:43.199
 it exclusively for those doctors have 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:46.199
 which there is the last stage of obesity but 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:47.879
 for some reason, some athletes use 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.719
 this drug 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:54.240
 he really works but he 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:58.860
 a lot of side effects that is he 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:02.310
 very very insecure that's why 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.069
 I give him the sixth place you want to receive 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.110
