ramp from corsair the Vengeance low

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.500 
ramp from corsair the Vengeance low
profile<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.220> bran<00:00:08.519> brand-new<00:00:09.179> i

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
think this came out like a week ago or

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.279 
think this came out like a week ago or
so<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:13.320> i'll<00:00:13.559> show<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:14.210> some<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.630> unique

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
so and i'll show you some of the unique

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.710 
so and i'll show you some of the unique
features<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.310> has<00:00:17.390> but<00:00:18.390> right<00:00:18.690> off

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
features that this one has but right off

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.650 
features that this one has but right off
the<00:00:18.960> bed<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.439> tell<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.949> white<00:00:20.660> heat

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the bed you can tell it's white heat

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.120 
the bed you can tell it's white heat
sinks<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:22.650> already<00:00:22.859> pretty

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
sinks on it so that's already pretty

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.120 
sinks on it so that's already pretty
special<00:00:23.960> but<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> main<00:00:25.289> thing<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
special but the main thing about it is

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.089 
special but the main thing about it is
that<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.480> has<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.720> low<00:00:28.170> extra-low<00:00:29.039> voltage

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that it has the low extra-low voltage

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.659 
that it has the low extra-low voltage
and<00:00:29.760> that's<00:00:30.210> 1.35<00:00:30.779> volks<00:00:31.500> right<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and that's 1.35 volks right there this

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.630 
and that's 1.35 volks right there this
only<00:00:32.880> comes<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.329> 8<00:00:33.570> gigabyte<00:00:34.050> kit<00:00:34.710> it's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
only comes in the 8 gigabyte kit it's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
only comes in the 8 gigabyte kit it's

generation<00:00:42.780> ones<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.500> pretty<00:00:43.739> sure<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> still

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
generation ones I'm pretty sure it still

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.690 
generation ones I'm pretty sure it still
works<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> first<00:00:44.789> generation<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:46.700> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
works with the first generation but you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.380 
works with the first generation but you
know<00:00:47.870> doesn't<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.050> matter<00:00:49.200> i<00:00:49.320> don't<00:00:49.590> know

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
know doesn't really matter i don't know

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.850 
know doesn't really matter i don't know
for<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.510> though<00:00:51.690> I'm<00:00:51.930> using<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.640> 2600<00:00:53.640> k<00:00:54.590> in<00:00:55.590> my

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
for me though I'm using the 2600 k in my

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.779 
for me though I'm using the 2600 k in my
build<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.960> opted<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.890> because

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
build and I opted for this one because

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
build and I opted for this one because
what<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.960> using<00:01:01.109> before<00:01:01.350> or<00:01:01.879> right<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.890> was

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
what I was using before or right now was

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
what I was using before or right now was
the<00:01:05.070> muskan<00:01:05.489> 2<00:01:05.790> x<00:01:06.000> 2<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.659> only<00:01:06.840> four

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the muskan 2 x 2 that's only four

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.410 
the muskan 2 x 2 that's only four
gigabytes<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:09.540> wasn't<00:01:09.960> enough<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:11.150> from<00:01:12.150> me

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
gigabytes and it wasn't enough I from me

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.820 
gigabytes and it wasn't enough I from me
personally<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.260> when<00:01:13.530> i<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:13.680> playing

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
personally because when i was playing

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.130 
personally because when i was playing
bad<00:01:14.010> company<00:01:14.159> 2<00:01:14.610> i<00:01:14.640> always<00:01:15.000> got<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.360> this

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
bad company 2 i always got this this

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.590 
bad company 2 i always got this this
message<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.860> oh<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.430> systems<00:01:18.210> running<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
message like oh your systems running a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.920 
message like oh your systems running a
little<00:01:18.780> slow<00:01:18.930> due<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> less<00:01:19.799> ram<00:01:20.040> or<00:01:20.310> whatever

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
little slow due to less ram or whatever

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.810 
little slow due to less ram or whatever
so<00:01:21.930> i<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.530> well<00:01:22.890> i<00:01:23.159> didn't<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.909> but

sort of wanted to I guess sort of one
you<00:01:30.060> guys<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.390> how<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> will

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you guys know how it is right so I will

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.350 
you guys know how it is right so I will
be<00:01:33.570> doing<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.140> unboxing<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> guys<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
be doing the unboxing for you guys and I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.630 
be doing the unboxing for you guys and I
will<00:01:36.420> try<00:01:37.670> for<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> XMP<00:01:39.770> enabled<00:01:40.770> since<00:01:41.520> this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
will try for the XMP enabled since this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.719 
will try for the XMP enabled since this
is<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.479> bit<00:01:42.600> lower<00:01:43.130> voltage<00:01:44.130> set<00:01:44.640> up

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
is a little bit lower voltage set up

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.690 
is a little bit lower voltage set up
already<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.619> should<00:01:46.890> overclock<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
already this one should overclock a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.249 
already this one should overclock a
little<00:01:48.299> bit<00:01:48.420> better<00:01:48.540> than<00:01:48.990> their<00:01:49.439> original

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
little bit better than their original

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.010 
little bit better than their original
1.5<00:01:52.259> volts<00:01:52.680> also<00:01:53.460> vengeance<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.659> little

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
1.5 volts also vengeance a little

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.940 
1.5 volts also vengeance a little
profile<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:57.149> normal<00:01:57.829> heatsinks<00:01:58.829> that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
profile and the normal heatsinks that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.380 
profile and the normal heatsinks that
usually<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.549> those<00:01:59.700> ones<00:01:59.909> came<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> couple

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
usually see those ones came out a couple

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.560 
usually see those ones came out a couple
years<00:02:00.689> ago<00:02:00.869> already<00:02:01.460> alright<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.759> i'll<00:02:03.390> be

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
years ago already alright so i'll be

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
years ago already alright so i'll be
throwing<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.170> case<00:02:04.500> give<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.040> guys<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
throwing it in the case give you guys a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.789 
throwing it in the case give you guys a
look<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:06.869> does<00:02:07.079> go<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> color<00:02:07.619> scheme

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
look it does go with the color scheme

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.600 
look it does go with the color scheme
pretty<00:02:08.340> well<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.789> i<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:10.250> but<00:02:11.250> i'll<00:02:11.400> show<00:02:11.550> you

pretty well I i think but i'll show you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.570 
pretty well I i think but i'll show you
guys<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.090> when<00:02:12.300> I

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.160 
guys in a bit when I
the<00:02:12.700> case<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.210> I'll<00:02:13.450> throw<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.900> there<00:02:14.050> all

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the case and I'll throw it in there all

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.990 
the case and I'll throw it in there all
right<00:02:14.200> I'll<00:02:15.070> be<00:02:15.190> right<00:02:15.220> back<00:02:15.400> all<00:02:15.670> right<00:02:15.850> so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
right I'll be right back all right so

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.330 
right I'll be right back all right so
before<00:02:16.210> I<00:02:16.420> throw<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.990> into<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.260> case<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:18.070> just

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
before I throw it into the case I just

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.270 
before I throw it into the case I just
want<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> let<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.120> guys<00:02:19.240> see<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:20.280> packaging

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
want to let you guys see the packaging

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.820 
want to let you guys see the packaging
that<00:02:21.640> course<00:02:22.030> i<00:02:22.180> did<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:22.600> each<00:02:22.840> individual<00:02:23.590> ram

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
that course i did so each individual ram

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.790 
that course i did so each individual ram
stick<00:02:24.160> they<00:02:24.340> have<00:02:24.580> their<00:02:24.790> own<00:02:24.820> clamshell

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
stick they have their own clamshell

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.820 
stick they have their own clamshell
plastic<00:02:26.800> case<00:02:27.070> with<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:28.530> which<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.680> pretty

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
plastic case with it which is pretty

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.950 
plastic case with it which is pretty
nice<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.370> don't<00:02:30.640> know<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.090> muskan<00:02:31.480> ones<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.840> I

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
nice I don't know the muskan ones that I

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.950 
nice I don't know the muskan ones that I
had<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.350> was<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:34.000> whole<00:02:34.210> thing<00:02:34.480> was<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.840> a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
had it was just the whole thing was in a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.160 
had it was just the whole thing was in a
clamshell<00:02:35.680> case<00:02:36.100> so<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> Corsair<00:02:37.690> sort<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.080> did

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
clamshell case so a Corsair sort of did

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.840 
clamshell case so a Corsair sort of did
a<00:02:38.200> one<00:02:38.440> up<00:02:38.590> but<00:02:39.370> these<00:02:39.490> are<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> lot<00:02:39.820> more

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
a one up but these are a lot more

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.430 
a one up but these are a lot more
expensive<00:02:40.270> than<00:02:40.570> these<00:02:40.750> guys<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:41.170> so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
expensive than these guys here so

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.370 
expensive than these guys here so
whatever<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:43.450> my<00:02:43.570> color<00:02:43.810> scheme<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.320> I

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
whatever so for my color scheme that I

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.190 
whatever so for my color scheme that I
tried<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.360> initially<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.570> my<00:02:46.660> build<00:02:46.930> it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
tried to do initially for my build it

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.580 
tried to do initially for my build it
was<00:02:47.320> for<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.770> golden<00:02:48.250> golden<00:02:49.120> black<00:02:49.590> theme

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
was for the golden golden black theme

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.170 
was for the golden golden black theme
and<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.840> i<00:02:53.830> have<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> white<00:02:54.250> case<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:54.790> i<00:02:54.820> thought

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and and i have a white case so i thought

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.660 
and and i have a white case so i thought
these<00:02:55.959> guys<00:02:56.290> here<00:02:56.770> would<00:02:56.980> be<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.190> perfect<00:02:57.610> match

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
these guys here would be a perfect match

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.480 
these guys here would be a perfect match
and<00:02:58.240> it<00:02:58.810> sort<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.140> was<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.040> little<00:03:00.250> bit<00:03:00.340> more

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
and it sort of was a little bit more

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.300 
and it sort of was a little bit more
than<00:03:00.550> what<00:03:00.880> i<00:03:00.910> wanted<00:03:02.160> especially<00:03:03.160> with<00:03:03.220> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
than what i wanted especially with the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.970 
than what i wanted especially with the
eight<00:03:03.459> gigs<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.080> there<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.230> go<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.740> does

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
eight gigs so there you go this does

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.190 
eight gigs so there you go this does
have<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> black<00:03:06.580> PCB<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.630> kind<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.900> hard<00:03:07.959> to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
have a black PCB it is kind of hard to

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.530 
have a black PCB it is kind of hard to
see<00:03:08.500> but<00:03:08.740> i<00:03:08.980> know<00:03:09.730> some<00:03:10.120> people<00:03:10.150> out<00:03:10.480> there

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
see but i know some people out there

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.060 
see but i know some people out there
might<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.110> little<00:03:11.230> bit<00:03:11.380> picky<00:03:11.709> about<00:03:11.860> their

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
might be a little bit picky about their

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.580 
might be a little bit picky about their
PCB<00:03:12.580> color<00:03:12.820> they<00:03:13.510> don't<00:03:13.690> want<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.930> green<00:03:14.110> they

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
PCB color they don't want the green they

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.320 
PCB color they don't want the green they
want<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:14.860> black<00:03:15.130> but<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:15.640> one's<00:03:15.850> black<00:03:16.030> so

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
want the black but this one's black so

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.840 
want the black but this one's black so
it's<00:03:16.450> all<00:03:16.570> cool<00:03:16.810> i<00:03:17.280> forgot<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.340> mention<00:03:18.430> these

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
it's all cool i forgot to mention these

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.880 
it's all cool i forgot to mention these
are<00:03:19.030> cl9<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:22.769> 9999<00:03:23.769> 24<00:03:24.700> uh-huh<00:03:25.890> pretty

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
are cl9 that's a 9999 24 uh-huh pretty

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.790 
are cl9 that's a 9999 24 uh-huh pretty
standard<00:03:27.100> for<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.820> timing<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:29.410> they<00:03:29.470> are<00:03:29.620> low

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
standard for the timing but they are low

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.070 
standard for the timing but they are low
voltage<00:03:30.160> so<00:03:30.430> i'll<00:03:30.700> be<00:03:30.820> doing<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.239> little<00:03:31.959> bit

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
voltage so i'll be doing a little bit

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.690 
voltage so i'll be doing a little bit
overclocking<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:32.830> guys<00:03:32.950> it's<00:03:33.489> going<00:03:33.640> to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
overclocking for you guys it's going to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.820 
overclocking for you guys it's going to
be<00:03:33.760> my<00:03:33.910> first<00:03:34.120> time<00:03:34.209> overclocking<00:03:34.720> ram<00:03:35.080> but

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
be my first time overclocking ram but

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.070 
be my first time overclocking ram but
i'll<00:03:36.130> let<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.430> know<00:03:36.459> how<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:37.180> goes<00:03:37.630> alright

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
i'll let you know how that goes alright

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.040 
i'll let you know how that goes alright
so<00:03:38.230> I'm<00:03:38.320> going<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.500> throw<00:03:38.620> one<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.860> case

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
so I'm going to throw one in the case

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.090 
so I'm going to throw one in the case
don't<00:03:41.050> you<00:03:41.110> guys<00:03:41.230> have<00:03:41.290> a<00:03:41.410> look<00:03:41.530> alright

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
don't you guys have a look alright

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.190 
don't you guys have a look alright
alright<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:42.910> there<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.209> go<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.660> just<00:03:43.840> installed

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
alright so there you go I just installed

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.110 
alright so there you go I just installed
the<00:03:44.410> RAM<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.160> played<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> little<00:03:45.700> bit<00:03:45.940> with

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the RAM and I played a little bit with

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.920 
the RAM and I played a little bit with
the<00:03:46.540> with<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.350> bios<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:50.230> i<00:03:50.620> enabled<00:03:51.390> XMP<00:03:52.390> but

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
the with the bios but i enabled XMP but

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.050 
the with the bios but i enabled XMP but
I<00:03:52.959> wasn't<00:03:53.440> too<00:03:53.530> sure<00:03:53.560> what<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.130> was<00:03:54.430> doing<00:03:54.850> I

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
I wasn't too sure what I was doing I

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.370 
I wasn't too sure what I was doing I
don't<00:03:55.209> want<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.480> change<00:03:55.630> any<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:55.989> timing

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
don't want to change any of the timing

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.990 
don't want to change any of the timing
so<00:03:56.530> I'm<00:03:56.620> not<00:03:56.769> going<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:56.950> do<00:03:57.100> any<00:03:57.310> overclocking

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
so I'm not going to do any overclocking

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.750 
so I'm not going to do any overclocking
today<00:03:58.410> I'm<00:03:59.410> going<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.620> be<00:03:59.890> reading<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.489> little

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
today I'm going to be reading a little

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.750 
today I'm going to be reading a little
bit<00:04:00.880> later<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.560> how<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.620> do<00:04:02.800> that<00:04:02.950> properly<00:04:03.280> but

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
bit later on how to do that properly but

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.870 
bit later on how to do that properly but

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
timing so there's triple 9 24 at one

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.270 
timing so there's triple 9 24 at one
point<00:04:09.760> three<00:04:09.910> five<00:04:10.150> volts<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.070> eight

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
the lighting is very very bad but what

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.150 
the lighting is very very bad but what
you<00:04:19.660> do<00:04:19.840> it's<00:04:20.049> in<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.260> middle<00:04:20.350> of<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.560> day<00:04:20.770> and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
you do it's in the middle of the day and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.360 
you do it's in the middle of the day and
it's<00:04:21.400> raining<00:04:21.669> today<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.770> kind<00:04:23.770> of

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
it's raining today so kind of

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.910 
it's raining today so kind of

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
anyways so the ram it is sort of tie in

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.680 
anyways so the ram it is sort of tie in

with the whole color scheme it's sort of

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.380 
with the whole color scheme it's sort of
deceiving<00:04:30.080> because<00:04:30.760> if<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:32.030> have<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.210> look
