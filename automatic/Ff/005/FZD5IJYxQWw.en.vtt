00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:21.160 

so<00:01:12.790> he's<00:01:12.910> gonna<00:01:13.030> go

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.140 

and<00:01:21.860> see<00:01:22.100> that's<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.370> thing<00:01:22.400> with<00:01:22.640> Hendrix's

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
and see that's the thing with Hendrix's

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.590 
and see that's the thing with Hendrix's
sometimes<00:01:23.510> he'll<00:01:23.690> go<00:01:25.840> then<00:01:26.840> go<00:01:27.880> or<00:01:28.880> he'll<00:01:29.270> turn

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
sometimes he'll go then go or he'll turn

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.679 
sometimes he'll go then go or he'll turn
around

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.510 

so<00:01:34.289> you<00:01:34.380> never<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.829> which<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.280> he's<00:01:35.429> gonna

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so you never know which one he's gonna

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
so you never know which one he's gonna
do<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.179> think<00:01:36.420> at<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.569> beginning<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.960> song

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
do and I think at the beginning of song

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.660 
do and I think at the beginning of song
he<00:01:37.319> goes<00:01:38.630> just<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.840> mark<00:01:40.109> first

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.700 

but<00:01:44.030> then<00:01:44.180> later<00:01:44.330> on<00:01:44.510> he<00:01:44.630> goes<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:51.050> that

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
but then later on he goes and that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.680 
but then later on he goes and that
brings<00:01:51.950> us<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.310> verse<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:53.119> verse<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.630> very

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690
