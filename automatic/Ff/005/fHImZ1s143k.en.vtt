but I know battlefield back up into is I
think<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.250> like<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.580> low<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
think it's like the low it's like the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.550 
think it's like the low it's like the
1024<00:01:29.340> by<00:01:29.460> 768<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.329> something<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.750> I'm

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
1024 by 768 or something like that I'm

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620 
1024 by 768 or something like that I'm
not<00:01:31.710> sure<00:01:31.920> exactly<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.549> I'll<00:01:33.210> correct<00:01:33.570> myself

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
not sure exactly but I'll correct myself
