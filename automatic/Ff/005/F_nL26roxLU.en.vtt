00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 just got a violet recently 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.889
 little camera distorts the color actually 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.309
 here 77 and blue you are not here for some reason 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.699
 that's why purple 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:23.039
 it turns out maybe not some purple 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:27.150
 color here of course does not distort and distorts 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.910
 and here is the blue there is a broom here 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.360
 only either purple or lilac 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.250
 how can you not say exactly what color 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:41.000
 well here but on to the camera distorts a little 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 here it is our violet we have it here 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.700
 Nephrolepis Nephrolepis is the kind 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.230
 Folder nickname variety of greenhouse and 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.739
 the truth is beginning to dry up the leaves that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.390
 such investment is not enough moisture 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.050
 air but as if forced but what 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.860
 leaves well, just generally because I will try 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.240
 save to make it grow big 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.880
 but humidity is always a problem 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.000
 just not a real problem for apartments 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.150
 winter heating central heating 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.150
 heresy air just listened days 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.939
 that this is not done the humidifier not 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.159
 no panacea unfortunately anyway that's all 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.259
 how would this cactus 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.360
 What about with him, too, I do not understand that with 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.000
 it is these some kind of incomprehensible 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.640
 whether it should be so from me now 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.750
 and not about these, that 's how it's called 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.790
 so whip like 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.060
 what are the problems like bald patches and how 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.060
 it is called 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.510
 beige some 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:07.080
 of it is small like everything on right from 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:12.540
 him so on it's hamedorea 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.989
 we grew it for a long time this stage 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.270
 recently acquired something already bent i don't 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.569
 I can do anything or she goes 15 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.850
 It was 90 years since this 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.150
 palm nostalgia started think not 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:33.950
 not enough of this palm that's got 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:36.420
 hamedorea hamedorea hamedorea 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.840
 that's me and everyone agreed kiev therefore 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.799
 here in publicity create their microclimate 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:50.220
 sometimes I will try to transplant later 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:51.660
 in the spring everyone here is such a small pot 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 but now I'm just afraid to transplant 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.049
 because all the same winter is all you can 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.150
 like but but still not in the winter is not a fact 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.200
 what will take root 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.450
 very strong load on the plant 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.530
 winter time so you need to wait 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.390
 Spring is still a long course but you can at the end 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.019
 february peresal principle spring is 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:18.900
 formally the chapter that light day will be 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.950
 wine and so on as it well and you Th 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.989
 you stage here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.689
 I transplanted before here we had on 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:35.220
 the night is something wrong with him 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:35.220
 chlorophytum is also incomprehensible but 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.959
 here were to not see from the window 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.629
 what i shoot because i shoot it 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.049
 plant but they might think that i 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:52.090
 taking pictures of their people on the street so i don't 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:54.280
 I understand to be honest how how how how 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.750
 can be encrypted so that but although 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.540
 everyone has their own concerns problems 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.690
 With the news it somehow confuses me 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.299
 see with the camera and think that I take them off 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.730
 I really don't take them off I take them off 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.260
 plants 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.379
 so it is with us chrysalidocarpus seems 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.049
 also i recently bought crap 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:20.079
 chrysalidocarpus 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:29.280
 Here, too, this is also a form of 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:32.080
 a kind of palm tree I planted a lemon 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:40.630
 lemon ti or mandarin do not remember in my 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:47.800
 lemon and since tusyat and big only 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:51.310
 this here we have left below in 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.680
 leave the entrance and now you put 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.560
 water on the right cat grass 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.570
 topovuyu will need to transplant course 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:13.449
 they both are no longer rooted to the medal 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:13.870
 Therefore, this correspondingly the grotto is already 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.789
 there is 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:22.870
 so here now from afar to 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:25.680
 people have not seen what I shoot show that 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.680
 there is going on outside 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:35.590
 here is this by the way photo of good plants 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:39.340
 with this, I bought new ones after all 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.440
 green became the window sill that outside the window all 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.219
 white 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.740
 it's snowing I 'll tell you how many degrees there aren't 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.159
 on not say but but I saw that there was one 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.050
 degree 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.419
 I don't understand why the camera is on 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.370
 automatic mode so tupit know 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:59.080
 just drink no other words many 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.330
 suffer with these automatic mode 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.820
 and you only cook well, that's a low clay you 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.490
 just lazy everything i cant even though you 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.930
 burst can't 3 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.909
 need to mess around like this all 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.479
 do and the other love so everything was on 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:15.719
 automat 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.719
 still 21st century twenty first century not 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.000
 should be like he was okay in 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.639
 automatics plan everything should be 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.550
 automated for owe whom robots 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:30.940
 it will eventually be snowing 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:35.240
 it is snowing 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:41.370
 goes like this 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:45.290
 here it is snow it goes it goes now i 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.290
 Separate video take off perhaps for snow
