00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 referee dietmar drabek for two 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.099
 The Salzburger and their fans are waiting 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.540
 in vain on his deep teeth 1 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.549
 heike annoying falls in the fight with 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.180
 robert ibertsberger referee 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.070
 drabek decides without hesitation 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:28.019
 throw in scene 20 vinegar this time in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.730
 heartfelt hug with Michael's opinion 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.730
 inevitably diverging 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.629
 only the referee's decisions 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.670
 not commenting it was for me 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.680
 no eleven meters because of the players 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.760
 recognizes 1000% not given the eleven meter 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.420
 a man can give and there you have to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.460
 already ask 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.260
 the Tyroleans are not in charge 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.879
 Dangerous as last the first and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.339
 only big chance of the first half 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.710
 There are three men in a minute to save 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.629
 Ms gallwitz kurt jara can not 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.830
 take 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.420
 from the aggressive pressing of the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.119
 Salzburger results in a slight 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 playful superiority to more 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.610
 but you also get chances as a tyrol 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.610
 Not 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.179
 a similar picture presents itself after 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.060
 innsbruck is only once 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.780
 really dangerous 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.200
 Significantly after one 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.450
 standard situation the better chances 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 but continue to host and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 although always if directly and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.490
 tirol stays played straightforward 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.480
 continue without a goal 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.400
 Salzburg continues without a goal 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.540
 Coach Hans Bane takes a relative 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.030
 calmly 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.150
 I do not think so if that influences 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.650
 players shoot through without change since 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.690
 you can keep working and then 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.340
 come therefore sent Salzburg 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.650
 to defend are your own 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.160
 Half retired and me difficult medium 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.110
 found 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.610
 to keep out one or the other 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.100
 by virtue of the man does not help and ensure 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.100
 for us the newly won point
