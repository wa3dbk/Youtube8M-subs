00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.220
 installation of PVC slopes 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.560
 step 1 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.499
 surface preparation before installation 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.289
 you need to prepare the slope to remove 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:24.669
 excess foam clean the surface of 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.669
 foreign objects 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.949
 step 2 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.930
 installation of the starting profile produce 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.789
 measured on the inner perimeter of the window 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.010
 profile 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:42.739
 measure the required length and cut off 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.750
 start profile fasteners carry on 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.629
 edge of the window profile on the floor 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 cylindrical screws with pitch drill 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.070
 20 centimeters 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.590
 step 3 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:20.870
 installation of lathing for lathing 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.710
 use a dry timber section of 20 to 40 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.290
 millimeters 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.340
 fasteners carry on the corner of the slope on 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.820
 dowel-nails 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.660
 step about 40 centimeters check 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:38.660
 by level 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:42.410
 whether the beam is installed correctly step 4 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.910
 mounting the top panel pre 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.310
 measuring the top panel 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.590
 we saw off in size with an electric jigsaw 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 or hacksaw with frequent teeth 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.160
 install the top panel in the start 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.160
 profile 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.510
 fasten the other edge of the panel under 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.920
 angle to the screws to pre 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.920
 prepared crate 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.799
 step 5 installation 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.049
 side panels are similar to mounting 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.769
 top panel install side 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.769
 panels 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.540
 the same is attached to the very sheathing cutter 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.540
 step 6 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.549
 mounting platband as platband 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.680
 use in pvc profile which 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.890
 we measure on the outer perimeter of the window and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.769
 cut off at the junction of the profile to 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:14.599
 we make cuts with a self-tapping screw and we delete 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:18.730
 unnecessary pieces of plastic tight 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.730
 set in the profile in the panel 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:48.350
 Step 7 stitches processing formed 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.020
 joint we process white sealant for 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.020
 prevent dust and moisture 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.150
 excess sealant removed 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.610
 decking 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:15.130
 completed after finishing 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.130
 your slopes can be like that 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.180
 We wish you a pleasant repair system 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.180
