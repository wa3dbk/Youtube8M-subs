00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello everybody here is the moral is to iphone 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.260
 4 that disassembled actually I got it alone 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.400
 board here has his motherboard to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.170
 show you how you do it 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 repair of audio audio failure is the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.380
 that this audio failure is when you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.830
 will stay with the person the person of the other 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.490
 side does not listen to the fault 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.230
 audio when 10 problem you take this 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.480
 hood that now the back of the plate 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 that part of the front invaded the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.980
 component to back 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.980
 Are you able to back off that hood? 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:52.020
 Did you remove the component cap? 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.100
 the component I chose this component is 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.859
 Where are you going to put the sack on top of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.770
 pressing him and giving the contact 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.680
 in fact we make a reservation but 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.439
 there the staff will have a blower for 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.670
 and I can do so that will weld 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:16.189
 make a cash card o the cards 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:24.180
 that comes on the chip cuts a piece by piece 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:30.390
 already cut I've already cut it closed in that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.290
 piece of rubbish and a little bit is too much 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.750
 thick 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.750
 So take some and it was a little 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.220
 why leave him child not to 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 damage any other component or the 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.899
 own component where it goes on top 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.250
 so I gave a hoe're this piece 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.070
 classic here a piece of card still 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.450
 I had to show that I cut 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.450
 put on top of this component here 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.570
 dance in the right size for them in the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:09.110
 component glue with a double face and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.110
 put the double face and date 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.950
 the support that I closed the hood he did not 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.790
 stayed with all the space of the ritinha tá 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.989
 right 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.430
 then this audio crash repair will 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.640
 put the component here put 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.690
 plastic up here closed 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.110
 you can to use the card again 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.900
 cell phone 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.250
 I take it because my name has 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.750
 need 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.900
 so it was just that I had a 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:47.340
 example to show you repair of the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.230
 audio failure that happens a lot on 4 4 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.850
 2 and got no yes but the frame 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.620
 the problem is that audio is very 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.620
 You draw metal here 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:09.000
 plastic is just to remember that this 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:14.370
 component is the processor that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.430
 component here the processor here is the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:24.359
 audio fault repair and back 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.940
 again the iphone 4 is a strategy 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.430
 common also here is to use the back cover 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.959
 as a guide for the screws 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.940
 as I let go by placing 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.160
 screws here as guide 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.160
 so this is the audio fault repair 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.920
 took the back 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.450
 the component in the corner is the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.870
 audio crash repair 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.090
 Well, I hope I helped put this together. 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:04:02.630
 part now will not move and changed the 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:10.680
 the power flex and contacted me 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:13.549
 here 's plastic paper 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.549
 I have a staff that 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.180
 have a staff that is kind of ignorant or 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.470
 Talk to you on the internet 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.759
 unfortunately there is a lot of car that makes a 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.229
 video banal destroys the device 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.880
 I'm going to demonstrate this here has to be 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:35.449
 shown as it is something that has some 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.930
 guys that do not dismount priest nothing at all 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.120
 take off the lid and put a piece here in 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.530
 I could not put you up there. 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.840
 piece that when closing the lid 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.150
 strengthen the board down then you 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.160
 has bent the board does not support 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.360
 damaging other components cuts a 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.639
 bit goes behind the correct component 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.699
 take the map of mântua there on the internet and 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.289
 download washes a plate iphone and co 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.009
 component right and put upon 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:08.180
 correct component is once again about 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:12.349
 Here you have to show again. 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.590
 Do not forget this component is 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.900
 here it is not small that it does not 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.930
 is this little other audio crash that 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.909
 happens only with this coil which is very 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.190
 fragile if you take a very hard step 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.159
 here or very high in the middle 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.900
 There you lose what's hot to take 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.870
 I belong to the other in the place 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.550
 so here's the phone here when 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.310
 You call someone, do not listen to this one. 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.830
 when you are calling and entering the 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.930
 Automatic speakerphone is this here is that 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.479
 here an audio reel this one and 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.300
 when the phone is connected to the 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:56.720
 person is listening is this component 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:06:01.310
 here the processor is just put the pass 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:08.240
 of complacency of the component 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:09.409
 right the lokon double-face field I will 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.320
 because I still do not have this 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:16.280
 audio failure problem when you have 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:19.070
 I'll do it, I'll do it and I'll do it. 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.690
 put the plastiki ok then put the 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.570
 plastic in being the component you go 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.750
 push a component down to 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.240
 weld contact that has become cold in the 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.330
 idea just ended 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.500
 letting loose sometimes 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.250
 he closed and he just set up his 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.610
 new 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.440
 so there's the repair of the audio fault 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.910
 When you call with people you do not listen. 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.330
 is the component here, just cut one 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.460
 plastic piece of those cards says 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.220
 that comes with a chip 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.130
 I hope I have helped the sun thank the 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.889
 all by time is being my site is 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.389
 commenting on my video there, I'm happy to 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:01.840
 be helping the staff there the staff are 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.789
 getting some problems and soon 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.550
 making more video there the next video 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:08.650
 do flex repair of power tanks 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.870
 button here is aimed both at 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:16.979
 You'll see how simple it is. 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.979
 I thank you all and see you next time.
