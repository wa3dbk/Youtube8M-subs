00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:09.130
 hello today we will look 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:13.800
 Pros and cons of nike high 1 on 1 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:17.230
 moro as you can see boots are made 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.210
 silver golden color large 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:31.950
 the piece will be made in silver 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:38.310
 the colors are the same because 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 original and coloring 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:47.590
 as you can see here there is a royce patch 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:52.090
 I'm just a fan of Borussia royce 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.810
 still wears these boots and I decided so 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.690
 coincided 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.430
 not a sister myself then their exact need 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:04.049
 I want to take the boots 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 you admit it, I liked 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.969
 they are light they fit well and 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 light enough 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.939
 as I told them very much 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.249
 liked 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.649
 those places that are usually beaten 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:27.729
 soccer players 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:31.840
 they are slightly fortified but they do not give 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.600
 of great importance to their eesu but when 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.139
 you beat them at least a little bit but still 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.100
 protect let's take out the insole with you 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:44.920
 look at her and so here's what it looks like 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.319
 this insole hypervenom it is a little bit 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.149
 shabby because as I said I already 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:55.740
 out played half a season here let's 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.740
 look at the shoes from the inside 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:07.430
 lead here a little bit sewn a little bit 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:13.040
 It is everywhere all sewn how to make 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:16.520
 if I look at it 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.000
 so here it can be seen that there translucent 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.900
 see in some places it means something 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.080
 that they are real and that's the oldest 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.200
 conditions control it means astana 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.519
 and passed control and they 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:38.980
 fermin and let's take a look at you 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:44.000
 see the sole nike 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:48.430
 this green sole here on the spikes 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.630
 transparent well I decided something transparent 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 will be more somehow look prettier and 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:00.100
 just another such model will not be soon 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.140
 know not with transparent spikes was not 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:08.500
 that's how you see she bought from on 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.060
 outsole in those places on what on what 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.769
 are coming 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.709
 significant load and because of this 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:23.359
 You do not have most likely will not be injury if 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.910
 of course you will play it neatly 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:30.070
 Naturally let's see how you 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.070
 will look on foot 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.459
 That looks like in the legs, I think 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.739
 that they look pretty dignified not 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.739
 like thats how they look
