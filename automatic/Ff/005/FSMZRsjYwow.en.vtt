00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
little tiny piece there and this rust

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.370 
little tiny piece there and this rust
will<00:01:17.610> pop<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.380> literally<00:01:20.930> fall<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.110> but

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
will pop out literally fall out but

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.100 
will pop out literally fall out but
you're<00:01:22.920> close<00:01:23.130> once<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> can

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you're close once that so then you can

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.190 
you're close once that so then you can
spin<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.130> probably<00:01:26.820> three<00:01:27.060> times<00:01:27.299> so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
spin this up to probably three times so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.340 
spin this up to probably three times so
you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.030> three<00:01:30.030> full<00:01:30.299> revolutions<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you can get a three full revolutions on

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.490 
you can get a three full revolutions on
a<00:01:31.490> camera<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:33.869> said<00:01:34.079> leave<00:01:34.290> that
