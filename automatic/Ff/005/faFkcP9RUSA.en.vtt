00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
fitness questions today's question is

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.120 
fitness questions today's question is
our<00:00:14.549> seated<00:00:15.450> calf<00:00:15.719> raise<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.170> necessary<00:00:16.859> in

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
our seated calf raise is necessary in

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.340 
our seated calf raise is necessary in
order<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.760> build<00:00:18.180> your<00:00:18.330> calves<00:00:18.600> effectively

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
order to build your calves effectively

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.310 
order to build your calves effectively
or<00:00:20.010> our<00:00:20.340> standing<00:00:21.000> calf<00:00:21.270> raises<00:00:21.600> enough<00:00:22.080> on

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
or our standing calf raises enough on

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.490 
or our standing calf raises enough on
their<00:00:22.529> own<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.840> basically<00:00:24.840> your<00:00:24.990> calves<00:00:25.320> are

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
their own so basically your calves are

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.820 
their own so basically your calves are
made<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:26.010> two<00:00:27.000> main<00:00:27.380> portions<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> first

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
made up of two main portions the first

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.730 
made up of two main portions the first
is<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> gastrocnemius<00:00:29.699> which<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.470> much

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
is the gastrocnemius which is the much

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.250 
is the gastrocnemius which is the much
larger<00:00:32.360> visible<00:00:33.360> portion<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> calf<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
larger visible portion of the calf that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.319 
larger visible portion of the calf that
sits<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> outside<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.790> lower<00:00:35.969> leg

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
sits on the outside of your lower leg

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.740 
sits on the outside of your lower leg
and<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:37.590> second<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> soleus<00:00:38.760> which<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and the second is the soleus which is a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.619 
and the second is the soleus which is a
much<00:00:40.050> smaller<00:00:40.670> basically<00:00:41.670> strip<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> muscle

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
much smaller basically strip of muscle

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.240 
much smaller basically strip of muscle
that<00:00:42.719> sits<00:00:42.960> underneath<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.739> gastrocnemius

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that sits underneath the gastrocnemius

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.779 
that sits underneath the gastrocnemius
and<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> perform<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> calf<00:00:46.680> raise<00:00:46.920> with

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and when you perform a calf raise with

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.060 
and when you perform a calf raise with
your<00:00:48.180> knees<00:00:48.390> bent<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> seated<00:00:49.829> calf

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
your knees bent like in a seated calf

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.939 
your knees bent like in a seated calf
raise<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.700> basically<00:00:51.829> deactivates<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
raise it basically deactivates the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.970 
raise it basically deactivates the
gastrocnemius<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.350> isolates<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.440> small

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
gastrocnemius and isolates that small

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.240 
gastrocnemius and isolates that small
soleus<00:00:56.520> muscle<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.079> goal<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
soleus muscle now if your goal is to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.330 
soleus muscle now if your goal is to
fully<00:00:59.850> maximize<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.780> development<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:02.039> your

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
fully maximize the development of your

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.609 
fully maximize the development of your
calves<00:01:02.699> then<00:01:03.329> obviously<00:01:03.719> building<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
calves then obviously building up the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.520 
calves then obviously building up the
soleus<00:01:05.010> muscle<00:01:05.519> will<00:01:05.729> help<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.479> since<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
soleus muscle will help a bit since it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.170 
soleus muscle will help a bit since it
basically<00:01:07.740> pushes<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.610> gastrocnemius

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
basically pushes the gastrocnemius

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.200 
basically pushes the gastrocnemius
muscle<00:01:09.960> further<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:10.920> however<00:01:11.760> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
muscle further out however it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240 
muscle further out however it's
important<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.630> keep<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.990> mind<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.619> when<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
important to keep in mind that when you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.020 
important to keep in mind that when you
perform<00:01:14.760> any<00:01:15.330> basic<00:01:15.780> calf<00:01:16.259> raise<00:01:16.909> even<00:01:17.909> with

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
perform any basic calf raise even with

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
perform any basic calf raise even with
your<00:01:18.150> knees<00:01:18.360> straight<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.259> standing

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
your knees straight like in a standing

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.980 
your knees straight like in a standing
calf<00:01:19.920> raise<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> light<00:01:21.180> pressed<00:01:21.450> calf<00:01:21.689> raise

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
calf raise or a light pressed calf raise

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530 
calf raise or a light pressed calf raise
or<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> machine<00:01:22.650> calf<00:01:22.950> raise<00:01:23.220> you're<00:01:23.970> actually

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
or a machine calf raise you're actually

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
or a machine calf raise you're actually
hitting<00:01:24.720> both<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> gastrocnemius<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
hitting both the gastrocnemius and the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.840 
hitting both the gastrocnemius and the
soleus<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.220> even<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
soleus at the same time so even if you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.420 
soleus at the same time so even if you
never<00:01:30.240> performed<00:01:30.900> any<00:01:31.200> seated<00:01:31.860> calf<00:01:32.100> raise

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
never performed any seated calf raise

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.640 
never performed any seated calf raise
work<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.030> your<00:01:33.659> soleus<00:01:34.020> would<00:01:34.350> still<00:01:34.619> end

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
work at all your soleus would still end

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
work at all your soleus would still end
up<00:01:34.920> getting<00:01:35.280> plenty<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> stimulation

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
up getting plenty of stimulation

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.679 
up getting plenty of stimulation
regardless<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:38.670> combined<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
regardless and that combined with the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
regardless and that combined with the
fact<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.350> already<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> very<00:01:41.130> small

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
fact that it's already a very small

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.330 
fact that it's already a very small
muscle<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.180> begin<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:43.040> overall<00:01:44.040> I'd<00:01:44.310> say

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
muscle to begin with overall I'd say

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.850 
muscle to begin with overall I'd say
that<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.880> most<00:01:45.180> cases<00:01:45.540> seated<00:01:46.439> calf<00:01:46.649> raises

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that in most cases seated calf raises

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.910 
that in most cases seated calf raises
probably<00:01:47.700> aren't<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> make<00:01:48.619> much<00:01:49.619> if

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
probably aren't going to make much if

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
probably aren't going to make much if
any<00:01:50.189> real<00:01:50.670> noticeable<00:01:51.030> difference<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.020> your

bottom line calf gains assuming that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.380 
bottom line calf gains assuming that
you're<00:01:54.960> doing<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.320> efficient<00:01:55.770> amount<00:01:56.040> of

you're doing this efficient amount of

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.270 
you're doing this efficient amount of
regular<00:01:57.390> straight<00:01:57.869> legged<00:01:58.110> calf<00:01:58.439> raise<00:01:58.710> work

regular straight legged calf raise work

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.370

now<00:01:59.790> if<00:01:59.969> calves<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> particular<00:02:00.960> weak

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
