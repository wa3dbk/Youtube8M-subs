00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.550
Hey guys!

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.720
I thought you might enjoy a little comparison
between the Yeti Tundra series, the hard coolers,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.150
and the Hopper series their soft coolers.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.730
Everybody's uses are different so you might
not necessarily need the same one that I prefer

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.570
but anyway, I'll show you some comparisons
here.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.779
The first thing that I want to do here is
show you the difference in weights.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:36.510
You can see it's hanging here by a bike scale
and we've got 26.4 pounds.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.510
So relatively heavy for the Tundra series.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.989
This is a Tundra 45.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.379
Great cooler but they are heavy.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.590
And here's my Hopper 20 on the scale.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.499
You can see 4.2 pounds, so significantly lighter.

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:59.270
It's not a direct apple to apple comparison.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.740
The Hopper 20 holds a little bit less capacity
wise.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:15.210
I usually put about 18 cans in the Hopper
20 and Yeti really rates them for about 12

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.050
cans I believe but you can get more in there.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.930
And then the hard Tundra 45, they rate that
for 26 cans or something like that but you

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.840
can get more than that if you want to put
less ice.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.970
But anyway, bottom line right here is that
the Hopper series is a lot lighter.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.280
So aside from the weight, there's a significant
difference in the bulkiness of these coolers.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.510
It's not directly apples to apples here because
the Hopper 20 does hold a little less but

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.320
the Hopper thirty is not much larger than
this.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.500
The Hoppers are just really really easy to
throw in a car or a trunk.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.170
Tundras, they work great in the back of a
truck or larger trunks but they do get bulky.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.090
Especially if you go with a larger size Tundra.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.180
The downsides to the soft Yeti are that it's
a little harder to load.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.150
It's got the zipper that constrains you.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.440
You can't just dump ice in like you can with
a Tundra.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.760
With the Tundra you just throw the ice in
there.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.920
With the Hopper you kind of got to open it
up and stuff it in.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.350
And when you're getting drinks, or whatever
it's easy to get in the hard cooler but the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.870
Hopper you've got this zipper that's rubbing
on your wrist like that.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.590
It's not terrible but a little bit different
set up there.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.080
The up sides to the Tundras are that obviously
they're hard so you can sit on them like a

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.260
normal cooler.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.960
You can stand on them.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.900
They're not going to get hurt.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.000
They're bear proof obviously like Yeti advertises
and they can be locked up more securely with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.550
these holes in the corners.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.960
The Hopper, you know you can lock them up
but these straps are, you know, people could

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.450
cut those so they would be able to be stolen
a little bit more easily.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.330
For the money, the Tundra is going to have
a little bit bigger capacity and obviously

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.090
the Hopper is not going to be bear proof.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.980
They both seal when you've got them locked
closed.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.650
This zipper is waterproof and the Tundras
are waterproof too.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.209
When you flip this over, even with water in
it, it will not leak.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.530
So they're really well built.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.430
Both of these coolers are going to last you
a lifetime if you take care of them and don't

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.490
let them get stolen.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.459
When Yeti first announced that they were going
to do a soft sided cooler I kind of laughed

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.730
at them and laughed at the price for sure
but I've really kind of fallen in love with

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.750
it.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.959
It's easy to put anywhere in a vehicle or
a boat, no space constraints just about, almost

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.410
holds as much, so much lighter....

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.640
Obviously it makes a difference in what you're
use is and the Hoppers can't be had in large

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.459
capacities right now but if you don't need
a huge cooler, I would seriously consider

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.660
the Hopper.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.790
I feel like the quality is just as good and
it's easier to use.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.120
Anyway, I appreciate you guys watching my
videos.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.069
