00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
hey guys Nikki ball just here and I'm

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.949 
hey guys Nikki ball just here and I'm
gonna<00:00:01.920> be<00:00:02.010> showing<00:00:02.280> you<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.730> solve<00:00:03.179> the

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
gonna be showing you how to solve the

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.249 
gonna be showing you how to solve the
pyraminx<00:00:04.380> so<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:04.890> is<00:00:04.980> another<00:00:05.250> tutorial

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
pyraminx so this is another tutorial

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.990 
pyraminx so this is another tutorial
yeah<00:00:07.259> it's<00:00:07.410> gonna<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.820> layer<00:00:08.820> by<00:00:08.970> layer

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
yeah it's gonna be on the layer by layer

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.749 
yeah it's gonna be on the layer by layer
method<00:00:09.360> not<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.769> monkey<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.519> three<00:00:11.670> one

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
method not the monkey do one three one

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.539 
method not the monkey do one three one
three<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.870> know<00:00:12.990> how<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.139> solution<00:00:13.620> just

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
three is you know how the solution just

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.250 
three is you know how the solution just
because<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.030> pretty<00:00:15.240> good<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.870> cubing

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
because this is a pretty good be cubing

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
because this is a pretty good be cubing
method<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.580> I'm<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:17.940> gonna<00:00:18.029> shown<00:00:18.390> wine<00:00:18.720> I'm

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
method and I'm just gonna shown wine I'm

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.800 
method and I'm just gonna shown wine I'm
talking<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.220> there<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.580> five<00:00:20.850> cases<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.480> learn

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.720 

yeah<00:00:24.810> I'll<00:00:25.800> leave<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> them<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
yeah I'll leave all of them in the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.760 
yeah I'll leave all of them in the
description<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:29.720> that's<00:00:31.850> seems<00:00:32.850> sufficient

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
description so that's seems sufficient

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.160 
description so that's seems sufficient
so<00:00:34.880> what<00:00:35.880> we're<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.239> doing<00:00:36.510> first<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
so what we're gonna be doing first is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.479 
so what we're gonna be doing first is
I'm<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.590> gonna<00:00:37.680> get<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> tips<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.340> way

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
I'm just gonna get the tips all the way

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.630 
I'm just gonna get the tips all the way
first<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> tip<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.440> match<00:00:40.680> each<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
first so a tip is when you match each of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.479 
first so a tip is when you match each of
these<00:00:41.730> colors<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> centered<00:00:43.620> pieces<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
these colors to the centered pieces that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.100 
these colors to the centered pieces that
are<00:00:44.610> adjacent<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> center<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.690> like

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
are adjacent to the center just like

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.430 
are adjacent to the center just like
this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
this

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.990 
this
so<00:00:46.980> yeah<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.260> turn<00:00:49.260> them<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:49.850> until<00:00:50.850> they're

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so yeah just turn them off until they're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.619 
so yeah just turn them off until they're
matching<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:52.010> yeah<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.239> we're<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.420> do

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
matching so yeah now what we're gonna do

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.619 
matching so yeah now what we're gonna do
is<00:00:54.809> we're<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:54.989> solve<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> center<00:00:55.649> pieces

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
is we're gonna solve the center pieces

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.939 
is we're gonna solve the center pieces
like<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.020> let<00:00:58.140> me<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.649> okay

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
like this here let me get the like okay

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.720 
like this here let me get the like okay
they're<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:02.370> means<00:01:02.489> just

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
they're like this so that means just

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.009 
they're like this so that means just
matching<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.270> them<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:03.989> like

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
matching two of them so they look like

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.149 
matching two of them so they look like
this<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:06.229> turning<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> until<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.979> get

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
this and then turning it until you get

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.880 
this and then turning it until you get
all<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.229> turning<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.560> until<00:01:10.830> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
all of them turning this one until you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
all of them turning this one until you
get<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.070> third<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.780> there's<00:01:12.780> still

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
get the third one so there's still

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.920 
get the third one so there's still
something<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.229> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> show<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.720> now<00:01:15.720> let's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
something I need to show you now let's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.499 
something I need to show you now let's
say<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.400> too<00:01:17.580> much<00:01:17.729> stuff<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.479> can

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
say that we have too much stuff you can

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.140 
say that we have too much stuff you can
expect<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> keep<00:01:19.110> turning<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:21.030> you're

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
expect to keep turning this but you're

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.530 
expect to keep turning this but you're
not<00:01:21.240> gonna<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:22.100> simply<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.580> it's

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
not gonna get it simply because it's

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.080 
not gonna get it simply because it's
right<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.280> want<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
right here so you want to get it so that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
right here so you want to get it so that
it's<00:01:27.240> above<00:01:27.570> these<00:01:27.869> two<00:01:28.110> center<00:01:28.470> pieces<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's above these two center pieces and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.429 
it's above these two center pieces and
then<00:01:29.909> bring<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.360> two<00:01:30.540> Center<00:01:30.810> pieces<00:01:31.140> onto

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
then bring these two Center pieces onto

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.830 
then bring these two Center pieces onto
the<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> single<00:01:33.150> center<00:01:33.420> piece<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the one that the single center piece is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.130 
the one that the single center piece is
on<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:36.049> then<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.590> should<00:01:38.030> yeah

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
on just like this then you should yeah

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.170 
on just like this then you should yeah
that<00:01:40.140> looks<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> Triforce<00:01:41.220> level<00:01:41.549> right

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that looks like the Triforce level right

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.460 
that looks like the Triforce level right
where<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:42.780> deliver<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.350> anyway<00:01:45.229> yeah<00:01:46.229> so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
where you out deliver so anyway yeah so

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.990 
where you out deliver so anyway yeah so
that's<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> first<00:01:47.070> step<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that's the first step just get all the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
that's the first step just get all the
Senators<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.780> play<00:01:49.140> around<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.590> okay

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
Senators just play around think okay

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.609 
Senators just play around think okay
eventually<00:01:50.390> but<00:01:51.390> yeah<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.140> intended<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
eventually but yeah that was intended to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.710 
eventually but yeah that was intended to
cover<00:01:53.250> everything<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.210> now<00:01:54.329> we're<00:01:54.479> gonna<00:01:54.600> be

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
cover everything so now we're gonna be

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.539 
cover everything so now we're gonna be
doing<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.140> solving<00:01:55.860> these<00:01:56.780> edge<00:01:57.780> pieces<00:01:58.549> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
doing is solving these edge pieces to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.130 
doing is solving these edge pieces to
make<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.729> bottom<00:02:00.030> layer<00:02:00.119> since<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
make the bottom layer since this is a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.440 
make the bottom layer since this is a
layer<00:02:01.409> by<00:02:01.590> layer<00:02:01.619> method<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.700> look<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.390> an

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
layer by layer method so look for an

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.700 
layer by layer method so look for an
edge<00:02:03.570> piece<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.740> layer<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:06.469> match<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
edge piece on this layer here match the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.670 
edge piece on this layer here match the
other<00:02:07.860> side<00:02:08.929> move<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.140> opposite<00:02:10.560> side<00:02:10.800> up

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
other side move the opposite side up

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.660 
other side move the opposite side up
push<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.849> edge<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.840> bring<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.080> back<00:02:14.110> down

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
push this edge in and bring it back down

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.540 
push this edge in and bring it back down
now<00:02:15.670> if<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.879> see<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.180> an<00:02:16.300> edge<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.920> red<00:02:17.920> like

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
now if you see that an edge is red like

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.930 
now if you see that an edge is red like
this<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.239> it's<00:02:19.450> on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.620> correct<00:02:20.739> side<00:02:20.980> but

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
this and it's on the correct side but

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.670 
this and it's on the correct side but
this<00:02:22.239> side<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:23.140> correct

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
this side is not correct

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.320 
this side is not correct
act<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.069> you're<00:02:24.250> putting<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.670> edge<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.150> and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
act like you're putting this edge in and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.990 
act like you're putting this edge in and
the<00:02:25.629> same<00:02:25.810> goes<00:02:26.019> for<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.530> flipped<00:02:26.769> edge<00:02:26.980> now<00:02:27.970> I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
the same goes for a flipped edge now I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.220 
the same goes for a flipped edge now I
can<00:02:28.209> put<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.110> put

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
can put this one in and now I can put

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.080 
can put this one in and now I can put
this<00:02:32.379> one<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:33.299> so<00:02:34.299> now<00:02:34.959> I<00:02:34.989> have<00:02:35.670> these<00:02:36.670> last

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
this one in so now I have these last

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.199 
this one in so now I have these last
layer<00:02:37.299> cases<00:02:37.720> which<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.110> need<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> show<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:39.209> so

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
layer cases which I need to show you so

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.020 
layer cases which I need to show you so
this<00:02:41.019> is<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.260> first<00:02:41.530> case<00:02:41.739> I'm<00:02:42.610> gonna<00:02:42.790> call

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
this is the first case I'm gonna call

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.470 
this is the first case I'm gonna call
these<00:02:43.450> two<00:02:43.720> cases<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.519> which<00:02:45.519> this<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:46.030> one<00:02:46.060> of

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
these two cases of which this is one of

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.559 
these two cases of which this is one of
the<00:02:47.230> cases<00:02:47.670> three<00:02:48.670> cycle<00:02:49.030> cases<00:02:49.299> because

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
the cases three cycle cases because

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.880 
the cases three cycle cases because
there<00:02:49.660> are<00:02:49.750> three<00:02:49.959> edges<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.410> need<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:50.799> in

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
there are three edges that need to go in

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.069 
there are three edges that need to go in
a<00:02:50.950> certain<00:02:51.190> cycle<00:02:51.579> so<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.780> counter

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
a certain cycle so this is the counter

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.940 
a certain cycle so this is the counter
clockwise<00:02:53.290> cycle<00:02:54.630> let<00:02:55.630> me<00:02:55.720> get<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.110> car<00:02:56.769> wash

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
clockwise cycle let me get the car wash

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.339 
clockwise cycle let me get the car wash
cycle<00:02:57.370> like<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.299> so<00:02:58.810> we're<00:02:58.900> gonna<00:02:58.959> start

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
cycle like this so we're gonna start

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.350 
cycle like this so we're gonna start
with<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.530> clock<00:02:59.860> clockwise<00:03:00.610> cycle<00:03:00.849> and<00:03:01.209> I

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
with the clock clockwise cycle and I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.930 
with the clock clockwise cycle and I
move<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.840> counter<00:03:02.110> clockwise<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:03.010> for

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
move on to the counter clockwise so for

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.530 
move on to the counter clockwise so for
this<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.269> am<00:03:04.360> gonna<00:03:04.690> show<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.140> algorithm<00:03:05.739> that

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this I am gonna show the algorithm that

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
this I am gonna show the algorithm that
most<00:03:07.540> people<00:03:07.840> use<00:03:08.049> and<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.319> going<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.500> show

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
most people use and I'm going to show

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.380 
most people use and I'm going to show
the<00:03:08.680> algorithm<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:09.190> use<00:03:09.579> so<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.269> how

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
the algorithm that I use so this is how

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.789 
the algorithm that I use so this is how
rhythm<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.750> most<00:03:11.049> people<00:03:11.349> use<00:03:12.750> which<00:03:13.750> is<00:03:14.019> L

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
rhythm that most people use which is L

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:22.729 
rhythm that most people use which is L

L<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.549> now<00:03:24.579> I'll<00:03:24.760> show<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.120> counter<00:03:25.359> clock

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
L so now I'll show you the counter clock

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.870 
L so now I'll show you the counter clock
way<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:27.040> this<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.400> counter<00:03:27.670> clockwise

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
way so this is the counter clockwise

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.309 
way so this is the counter clockwise
like<00:03:28.510> what<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.750> had<00:03:28.930> before

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
like what I had before

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:38.400 
like what I had before
so<00:03:31.170> what<00:03:32.170> we're<00:03:32.290> gonna<00:03:32.349> do<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:36.810> sorry<00:03:37.810> we're

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
so what we're gonna do is sorry we're

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.020 
so what we're gonna do is sorry we're
gonna<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.950> know<00:03:39.069> only<00:03:39.280> for<00:03:39.459> any<00:03:39.579> position

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
gonna you know only for any position

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.240 
gonna you know only for any position
just<00:03:40.329> like<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.540> last<00:03:40.660> case<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.169> I<00:03:41.620> want<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.130> do

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
just like the last case and I want to do

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:51.300 
just like the last case and I want to do

oh<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.849> know<00:03:51.940> what<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.299> forgot<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.720> show<00:03:53.169> you

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
oh you know what I forgot to show you

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.920 
oh you know what I forgot to show you
the<00:03:53.440> algorithms<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.639> I<00:03:54.669> use<00:03:55.090> I'll<00:03:55.569> just<00:03:55.750> put

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
the algorithms that I use I'll just put

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.170 
the algorithms that I use I'll just put
those<00:03:56.019> in<00:03:56.169> a<00:03:56.260> separate<00:03:56.560> video<00:03:56.739> just<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:58.030> this

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
those in a separate video just so this

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.550 
those in a separate video just so this
tutorial<00:03:58.660> can<00:03:58.720> be<00:03:58.840> shorter<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.650> yeah

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
tutorial can be shorter so yeah

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.110 
tutorial can be shorter so yeah
now<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.980> next<00:04:03.160> cases<00:04:03.489> I'll<00:04:03.579> be<00:04:03.669> showing<00:04:03.819> are

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
now the next cases I'll be showing are

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.659 
now the next cases I'll be showing are
irregular<00:04:04.870> cases<00:04:05.410> because<00:04:06.190> in<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.400> kind<00:04:06.609> of

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
irregular cases because in the kind of

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.339 
irregular cases because in the kind of
awkward<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.419> yeah<00:04:07.690> I'll<00:04:07.840> get<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.079> the<00:04:08.169> first

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
awkward so yeah I'll get to the first

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.780 
awkward so yeah I'll get to the first
one<00:04:08.560> right<00:04:08.680> now<00:04:08.859> so<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.930> is<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.169> first

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
one right now so this is the first

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.539 
one right now so this is the first
irregular<00:04:12.790> case<00:04:13.169> where<00:04:14.169> you<00:04:14.980> have<00:04:15.099> two<00:04:15.340> that

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
irregular case where you have two that

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.000 
irregular case where you have two that
are<00:04:15.669> matching<00:04:15.940> two<00:04:16.570> edges<00:04:17.260> that<00:04:17.289> have<00:04:17.620> one

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
are matching two edges that have one

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.709 
are matching two edges that have one
color<00:04:18.190> matching<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.150> one<00:04:19.299> that<00:04:19.419> has<00:04:19.539> no

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:19.719 
color matching and then one that has no

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:21.270 
color matching and then one that has no
colors<00:04:20.019> matching<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.829> two<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.159> are

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
colors matching and the two that are

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.399 
colors matching and the two that are
matching<00:04:21.459> are<00:04:22.150> both<00:04:22.390> on<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.659> right<00:04:22.840> of<00:04:23.080> each

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
matching are both on the right of each

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.320 
matching are both on the right of each
site<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.340> want<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.550> hole

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
site and you want a hole

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.110 
site and you want a hole
the<00:04:26.110> cube<00:04:27.069> or<00:04:27.310> puzzle<00:04:27.699> so<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:30.430> from

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
the cube or puzzle so that the the from

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.719 
the cube or puzzle so that the the from
side<00:04:31.629> on<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.900> left<00:04:32.199> that<00:04:32.770> has<00:04:32.949> one<00:04:33.220> matching

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
side on the left that has one matching

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:39.180 
side on the left that has one matching
of<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.240> two<00:04:34.419> is<00:04:35.789> facing<00:04:36.789> you<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.889> you<00:04:38.889> want<00:04:39.069> to

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
of the two is facing you and you want to

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.839 
of the two is facing you and you want to
do<00:04:39.340> this<00:04:39.460> out<00:04:39.669> of<00:04:39.699> our<00:04:40.180> prime<00:04:40.810> L<00:04:41.710> prime<00:04:42.099> u<00:04:42.819> prime

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
do this out of our prime L prime u prime

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.909 
do this out of our prime L prime u prime
L<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.830> are<00:04:46.020> that's<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.169> only<00:04:47.379> algorithm<00:04:47.680> I

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
L you are that's the only algorithm I

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.790 
L you are that's the only algorithm I
know<00:04:47.979> for<00:04:48.580> that<00:04:48.669> case<00:04:48.909> so<00:04:49.590> yeah<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:53.680> pretty

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
know for that case so yeah it's pretty

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.830 
know for that case so yeah it's pretty
fast<00:04:54.159> I<00:04:54.430> don't<00:04:54.699> really<00:04:54.849> like<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.360> don't<00:04:55.629> really

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
fast I don't really like I don't really

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.830 
fast I don't really like I don't really
like<00:04:56.139> this<00:04:56.289> case<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.860> much<00:04:57.099> but<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:58.539> does<00:04:58.599> the

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
like this case that much but it does the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.430 
like this case that much but it does the
purpose<00:04:59.199> so<00:04:59.710> now<00:05:00.280> for<00:05:00.669> the<00:05:00.759> next<00:05:00.940> case<00:05:01.440> I'm

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
purpose so now for the next case I'm

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.430 
purpose so now for the next case I'm
just<00:05:02.500> gonna<00:05:02.710> get<00:05:02.949> like<00:05:03.099> that<00:05:03.750> there<00:05:04.750> it's

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
just gonna get like that there it's

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.649 
just gonna get like that there it's
where<00:05:05.849> you<00:05:06.849> have<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.060> same<00:05:07.240> case<00:05:07.419> it's

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
where you have the same case it's

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.480 
where you have the same case it's
basically<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.169> mirror<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.710> have<00:05:08.830> two<00:05:09.069> that

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
basically the mirror you have two that

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.309 
basically the mirror you have two that
are<00:05:09.639> matching<00:05:09.880> two<00:05:10.419> with<00:05:10.569> one<00:05:10.780> matching<00:05:11.080> side

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
are matching two with one matching side

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.350 
are matching two with one matching side
but<00:05:11.740> they're<00:05:11.860> both<00:05:11.919> on<00:05:12.099> the<00:05:12.159> left<00:05:12.370> so<00:05:13.000> you<00:05:13.030> hold

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
but they're both on the left so you hold

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.779 
but they're both on the left so you hold
it<00:05:13.509> so<00:05:13.659> that<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.900> one<00:05:14.050> on<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.229> right<00:05:14.789> is

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
it so that the one on the right is

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:23.670 
it so that the one on the right is
facing<00:05:16.180> you<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.889> do<00:05:18.039> this<00:05:18.280> over<00:05:18.539> L<00:05:19.650> R<00:05:21.659> u<00:05:22.680> R

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
facing you and you do this over L R u R

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.879 
facing you and you do this over L R u R
prime<00:05:24.270> u<00:05:25.270> prime<00:05:25.560> L<00:05:26.560> prime<00:05:26.949> like<00:05:27.759> this<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:29.500> I

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
prime u prime L prime like this and I

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.050 
prime u prime L prime like this and I
just<00:05:29.919> hold<00:05:30.219> the<00:05:30.340> Q<00:05:30.690> so<00:05:31.690> now<00:05:32.699> we<00:05:33.699> only<00:05:33.819> have<00:05:33.940> one

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
just hold the Q so now we only have one

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.170 
just hold the Q so now we only have one
more<00:05:34.419> case<00:05:34.719> to<00:05:35.020> show<00:05:35.639> which<00:05:36.639> is<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:39.610> two<00:05:39.880> edge

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
more case to show which is the two edge

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.820 
more case to show which is the two edge
flip<00:05:40.690> case<00:05:41.940> so<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:44.020> want<00:05:44.289> to<00:05:44.380> hold<00:05:44.529> it<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:44.800> that

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
flip case so you want to hold it so that

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.959 
flip case so you want to hold it so that
the<00:05:45.069> two<00:05:45.279> aren't<00:05:46.139> facing<00:05:47.669> facing<00:05:48.669> you<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:50.969> the

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
the two aren't facing facing you and the

00:05:51.969 --> 00:06:00.510 
the two aren't facing facing you and the
algorithm<00:05:52.419> is<00:05:52.599> o<00:05:55.349> R<00:05:56.349> prime<00:05:56.830> L<00:05:57.699> prime<00:05:58.090> R<00:05:59.190> u<00:06:00.190> prime

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
algorithm is o R prime L prime R u prime

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.140 
algorithm is o R prime L prime R u prime
R<00:06:01.590> u<00:06:02.590> R<00:06:03.550> Prime<00:06:04.139> and<00:06:05.139> that<00:06:05.380> should<00:06:05.590> solve<00:06:05.770> it

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
R u R Prime and that should solve it

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.080 
R u R Prime and that should solve it
I'm<00:06:07.569> so<00:06:08.349> yeah<00:06:09.130> that's<00:06:09.400> recover<00:06:09.759> everything

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
I'm so yeah that's recover everything

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.120 
I'm so yeah that's recover everything
that<00:06:10.900> you<00:06:10.960> need<00:06:11.110> to<00:06:11.139> know<00:06:11.319> for<00:06:11.529> solving<00:06:11.860> the

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
that you need to know for solving the

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.260 
that you need to know for solving the
pair<00:06:12.340> makes<00:06:12.520> using<00:06:12.789> the<00:06:12.880> layer<00:06:13.060> by<00:06:13.240> layer

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
pair makes using the layer by layer

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.110 
pair makes using the layer by layer
method<00:06:13.719> so<00:06:14.529> like<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:14.830> said<00:06:14.889> I'll<00:06:15.279> leave<00:06:15.789> my

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
method so like I said I'll leave my

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.909 
method so like I said I'll leave my
algorithms<00:06:16.779> in<00:06:17.020> a<00:06:17.409> separate<00:06:17.740> video<00:06:18.009> so<00:06:18.659> yeah

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
algorithms in a separate video so yeah

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.070 
algorithms in a separate video so yeah
so<00:06:20.919> that<00:06:21.039> this<00:06:21.159> tutorial<00:06:21.669> isn't<00:06:21.819> as<00:06:21.969> long<00:06:22.180> so<00:06:22.779> I

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
so that this tutorial isn't as long so I

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.839 
so that this tutorial isn't as long so I
hope<00:06:23.500> you<00:06:23.590> guys<00:06:23.710> enjoyed<00:06:24.099> this<00:06:24.279> tutorial<00:06:24.340> and

hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.390 
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and
I<00:06:24.940> hope<00:06:24.969> it<00:06:25.710> helped<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:27.069> solve<00:06:27.340> the

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
I hope it helped you to solve the

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.260 
I hope it helped you to solve the
pairings<00:06:27.729> faster

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
pairings faster

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.850 
pairings faster
I<00:06:28.300> have<00:06:28.659> heard<00:06:28.750> about<00:06:28.870> six<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:29.349> seven<00:06:29.380> seconds

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
I have heard about six to seven seconds

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.709 
I have heard about six to seven seconds
with<00:06:30.009> this<00:06:30.159> method<00:06:30.490> and<00:06:30.639> I<00:06:30.759> do<00:06:30.819> use<00:06:31.270> it<00:06:31.479> it<00:06:31.690> is

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
with this method and I do use it it is

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.920 
with this method and I do use it it is
my<00:06:31.990> main<00:06:32.199> method<00:06:32.560> I<00:06:32.710> guess<00:06:33.180> so<00:06:34.180> yeah<00:06:34.750> that

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
my main method I guess so yeah that

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.510 
my main method I guess so yeah that
combined<00:06:35.320> with<00:06:35.409> the<00:06:35.529> Changzhou<00:06:35.860> pyramus<00:06:36.310> was

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
combined with the Changzhou pyramus was

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.860 
combined with the Changzhou pyramus was
a<00:06:36.550> really<00:06:37.270> nice<00:06:37.449> pair<00:06:37.719> me

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
a really nice pair me

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.650 
a really nice pair me
yeah<00:06:39.200> six<00:06:39.620> to<00:06:39.920> seven<00:06:40.190> seconds<00:06:40.490> average<00:06:40.820> so

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
yeah six to seven seconds average so

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.050 
yeah six to seven seconds average so
Jeff<00:06:41.930> just<00:06:42.140> just<00:06:42.740> practice<00:06:43.190> with<00:06:43.550> this<00:06:43.670> method

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
Jeff just just practice with this method

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.080 
Jeff just just practice with this method
and<00:06:44.210> that<00:06:44.840> should<00:06:45.080> get<00:06:45.230> you<00:06:45.410> a<00:06:45.590> lot<00:06:45.860> faster<00:06:46.310> so

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090
