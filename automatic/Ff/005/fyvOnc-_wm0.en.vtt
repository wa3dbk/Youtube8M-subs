and I found a lot of a oh well there's a
useful<00:00:12.210> nether<00:00:12.389> wart<00:00:12.690> now<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.380> potions<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.910> I

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
useful nether wart now for potions so I

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.109 
useful nether wart now for potions so I
went<00:00:15.120> ahead<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> designed<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.379> new<00:00:17.119> another

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
went ahead and designed a new another

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.609 
went ahead and designed a new another
war<00:00:18.420> farming<00:00:18.960> system<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:21.150> has<00:00:22.080> zero<00:00:22.529> chance

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
war farming system so I has zero chance

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.410 
war farming system so I has zero chance
of<00:00:23.160> failure<00:00:23.460> now<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.760> basically<00:00:26.760> its<00:00:27.000> own<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
of failure now so basically its own a

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.890 
of failure now so basically its own a
pillar<00:00:28.019> style<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.859> yes<00:00:29.599> this<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.750> how

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
pillar style like this yes this is how

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.690 
pillar style like this yes this is how
you<00:00:30.960> plant<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.830> go<00:00:32.070> around<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.550> whole

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
you plant it just go around the whole

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.190 
you plant it just go around the whole
thing<00:00:33.469> open<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> doors<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> plan<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:37.640> yeah

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
thing open the doors to plan and yeah

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.530 
thing open the doors to plan and yeah
same<00:00:40.200> thing<00:00:40.829> over<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.239> my

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
same thing over here this is my

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.090 
same thing over here this is my
detection<00:00:42.989> system<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:45.379> detecting<00:00:46.379> crops<00:00:46.890> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
detection system for detecting crops it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.590 
detection system for detecting crops it
doesn't<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.820> neither<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.329> I'm

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
doesn't just have to be neither was I'm

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
doesn't just have to be neither was I'm
using<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.379> wheat<00:00:49.980> farm<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:52.370> which

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
using this for my wheat farm to which

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.889 
using this for my wheat farm to which
shall<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> posting<00:00:54.120> after<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.449> video<00:00:54.719> but

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
shall be posting after this video but

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.400 
shall be posting after this video but
anyway<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.489> how<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> works<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.420> place

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
anyway so this is how it works you place

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.689 
anyway so this is how it works you place
our<00:00:58.800> timer<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.989> reset<00:01:00.989> everything<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.829> then

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
our timer here reset everything and then

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.609 
our timer here reset everything and then
you<00:01:02.940> wait<00:01:03.149> because<00:01:03.480> nether<00:01:04.049> Ward's<00:01:04.439> have

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
you wait because nether Ward's have

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.850 
you wait because nether Ward's have
three<00:01:05.129> stages<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.970> growth<00:01:06.380> there's<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.530> dis

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
three stages of growth there's a dis

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
three stages of growth there's a dis
stage<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:09.240> there's<00:01:09.540> another<00:01:09.600> stage<00:01:10.170> where

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
stage then there's another stage where

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.810 
stage then there's another stage where
they<00:01:10.680> grow<00:01:10.979> um<00:01:12.860> bigger<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.549> there's<00:01:14.760> another

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
they grow um bigger then there's another

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.080 
they grow um bigger then there's another
one<00:01:15.240> where<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.630> grow<00:01:15.900> another<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.090> think

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
one where they grow another one I think

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.469 
one where they grow another one I think
that's<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.310> only<00:01:20.460> has<00:01:20.640> three<00:01:20.970> they

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that's all that they only has three they

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.990 
that's all that they only has three they
could<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.900> four<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.500> four<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:23.159> my

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
could have four that have four then my

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.840 
could have four that have four then my
mistake<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.659> anyway<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> first

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
mistake but anyway so this is the first

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.399 
mistake but anyway so this is the first
stage<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.119> growth<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.720> assuming<00:01:28.290> that's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
stage of growth I'm assuming that's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
stage of growth I'm assuming that's
three<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:29.130> pretty<00:01:29.970> stupid<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.689> comes<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
three I'm pretty stupid when it comes to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.469 
three I'm pretty stupid when it comes to
these<00:01:31.259> kind<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.619> stuff<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.040> anyway<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.150> let's

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
these kind of stuff but anyway so let's

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.200 
these kind of stuff but anyway so let's
just<00:01:33.689> pretend<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.110> grew<00:01:34.320> one<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> bud

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
just pretend it grew one this is a bud

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.990 
just pretend it grew one this is a bud
switch<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.810> very<00:01:36.990> small<00:01:37.140> simple<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:38.040> hey

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
switch for very small simple one hey

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.580 
switch for very small simple one hey
everyone<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:42.119> activates<00:01:42.990> whatever<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
everyone it just activates whatever and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
everyone it just activates whatever and
then<00:01:43.740> say<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> grows<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:44.939> time<00:01:45.149> which

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
then say it grows one more time which

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.440 
then say it grows one more time which
will<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> last<00:01:45.869> time

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
will be the last time

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.080 
will be the last time
it<00:01:47.990> hits<00:01:48.229> an<00:01:48.409> RS<00:01:48.829> nor<00:01:49.070> latch<00:01:49.130> there<00:01:49.729> which

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
it hits an RS nor latch there which

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.779 
it hits an RS nor latch there which
activates<00:01:50.810> all<00:01:51.110> which<00:01:51.950> pushes<00:01:52.219> down<00:01:52.549> all

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
activates all which pushes down all

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.050 
activates all which pushes down all
these<00:01:52.939> in<00:01:53.090> other<00:01:53.210> words<00:01:54.159> as<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.549> now<00:01:55.579> I<00:01:55.789> have

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.900 
and as I said to replay this open away I
need<00:02:10.069> to<00:02:10.160> reset<00:02:12.130> just<00:02:13.130> replant<00:02:13.819> everything

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
need to reset just replant everything

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.550 
need to reset just replant everything
and<00:02:16.910> once<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.299> finish<00:02:17.569> replanting<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:21.290> then

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
and once you finish replanting you then
