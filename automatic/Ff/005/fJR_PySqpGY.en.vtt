that is really about organization and
making<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.070> easier<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.240> access<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.810> all

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
absolutely sweet is we couldn't change

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.170 
absolutely sweet is we couldn't change
your<00:01:16.680> output<00:01:17.100> file<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> change<00:01:17.939> your

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
your output file when you change your

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
your output file when you change your
destination<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> file<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:19.799> creating

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
destination of the file you're creating

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
destination of the file you're creating
it's<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> use<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> hard-coded<00:01:22.290> paths

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it's not going to use a hard-coded paths

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.620 
it's not going to use a hard-coded paths
as<00:01:22.890> i<00:01:22.920> did<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> path<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.790> past<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.509> it's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
as i did in the path but past but it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
as i did in the path but past but it's
going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.229> relative<00:01:25.830> path<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.280> is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
going to use a relative path which is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.240 
going to use a relative path which is
absolutely<00:01:27.080> absolutely<00:01:28.080> awesome<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.710> only

lib I wish it wouldn't use a full path
but<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.930> still<00:01:46.110> using<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> fill<00:01:46.649> bet<00:01:46.799> so

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
but it's still using a fill bet so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.580 
but it's still using a fill bet so
hopefully<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.149> near<00:01:48.329> future<00:01:48.420> maybe<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
hopefully in the near future maybe a

dobe<00:01:49.979> will<00:01:50.220> come<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.759> with<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> solution

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
dobe will come up with a solution

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.060 
dobe will come up with a solution
because<00:01:51.600> I'll<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.750> actually<00:01:52.320> fantastic<00:01:52.649> if

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
because I'll be actually fantastic if

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.760 
because I'll be actually fantastic if
we're<00:01:53.310> already<00:01:53.430> inside<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.090> folder

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
we're already inside of that folder

we're already inside of that folder
nothing<00:01:55.770> needs<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.979> type<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
nothing needs to type that because I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.700 
nothing needs to type that because I
always<00:01:56.729> would<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.270> inside<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.290> manually

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
always would go inside then manually

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.319
