00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
so that you discharge all static

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.640 
so that you discharge all static
electricity<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.170> computer<00:01:18.560> are

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
electricity and you in the computer are

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.070
