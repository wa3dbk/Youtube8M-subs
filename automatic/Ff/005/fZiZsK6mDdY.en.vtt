00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.700
 Anna, honey, get up. 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.700
 No. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 I have had enough! 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000
 - Hurry up! - What? I'm done. 

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:11.800
 For the Colemanovic family ... 

00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:13.500
 Have gold. And make the right decisions. 

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:16.200
 ... are a dramatic Monday ... 

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:17.450
 No! 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 I can't believe it. It's Jake. 

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.000
 He's not looking here. No, she's definitely looking here. 

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.500
 ... Tuesdays are wild ... 

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.500
 Get out of my room! 

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:32.500
 ... and as far as Anna and Tess are concerned, they never had time to understand each other. 

00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:34.600
 - What? - Time's up, it's sixth. 

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.500
 You're ruining my life! 

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.100
 But on Friday ... 

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:42.500
 - You think I have a perfect life. - In my school, you wouldn't last a day. 

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.301
 Biscuit? 

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.000
 ... it all changes, ... 

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.500
 ... because things start to be a little scary. 

00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:53.350
 Why am I in Anna's room? 

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.000
 It is not mine. 

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.000
 This is not mine either. 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.500
 And this is definitely not mine. 

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:05.800
 So, you're in my body, and I'm in yours. 

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.500
 - I'm old! - Sorry? 

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.500
 I'm like the guardian of the tomb! 

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:12.500
 My darling! 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.000
 Could you just have a second? 

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.500
 - I need my body back. - I have a wedding tomorrow. 

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:20.000
 I won't marry Ryan! 

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:24.000
 - Platinum, great. - Don't even think about it. 

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.000
 JAMIE LEE CURTIS - The thong will kill me. 

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.500
 LINDSAY LOHAN - That's a great motorbike. 

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.500
 - What? - I didn't go. 

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:36.000
 I don't have it. 

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.000
 Walt Disney presents ... 

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:42.500
 ... a film about how much work it will give ... 

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.500
 I can not. 

00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:44.500
 What do you mean? 

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:46.500
 ...realize... 

00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:47.500
 Do something! 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.000
 ... one's dream. 

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:57.200
 - And what you see is what you're missing. - Only selfless love will bring you back. 

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.500
 - How about we? - Yeah. 

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:05.800
 So it was stupid. 

00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.000
 BETWEEN US GIRLS 

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:11.200
 - Where's Harry's school? - He can walk. 

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:12.500
 It's twenty blocks. 

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:14.500
 That you run. ------------------------------ 61eba88b361f--
