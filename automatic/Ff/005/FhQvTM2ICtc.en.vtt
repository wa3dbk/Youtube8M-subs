00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
hallways while sprinting you go super

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.030 
hallways while sprinting you go super
fast<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:48.340> looks<00:02:48.519> pretty<00:02:48.639> funny<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.470> Anna

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
is actually this so there's the skeleton

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.759 
is actually this so there's the skeleton
spawner<00:03:19.269> right<00:03:19.659> there<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:22.319> what<00:03:23.319> I<00:03:23.349> did<00:03:23.739> was

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
spawner right there and what I did was

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.250 
spawner right there and what I did was
when<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.459> got<00:03:24.879> to<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.420> know<00:03:25.540> first<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.959> you

have to take it out of commission you
know<00:03:30.189> torch<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.730> up<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.060> everything<00:03:32.609> but<00:03:34.919> as

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
know torch it up and everything but as

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:49.619 
know torch it up and everything but as
you<00:03:36.129> can<00:03:36.220> see<00:03:36.489> it's<00:03:36.700> very<00:03:37.120> effective<00:03:48.359> but<00:03:49.359> what

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
you can see it's very effective but what

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:56.039 
you can see it's very effective but what
I<00:03:49.659> did<00:03:49.989> was<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:51.870> from<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.760> spawner<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:55.150> counted

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
I did was I from the spawner I counted

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.009 
I did was I from the spawner I counted
four<00:03:56.229> boys<00:03:56.769> out<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:58.829> each<00:03:59.829> side<00:04:00.250> and<00:04:00.989> then<00:04:01.989> I

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
four boys out on each side and then I

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.189 
four boys out on each side and then I
dug<00:04:02.470> two<00:04:02.859> blocks<00:04:03.220> down<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:04.090> now<00:04:04.930> these

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
dug two blocks down and now these

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.990 
dug two blocks down and now these
channels<00:04:05.859> at<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.129> water<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.879> the<00:04:07.199> skeletons

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
channels at the water that the skeletons

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.560 
channels at the water that the skeletons
r8<00:04:12.230> get<00:04:13.230> adding<00:04:13.500> skills<00:04:16.700> so<00:04:17.700> since<00:04:18.209> there<00:04:18.390> a

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
r8 get adding skills so since there a

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.610 
r8 get adding skills so since there a
lock<00:04:18.840> you<00:04:19.350> can<00:04:19.560> see<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.220> water<00:04:21.620> stops

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
lock you can see that the water stops

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.400 
lock you can see that the water stops
right<00:04:22.920> at<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.250> edge<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.790> out<00:04:24.240> right<00:04:24.480> here<00:04:27.410> the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
right at the edge and out right here the

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.040 
right at the edge and out right here the
mobs<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:29.040> simply<00:04:29.430> fall<00:04:29.910> off<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.480> into<00:04:30.870> this

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
mobs just simply fall off and into this

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.040 
mobs just simply fall off and into this
other<00:04:31.290> channel<00:04:31.830> that's<00:04:31.980> running<00:04:32.840> adjacent<00:04:34.880> to

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
other channel that's running adjacent to

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.360 
other channel that's running adjacent to
have<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.200> waters<00:04:37.620> running<00:04:37.920> so<00:04:38.220> they<00:04:38.250> just

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
have this waters running so they just

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.900 
have this waters running so they just
fall<00:04:38.670> into<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.090> little<00:04:39.270> chick<00:04:39.570> right<00:04:39.870> thing

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
fall into this little chick right thing

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.650 
fall into this little chick right thing
they<00:04:41.910> come<00:04:42.240> over<00:04:42.270> here<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:46.400> then<00:04:47.400> as<00:04:47.610> they<00:04:48.480> go

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
they come over here and then as they go

00:04:48.660 --> 00:05:01.130 
they come over here and then as they go
down<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:49.380> was<00:04:49.500> just<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.800> little<00:04:50.070> lobby<00:04:58.880> and<00:05:00.140> then

down it was just a little lobby and then

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.860 
down it was just a little lobby and then
the<00:05:01.260> water<00:05:01.470> just<00:05:01.770> curves<00:05:02.390> and<00:05:03.390> let<00:05:03.600> me<00:05:03.690> show

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
the water just curves and let me show

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.110 
the water just curves and let me show
you<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.110> problem<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:04.740> was<00:05:05.120> originally

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
you the problem that I was originally

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.870 
you the problem that I was originally
get<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.110> box<00:05:07.350> pond<00:05:07.650> over<00:05:07.830> there<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.250> wanted<00:05:08.760> to

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
get the box pond over there I wanted to

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.659

chin<00:05:09.230> and<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.380> have<00:05:10.620> water<00:05:10.919> actually<00:05:11.220> set<00:05:11.640> up

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
chin and I have water actually set up

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.159 
chin and I have water actually set up
going<00:05:11.970> right<00:05:12.180> here<00:05:12.330> see<00:05:12.510> I<00:05:12.630> even<00:05:12.900> have<00:05:13.050> the

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
going right here see I even have the

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.719 
going right here see I even have the
lava<00:05:13.410> Tribune<00:05:13.950> everything<00:05:14.630> but<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.720> was<00:05:16.729> too

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
lava Tribune everything but I was too

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.110 
lava Tribune everything but I was too
far<00:05:18.120> away<00:05:18.330> for<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.960> pop<00:05:19.169> status<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.940> this

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
far away for the pop status so this

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.480 
far away for the pop status so this
ensures<00:05:23.240> five<00:05:24.240> or<00:05:24.419> six<00:05:24.600> blocks<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:25.490> is

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
ensures five or six blocks that is

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.280 
ensures five or six blocks that is
sitting<00:05:26.880> right<00:05:26.910> here<00:05:27.300> see<00:05:27.840> I've<00:05:27.930> already<00:05:28.080> got

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
spawner for the mobs to spawn so that's

00:05:45.139 --> 00:06:02.260 
spawner for the mobs to spawn so that's
why<00:05:45.320> it's<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:47.090> so<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:55.330> items<00:05:59.650> and<00:06:00.940> so<00:06:01.940> that

just have the water it goes into the

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.560 
just have the water it goes into the
other<00:06:09.350> channel<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.889> wraps<00:06:10.100> around<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:10.850> boom

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
other channel that wraps around and boom

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.129 
other channel that wraps around and boom
you're<00:06:11.780> done<00:06:12.669> now<00:06:13.669> I<00:06:13.729> actually<00:06:14.180> have<00:06:14.780> another

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
you're done now I actually have another

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.730 
you're done now I actually have another
skeleton<00:06:15.680> spawner<00:06:16.419> that<00:06:17.419> way<00:06:17.690> as<00:06:17.930> marked<00:06:18.590> out

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
skeleton spawner that way as marked out

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.340 
skeleton spawner that way as marked out
by<00:06:18.770> the<00:06:19.010> spread<00:06:19.400> stone<00:06:19.700> which<00:06:20.600> actually<00:06:20.900> turns

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
by the spread stone which actually turns

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.740 
by the spread stone which actually turns
out<00:06:21.530> to<00:06:21.590> be<00:06:21.740> a<00:06:21.860> pretty<00:06:22.160> good<00:06:22.550> system<00:06:23.479> for

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
out to be a pretty good system for

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.700 
out to be a pretty good system for
marking<00:06:24.289> out<00:06:24.590> pathways<00:06:25.130> and<00:06:25.310> stuff<00:06:25.550> but<00:06:26.330> I<00:06:26.750> was

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
marking out pathways and stuff but I was

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.529 
marking out pathways and stuff but I was
gonna<00:06:27.889> make<00:06:27.979> it<00:06:28.370> so<00:06:28.639> I<00:06:28.970> just<00:06:29.000> dug<00:06:29.840> the

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
gonna make it so I just dug the

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.920 
gonna make it so I just dug the
dimensions<00:06:32.539> of<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:33.110> skeleton<00:06:33.680> spawner<00:06:34.930> like

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
dimensions of the skeleton spawner like

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.279 
dimensions of the skeleton spawner like
twenty<00:06:36.500> four<00:06:37.100> blocks<00:06:37.490> down<00:06:37.789> I<00:06:37.820> think<00:06:38.289> kills

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289 
twenty four blocks down I think kills

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.129 
twenty four blocks down I think kills
mobs<00:06:39.650> or<00:06:39.860> maybe<00:06:40.070> even<00:06:40.160> deeper<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:40.940> so<00:06:41.660> I<00:06:41.840> just

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 
mobs or maybe even deeper and so I just

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.560 
mobs or maybe even deeper and so I just
have<00:06:42.320> a<00:06:42.350> bottomless<00:06:42.950> pit<00:06:43.160> type<00:06:43.880> thing<00:06:44.539> where

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
have a bottomless pit type thing where

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.129 
have a bottomless pit type thing where
Bob's<00:06:45.410> just<00:06:45.860> spawn<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:46.430> fall<00:06:46.610> down<00:06:46.639> but<00:06:47.570> that

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
Bob's just spawn and fall down but that

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.510 
Bob's just spawn and fall down but that
that<00:06:48.380> projects<00:06:48.950> for<00:06:49.130> a<00:06:49.160> little<00:06:49.400> later<00:06:51.099> but<00:06:52.099> so

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
that projects for a little later but so

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.030 
that projects for a little later but so
since<00:06:52.820> I<00:06:52.970> have

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
since I have

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.230 
since I have
all<00:06:54.160> that<00:06:54.580> bone<00:06:55.570> I<00:06:56.020> can<00:06:56.740> make<00:06:57.240> essentially

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
all that bone I can make essentially

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
all that bone I can make essentially
unlimited<00:06:58.630> bone<00:06:59.350> meal<00:06:59.680> which<00:07:00.310> means<00:07:01.260> pretty

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
unlimited bone meal which means pretty

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.650 
unlimited bone meal which means pretty
much<00:07:02.350> unlimited<00:07:02.890> bread<00:07:03.490> and<00:07:03.790> red<00:07:04.390> is<00:07:04.420> a

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
much unlimited bread and red is a

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.400 
much unlimited bread and red is a
fantastic<00:07:05.350> source<00:07:05.980> for<00:07:06.280> food<00:07:06.580> on<00:07:07.230> survival<00:07:08.230> if

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
fantastic source for food on survival if

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.370 
fantastic source for food on survival if
you<00:07:09.040> have<00:07:09.250> Bonilla<00:07:09.790> otherwise<00:07:10.210> it<00:07:10.480> it<00:07:11.050> takes<00:07:11.260> a

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
you have Bonilla otherwise it it takes a

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.800 
you have Bonilla otherwise it it takes a
little<00:07:11.560> bit<00:07:11.770> two<00:07:12.250> logs<00:07:12.610> and<00:07:12.970> crow<00:07:13.210> to<00:07:13.480> release

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
little bit two logs and crow to release

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.980 
little bit two logs and crow to release
stain<00:07:14.320> yourself<00:07:14.830> unless<00:07:15.820> you<00:07:16.210> had<00:07:16.450> quite<00:07:16.930> a
