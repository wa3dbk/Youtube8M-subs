00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.660
 you can see Algae Optimus Speed ​​has been around the world right now 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.709
 Extreme 990 Optimus Speed ​​or Etihad you need it if you like it on demos 2x 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.450
 whatever that is the device that is the packaging 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.480
 Here you will first see the device LG Optimus Speed 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.099
 for a year a few technical data 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.279
 accordingly, the device and a few technical data was again like him 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.989
 Alright, and then I'll just take the device out of the box 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.710
 take it out so they can see it because their son has plastic protection 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.950
 and here we have the money she needs if she has the front 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.100
 this is the device house 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 and who knows what falls on first is relatively difficult to say 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.260
 directly 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.750
 yes it is a bit thicker too 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.120
 of course I had just tested the Samsung Galaxy s2 that is natural 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.820
 much thinner I note you keep next to it 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.229
 first time here what few outside we have posted around here 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.400
 Mehmedi 4 in custody 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.590
 so that device can see properly 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.650
 is 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.160
 So with her a protective Uni front also actually Genoa easy peel off 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.870
 and now we have the device 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.680
 as I said it is definitely a more robust 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.710
 as a single device is then of course also more difficult 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.469
 something weird for example, here by design I would say 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.790
 that's a lot of space for those action buttons when I look at it 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.750
 Of course you do not know why this was the case, so the way was gone 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.260
 might be a little smaller 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.670
 Again, it was less beautiful and you have to work well 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 I can imagine that the device can be there and not so 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 quickly breaks 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.170
 we have it here now we have here when the first smartphone with me 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.470
 Dual core processor respectively 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.400
 Doerr core processor 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.890
 a one-gigahertz processor SAS to become more specific a cell phone Hierzegger 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.360
 Processor and all this Chaumont can watch another video 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.649
 you can look at www Engine 5 7 points e 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.219
 or on YouTube you 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.030
 that's what the turn of the outside looks like we have here 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.830
 male measures by 11 27 millimeters by 64 millimeters May 11 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.010
 Millimeters at the thickest point 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.650
 we have here an entrance for the headphones Dyk pegging me with the box 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.360
 is this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.049
 and we have the entrance hidden under these 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.519
 for a hdmi cable 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.150
 we have the possibility to send the pictures and videos directly to your television 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.150
 transfer 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.129
 about this cable so what do we have as he looks right 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.279
 here find nothing except these two buttons and these are showing Hertha's 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:49.900
 Hawass 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.609
 yes for the volume, of course, determine more thick 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.159
 on the left side, there is absolutely nothing to find more normal there 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.309
 and the rounds 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:05.059
 simply the input for the micro SBK got her juice its percent protection 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.059
 on the new home 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.499
 and we see the boxes here 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.419
 loudspeaker on the back we have an 8-megapixel camera 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.539
 and then done 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.179
 with Google is here 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.499
 here were notified had been announced 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:22.620
 I'm still missing at the front 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.610
 a front camera sensors are installed here and have been here for four years 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.659
 that punishment 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.120
 yes that's all from the outside sure that sammer the samsung s2 the next 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.969
 Müller with the group get an impression how thick that is 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.889
 but I see so much money that it is not now if you do that 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.889
 but looks much easier this device 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.479
 therefore no one should log in here 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.669
 what does it matter to deliver what really show it once and for once 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.870
 Although not even the packaging 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.879
 then there would be data cables Nico SP Zoo is gone 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.239
 here we have an adapter the belly to charge the device at the socket 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.299
 we have nimbly out of the headphones here with 3 4 5 millimeters 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.739
 then we do not lead in Europe that one 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.279
 and Liam wants to make phone calls that we can do more 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.180
 we see for whom 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.350
 Manual also this is the ten millionth Hausen 500 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.590
 MAh mAh battery included with this promises 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.000
 according to Annecy 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.020
 withstand a talk time of ten hours of standby mode every 20 days 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.509
 and would be the sim card 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.450
 We both use them once 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.930
 and there I have to make you a man behind this small step 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.499
 and with something with power stand this nature blanket remove 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.809
 I have to which lanes the battery war always very very hard to get out again 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:51.679
 Everybody has to go out a little bit fast 

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:53.620
 the fingers away 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.279
 then here we have the sim card with the contact down purely 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.400
 and put the Orco with the contacts on top 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:05.639
 Battery of the winner may here had the slot for the Nico is the card 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.659
 we have an internal memory of 505 here you can do the whole thing 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.250
 Of course, expand with a Nico sd card 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.270
 expand up to 32GB 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.540
 Now with the battery, the device weighs 147 grams and costs around 410 euros 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.300
 Here we see very many fingerprints 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.530
 You can see this immediately visible in the light, like the operation 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.780
 of these LG Optimus Speed ​​with the dual-core processor you will be in 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.589
 watch the two videos so look over at www mobile - Enzi dot de
