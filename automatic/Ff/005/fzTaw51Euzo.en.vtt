00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
site that we would be amazed how quickly

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.740 
site that we would be amazed how quickly
these<00:01:56.540> native<00:01:57.229> Elms<00:01:57.770> would<00:01:58.340> would<00:01:59.149> grow<00:01:59.390> once

the<00:02:00.049> garden<00:02:00.619> began<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:01.100> be<00:02:01.220> fertilized<00:02:01.820> and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
the garden began to be fertilized and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.539 
the garden began to be fertilized and
irrigated<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.979> certainly<00:02:04.340> has<00:02:04.520> been

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
irrigated and that certainly has been

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.850 
irrigated and that certainly has been
true<00:02:04.970> when<00:02:05.720> we<00:02:05.869> planted<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.350> garden<00:02:06.680> there

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
true when we planted the garden there

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.870 
true when we planted the garden there
were<00:02:07.149> many<00:02:08.149> areas<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.050> were<00:02:09.560> in<00:02:09.890> full<00:02:10.160> Sun<00:02:10.459> so

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
were many areas that were in full Sun so

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.320 
were many areas that were in full Sun so
we<00:02:11.090> initially<00:02:11.750> planted<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.560> lot<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:13.160> Sun<00:02:14.060> loving

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
we initially planted a lot of Sun loving

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.290 
we initially planted a lot of Sun loving
plants<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:16.280> are<00:02:16.430> slowly<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.239> surely

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
plants and we are slowly but surely

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.949 
plants and we are slowly but surely
losing<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.319> big<00:02:19.190> portion<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.910> those<00:02:20.120> sunny

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
losing a big portion of those sunny

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.920 
losing a big portion of those sunny
areas<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.890> they're<00:02:22.730> being<00:02:22.970> transformed<00:02:23.600> to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
areas and they're being transformed to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.860 
areas and they're being transformed to
areas<00:02:24.350> with<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.530> lot<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.739> shade<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:25.840> as<00:02:26.840> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
areas with a lot of shade but as a

about the soil here that they love it's
been<00:02:48.680> an<00:02:48.799> interesting<00:02:49.280> challenge<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.970> keep

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
been an interesting challenge to keep

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.530 
been an interesting challenge to keep
things<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:51.140> this<00:02:51.350> in<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> right<00:02:51.799> spots<00:02:52.540> based

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540

things in this in the right spots based
on<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.959> light<00:02:54.380> needs

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.069 

but<00:03:14.099> it's<00:03:14.519> okay<00:03:14.819> most<00:03:14.999> gardeners<00:03:15.450> are<00:03:15.749> always

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
but it's okay most gardeners are always

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.559 
but it's okay most gardeners are always
digging<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:17.129> moving<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.639> replacing<00:03:18.180> plants
