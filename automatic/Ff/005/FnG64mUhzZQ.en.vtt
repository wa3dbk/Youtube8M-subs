forward<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.720> that<00:00:39.490> I<00:00:40.990> think<00:00:41.990> they<00:00:42.110> did<00:00:42.470> make<00:00:42.710> a

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
forward to that I think they did make a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.500 
forward to that I think they did make a
few<00:00:42.860> changes<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:46.040> story<00:00:46.640> slightly<00:00:47.420> in

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
few changes to the story slightly in

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.090 
few changes to the story slightly in
terms<00:00:47.750> of<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.080> script<00:00:48.620> because<00:00:48.830> they

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
terms of the script because they

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.250 
terms of the script because they
mentioned<00:00:49.550> how<00:00:49.700> in<00:00:50.060> the<00:00:50.660> tournament<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.170> know

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
mentioned how in the tournament you know

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.090 
mentioned how in the tournament you know
like<00:00:51.440> third<00:00:52.070> fourth<00:00:52.580> and<00:00:52.730> fifth<00:00:52.820> place

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
like third fourth and fifth place

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.620 
like third fourth and fifth place
whoever<00:00:55.100> gets<00:00:55.340> in<00:00:55.460> those<00:00:55.610> ranks<00:00:56.480> in<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
whoever gets in those ranks in the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.930 
whoever gets in those ranks in the
tournament<00:00:57.140> they<00:00:57.680> can<00:00:57.890> win<00:00:58.070> some<00:00:58.400> prize<00:00:58.640> money

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
tournament they can win some prize money

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.360 
tournament they can win some prize money
as<00:00:59.150> well<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.720> that's<00:01:00.380> why<00:01:00.530> Crillon<00:01:00.890> enters

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
as well and that's why Crillon enters

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.680 
as well and that's why Crillon enters
the<00:01:01.520> tournament<00:01:01.670> now<00:01:01.970> I<00:01:02.000> do<00:01:02.180> think<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.450> makes

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
the tournament now I do think that makes

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.750 
the tournament now I do think that makes
more<00:01:02.840> sense<00:01:02.950> than<00:01:03.950> how<00:01:04.129> they<00:01:04.160> did<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.460> in<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
more sense than how they did it in the

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.670 
more sense than how they did it in the
original<00:01:05.200> anime<00:01:06.200> because<00:01:06.440> in<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.590> original

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
original anime because in the original

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.350 
original anime because in the original
enemy<00:01:07.190> i<00:01:07.280> think<00:01:07.460> he<00:01:07.520> just<00:01:07.580> said<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:07.970> first<00:01:08.210> and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
enemy i think he just said the first and

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.810 
enemy i think he just said the first and
second<00:01:08.660> place<00:01:08.870> get<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.140> prize<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:10.520> that<00:01:10.670> makes

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
second place get a prize so that makes

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.400 
second place get a prize so that makes
more<00:01:10.940> sense<00:01:11.000> where<00:01:11.480> I<00:01:11.540> Krillin<00:01:12.080> would<00:01:12.200> want<00:01:12.350> to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
more sense where I Krillin would want to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.380 
more sense where I Krillin would want to
enter<00:01:12.680> because<00:01:12.800> as<00:01:13.400> strongest<00:01:13.790> Crillon<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.150> he

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
enter because as strongest Crillon is he

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.410 
enter because as strongest Crillon is he
should<00:01:14.720> get<00:01:17.110> into<00:01:18.460> at<00:01:19.460> least<00:01:19.520> maybe<00:01:20.090> fifth

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
should get into at least maybe fifth

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.240 
should get into at least maybe fifth
place<00:01:21.370> but<00:01:22.370> then<00:01:22.520> again<00:01:23.890> let's<00:01:24.890> see<00:01:25.070> there's

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
place but then again let's see there's

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.100 
place but then again let's see there's
Goku<00:01:26.020> there's<00:01:27.160> go<00:01:28.160> on<00:01:28.510> rachita<00:01:30.370> piccolo<00:01:32.110> so

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
Goku there's go on rachita piccolo so

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.350 
Goku there's go on rachita piccolo so
yeah<00:01:33.260> crunch<00:01:33.650> again<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.220> fifth<00:01:34.430> place<00:01:34.610> if<00:01:35.120> you

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
yeah crunch again to fifth place if you

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.330 
yeah crunch again to fifth place if you
go<00:01:35.480> by<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.630> launcher<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.409> know<00:01:36.530> because<00:01:37.190> I

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
go by that launcher you know because I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.250 
go by that launcher you know because I
at<00:01:37.940> this<00:01:38.120> time<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.570> series<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.050> know<00:01:39.140> they

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
at this time the series you know they

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.930 
at this time the series you know they
weren't<00:01:39.409> really<00:01:39.620> friends<00:01:39.920> with<00:01:40.130> Hercule<00:01:40.610> so

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
weren't really friends with Hercule so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.910 
weren't really friends with Hercule so
they<00:01:41.450> wouldn't<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:41.900> just<00:01:42.110> let<00:01:42.470> him<00:01:42.650> win<00:01:42.800> the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
they wouldn't have just let him win the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.880 
they wouldn't have just let him win the
tournament<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.400> don't<00:01:43.580> think<00:01:45.220> so<00:01:46.870> again<00:01:47.890> with

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
tournament I don't think so again with

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.230 
tournament I don't think so again with
that<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:49.159> mind<00:01:49.190> Krillin<00:01:49.909> should<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.150> at

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
that in mind Krillin should have at

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.610 
that in mind Krillin should have at
least<00:01:50.270> gone<00:01:50.690> into<00:01:50.900> fifth<00:01:51.110> place<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.560> the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
least gone into fifth place in the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.520 
least gone into fifth place in the
tournament<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.600> won<00:01:53.600> some<00:01:53.780> money<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.500> that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
tournament and won some money so that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.680 
tournament and won some money so that
makes<00:01:55.010> more<00:01:55.159> sense<00:01:55.220> as<00:01:55.700> far<00:01:56.090> as<00:01:56.210> changing<00:01:56.420> the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
makes more sense as far as changing the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.180 
makes more sense as far as changing the
script<00:01:56.930> for<00:01:57.290> why<00:01:57.409> Crillon<00:01:57.830> would<00:01:57.950> want<00:01:58.130> to

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
script for why Crillon would want to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.130 
script for why Crillon would want to
enter<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.490> wall<00:01:58.640> tournament<00:01:59.150> narrow-body
