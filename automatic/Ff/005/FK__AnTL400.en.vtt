00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
experience with how it works in that one
most<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.640> probably<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.300> same<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
most of it is probably the same but you

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.540 
most of it is probably the same but you
may<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> test<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.710> out<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:28.980> yourself<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
may want to test it out for yourself and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580 
may want to test it out for yourself and
you<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.210> let<00:00:30.330> me<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.570> below<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:31.140> anything's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you can let me know below if anything's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.410 
you can let me know below if anything's
different<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.550> put<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:32.700> annotations

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420

have to take it back out of the Sheep
again<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.710> decaying<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> whole<00:01:53.460> time

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
again and it's decaying the whole time

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
again and it's decaying the whole time
so<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.210> would<00:01:54.450> never<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.930> intentionally

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649

different resources now let's take a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.259 
different resources now let's take a
look<00:02:13.230> at<00:02:13.379> some<00:02:13.560> other<00:02:13.680> situations<00:02:14.459> what<00:02:15.030> about

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
look at some other situations what about

this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.830> true<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.190> every<00:02:29.370> version<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.970> I've

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
this is true of every version that I've

this is true of every version that I've
seen<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:31.050> way<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> lot<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> people<00:02:31.650> know<00:02:31.980> you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
seen one way a lot of people know you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.949 
seen one way a lot of people know you
can<00:02:32.280> drop<00:02:32.489> off<00:02:32.640> your<00:02:32.700> resources<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.660> by

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
can drop off your resources is by

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.380 
can drop off your resources is by
building<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.590> new<00:02:34.620> town<00:02:35.069> center<00:02:35.519> as<00:02:35.730> soon<00:02:36.090> as

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
building a new town center as soon as

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.670 
building a new town center as soon as
it's<00:02:36.569> built<00:02:36.750> they<00:02:36.900> drop<00:02:37.110> off<00:02:37.319> all<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
it's built they drop off all the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.650 
it's built they drop off all the
resources<00:02:38.160> regardless<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.090> what<00:02:39.209> type<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.569> is

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
resources regardless of what type it is

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630 
resources regardless of what type it is
that<00:02:40.349> makes<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> lot<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.709> sense<00:02:41.010> because<00:02:41.250> town

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that makes a lot of sense because town

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.490 
that makes a lot of sense because town
centers<00:02:42.000> are<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.209> universal<00:02:42.840> drop-off<00:02:43.200> point

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
centers are a universal drop-off point

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.350 
centers are a universal drop-off point
for<00:02:43.739> everything<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:45.000> what<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:45.209> you're

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
for everything so what if you're

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.910 
for everything so what if you're
building<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.750> lumber<00:02:46.019> camp<00:02:46.230> with<00:02:46.620> some

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
building a lumber camp with some

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.630 
building a lumber camp with some
Lumberjacks

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
Lumberjacks

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.789 
Lumberjacks
well<00:02:48.150> they<00:02:48.420> drop<00:02:48.630> off<00:02:48.840> any<00:02:49.079> wood<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.650> they're

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
well they drop off any wood that they're

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.949 
well they drop off any wood that they're
carrying<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.579> makes<00:02:50.790> sense<00:02:51.030> one<00:02:51.780> thing

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
carrying and that makes sense one thing

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.509 
carrying and that makes sense one thing
you<00:02:52.110> might<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.069> they<00:02:53.340> also

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
you might not know is that they also

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.610 
you might not know is that they also
drop<00:02:53.970> off<00:02:54.180> any<00:02:54.540> other<00:02:54.840> resources<00:02:55.349> they're

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
drop off any other resources they're

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.100 
drop off any other resources they're
carrying<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.579> gold<00:02:56.849> miners<00:02:57.180> drop<00:02:57.420> off<00:02:57.569> gold<00:02:57.900> in

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110

sending new villagers to wood I could
just<00:04:02.760> grab<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.120> wood<00:04:03.299> villagers<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.930> tell

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
just grab the wood villagers and tell

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.690 
just grab the wood villagers and tell
