can see right there so when does come
with<00:02:50.160> handles<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:51.090> don't<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.599> that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
with handles you don't have to get that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.420 
with handles you don't have to get that
option<00:02:52.080> that's<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:52.620> if<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:52.980> want<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.190> add<00:02:53.280> it

on there big guy looks a little feminine
with<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.410> handles<00:02:55.709> but<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.130> mean<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
with the handles but I mean it's a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.430 
with the handles but I mean it's a
personal<00:02:57.120> preference<00:02:57.330> this<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.020> probably<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
personal preference this is probably the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.750 
personal preference this is probably the
type<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.830> thing<00:02:59.040> where<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.340> either<00:02:59.459> carry

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
type of thing where you can either carry

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.220 
type of thing where you can either carry
by<00:02:59.940> itself<00:03:00.270> most<00:03:00.569> likely<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.900> carry<00:03:01.050> this

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
by itself most likely to carry this

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.780 
by itself most likely to carry this
alone<00:03:01.530> or<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.920> can<00:03:02.069> also<00:03:02.250> put<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.610> like<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
alone or you can also put this like a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.850 
alone or you can also put this like a
roof<00:03:03.060> case<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.420> backpack<00:03:03.780> there<00:03:04.770> may<00:03:04.830> be

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
roof case of a backpack there may be

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.170 
roof case of a backpack there may be
some<00:03:05.069> negatives<00:03:05.430> doing<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.850> I'll<00:03:06.000> talk<00:03:06.150> about

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
some negatives doing it I'll talk about

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.610 
some negatives doing it I'll talk about
that<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> second<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:06.840> well<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.500> quite

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
that in a second as well so it's quite

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.800 
that in a second as well so it's quite
open<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.459> basically<00:03:08.580> that's<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
open this up and so basically that's the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.720 
open this up and so basically that's the
MSI<00:03:10.140> right<00:03:10.350> there<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:11.640> perforated

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
MSI right there and it's perforated

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.259 
MSI right there and it's perforated
leather<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.780> see<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.910> hopefully<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
leather you can see that hopefully the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.479 
leather you can see that hopefully the
HD<00:03:15.840> quality<00:03:16.319> is<00:03:16.590> coming<00:03:16.830> out<00:03:16.920> there<00:03:17.069> see<00:03:17.459> that

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
HD quality is coming out there see that

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.400 
HD quality is coming out there see that
leather<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.030> those<00:03:18.690> leathers<00:03:19.110> raised

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
leather and those leathers raised

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.490 
leather and those leathers raised
slightly<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.580> you've<00:03:20.819> got<00:03:20.940> an<00:03:21.060> embossed<00:03:21.500> look

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
slightly and you've got an embossed look

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.410 
slightly and you've got an embossed look
right<00:03:22.709> there<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.610> this<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.970> part<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.330> the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
right there so this is the part on the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.400 
right there so this is the part on the
bottom<00:03:24.540> right<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.930> when<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.110> replace<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
bottom right here when you replace the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.080 
bottom right here when you replace the
laptop<00:03:25.890> right<00:03:26.190> here<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:26.940> is

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
laptop right here and so this is

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.120 
laptop right here and so this is
actually<00:03:27.180> raised<00:03:27.569> maybe<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.680> couple

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
actually raised maybe like a couple

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.610 
actually raised maybe like a couple
millimeters<00:03:29.519> or<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:31.080> by<00:03:31.230> much<00:03:31.380> at<00:03:31.560> all

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
millimeters or so not by much at all

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.170 
millimeters or so not by much at all
this<00:03:32.100> raised<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> little<00:03:32.640> bit<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:32.880> we<00:03:33.060> may

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
this raised a little bit so that we may

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.809 
this raised a little bit so that we may
play<00:03:33.330> put<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.650> macbook<00:03:35.010> 13-inch<00:03:35.430> MacBook

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
in here and we had a little bit of

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.900 
in here and we had a little bit of
circulation<00:03:37.590> going<00:03:37.620> through<00:03:37.950> there<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.250> if

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
circulation going through there and if

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.280 
circulation going through there and if
these<00:03:39.000> rubber<00:03:39.299> or<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.840> these<00:03:39.930> were<00:03:40.049> these

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
these rubber or not these were these

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.039 
these rubber or not these were these
little<00:03:40.530> insert<00:03:41.390> corner<00:03:42.390> pieces<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.780> keep<00:03:42.930> it

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
little insert corner pieces to keep it

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.750 
little insert corner pieces to keep it
in<00:03:43.140> place<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:44.160> we'll<00:03:44.280> move<00:03:44.459> around<00:03:44.670> or

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
in place so we'll move around or

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.490 
in place so we'll move around or
anything<00:03:44.819> pop<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.900> lock<00:03:46.019> up<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.290> there<00:03:46.410> as
