00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello my name is Roma rapmon and 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.700
 today I will cook a crucian 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.429
 or the free romance name of the fish 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.780
 comes from the golden strip 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.219
 between my eyes here it is 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.509
 can see if you see such 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.410
 golden stripe on fish 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.410
 it values 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.619
 so before cooking the city i 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:31.650
 heat the pan as much as possible 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.660
 add olive oil and kin dorado 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.410
 roast 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.460
 turn while me a gift from being fried I 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.890
 even cherry tomatoes in half let down 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.660
 why fish shallots 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.050
 with thin half rings cut shallot show 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.180
 a club that will not be bitter not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.399
 sharpen a fairly neutral forehead 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.680
 so in most European kitchens 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.280
 him 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:07.590
 besides shallots and i will take chili pepper 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.610
 I add chili pepper and do it. 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.680
 capers 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.680
 now color on such pickled buds 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.540
 can be laid 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.820
 but they are softer so i'm fine 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:27.750
 amenable passed slightly to Yanochka 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.750
 the console did on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 simple all 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.380
 some 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.299
 jump 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.719
 and quite a small amount of renault 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:50.380

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.380

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.750
 the channel is big enough so 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.769
