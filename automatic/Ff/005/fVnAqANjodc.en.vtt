00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:05.099 

now<00:00:01.819> in<00:00:01.940> this<00:00:02.030> video<00:00:02.210> I<00:00:02.750> want<00:00:03.499> to<00:00:03.649> focus<00:00:04.520> on

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
now in this video I want to focus on

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.830 
now in this video I want to focus on
contrast<00:00:06.109> and<00:00:06.560> edges<00:00:06.980> and<00:00:07.910> this<00:00:08.630> particular

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
contrast and edges and this particular

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.680 
contrast and edges and this particular
scene<00:00:09.260> there's<00:00:09.560> a<00:00:09.880> storm<00:00:10.880> building<00:00:11.360> up<00:00:11.480> over

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
scene there's a storm building up over

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.480 
scene there's a storm building up over
the<00:00:11.780> mountains<00:00:12.170> this<00:00:12.350> is<00:00:12.590> in<00:00:12.770> the<00:00:12.860> Tetons<00:00:13.280> in

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
the mountains this is in the Tetons in

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.439 
the mountains this is in the Tetons in
Wyoming<00:00:14.080> and<00:00:15.080> you<00:00:15.200> get<00:00:15.350> a<00:00:15.380> lot<00:00:15.650> of<00:00:15.830> variety<00:00:16.039> of

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
Wyoming and you get a lot of variety of

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.810 
Wyoming and you get a lot of variety of
edges<00:00:17.449> as<00:00:18.289> the<00:00:18.470> mountains<00:00:18.800> recede<00:00:19.160> back<00:00:19.400> into

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
edges as the mountains recede back into

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.839 
edges as the mountains recede back into
the<00:00:19.999> to<00:00:20.749> the<00:00:20.869> clouds<00:00:21.199> and<00:00:22.009> then<00:00:22.460> as<00:00:22.580> things

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
the to the clouds and then as things

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.960 
the to the clouds and then as things
gradually<00:00:23.179> come<00:00:23.630> forward<00:00:24.109> the<00:00:24.230> edges<00:00:24.619> get

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
gradually come forward the edges get

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.239 
gradually come forward the edges get
harder<00:00:25.970> until<00:00:26.659> I<00:00:26.869> went<00:00:27.140> my<00:00:27.349> hardest<00:00:27.800> edge<00:00:28.009> it's

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:28.249 
harder until I went my hardest edge it's

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.489 
harder until I went my hardest edge it's
not<00:00:28.400> going<00:00:28.579> to<00:00:28.669> side<00:00:28.909> where<00:00:29.210> they<00:00:29.419> are<00:00:29.599> right

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:30.499 
not going to side where they are right

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.910 
not going to side where they are right
in<00:00:30.710> here<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.550> also<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.180> most<00:00:32.390> contrast<00:00:32.930> most

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
in here and also the most contrast most

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.920 
in here and also the most contrast most
contrast<00:00:34.520> I<00:00:34.760> want<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.330> know<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.480> could<00:00:35.630> have<00:00:35.780> it

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
contrast I want you know I could have it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.870 
contrast I want you know I could have it
here<00:00:35.960> which<00:00:36.590> is<00:00:36.740> a<00:00:36.770> little<00:00:36.980> further<00:00:37.040> back<00:00:37.520> or

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
here which is a little further back or

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.650 
here which is a little further back or
maybe<00:00:38.570> over<00:00:38.870> here<00:00:40.120> but<00:00:41.120> I<00:00:41.150> really<00:00:41.240> want<00:00:41.600> to

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
maybe over here but I really want to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.190 
maybe over here but I really want to
focus<00:00:41.780> on<00:00:42.080> those<00:00:42.290> things<00:00:43.420> make<00:00:44.420> sure<00:00:44.630> I<00:00:44.660> decide

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
focus on those things make sure I decide

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.010 
focus on those things make sure I decide
where<00:00:45.740> the<00:00:45.950> darkest<00:00:46.370> darks<00:00:46.700> are<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.900> know<00:00:47.960> I

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
where the darkest darks are you know I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.140 
where the darkest darks are you know I
don't<00:00:48.230> want<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.440> darkest<00:00:48.830> dark<00:00:49.070> over<00:00:49.400> here<00:00:49.430> or

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
don't want the darkest dark over here or

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.790 
don't want the darkest dark over here or
somewhere<00:00:50.540> back<00:00:50.750> in<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.960> mountains<00:00:51.410> it's

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
somewhere back in the mountains it's

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.050 
somewhere back in the mountains it's
going<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.040> be<00:00:52.160> in<00:00:52.310> here<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:52.880> then<00:00:52.970> the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
going to be in here and then the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.790 
going to be in here and then the
lightest<00:00:53.510> light<00:00:53.780> can<00:00:54.110> be<00:00:54.260> somewhere<00:00:54.650> around

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
lightest light can be somewhere around

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.430 
lightest light can be somewhere around
there<00:00:55.130> also<00:00:55.780> and<00:00:56.780> when<00:00:56.900> we<00:00:56.960> talk<00:00:57.110> about<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
there also and when we talk about the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.140 
there also and when we talk about the
lightest<00:00:57.860> light<00:00:58.100> it's<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.640> know<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:58.880> might

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
lightest light it's you know I might

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.390 
lightest light it's you know I might
have<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.390> small<00:00:59.660> highlight<00:01:00.560> on<00:01:00.770> a<00:01:00.800> tree<00:01:01.160> that's

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
have a small highlight on a tree that's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.210 
have a small highlight on a tree that's
a<00:01:01.490> little<00:01:01.670> bit<00:01:01.820> lighter<00:01:02.140> but<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:03.200> larger<00:01:03.890> shaped

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
a little bit lighter but a larger shaped

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.130 
a little bit lighter but a larger shaped
it's<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.670> lightest<00:01:05.059> light<00:01:05.329> like<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.810> field

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
it's the lightest light like the field

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.200 
it's the lightest light like the field
back<00:01:06.439> here<00:01:06.770> in<00:01:06.859> the<00:01:06.950> grass<00:01:07.189> or<00:01:07.729> maybe<00:01:07.969> this

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
back here in the grass or maybe this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.370 
back here in the grass or maybe this
field<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.780> front<00:01:09.640> or<00:01:10.640> maybe<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.420> clouds

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
field in front or maybe the the clouds

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.489 
field in front or maybe the the clouds
in<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.859> in<00:01:13.219> the<00:01:13.369> distance<00:01:13.759> in<00:01:14.030> there<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:15.439> it

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
in the in the distance in there and it

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.169 
in the in the distance in there and it
doesn't<00:01:15.530> have<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:15.829> be<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.130> lightest<00:01:16.609> but<00:01:16.969> it's

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
doesn't have to be the lightest but it's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.419 
doesn't have to be the lightest but it's
lighter<00:01:17.600> sometimes<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.439> well<00:01:19.009> I'll<00:01:19.280> always

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
lighter sometimes the well I'll always

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.489 
lighter sometimes the well I'll always
make<00:01:19.819> maybe<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.390> clouds<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:21.170> are<00:01:21.319> hit<00:01:21.469> by

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
make maybe the clouds that are hit by

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.669 
make maybe the clouds that are hit by
the<00:01:21.649> sunlight<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.399> lightest<00:01:23.499> because<00:01:24.499> that's

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
the sunlight the lightest because that's

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.340 
the sunlight the lightest because that's
the<00:01:24.890> light<00:01:25.069> source<00:01:25.509> but<00:01:26.509> aside<00:01:26.840> from<00:01:26.899> that<00:01:27.170> I

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
the light source but aside from that I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.779 
the light source but aside from that I
want<00:01:27.679> to<00:01:27.770> make<00:01:27.890> sure<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
want to make sure this is the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.899 
want to make sure this is the
concentration<00:01:29.749> of<00:01:30.229> darkest<00:01:30.889> dark<00:01:31.219> and<00:01:31.670> you

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
concentration of darkest dark and you

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.609 
concentration of darkest dark and you
know<00:01:31.999> pretty<00:01:32.240> light<00:01:32.539> lights<00:01:32.899> are<00:01:33.319> right

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
know pretty light lights are right

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.359 
know pretty light lights are right
around<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:34.069> here<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:36.170> what<00:01:36.350> if<00:01:36.439> I<00:01:36.560> think

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
around in here so what if I think

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.980 
around in here so what if I think
compositionally<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:38.299> is<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.509> very<00:01:38.780> long

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
compositionally this is a very long

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.020 
compositionally this is a very long
composition

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
composition

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.429 
composition
I've<00:01:41.030> already<00:01:41.270> cropped<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:41.929> it<00:01:42.049> was<00:01:42.200> more

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
I've already cropped it it was more

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.709 
I've already cropped it it was more
square<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:43.189> think<00:01:43.939> in<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.149> terms<00:01:44.329> of<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
square and I think in in terms of the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.230 
square and I think in in terms of the
long<00:01:44.959> range<00:01:45.409> of<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.770> mountains<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.490> Tetons

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
long range of the mountains the Tetons

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.709 
long range of the mountains the Tetons
here<00:01:47.689> are<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.259> very<00:01:48.619> long<00:01:48.889> range<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:50.420> range

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
here are a very long range and the range

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.389 
here are a very long range and the range
of<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> trees<00:01:51.289> in<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.649> sunlight<00:01:52.069> so<00:01:52.280> it's

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
of the trees in the sunlight so it's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.160 
of the trees in the sunlight so it's
more<00:01:52.639> of<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.819> longer<00:01:53.090> composition<00:01:53.929> there's

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
more of a longer composition there's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.440 
more of a longer composition there's
nothing<00:01:54.579> really<00:01:55.579> tall<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:58.090> makes<00:01:59.090> me<00:01:59.270> want

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
nothing really tall that makes me want

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.029 
nothing really tall that makes me want
to<00:01:59.509> go<00:01:59.600> vertical<00:01:59.899> or<00:02:00.409> square<00:02:00.770> or<00:02:00.950> even

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
to go vertical or square or even

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.249 
to go vertical or square or even
rectangle<00:02:01.819> I<00:02:01.969> mean<00:02:02.450> obviously<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.810> mountains

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
rectangle I mean obviously the mountains

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.469 
rectangle I mean obviously the mountains
are<00:02:03.409> tall<00:02:03.649> but<00:02:03.679> in<00:02:04.279> this<00:02:04.700> photograph<00:02:04.969> they're

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
are tall but in this photograph they're

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.749 
are tall but in this photograph they're
not<00:02:05.659> they're<00:02:06.590> more<00:02:06.829> spread<00:02:07.279> out<00:02:07.310> horizontally

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
not they're more spread out horizontally

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.880 
not they're more spread out horizontally
than<00:02:08.450> they<00:02:08.539> are<00:02:08.569> vertically<00:02:09.170> same<00:02:09.590> thing<00:02:09.769> with

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
than they are vertically same thing with

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.369 
than they are vertically same thing with
the<00:02:09.979> treaty's<00:02:10.399> spread<00:02:11.180> out<00:02:11.330> horizontally<00:02:11.540> so

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
the treaty's spread out horizontally so

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.500 
the treaty's spread out horizontally so
I<00:02:12.590> want<00:02:13.189> to<00:02:13.310> stick<00:02:13.549> with<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.879> more

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
I want to stick with a more

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.559 
I want to stick with a more
horizontal<00:02:15.700> picture<00:02:16.700> or<00:02:17.530> size<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.739> canvas<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
horizontal picture or size of canvas and

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.199 
horizontal picture or size of canvas and
it<00:02:20.569> also<00:02:20.690> gives<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.260> variety<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:24.250> size<00:02:25.250> if

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
it also gives you a variety of size if

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.059 
it also gives you a variety of size if
everything<00:02:26.659> you<00:02:26.780> paints<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.260> rectangle<00:02:27.890> nine

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
everything you paints a rectangle nine

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.570 
everything you paints a rectangle nine
by<00:02:28.280> twelve<00:02:28.610> love<00:02:28.909> my<00:02:29.060> 14<00:02:29.569> 8<00:02:29.780> by<00:02:29.959> 10<00:02:30.580> there's

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
by twelve love my 14 8 by 10 there's

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.280 
by twelve love my 14 8 by 10 there's
kind<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.910> sameness<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.599> composition

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
kind of a sameness to the composition

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.930 
kind of a sameness to the composition
but<00:02:33.319> when<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.709> can<00:02:33.890> stretch<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.310> out<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.670> little

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
but when you can stretch it out a little

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.940 
but when you can stretch it out a little
bit<00:02:35.120> makes<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> little<00:02:36.170> bit<00:02:36.349> easier<00:02:36.680> than<00:02:36.739> I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
bit makes it a little bit easier than I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.670 
bit makes it a little bit easier than I
can<00:02:37.190> are<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.879> little<00:02:38.030> bit<00:02:38.180> more<00:02:38.360> variety<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:39.019> can

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
can are a little bit more variety I can

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.300 
can are a little bit more variety I can
zoom<00:02:40.250> in<00:02:40.690> make<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.720> more<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.079> a<00:02:42.170> rectangle<00:02:45.310> pull

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
zoom in make it more of a rectangle pull

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.199 
zoom in make it more of a rectangle pull
back<00:02:46.579> here

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
back here

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.140 
back here
I<00:02:49.510> never<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.690> more<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.110> rectangle<00:02:51.829> I<00:02:52.459> could

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
I never have more of a rectangle I could

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.630 
I never have more of a rectangle I could
push<00:02:53.599> this<00:02:53.810> around<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.799> can<00:02:54.950> raise<00:02:55.190> up<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
push this around you can raise up the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.660 
push this around you can raise up the
horizon<00:02:56.090> line<00:02:56.299> pretty<00:02:56.629> high<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:58.370> where<00:02:58.519> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
horizon line pretty high to where the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.190 
horizon line pretty high to where the
water<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.299> trees<00:02:59.599> become<00:03:00.019> more

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
water and the trees become more

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.949 
water and the trees become more
important<00:03:00.680> or<00:03:00.859> lower<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.730> where<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.660> sky

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
important or lower it to where the sky

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.930 
important or lower it to where the sky
and<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.290> mountain<00:03:03.650> becomes<00:03:03.980> more<00:03:04.400> important

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and the mountain becomes more important

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.210 
and the mountain becomes more important
so<00:03:05.150> thank<00:03:05.420> through<00:03:05.690> those<00:03:05.900> things<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.890> shape

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
so thank through those things the shape

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.890 
so thank through those things the shape
of<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.879> composition<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:11.480> then<00:03:11.750> we're<00:03:11.870> not

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
of the composition and then we're not

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.440 
of the composition and then we're not
really<00:03:12.019> talking<00:03:12.349> size<00:03:12.829> here<00:03:13.250> cuz<00:03:13.489> size<00:03:13.700> is

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
really talking size here cuz size is

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.569 
really talking size here cuz size is
going<00:03:14.629> to<00:03:14.690> be<00:03:14.810> small<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:15.410> I'll<00:03:16.069> probably<00:03:16.310> do

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
going to be small like I'll probably do

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.759 
going to be small like I'll probably do
this<00:03:18.459> 8<00:03:19.459> by<00:03:19.760> 13<00:03:20.299> or<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:20.810> do<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:20.959> 6<00:03:21.260> by<00:03:21.440> 12

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
this 8 by 13 or I can do it 6 by 12

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.250 
this 8 by 13 or I can do it 6 by 12
those<00:03:22.340> are<00:03:22.519> long<00:03:22.730> compositions<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.780> don't<00:03:24.169> have

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
those are long compositions I don't have

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.870 
those are long compositions I don't have
to<00:03:24.349> do<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.590> big<00:03:24.829> just<00:03:25.370> because<00:03:25.639> it's<00:03:25.819> long<00:03:27.880> so

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
to do it big just because it's long so

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.610 
to do it big just because it's long so
that's<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.209> pretty<00:03:29.329> good<00:03:29.450> composition<00:03:29.959> too<00:03:30.440> but

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
that's a pretty good composition too but

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.289 
that's a pretty good composition too but
again<00:03:30.709> we're<00:03:30.950> getting<00:03:31.040> more<00:03:31.280> rectangular<00:03:31.970> and

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
again we're getting more rectangular and

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.920 
again we're getting more rectangular and
I<00:03:32.450> want<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.810> focus<00:03:34.120> compositionally<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
I want to focus compositionally on the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.839 
I want to focus compositionally on the
long<00:03:39.200> horizontal<00:03:39.739> feel<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.489> mountains

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
long horizontal feel of the mountains

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.449 
long horizontal feel of the mountains
and<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.120> horizontal<00:03:41.480> feel<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.410> trees<00:03:42.709> so

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
and the horizontal feel of the trees so

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.449 
and the horizontal feel of the trees so
I<00:03:43.489> see<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.090> as<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.419> horizontal<00:03:45.459> composition

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
I see this as a horizontal composition

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.690 
I see this as a horizontal composition
and<00:03:46.579> that's<00:03:46.730> what<00:03:46.910> we'll<00:03:47.090> go<00:03:47.540> with
