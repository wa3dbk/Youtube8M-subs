out<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> pretty<00:01:36.270> lightweight<00:01:36.570> lowell

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
out this is a pretty lightweight lowell

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.350 
out this is a pretty lightweight lowell
total<00:01:37.979> light<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.909> would<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.060> weighs<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
total light and it would just weighs a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.380 
total light and it would just weighs a
pound<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.490> question<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.939> had<00:01:42.150> when

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
pound or so so the question we had when

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.330 
pound or so so the question we had when
we<00:01:42.420> first<00:01:42.509> saw<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.710> know<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
we first saw this is you know can I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280 
we first saw this is you know can I
actually<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> little<00:01:45.240> bit<00:01:45.390> heavier<00:01:45.810> weight

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
actually put a little bit heavier weight

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
actually put a little bit heavier weight
of<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.950> light<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.909> I'm<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> clamp

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
of a light on here so I'm going to clamp

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.819 
of a light on here so I'm going to clamp
that<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> side<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.590> ladder

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
that right to the side of this ladder

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.889 
that right to the side of this ladder
and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:50.700> here's<00:01:50.970> my<00:01:51.180> Profoto

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and then here's my Profoto

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.560 
and then here's my Profoto
this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.799> an<00:01:52.890> acute<00:01:53.250> head<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.610> d<00:01:53.700> forehead<00:01:54.180> this

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this is an acute head of d forehead this

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.090 
this is an acute head of d forehead this
is<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> normal

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
is what it's going to be a normal

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.969 
is what it's going to be a normal
weighing<00:01:56.729> studio<00:01:57.570> light<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.049> I'll<00:01:58.560> stick

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
weighing studio light and I'll stick

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.459 
weighing studio light and I'll stick
this<00:01:59.159> right<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.700> there<00:01:59.939> tighten<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> down<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
this right on there tighten it down and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
this right on there tighten it down and
you<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.189> like<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.659> our

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
you can see just like that we have our

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.289 
you can see just like that we have our
pro<00:02:04.649> photo<00:02:04.829> head<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.180> is

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
pro photo head on there and so this is

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.580 
pro photo head on there and so this is
probably<00:02:06.509> gonna<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.689> one<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> heavier

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
probably gonna be one of the heavier

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.930 
probably gonna be one of the heavier
heads<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.220> put<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
heads that you would put on this and you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.999 
heads that you would put on this and you
can<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> Det<00:02:09.599> holds<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.500> fine

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
can see the Det holds it just fine

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400 
can see the Det holds it just fine
so<00:02:11.310> this<00:02:11.870> clamp<00:02:12.870> here

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so this clamp here

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.710 
so this clamp here
is<00:02:13.560> yeah<00:02:14.160> pretty<00:02:14.190> beefy<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.970> I'll<00:02:15.300> take<00:02:15.540> that

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
is yeah pretty beefy and I'll take that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.790 
is yeah pretty beefy and I'll take that
off<00:02:15.930> now<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.440> other<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.480> made<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:18.870> using

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
off now the other one is made for using

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.130 
off now the other one is made for using
a<00:02:20.370> light<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.150> might<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> little<00:02:21.870> teeny

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
a light that might have a little teeny

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.410 
a light that might have a little teeny
quarter<00:02:22.740> twenty<00:02:23.160> thread<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.270> me

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
quarter twenty thread and this is me

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.300 
quarter twenty thread and this is me
something<00:02:24.750> for<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> speed<00:02:25.500> light<00:02:25.770> now

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
something for like a speed light now

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.940 
something for like a speed light now
I'll<00:02:26.460> show<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:26.910> fast<00:02:27.240> here<00:02:27.680> if<00:02:28.680> you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
I'll show you right fast here if you

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.410 
I'll show you right fast here if you
have<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> normal<00:02:29.520> speed<00:02:29.820> light<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.240> my

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
have a normal speed light this is my

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.410 
have a normal speed light this is my
nikon<00:02:31.110> sb-700<00:02:31.830> usually<00:02:32.700> inside<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.210> box

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
nikon sb-700 usually inside the box

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.640 
nikon sb-700 usually inside the box
you've<00:02:33.660> got<00:02:33.810> something<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.200> looks<00:02:34.320> like

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
you've got something that looks like

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.250 
you've got something that looks like
this<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:36.030> normally<00:02:36.570> made<00:02:36.810> for

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
this and this is normally made for

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260 
this and this is normally made for
shooting<00:02:37.710> on<00:02:37.830> flat<00:02:38.160> surfaces<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:38.940> could

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
shooting on flat surfaces so you could

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.510 
shooting on flat surfaces so you could
slide<00:02:40.170> your<00:02:40.410> speed<00:02:40.650> light<00:02:40.830> onto<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.220> and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
slide your speed light onto that and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.250 
slide your speed light onto that and
stick<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.300> down<00:02:42.450> on<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.690> surface<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.140> that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
stick it down on a surface and that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.110 
stick it down on a surface and that
works<00:02:43.440> great<00:02:43.740> if<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.160> flat<00:02:44.640> surfaces

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
works great if you have flat surfaces

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.970 
works great if you have flat surfaces
but<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.660> happens<00:02:46.020> when<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.470> want<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.710> hang

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
but what happens when you want to hang

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.700 
but what happens when you want to hang
this<00:02:47.130> from<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.520> ceiling<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:48.690> stick<00:02:49.530> it<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.680> a

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
this from the ceiling or stick it on a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.960 
this from the ceiling or stick it on a
door<00:02:49.950> or<00:02:50.070> something<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.520> get<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.700> out<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
door or something and get it out of the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.330 
door or something and get it out of the
way<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.930> nice<00:02:52.080> thing<00:02:52.110> about<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:52.950> on

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
way well the nice thing about this is on

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.100 
way well the nice thing about this is on
the<00:02:53.460> bottom<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:53.970> almost<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:54.690> these<00:02:54.840> plates

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
the bottom of almost all these plates

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.290 
the bottom of almost all these plates
there<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> quarter<00:02:55.950> twenty<00:02:56.070> thread<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.910> so

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
there is a quarter twenty thread and so

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.670 
there is a quarter twenty thread and so
that<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.720> mount<00:02:58.050> these<00:02:58.260> two<00:02:58.530> light

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
that you can mount these two light

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.040 
that you can mount these two light
stands<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.550> so<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.850> works<00:03:00.030> great<00:03:00.390> because<00:03:00.840> I

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
stands and so that works great because I

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.040 
stands and so that works great because I
can<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.350> take<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.070> this<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.310> my<00:03:02.430> small

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
can just take this and this is my small

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.680 
can just take this and this is my small
socket<00:03:04.050> head<00:03:04.350> here<00:03:04.620> my<00:03:04.890> ball<00:03:05.100> head<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.510> can

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
socket head here my ball head so I can

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.450 
socket head here my ball head so I can
move<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.020> around<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.190> allows<00:03:08.430> me

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
move that around and what that allows me

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.640 
move that around and what that allows me
to<00:03:08.730> do<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.030> right<00:03:09.270> underneath<00:03:09.480> here<00:03:10.110> there's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
