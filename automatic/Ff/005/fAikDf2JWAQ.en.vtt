after you do a whole bunch of stuff but
um<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:08.220> obvious<00:01:08.369> use<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.240> shoot<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
um so the obvious use is you shoot a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
um so the obvious use is you shoot a
zombie<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.960> turns<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.530> human<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.250> then

zombie it turns into a human and then
when<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> human<00:01:12.510> tries<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:13.580> essentially

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
when the human tries to go essentially

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.310 
when the human tries to go essentially

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.770 
chase after them won't run after them
and<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.340> won't<00:01:41.549> hit<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.119> anything<00:01:42.299> so

and they won't hit them or anything so

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
and they won't hit them or anything so
if<00:01:42.869> your<00:01:43.229> teammates<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.740> trouble<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> can

if your teammates in trouble you can

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
if your teammates in trouble you can
just<00:01:45.320> shoot<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.439> once<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.860> he'll<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.159> good

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
just shoot them once and he'll be good

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.840 
just shoot them once and he'll be good
and<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.270> also<00:01:48.420> calm<00:01:49.259> down<00:01:49.350> George<00:01:50.340> Romero

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and you can also calm down George Romero

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.380 
and you can also calm down George Romero
without<00:01:51.720> having<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> put<00:01:52.530> them<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> water

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
without having to put them in the water

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
without having to put them in the water
so<00:01:54.390> those<00:01:54.840> things<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.259> all<00:01:55.350> pretty<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.799> but

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
so those things are all pretty good but

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.950 
so those things are all pretty good but
then<00:01:56.610> upgraded<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.790> far<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.329> only<00:02:00.360> distant

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
then upgraded so far the only distant

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.590 
then upgraded so far the only distant
difference<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:01.649> I've<00:02:01.799> found<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.820> think

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
difference what I've found is I think

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
difference what I've found is I think
more<00:02:03.930> zombies<00:02:04.439> chase<00:02:04.710> after<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.130> human<00:02:05.340> if

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
more zombies chase after the human if

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.119 
more zombies chase after the human if
you<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.119> turn<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.630> into<00:02:06.810> human<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:08.099> also

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
you like turn one into human but also

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.730 
you like turn one into human but also
the<00:02:09.060> most<00:02:09.090> important<00:02:09.780> thing

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
the most important thing

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.760 
the most important thing
is<00:02:10.980> if<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:12.120> shoot<00:02:12.450> your<00:02:12.630> teammate<00:02:13.110> they<00:02:13.530> also

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is if you shoot your teammate they also

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
is if you shoot your teammate they also
be<00:02:14.130> they<00:02:14.400> become<00:02:14.670> invisible<00:02:15.060> or<00:02:15.450> whatever<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
be they become invisible or whatever to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.970 
be they become invisible or whatever to
the<00:02:16.020> zombies<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:17.070> they<00:02:17.250> also<00:02:17.490> get<00:02:18.060> insta-kill

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
the zombies but they also get insta-kill

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.960 
the zombies but they also get insta-kill
which<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.390> pretty<00:02:21.390> cool<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.920> you're<00:02:23.100> if

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
which is pretty cool so if you're if

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.760 
which is pretty cool so if you're if
you're<00:02:24.120> trying<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> get<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:25.050> someone

you're trying to get to like someone

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.890 
you're trying to get to like someone
who's<00:02:26.010> down<00:02:26.250> or<00:02:26.460> something<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.030> pop<00:02:27.270> like

your other two teammates or whatever
with<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.910> then<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.630> clear<00:02:30.900> out

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
with it and then they can like clear out

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.770 
with it and then they can like clear out
all<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.890> area<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.220> zombies<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.820> someone<00:02:33.660> with

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
to call it he will go under the ice for

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.350 
to call it he will go under the ice for
depending<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.040> how<00:02:59.160> long<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.490> round<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.940> maybe

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
depending on how long the round is maybe

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.800 
depending on how long the round is maybe
a<00:03:00.450> round<00:03:00.750> or<00:03:00.990> two<00:03:01.020> or<00:03:01.560> not<00:03:01.980> even<00:03:02.220> around<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:03.510> if

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
a round or two or not even around so if

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.970 
a round or two or not even around so if
you're<00:03:03.900> trying<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.200> get<00:03:04.290> rid<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.500> him<00:03:04.710> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
you're trying to get rid of him a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.670 
you're trying to get rid of him a
killing<00:03:05.910> quote<00:03:06.570> unquote<00:03:06.690> killing<00:03:07.320> him<00:03:07.470> like

with a scavenger or something it's

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.310 
with a scavenger or something it's
probably<00:03:10.260> better<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:10.800> he<00:03:11.190> will<00:03:12.140> be<00:03:13.140> gone

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
probably better because he will be gone
