we<00:00:01.140> go<00:00:01.199> five<00:00:01.500> number<00:00:02.010> three<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:04.140> write

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
we go five number three we have to write

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.660 
we go five number three we have to write
out<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.589> reaction<00:00:05.130> whenever<00:00:05.339> you<00:00:05.580> have

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
out the reaction whenever you have

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.760 
out the reaction whenever you have
something<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.330> can<00:00:06.569> write<00:00:06.779> it<00:00:06.990> out<00:00:07.080> it's

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
something that you can write it out it's

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.430 
something that you can write it out it's

this<00:01:16.470> reaction<00:01:17.130> should<00:01:17.400> look<00:01:17.670> very<00:01:17.909> familiar

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this reaction should look very familiar

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
this reaction should look very familiar
to<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.170> if<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.070> recognize<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to you if I recognize it it's the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.370 
to you if I recognize it it's the
reverse<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.720> ion<00:01:25.020> product<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.740> water<00:01:26.030> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
reverse of the ion product of water and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.649 
reverse of the ion product of water and
it<00:01:28.380> has<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> special<00:01:28.860> K<00:01:29.280> which<00:01:29.700> K<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:31.100> K<00:01:32.100> W

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
it has a special K which K is that K W

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.179 
it has a special K which K is that K W
which<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.689> equal<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> give<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.770> back<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
which is equal to give it on back the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.020 
which is equal to give it on back the
test<00:01:35.369> 1.0<00:01:35.909> times<00:01:36.180> 10<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> minus<00:01:36.900> 14<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
test 1.0 times 10 to the minus 14 when I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.730 
test 1.0 times 10 to the minus 14 when I
flip<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.750> reaction<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.530> happens<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> K

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
flip a reaction what happens to the K

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.859 
flip a reaction what happens to the K
put<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> Flint<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
put the Flint in and it

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.929 
put the Flint in and it
yeah<00:01:48.640> kW<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.270> -<00:01:50.869> power<00:01:51.469> when<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.369> multiply

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
yeah kW the - power when I multiply

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.090 
yeah kW the - power when I multiply
through<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.359> reaction<00:01:53.990> by<00:01:54.109> two<00:01:54.170> what<00:01:54.740> happens

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
through a reaction by two what happens

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.599 
through a reaction by two what happens
to<00:01:55.250> K<00:01:55.840> squared<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.289> is<00:01:57.469> kW<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.250> minus

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
to K squared so this is kW to the minus

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.539 
to K squared so this is kW to the minus
2<00:01:58.789> power<00:01:59.000> or<00:01:59.869> if<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.710> look<00:02:00.859> on<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.130> answer

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
2 power or if you look on the answer

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.109 
2 power or if you look on the answer
here<00:02:01.729> 1.0<00:02:02.329> times<00:02:02.600> 10<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.049> 28<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.939> flip<00:02:04.939> over

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
here 1.0 times 10 to the 28 I flip over

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.830 
here 1.0 times 10 to the 28 I flip over
the<00:02:05.299> 14<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:05.959> multiply<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.409> by<00:02:06.469> 2<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.660> whole

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
the 14 and multiply it by 2 so the whole

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.979 
the 14 and multiply it by 2 so the whole
policy<00:02:12.230> would<00:02:12.940> recognize<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.360> reaction

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
policy would recognize this reaction

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.180 
policy would recognize this reaction
right<00:02:15.140> here<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.590> your<00:02:15.799> ion<00:02:16.220> product<00:02:16.519> reaction
