gameplay<00:03:41.990> essentially<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:44.020> no<00:03:45.020> release<00:03:45.350> date

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
gameplay essentially is no release date

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.230 
gameplay essentially is no release date
we're<00:03:46.040> still<00:03:46.340> not<00:03:46.460> this<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:46.850> still<00:03:47.120> in

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
we're still not this is still in

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.710 
we're still not this is still in
development<00:03:47.330> so<00:03:48.050> my<00:03:48.410> theory<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:50.120> d23

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
development so my theory is that a d23

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.780 
development so my theory is that a d23
which<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.230> at<00:03:51.380> disney<00:03:51.740> expo<00:03:52.190> thing<00:03:52.220> that
