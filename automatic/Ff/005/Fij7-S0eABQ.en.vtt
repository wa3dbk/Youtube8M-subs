I'll touch Commerce mostly and then i'll

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.510

i'm switching the over attachment for

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.480 
i'm switching the over attachment for
toughness<00:02:11.170> is<00:02:11.530> really<00:02:11.920> really<00:02:12.099> key<00:02:12.430> now

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
toughness is really really key now

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.610

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
really want to use toughness anyway just

awesome thinkers if you if you haven't
like<00:02:24.020> if<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.500> first<00:02:24.800> game<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:25.190> your<00:02:25.460> aims<00:02:25.610> not

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
like if you first game on your aims not

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.390 
like if you first game on your aims not
really<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.240> like<00:02:27.050> good<00:02:27.290> then<00:02:27.710> toughness<00:02:28.280> it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
really that like good then toughness it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.530 
really that like good then toughness it
allows<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.790> get<00:02:28.880> them<00:02:29.060> kills<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.480> you

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
allows you to get them kills that you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.990 
allows you to get them kills that you
want<00:02:29.720> either<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.830> when<00:02:31.520> going<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.850> these

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
want either get that when going on these

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.670 
want either get that when going on these
long<00:02:32.180> streaks<00:02:32.570> it's<00:02:32.750> really<00:02:33.110> important<00:02:33.500> now

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
long streaks it's really important now

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.010 
long streaks it's really important now
like<00:02:34.040> you're<00:02:34.400> gonna<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.000> get<00:02:35.120> lucky<00:02:35.570> but

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
like you're gonna have to get lucky but

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.050 
like you're gonna have to get lucky but
soften<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:36.980> makes<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:37.370> lot<00:02:37.490> easier<00:02:37.550> so

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
soften it just makes it a lot easier so

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.990 
soften it just makes it a lot easier so
get<00:02:38.300> into<00:02:38.510> them<00:02:38.630> head-on<00:02:38.870> gunfights<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:40.790> can

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
get into them head-on gunfights you can

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.060 
get into them head-on gunfights you can
just<00:02:41.120> like<00:02:41.270> win<00:02:42.170> them<00:02:42.290> or<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:42.650> usually<00:02:42.800> you

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
just like win them or what usually you

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.160 
just like win them or what usually you
can<00:02:43.280> kill<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.700> guy<00:02:43.850> if<00:02:44.180> he's<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> if<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.990> shoot

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
can kill the guy if he's a if you shoot

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.630 
can kill the guy if he's a if you shoot
at<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.440> because<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.770> flinch<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.430> game

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
at you because the flinch in this game

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.540 
at you because the flinch in this game
is<00:02:47.090> pretty<00:02:47.450> pretty<00:02:48.170> high<00:02:48.460> especially<00:02:49.460> with

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
is pretty pretty high especially with

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.800 
is pretty pretty high especially with
some<00:02:49.790> machine<00:02:50.000> England's<00:02:50.270> if<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.480> get<00:02:50.630> hit

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
some machine England's if you get hit

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.720 
some machine England's if you get hit
with<00:02:50.960> an<00:02:51.080> assault<00:02:51.380> rifle<00:02:51.470> at<00:02:51.740> close<00:02:51.950> range<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
with an assault rifle at close range the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.730 
with an assault rifle at close range the
flinch<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.240> pretty<00:02:53.540> damn<00:02:53.750> high<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.200> yeah

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
flinch is pretty damn high so yeah

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.530 
flinch is pretty damn high so yeah
toughness<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> big<00:02:55.670> thing<00:02:55.880> when<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.270> for

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
toughness is a big thing when going for

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.530 
toughness is a big thing when going for
nuclear<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.250> definitely<00:02:58.250> switch<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.940> second

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
nuclear so definitely switch that second

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.160 
nuclear so definitely switch that second
attachment<00:02:59.780> out<00:03:00.170> for<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.600> fifth<00:03:02.930> perk

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
attachment out for a for the fifth perk

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.620 
attachment out for a for the fifth perk
because<00:03:03.500> like<00:03:03.680> five<00:03:04.190> perks<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.090> its

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
because like five perks is and its

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.150 
because like five perks is and its
really<00:03:05.840> advantageous<00:03:06.620> when<00:03:06.830> you're<00:03:07.010> going

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
really advantageous when you're going

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.250 
really advantageous when you're going
for<00:03:07.340> nucleus<00:03:07.700> like<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:07.910> said<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:08.810> anyway<00:03:09.050> in

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
for nucleus like I said but anyway in

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.290 
for nucleus like I said but anyway in
this<00:03:09.560> game<00:03:09.800> play<00:03:10.070> I<00:03:10.340> was<00:03:10.700> pretty<00:03:10.940> much<00:03:11.000> just

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
this game play I was pretty much just

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.210 
this game play I was pretty much just
trying<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.690> play<00:03:11.900> as<00:03:12.140> sensible<00:03:12.620> as<00:03:12.680> possible

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
trying to play as sensible as possible

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.250 
trying to play as sensible as possible
now<00:03:13.370> because<00:03:14.060> I'm<00:03:14.270> going<00:03:14.480> for<00:03:14.660> nuclear<00:03:15.080> I

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
now because I'm going for nuclear I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.290 
now because I'm going for nuclear I
wanted<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.590> rock<00:03:15.860> out<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.520> non-lethal<00:03:17.000> kill

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
wanted to rock out the non-lethal kill

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.270 
wanted to rock out the non-lethal kill
streets<00:03:17.570> which<00:03:17.750> in<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:17.960> game<00:03:18.200> play<00:03:18.440> I've<00:03:18.650> got

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
streets which in this game play I've got

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.450 
streets which in this game play I've got
the<00:03:19.490> UAV<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.270> orbital<00:03:20.690> vsat<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.740> EMP<00:03:22.280> now

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
the UAV the orbital vsat and the EMP now

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.220 
the UAV the orbital vsat and the EMP now
the<00:03:22.520> EMP<00:03:23.090> seems<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.420> be<00:03:23.480> working<00:03:23.690> really<00:03:24.080> well

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
the EMP seems to be working really well

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.200 
the EMP seems to be working really well
going<00:03:24.920> for<00:03:25.100> non-lethal<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.700> mean<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.030> other

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
going for non-lethal I mean the other

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.780 
going for non-lethal I mean the other
kind<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.750> variation<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.130> non-lethal

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
kind of variation of this non-lethal

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.820 
kind of variation of this non-lethal
killstreak<00:03:29.390> loadout<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.140> use<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.350> UAV

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
killstreak loadout is to use the UAV

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.550 
killstreak loadout is to use the UAV
account<00:03:31.460> UAV<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> absolute<00:03:32.420> visa<00:03:32.840> but

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
account UAV and the absolute visa but

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.010 
account UAV and the absolute visa but
because<00:03:34.210> because<00:03:35.210> this<00:03:35.420> is<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.810> first

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
because because this is like the first

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.610 
because because this is like the first
time<00:03:36.200> I've<00:03:36.650> used<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.600> EMP<00:03:38.600> in<00:03:38.810> my<00:03:39.020> non-lethal

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
time I've used the EMP in my non-lethal

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.830 
time I've used the EMP in my non-lethal
setup<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.130> obviously<00:03:41.120> worked<00:03:41.450> pretty<00:03:41.630> well

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
setup and obviously worked pretty well

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.780 
setup and obviously worked pretty well
on<00:03:41.960> mice<00:03:42.080> again<00:03:42.320> nuclear<00:03:42.710> so<00:03:42.920> I'm<00:03:43.160> kind<00:03:43.700> of

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
on mice again nuclear so I'm kind of

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.920 
on mice again nuclear so I'm kind of
thinking<00:03:43.940> that

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
thinking that

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.740 
thinking that
it's<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.650> lot<00:03:45.799> more<00:03:45.829> useful<00:03:46.189> now<00:03:46.819> he<00:03:46.909> just<00:03:47.209> it's

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
it's a lot more useful now he just it's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.119 
it's a lot more useful now he just it's
just<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.049> thing<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.469> you<00:03:48.560> seem<00:03:48.739> some<00:03:48.920> days

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
just the thing that you seem some days

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.800 
just the thing that you seem some days
the<00:03:49.310> enemies<00:03:49.609> it<00:03:49.760> makes<00:03:50.000> you<00:03:50.120> scream<00:03:50.450> go<00:03:50.629> all

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
the enemies it makes you scream go all

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.809 
the enemies it makes you scream go all
weird<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:51.409> stuff<00:03:51.469> and<00:03:51.859> then<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.790> just

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
weird and stuff and then it just

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.190 
weird and stuff and then it just
confuses<00:03:53.299> them<00:03:53.689> i<00:03:53.780> don't<00:03:53.900> know<00:03:53.989> if<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.170> really

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
confuses them i don't know if it really

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.039 
confuses them i don't know if it really
does<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.739> but<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.640> would<00:03:56.239> seem<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.719> have<00:03:56.870> that

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
does that but it would seem to have that

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.449 
does that but it would seem to have that
kind<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.319> effect<00:03:57.680> on<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.980> enemies<00:03:58.280> and

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
kind of effect on the enemies and

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.940 
kind of effect on the enemies and
obviously<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.569> disables<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.079> radar<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.680> which

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
obviously it disables the radar to which

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.640 
obviously it disables the radar to which
and<00:04:01.189> the<00:04:01.730> khania<00:04:01.969> v<00:04:02.180> does<00:04:02.510> also<00:04:02.989> but<00:04:03.439> i'm<00:04:03.500> not

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
and the khania v does also but i'm not

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.740 
and the khania v does also but i'm not
sure<00:04:03.859> which<00:04:04.040> lasts<00:04:04.489> longer<00:04:04.849> than<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.329> EMP

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
sure which lasts longer than the EMP

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.569 
sure which lasts longer than the EMP
might<00:04:06.379> last<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.680> little<00:04:06.859> bit<00:04:06.980> longer<00:04:07.250> i'm<00:04:07.459> not

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
might last a little bit longer i'm not

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.830 
might last a little bit longer i'm not
sure<00:04:07.730> i<00:04:07.790> mean<00:04:07.969> it<00:04:08.060> should<00:04:08.239> do<00:04:08.389> soon<00:04:08.599> as<00:04:08.689> though

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
sure i mean it should do soon as though

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.339 
sure i mean it should do soon as though
is<00:04:09.379> it<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.549> a<00:04:10.579> high<00:04:10.790> score<00:04:11.150> shriek<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:11.689> anyway

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
is it is a high score shriek but anyway

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.920 
is it is a high score shriek but anyway
it<00:04:12.620> does<00:04:12.859> a<00:04:13.180> disabled<00:04:14.180> enemy<00:04:14.510> Scott<00:04:14.780> shrieks

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
it does a disabled enemy Scott shrieks

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.449 
it does a disabled enemy Scott shrieks
oh<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.439> might<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:15.889> get<00:04:16.009> like<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.220> hunter-killer

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
oh I might just get like a hunter-killer

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.920 
oh I might just get like a hunter-killer
John<00:04:16.850> or<00:04:16.970> something<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.479> thing<00:04:17.660> won't<00:04:17.780> be

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
John or something that thing won't be

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.479 
John or something that thing won't be

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
by bouncing but how clutch was I

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.170 
by bouncing but how clutch was I
literally<00:04:28.009> got<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.370> kill<00:04:28.550> and<00:04:28.669> then<00:04:28.789> died<00:04:29.000> but
