00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and r7 to represent more like mid range

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.870 
and r7 to represent more like mid range
performance<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.860> get<00:02:05.040> three<00:02:05.460> numbers

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
performance then we get three numbers

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.749 
performance then we get three numbers
after<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.899> indicate<00:02:07.380> performance<00:02:08.340> so

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
after that to indicate performance so

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.119 
after that to indicate performance so
250<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.629> less<00:02:09.899> than<00:02:10.080> 260<00:02:10.649> which<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> less<00:02:11.039> than

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
250 is less than 260 which is less than

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.220 
250 is less than 260 which is less than
270<00:02:11.520> 280<00:02:11.730> 290<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.480> an

X in some cases might indicate more

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.949 
X in some cases might indicate more
performance<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.879> basically<00:02:17.940> how<00:02:18.569> it

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
performance so that is basically how it

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.309

have<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.109> budget<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.560> because<00:03:08.040> they<00:03:08.220> know

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
have to budget that because they know

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.559 
have to budget that because they know
they're<00:03:08.700> going<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:08.879> have<00:03:09.030> some<00:03:09.209> dedicated

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
they're going to have some dedicated

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.449 
they're going to have some dedicated
processing<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.859> not<00:03:11.040> only<00:03:11.069> take

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
processing for it that can not only take

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.000 
processing for it that can not only take
that<00:03:11.760> load<00:03:11.910> off<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.239> cpu<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:13.109> also<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.440> do

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
that load off the cpu but also just do

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.680 
that load off the cpu but also just do
it<00:03:14.160> better<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:14.879> we'll<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.060> able<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.299> have<00:03:15.450> more

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
it better so we'll be able to have more

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.110 
it better so we'll be able to have more
voices<00:03:16.019> better<00:03:16.799> environmental<00:03:17.430> sound<00:03:17.910> and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
voices better environmental sound and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.330 
voices better environmental sound and
it's<00:03:18.239> kind<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.480> like<00:03:18.630> adding<00:03:19.019> like<00:03:19.769> physics

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
it's kind of like adding like physics

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's kind of like adding like physics
support<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.940> sound<00:03:21.239> when<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.510> have<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.750> kind

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
support to sound when you have this kind

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.599 
support to sound when you have this kind
of<00:03:22.019> processing<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.769> go<00:03:22.980> into<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.430> a

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
of processing so you go into like a

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.089 
of processing so you go into like a
dungeon<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.660> instead<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.560> developer

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
dungeon and instead of the developer

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.280 
dungeon and instead of the developer
just<00:03:26.340> kind<00:03:26.639> of<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:27.000> making<00:03:27.630> noises<00:03:27.810> that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
just kind of like making noises that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.069 
just kind of like making noises that
sound<00:03:29.130> more<00:03:29.700> dungeon<00:03:30.510> II<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.810> then<00:03:30.930> maybe

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
sound more dungeon II and then maybe

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.050 
sound more dungeon II and then maybe
adding<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.470> little<00:03:31.620> bit<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.829> like<00:03:32.160> reverb<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.910> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
adding a little bit of like reverb to it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.009 
adding a little bit of like reverb to it
and<00:03:33.209> then<00:03:33.329> when<00:03:33.450> you<00:03:33.510> walk<00:03:33.660> out<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:33.930> room

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
and then when you walk out of that room

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.949 
and then when you walk out of that room
immediately<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.859> changes<00:03:35.310> instead<00:03:36.120> sounds

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
immediately it changes instead sounds

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.030 
immediately it changes instead sounds

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.920 
will be generated where they're
generated<00:03:38.549> they<00:03:38.819> will<00:03:39.000> bounce<00:03:39.239> off<00:03:39.510> objects

with<00:06:35.090> full<00:06:35.390> mantle<00:06:35.780> support<00:06:36.169> so<00:06:36.919> you<00:06:36.979> might<00:06:37.190> be

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
with full mantle support so you might be

with full mantle support so you might be
wondering<00:06:37.370> Linus<00:06:38.120> how<00:06:38.300> did<00:06:38.479> you<00:06:38.599> make<00:06:38.720> it<00:06:38.960> this

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
wondering Linus how did you make it this

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.710 
wondering Linus how did you make it this
far<00:06:39.200> into

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
far into

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.140 
far into
the<00:06:39.810> video<00:06:40.050> without<00:06:40.260> talking<00:06:41.100> about<00:06:41.130> the<00:06:41.460> 290

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
the video without talking about the 290

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.520 
the video without talking about the 290
in<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.330> 290x<00:06:42.960> well<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:44.190> answer<00:06:44.220> is<00:06:44.850> that<00:06:45.530> but

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
in the 290x well the answer is that but

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.010 
in the 290x well the answer is that but
there<00:06:46.860> we<00:06:47.370> don't<00:06:47.490> have<00:06:47.730> many<00:06:47.970> details<00:06:48.540> on<00:06:48.810> them

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
there we don't have many details on them

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.310 
there we don't have many details on them
yet<00:06:49.260> so<00:06:49.470> stay<00:06:50.460> tuned<00:06:50.760> guys<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.390> NBA<00:06:51.690> has<00:06:52.020> not

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
yet so stay tuned guys the NBA has not

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.740 
yet so stay tuned guys the NBA has not
lifted<00:06:52.530> on<00:06:52.800> those<00:06:52.980> cards<00:06:53.430> but<00:06:53.790> be<00:06:54.330> very

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
lifted on those cards but be very

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.190 
lifted on those cards but be very
excited<00:06:55.410> for<00:06:55.950> when<00:06:56.250> they<00:06:56.790> hit<00:06:57.330> now<00:06:57.840> the<00:06:57.900> last

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
excited for when they hit now the last

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.720 
excited for when they hit now the last
thing<00:06:58.320> I<00:06:58.470> did<00:06:58.620> want<00:06:58.740> to<00:06:58.860> mention<00:06:58.950> is<00:06:59.310> true

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
thing I did want to mention is true

thing I did want to mention is true
audio<00:07:00.090> support<00:07:00.360> will<00:07:01.050> actually<00:07:01.590> only<00:07:01.860> be

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
audio support will actually only be

audio support will actually only be
implemented<00:07:02.850> on<00:07:02.970> the<00:07:03.450> 260x<00:07:04.320> the<00:07:04.620> 290<00:07:05.130> and<00:07:05.220> the

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
290x but mantle which I really feel is

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.820 
290x but mantle which I really feel is
the<00:07:09.090> truly<00:07:09.750> important<00:07:10.470> thing<00:07:10.650> that's

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
the truly important thing that's

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.560 
the truly important thing that's
happening<00:07:11.250> right<00:07:11.310> now<00:07:11.460> is<00:07:11.850> going<00:07:12.390> to<00:07:12.480> be

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
happening right now is going to be

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.290 
happening right now is going to be
available<00:07:12.840> across<00:07:13.530> the<00:07:14.100> board<00:07:14.370> get<00:07:15.150> it

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
available across the board get it

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.170 
available across the board get it
because<00:07:15.600> it's<00:07:16.290> a<00:07:16.410> graphics<00:07:16.830> board<00:07:17.460> like<00:07:17.760> pce

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
because it's a graphics board like pce

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.060 
because it's a graphics board like pce
printed<00:07:18.660> circuit<00:07:19.020> board<00:07:19.260> anyway<00:07:19.890> without

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
printed circuit board anyway without

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.340 
printed circuit board anyway without
further<00:07:20.220> ado<00:07:20.820> I<00:07:21.420> think<00:07:21.810> that's<00:07:21.960> it<00:07:22.140> for<00:07:22.170> the

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
further ado I think that's it for the

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.900 
further ado I think that's it for the
shot<00:07:22.560> so<00:07:22.770> if<00:07:22.860> you<00:07:22.980> could<00:07:23.130> my<00:07:23.340> assistant<00:07:23.760> could

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:23.910 
shot so if you could my assistant could

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.970 
shot so if you could my assistant could
just<00:07:24.090> kind<00:07:24.210> of<00:07:24.300> hand<00:07:24.480> me<00:07:24.630> the<00:07:24.890> equipment<00:07:25.890> here

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980 
just kind of hand me the equipment here

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.290 
just kind of hand me the equipment here
