00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.900
 of the totally free person that 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.599
 they have appeared very good and when 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.730
 they wanted to continue good let's see if this 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.660
 video exceeds like all previous 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.660
 the stores 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.980
 this thanks maybe and that you know that if 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:36.710
 you give me a little weird voice 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:38.449
 and that's because these guys do not 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.670
 roll more I hope you like the 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.809
 games and let's say with the video the first 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.059
 game that I'm going to teach you is called 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.860
 mortal kombat 10 and surely many of 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.809
 you will already know this title of 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.000
 I have played on other platforms as 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.040
 good as can be the playstation for 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.479
 those who do not know mortal kombat is a 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.970
 fighting game of the most played of the 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.949
 world together with the tekken are worth together 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.600
 with things like poker and the truth is 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.089
 which is a pretty good game 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.369
 graphically as you see is super 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.380
 currado and me if it were you I 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.390
 they would download fast as you can 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.760
 find it for free both in 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.830
 them as therefore if you like them 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.710
 this kind of deadly 10 kombat games is 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.549
 a great option and as I tell you to run 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.549
 guys that is 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.420
 the next game that he usually teaches is 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.280
 the model compass 5 which is the best 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.860
 first person shooter under my point 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.869
 of view for mobile platforms the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.149
 game graphically the truth is that it is 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.250
 One pass and you are already seeing it 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.869
 history then more of the same and the only 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.310
 hit that you could put this game is 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.649
 who eats the battery but with all 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.570
 the graphics you have etcetera the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.759
 truth is that I think it is impossible 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.440
 do not consume a little and take the 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.299
 game has a campaign mode that 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.799
 lasts about five hours is worth 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.800
 your level that the truth is that in the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.690
 Campaign mode is super cursed worth 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.909
 so we go well traveling more 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.250
 world and the multiplayer mode that under a 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.039
 point of view is the strong point of the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.259
 game is valid with the modalities that can 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.819
 have any shooter game like that 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.490
 Well, it could be because 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.899
 example the gameplay capture of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.689
 flag 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.930
 the truth is that as you are seeing this 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:17.180
 game is not that I recommend it is that 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.730
 you have to have it directly 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.920
 you can find it for free in 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.310
 the app store and I've downloaded it 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.310
 because it's a game that is this game 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.910
 because 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.570
 the next game that I'm going to show you 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.490
 is the call or mini zombies that is a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.200
 third person shooter with some 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.910
 3d graphics as you are seeing very 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.040
 good and with a visual style like that 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.720
 pulling cartoon that as I already 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.510
 you know guys is a style that to me 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.210
 cool pretty good the game has 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.800
 three modes is worth in survival mode in the 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.200
 that we have to survive the maximum 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.190
 possible time to successive hordes of 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.470
 zombies that is the one that I am playing 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.760
 right now the cooperative mode that 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.820
 it's the same as this but 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.350
 accompanied by another person is worth online and 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.940
 the online mode is worth the classic 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.850
 dead man's that is all against all 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.220
 Now I will kill this logos 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.780
 well the controls the truth is 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.910
 which are very simple is very 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.860
 often play and the truth is that I am 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.630
 dealing quite a lot with this game well what 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.670
 I've made guys Carlos a thousand zombies a 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.070
 I play the next game that I 'm going to 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.080
 teach if tying anointed 2 and it's a 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.880
 type of action platform game like this 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.020
 retro as there are 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.670
 good as it was just said is a 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.650
 platform is very peculiar in that 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.870
 we have to overcome a lot of levels 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.220
 I think there are 90 more while we send 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.410
 all kinds of monsters that go 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.230
 appearing 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.330
 good as you see the game surely you 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.880
 moves more to the generation of 90 the 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.620
 truth is that it's a game like that 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.930
 The first ones are worth the oldest 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.180
 we play in Danish and the game to simple 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.970
 View seems easy but it is not easy 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.010
 to me personally sometimes I get to 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.230
 despair because I do not get 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.970
 move to some screen therefore if 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.940
 you like this kind of games like that 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.280
 super mario I recommend this is worth the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.350
 hero rank 2 that the truth is that it's 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.330
 pretty well done to play is very 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.030
 simple provides a lot of hours 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.450
 of entertainment and as I tell you it is not 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.520
 nothing simple 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.710
 the next game will teach them the gear 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.420
 stone surely many of you already 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.580
 you will know this title vale is a game 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.500
 weaken and for those who do not know it 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.180
 It is a very addictive card game 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.970
 I do not recommend you start playing 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.010
 for nothing because if you do not go to vice 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.460
 until recently this game is only 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.170
 I could play on mac or pc or ipad voucher and 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.850
 does nothing came out the mobile version that 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.220
 Many people are waiting for 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.710
 start continuously throughout the 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.770
 day and the truth is that as you can see 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.680
 very well it's super intuitive and I do not know 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.000
 moves away much to the mobile version of 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.070
 mac or pc 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.950
