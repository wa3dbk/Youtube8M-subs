 5 when cars 2 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.449
 Why 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.730
 on this play area 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.960
 erected to international standards 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 the president of the republic has arrived 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.509
 with at his side 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.480
 the footballer samuel eto'o 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.550
 to Gabonese youth here 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.550
 the Cameroonian international staying at Gabon 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.160
 to reserve the scoop of the announced 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.360
 of creation in our country 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.880
 a foundation 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.700
 who now bears his name 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.559
 I've had 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 the chance to have london free 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.210
 friendship with my older brother 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.140
 and I thought 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.360
 and other purposes the child of Cameroonians I am in the cold since 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.880
 an African moment 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.880
 why we will not do something 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.600
 after several 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.690
 that's why I came here today with my big brother's permission 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.540
 for the handles 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 the samuel eto'o foundation 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.580
 so that in ten years we had teams ready to win the cup of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.020
 world because it's my dream 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.710
 I still have three four years 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.580
 in football I hope to win the World Cup with Cameroon but that 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.430
 will be the world cup of Africans 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.170
 if I can not do it as a player it must be like an ash tree 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.820
 in front of my place 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.610
 for the benefit of Gabonese youth 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.240
 the initiative 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.720
 Ã©loi 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.450
 she constitutes 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.760
 school condition 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.410
 for the head of state 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.430
 it was an act of terror to the very dimension 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.590
 from the generosity dgrad 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.640
 from this illustrious son of the continent to the world 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.230
 all Gabonese and Gabonese 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.230
 donated to the brothers samuel eto'o 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.650
 Why 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.270
 his vision 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.000
 and his generosity 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.080
 we must always welcome companies like his 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.199
 someone who is as good at life 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.649
 and who thinks 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.349
 that the chance he had 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.269
 he must be able to share it with others 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.999
 so we are obviously 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.509
 very pleased 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.239
 before we see him by our side 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.629
 for the little samuel story 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.039
 some thought 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.129
 when we look at the side 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.389
 I was in the process of the transfer window not being completed 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.089
 to negotiate to bring week hector came to play in a club here 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:39.419
 3 but m so our exchanges are not over yet 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:41.069
 Sharko some of his hopes 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.069
 because it had been announced somewhere in Russia 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.839
 but he still first wanted to enjoy the African heat of arolla 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.379
 why he is a little bit here 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.179
 so if I wanted to enjoy 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:55.449
 goal show 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.609
 the stage you know you've ever seen 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.459
 montpellier 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.849
 progress 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.659
 and to tell him yes we were waiting for him 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.509
 in one of these stadiums 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.659
 to play the final 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.929
 because 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.459
 as a Gabonese 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.119
 samuel enlighten he owes us a revenge 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.279
 at 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:23.339
 class its there wages certainly kept in gold letters 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:25.029
 in history 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.009
 this sports structure under construction 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.839
 symbol of the future of sirens the department of loire
