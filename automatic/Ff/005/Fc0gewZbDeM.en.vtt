00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
by section okay so once you get all the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.830 
by section okay so once you get all the
way<00:02:11.900> down<00:02:12.200> your<00:02:12.470> ponytail<00:02:13.069> um<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:14.180> are

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
way down your ponytail um you are

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.680 
way down your ponytail um you are
basically<00:02:15.530> almost<00:02:16.010> done<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:16.970> i'm<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.450> going

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
basically almost done but i'm just going

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.949 
basically almost done but i'm just going
to<00:02:17.810> continue<00:02:18.250> gently<00:02:19.250> kind<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.610> tugging<00:02:20.540> on

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
to continue gently kind of tugging on

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.220 
to continue gently kind of tugging on
the<00:02:21.860> little<00:02:22.190> sections<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.660> make<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.870> a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
the little sections just to make it a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.250 
the little sections just to make it a
little<00:02:24.530> uneven<00:02:25.099> not<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.060> uniform<00:02:26.690> i<00:02:26.900> think<00:02:27.110> by

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
little uneven not so uniform i think by

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.940 
little uneven not so uniform i think by
doing<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:28.069> it'll<00:02:28.519> look<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.209> lot<00:02:29.420> more<00:02:29.950> unique

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
doing this it'll look a lot more unique

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430 
doing this it'll look a lot more unique
and<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.400> little<00:02:31.640> less<00:02:31.819> little<00:02:32.660> kiddish<00:02:33.019> i<00:02:33.230> guess

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
and a little less little kiddish i guess

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.809 
and a little less little kiddish i guess
um<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.970> just<00:02:35.000> go<00:02:35.780> through<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.470> gently<00:02:36.819> tug

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
um so just go through it and gently tug

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.280 
um so just go through it and gently tug
on<00:02:37.970> each<00:02:38.180> section<00:02:38.690> once<00:02:38.930> you're<00:02:39.110> finished

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
on each section once you're finished
