hi I'm Allison Trimble with willfully
guided<00:00:03.120> horsemanship<00:00:03.830> this<00:00:04.830> question<00:00:05.190> was

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
guided horsemanship this question was

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.309 
guided horsemanship this question was
submitted<00:00:05.520> from<00:00:05.879> Katie<00:00:06.150> Campbell<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.779> Alaska

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
and she says I've started turning my

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.150 
and she says I've started turning my
horse<00:00:09.420> around<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.139> he<00:00:10.440> wants<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.769> step<00:00:10.980> behind

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
horse around and he wants to step behind

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
horse around and he wants to step behind
more<00:00:11.730> than<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:12.000> front<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.420> his<00:00:12.450> spin<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.139> this

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
more than in front in his spin and this

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.279 
more than in front in his spin and this
is<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> great<00:00:14.490> question<00:00:14.759> Katie<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.480> actually<00:00:16.109> is

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
is a great question Katie it actually is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.820 
is a great question Katie it actually is
extremely<00:00:16.890> common<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:18.080> a<00:00:19.080> lot<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.470> horses<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
extremely common for a lot of horses to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.090 
extremely common for a lot of horses to
do<00:00:19.980> when<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.220> start<00:00:20.279> spinning<00:00:20.850> them<00:00:22.100> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
do when you start spinning them the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.740 
do when you start spinning them the
first<00:00:23.310> thing<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.699> know<00:00:23.820> about<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.240> turnaround

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
first thing to know about a turnaround

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.109 
first thing to know about a turnaround
is<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.289> forward<00:00:25.710> motion<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> unless

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
is that it's forward motion and unless

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670 
is that it's forward motion and unless
you<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.390> able<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:28.050> horse<00:00:28.260> reaching

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
you are able to have your horse reaching

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
you are able to have your horse reaching
one<00:00:28.890> foot<00:00:29.160> around<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.760> other<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.150> front<00:00:30.269> of

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
one foot around the other in front of

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.700 
one foot around the other in front of
that<00:00:30.510> foot<00:00:30.810> you're<00:00:31.170> never<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.650> able

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that foot you're never going to be able

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.639 
that foot you're never going to be able
to<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.669> proper<00:00:33.090> foundation<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.350> build

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to have the proper foundation to build

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.920 
to have the proper foundation to build
into<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> fast<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> free<00:00:36.030> spin<00:00:36.300> down<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.750> road

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
into a fast or a free spin down the road

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.440 
into a fast or a free spin down the road
so<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:38.190> happens<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.700> lot<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.940> people<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so what happens with a lot of people is

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.850 
so what happens with a lot of people is
that<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.870> start<00:00:40.170> stepping<00:00:40.530> their<00:00:40.649> horse

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that is they start stepping their horse

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860 
that is they start stepping their horse
around<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> turn<00:00:41.790> around<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.300> I

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
around here and a turn around and I

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
around here and a turn around and I
think<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> where<00:00:43.620> most<00:00:43.860> people<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.280> into

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
think this is where most people get into

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000 
think this is where most people get into
trouble<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.660> easiest<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.739> feel

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
trouble is the easiest thing to feel

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.430 
trouble is the easiest thing to feel
sometimes<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.210> wrong<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.260> they

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
sometimes is when it's wrong and so they

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.830 
sometimes is when it's wrong and so they
feel<00:00:49.620> their<00:00:49.860> horse<00:00:50.070> move<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.879> way<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.719> what

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
feel their horse move this way but what

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.569 
feel their horse move this way but what
they're<00:00:52.020> feeling<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> horse<00:00:52.920> stopping

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
they're feeling is this horse stopping

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
they're feeling is this horse stopping
sucking<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.629> moving<00:00:55.199> across<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.890> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
sucking back and moving across and so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
sucking back and moving across and so
around<00:00:57.360> properly<00:00:57.989> you're<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
around properly you're not going to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.139 
around properly you're not going to
really<00:00:58.739> feel<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.219> much<00:00:59.399> happening<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.120> I

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
really feel as much happening so what I

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.819 
really feel as much happening so what I
think<00:01:00.449> happens<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> people<00:01:00.960> start<00:01:01.230> walking

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
think happens is people start walking

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.590 
think happens is people start walking
their<00:01:01.920> horse<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:03.180> start<00:01:03.449> asking

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
their horse around and they start asking

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.440 
their horse around and they start asking
him<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> step<00:01:04.229> around<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> turn<00:01:05.159> around<00:01:05.450> or

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
him to step around into a turn around or

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.940 
him to step around into a turn around or
they're<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.810> working<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
they're not working for it at all and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.920 
they're not working for it at all and
they<00:01:08.040> don't<00:01:08.220> feel<00:01:08.400> them<00:01:08.610> stepping<00:01:09.299> forward<00:01:09.659> or

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
they don't feel them stepping forward or

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.719 
they don't feel them stepping forward or
they<00:01:10.020> start<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> stop<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.549> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
they start from a stop and the way that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
they start from a stop and the way that
they<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> feel<00:01:12.180> their<00:01:12.420> horse<00:01:12.570> move<00:01:12.810> across<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
they can feel their horse move across is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.789 
they can feel their horse move across is
as<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> steps<00:01:13.920> behind<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.619> actually

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
as it steps behind here so and actually

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
as it steps behind here so and actually
this<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> problem<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.270> this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is this is a problem that this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
this is this is a problem that this
horse<00:01:18.689> has<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.170> different<00:01:19.500> way<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
horse has in a different way it's just

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
horse has in a different way it's just
that<00:01:20.220> he<00:01:20.400> subtly<00:01:21.000> wants<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> suck<00:01:21.600> back<00:01:21.810> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that he subtly wants to suck back a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.530 
that he subtly wants to suck back a
little<00:01:22.170> more<00:01:22.580> than<00:01:23.580> another<00:01:23.880> horse<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> when

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
little more than another horse and when

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.390 
little more than another horse and when
he's<00:01:24.750> moving<00:01:24.960> forward<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> way<00:01:25.680> he<00:01:25.890> properly

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
he's moving forward the way he properly

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.190 
he's moving forward the way he properly
should<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.390> turns<00:01:27.630> around<00:01:27.960> nice<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
should he really turns around nice and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
should he really turns around nice and
when<00:01:28.530> he<00:01:28.619> sucks<00:01:28.860> back<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.430> he<00:01:29.549> can

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
when he sucks back a little bit he can

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.030 
when he sucks back a little bit he can
start<00:01:29.939> getting<00:01:30.180> his<00:01:30.270> feet<00:01:30.509> knocking<00:01:30.900> together

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
start getting his feet knocking together

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
start getting his feet knocking together
and<00:01:32.040> kind<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.640> his<00:01:32.759> own<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and kind of get in his own way so what I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
and kind of get in his own way so what I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
would tell people to do is break the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.270 
would tell people to do is break the
turnaround<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:38.070> bunch

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
turnaround and think of it in in a bunch

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
turnaround and think of it in in a bunch
of<00:01:38.600> individual<00:01:39.600> steps<00:01:40.020> while<00:01:40.259> you're<00:01:40.409> first

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
of individual steps while you're first

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
same direction so you're just going to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.139 
same direction so you're just going to
be<00:01:56.040> walking<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.579> circle<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
be walking this circle which is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.850 
be walking this circle which is
basically<00:01:57.689> an<00:01:57.840> extended<00:01:58.290> version<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
basically an extended version of the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590 
basically an extended version of the
spin<00:01:59.130> you're<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> ask<00:02:00.119> them<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.450> move

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
spin you're going to ask them to move

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
spin you're going to ask them to move
across<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:02.070> you're<00:02:02.189> gonna<00:02:02.310> ask<00:02:02.460> them

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
across and then you're gonna ask them

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.510 
across and then you're gonna ask them
walk<00:02:02.880> forward<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:05.369> can

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
walk forward and up out of that you can

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.240 
walk forward and up out of that you can
do<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.729> both<00:02:05.939> directions<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:08.099> most

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
do this both directions so the most

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.889 
do this both directions so the most
important<00:02:08.849> thing<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.599> get<00:02:09.750> your

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
important thing you can do to get your

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
important thing you can do to get your
horse<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.289> stop<00:02:10.319> stepping<00:02:11.099> behind<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
horse to stop stepping behind is to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.940 
horse to stop stepping behind is to
start<00:02:12.030> moving<00:02:12.360> them<00:02:12.450> forward

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
start moving them forward

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.490 
start moving them forward
moving<00:02:13.520> forward<00:02:13.760> out<00:02:13.970> into<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:14.300> circle<00:02:14.750> walk

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
moving forward out into this circle walk

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.040 
moving forward out into this circle walk
a<00:02:15.530> nice<00:02:15.830> circle<00:02:16.370> pick<00:02:17.300> up<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.660> ask<00:02:17.780> him<00:02:17.959> to

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
a nice circle pick up and ask him to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.780 
a nice circle pick up and ask him to
move<00:02:18.170> across<00:02:18.379> if<00:02:18.680> he<00:02:18.769> does<00:02:19.010> stop<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.580> step

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
move across if he does stop and step

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.270 
move across if he does stop and step
behind<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.660> ask<00:02:21.170> him<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.500> move<00:02:21.680> forward

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
behind like this ask him to move forward

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.660 
behind like this ask him to move forward
and<00:02:22.599> then<00:02:23.599> step<00:02:23.780> across<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.560> move<00:02:24.980> forward

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
and then step across and move forward

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.120 
and then step across and move forward
and<00:02:26.349> step<00:02:27.349> across<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.989> last<00:02:30.650> thing<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.010> I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
and step across so the last thing that I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.380 
and step across so the last thing that I
want<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.670> remember<00:02:31.910> when<00:02:32.180> you're<00:02:32.360> doing

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
want you to remember when you're doing

want you to remember when you're doing
this<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:33.110> stick<00:02:33.769> to<00:02:33.920> one<00:02:34.099> direction<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.910> a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
this is stick to one direction for a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.790 
this is stick to one direction for a
while<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.660> know<00:02:35.690> work<00:02:36.050> on<00:02:36.200> your<00:02:36.380> right<00:02:36.560> turn

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
while you know work on your right turn

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.210 
while you know work on your right turn
around

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
around

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.680 
around
ask<00:02:37.370> him<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.760> move<00:02:37.880> forward<00:02:38.300> move<00:02:38.510> his

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
ask him to move forward move his

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.990 
ask him to move forward move his
shoulders<00:02:39.049> over<00:02:39.230> walk<00:02:39.620> forward<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.310> work<00:02:40.849> on

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
shoulders over walk forward and work on

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.250 
shoulders over walk forward and work on
that<00:02:41.150> direction<00:02:41.510> until<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.959> feel<00:02:42.110> like

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
that direction until you feel like

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.960 
that direction until you feel like
you've<00:02:42.410> accomplished<00:02:42.980> something<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.580> then

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
you've accomplished something and then

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.220 
you've accomplished something and then
switch<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.330> go<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.569> other<00:02:44.660> direction<00:02:44.780> don't

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
switch and go the other direction don't

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.930 
switch and go the other direction don't
be<00:02:45.440> constantly<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.099> right<00:02:46.370> turn<00:02:46.580> around<00:02:46.700> to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
be constantly going right turn around to

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.559 
be constantly going right turn around to
the<00:02:46.970> left<00:02:47.090> turn<00:02:47.299> around<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:52.459> think<00:02:53.420> that

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
the left turn around and I think that

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.650 
the left turn around and I think that
the<00:02:53.660> most<00:02:53.810> important<00:02:54.470> thing<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.860> remember<00:02:54.950> is

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the most important thing to remember is

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.520 
the most important thing to remember is
quitting<00:02:56.660> where<00:02:56.900> your<00:02:57.019> horse<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.380> making

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
quitting where your horse is making

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.500 
quitting where your horse is making
progress<00:02:57.890> if<00:02:58.310> your<00:02:58.730> horse<00:02:58.880> has<00:02:59.060> been<00:02:59.239> stepping

behind a whole bunch and you finally get

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.250 
behind a whole bunch and you finally get
him<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.970> kind<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.269> go<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.569> cross<00:03:02.780> forward<00:03:03.110> in

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
him to kind of go and cross forward in
