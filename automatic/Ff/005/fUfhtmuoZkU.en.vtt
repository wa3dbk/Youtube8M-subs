competitive games a competitive schedule
being<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.370> part<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.670> scta<00:02:24.090> would<00:02:24.300> give<00:02:24.450> us

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
being a part of the scta would give us

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.270 
being a part of the scta would give us
that<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.110> also<00:02:25.290> helped<00:02:25.680> us<00:02:25.860> bring<00:02:26.010> down

that and it also helped us bring down

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.510 
that and it also helped us bring down
the<00:02:26.430> costs<00:02:26.930> for<00:02:27.930> families<00:02:28.070> in<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.190> western

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
New York here and I think we all would

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.960 
New York here and I think we all would
agree<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.310> know<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.820> make

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
agree that you know if we can make

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.730 
agree that you know if we can make

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
possible for all our families and that's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.840 
possible for all our families and that's
really<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:37.980> should<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.400> pursuit<00:02:38.730> of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
really what we should be in pursuit of

really what we should be in pursuit of
an<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:40.230> that's<00:02:40.440> part<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.740> reason<00:02:40.800> we

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
an that that's part of the reason we

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.430 
an that that's part of the reason we
want<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.580> as<00:02:41.760> well<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.150> Hawk<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.260> just

omha where we're a home town mentality I

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.800 
omha where we're a home town mentality I
guess<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.550> next<00:03:08.640> question<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:09.120> why<00:03:09.270> would<00:03:09.720> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
guess the next question is why would it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.750 
guess the next question is why would it
be<00:03:09.900> good<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.770> scta<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.459> adding<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
be good for the scta and adding the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.100 
be good for the scta and adding the
buffalo<00:03:12.060> regals<00:03:12.240> well<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.600> think<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.959> because

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
buffalo regals well I think it's because

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.020 
buffalo regals well I think it's because
you're<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> be<00:03:14.190> adding<00:03:14.310> some<00:03:14.459> diversity

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
you're going to be adding some diversity

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.730 
you're going to be adding some diversity
and<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.240> think<00:03:15.390> any<00:03:15.510> time<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.170> have<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> little

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
and I think any time you have a little

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.930 
and I think any time you have a little
bit<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:16.860> diversity<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.489> your<00:03:17.580> league<00:03:17.730> it's

you know a high level of competition and
you<00:03:38.280> know<00:03:38.370> that's<00:03:38.550> that's<00:03:38.820> ultimately<00:03:39.120> what

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
you know that's that's ultimately what

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.790 
you know that's that's ultimately what
we're<00:03:39.600> trying<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.840> push<00:03:39.989> these<00:03:40.140> kids<00:03:40.440> tues<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
we're trying to push these kids tues to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.310 
we're trying to push these kids tues to
compete<00:03:41.100> at<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> very<00:03:41.310> high<00:03:41.489> level<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.320> and

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
compete at a very high level and and

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.430 
compete at a very high level and and
push<00:03:43.530> them<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:43.920> regard<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.050> we<00:03:46.050> would<00:03:46.230> I

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
push them in that regard so we would I

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.410 
push them in that regard so we would I
just<00:03:46.920> think<00:03:47.070> we'd<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.400> very<00:03:47.790> very<00:03:48.150> good

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
just think we'd be a very very good

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.150 
just think we'd be a very very good
advocate<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.230> scta<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.800> think<00:03:50.100> we<00:03:50.730> would

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
advocate for the scta I think we would

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.400 
advocate for the scta I think we would
represent<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.430> scta<00:03:53.910> very<00:03:54.480> well<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.930> think<00:03:55.080> we

represent the scta very well I think we

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.949
