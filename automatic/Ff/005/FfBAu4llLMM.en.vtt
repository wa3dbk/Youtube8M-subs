 video series reviews the xbox wool and 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.460
 in this review 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
 I want to show you well 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.090
 brde difference games 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.190
 a command that we go to the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 videogame record this game because they are 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.220
 things an ash cake when you give 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.359
 the command to record this game in command 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.070
 by voice 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.970
 It will pick up the last 30 seconds. 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.750
 back from the command still 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 Because this is for you, it was there. 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 a radical maneuver made the maneuver the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 killed someone sensational 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.149
 only you did not know you were going 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.850
 to be seen trying and never 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.410
 Can you go there and succeed? 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.090
 Only then did not you have 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.710
 sent tie Dr. 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.140
 you give him command to do the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.969
 recording this week by ba 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.260
 as shown in the previous video I will not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.100
 say you will not activate the last 30 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.570
 seconds 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.120
 from the moment you sent 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.699
 record or you can come here in the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.580
 pilot studio and do editing and pick up 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.320
 under that stretch of you I go 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.420
 do some things I'll give this one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.360
 voice command in the same game to pick up 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.180
 then when you can kill someone and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.409
 then I'll do a gameplay using the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.159
 games dvr 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.869
 I'm going to have to start recording. 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.570
 remembering for example if you were in a 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.030
 very complicated phase and this phase 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.590
 for you to spend a minute or two you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.200
 discover a sensational way of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.259
 pass phase when there takes half an hour 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 to spend you finalized in 23 minutes 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.439
 so what are you going to do? 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.540
 You know it took two minutes, you do not have 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.020
 problem you come here for the home screen 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.320
 of this game behind rhodan calls the dvr 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.850
 games you could give the voice command 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.939
 prefix here on my list but let's 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.829
 do this time by this method 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.469
 so now you were going to have the game playing 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:06.290
 here is this option here in dvr it 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:11.009
 finish the clip should end by now 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.550
 the option will hold 30 seconds 45 minutes 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.950
 three minutes 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.680
 minutes, because how does it work? 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 re five minutes system connected 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.830
 starts recording five minutes again 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.780
 Makes 15 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.150
 So you 're always playing it, are you? 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.830
 storing this in memory the difference 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.780
 with emotion the voice command 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.400
 he only uses gasoline second only 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.370
 you see in the middle of the game 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.070
 in dvr games and get back up to five 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.710
 minutes but then the question 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.600
 I do not want to just go back the last five 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.670
 minutes I wanted to record for example 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.620
 pauzeiro game and I know I go 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.780
 I can show the staff myself 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.810
 finishing a foul that does not take 30 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.170
 making three minutes minutes and 10% 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.660
 Time is no problem, you paulo the game. 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.190
 started doing that I started the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.490
 from there separate a new clip 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.830
 You go to the computer here for five 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.680
 minutes left to finish 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.540
 pr of the neighborhood in the part of the year 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.860
 you catch will appear in the neighborhood 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.010
 to another screen 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.830
 Okay, so you 're going to have this boy. 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.190
 so now what I'm going to do 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.570
 start the match 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.370
 I will try to do something 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.680
 extraordinary because I'm in the video 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.959
 previous silicone for damn right 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.330
 and I'll try to make an epic moment there 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.340
 kill someone as I like and I think 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.100
 now sees no advantage in his 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.720
 best cabin who but I'm not going yet 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.390
 kill the boat and I'll drive the video, come on 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.950
 show you a video right now 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.610
 you will be able to see the difference well 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.260
 when I command it to record 30 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.260
 seconds back 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.989
 if I call and see and I got back 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:00.660
 up to 5 minutes or from the command to start 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:04.480
 and up to five years to come forward 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.190
 playing the default mode first 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.190
 kill I'll give him the command 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:19.410
 if I can score with it then goes 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:32.280
 be top you come running around here, huh? 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:33.240
 is the standard at this time is to stay is the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:50.820
 same 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:57.570
 at the time it was my face but it does not have 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:59.990
 future problem to world football to you 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.440
 You can have fun with my courses too. 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:07.520
 important is the general entertainment 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.520
 come on 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:24.330
 i xbox save this game 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:26.130
 So now it's good, and the point is yours. 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.970
 You'll see that I might even have taken my 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.770
 death it's 30 seconds behind 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.690
 I can continue to play what is 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:38.160

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:51.020

 It's so much that I'm going to do I could give 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:36.500
 voice command but I 'll do it with the 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.500
