we're trying to be a bit greener the
fuel<00:00:40.829> consumption<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.550> 25<00:00:42.059> percent<00:00:42.210> better<00:00:42.540> in

heater warms everything up the ice is

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
heater warms everything up the ice is
there<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.799> should<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.100> better<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.520> running

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610

there so we should be better at running
in<00:01:38.880> winter<00:01:39.560> obviously<00:01:40.560> people<00:01:40.710> may<00:01:41.009> be
