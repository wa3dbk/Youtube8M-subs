welcome<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.730> day<00:00:05.879> two<00:00:05.940> at<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.020> point<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.500> have

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
welcome to day two at this point we have

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.220 
welcome to day two at this point we have
isolated<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.309> DNA<00:00:08.670> broken<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.630> into<00:00:09.900> random

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
isolated the DNA broken it into random

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.860 
isolated the DNA broken it into random
3kb<00:00:10.650> pieces<00:00:11.190> inserted<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> pieces<00:00:12.570> into<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
3kb pieces inserted the pieces into the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.990 
3kb pieces inserted the pieces into the
vector<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.500> force<00:00:14.130> those<00:00:14.309> plasmids<00:00:14.849> into

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
vector and force those plasmids into

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.260 
vector and force those plasmids into
e.coli<00:00:15.599> bacteria<00:00:16.310> the<00:00:17.310> bacterial<00:00:17.850> colonies

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
e.coli bacteria the bacterial colonies

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.000 
e.coli bacteria the bacterial colonies
have<00:00:18.420> had<00:00:18.539> about<00:00:18.750> 20<00:00:19.140> hours<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.560> grow<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
have had about 20 hours to grow on the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
have had about 20 hours to grow on the
medium<00:00:20.340> containing<00:00:20.880> ampicillin<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.720> x-gal

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
medium containing ampicillin and x-gal

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.189 
medium containing ampicillin and x-gal
the<00:00:23.130> e.coli<00:00:23.490> bacteria<00:00:23.640> divide<00:00:24.539> about<00:00:24.900> every

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the e.coli bacteria divide about every

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.160 
the e.coli bacteria divide about every
20<00:00:25.500> minutes<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.820> 20<00:00:27.119> hours<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.960> about

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
20 minutes so in 20 hours we have about

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980 
20 minutes so in 20 hours we have about
a<00:00:28.230> million<00:00:28.500> bacteria<00:00:28.769> per<00:00:29.279> colony<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
a million bacteria per colony on this

a million bacteria per colony on this
plate<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.560> three<00:00:31.800> different<00:00:31.920> kinds<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
plate we have three different kinds of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.549 
plate we have three different kinds of
bacteria<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.480> first<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> bacteria<00:00:34.500> that

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

plasmid has a functioning Lac z gene

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690 
plasmid has a functioning Lac z gene
which<00:01:07.380> means<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.220> contain<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
white bacterial colonies arose from a

white bacterial colonies arose from a

times<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.810> actually<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> right

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.910 
times and we can actually see it right
here<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:54.270> next<00:01:54.420> step<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> transfer<00:01:55.530> these

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
here the next step is to transfer these
