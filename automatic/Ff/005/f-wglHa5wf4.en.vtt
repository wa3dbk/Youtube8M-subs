00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
hi my name is aimy Sangster I'm the soil

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.850 
hi my name is aimy Sangster I'm the soil
specialist<00:00:17.510> for<00:00:17.689> perinea<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.320> today<00:00:18.680> we're

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
specialist for perinea and today we're

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.590 
specialist for perinea and today we're
gonna<00:00:18.920> demonstrate<00:00:19.220> how<00:00:19.730> to<00:00:19.760> take<00:00:20.000> a<00:00:20.210> proper

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
gonna demonstrate how to take a proper

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.350 
gonna demonstrate how to take a proper
soil<00:00:20.900> sample<00:00:21.340> one<00:00:22.340> of<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:22.550> most<00:00:22.910> important

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
soil sample one of the most important

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.760 
soil sample one of the most important
steps<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:23.750> one<00:00:23.840> of<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:23.990> first<00:00:24.200> steps<00:00:24.470> in<00:00:24.650> any

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
steps and one of the first steps in any

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.370 
steps and one of the first steps in any
cropping<00:00:25.220> system<00:00:25.610> really<00:00:26.420> is<00:00:26.690> to<00:00:26.930> try<00:00:27.200> and

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
cropping system really is to try and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.930 
cropping system really is to try and
assess<00:00:27.619> what<00:00:27.860> level<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.160> nutrients<00:00:28.760> are<00:00:28.910> in

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
assess what level of nutrients are in

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.000 
assess what level of nutrients are in
your<00:00:29.180> soil<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:29.750> you'll<00:00:29.869> do<00:00:30.020> this<00:00:30.170> by<00:00:30.230> taking<00:00:30.770> a

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
your soil and you'll do this by taking a

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.680 
your soil and you'll do this by taking a
soil<00:00:31.220> sample<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:31.760> then<00:00:31.910> sending<00:00:32.270> it<00:00:32.360> off<00:00:32.480> to<00:00:32.510> a

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
soil sample and then sending it off to a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.450 
soil sample and then sending it off to a
laboratory<00:00:32.960> which<00:00:33.860> will<00:00:34.010> perform<00:00:34.280> an

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
laboratory which will perform an

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.740 
laboratory which will perform an
analysis<00:00:34.970> on<00:00:35.120> it<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:35.420> you'll<00:00:35.540> get<00:00:35.629> the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
analysis on it and you'll get the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.770 
analysis on it and you'll get the
results<00:00:35.840> back<00:00:36.430> however<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:38.239> results<00:00:38.629> that

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
results back however the results that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.660 
results back however the results that
you<00:00:38.870> get<00:00:38.989> back<00:00:39.230> are<00:00:39.470> only<00:00:39.890> as<00:00:40.070> good<00:00:40.280> as<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
you get back are only as good as the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.189 
you get back are only as good as the
sample<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:41.150> send<00:00:41.390> in<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:41.870> it's<00:00:42.019> really

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
sample you send in so it's really

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.930 
sample you send in so it's really
important<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.769> make<00:00:42.920> sure<00:00:42.949> that<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.610> start

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
important to make sure that you start

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.460 
important to make sure that you start
off<00:00:44.059> on<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.360> right<00:00:44.479> foot<00:00:45.670> for<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.760> most<00:00:46.970> part

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
off on the right foot for the most part

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.229 
off on the right foot for the most part
the<00:00:48.470> monster<00:00:48.800> farmers<00:00:49.309> are<00:00:49.489> interested<00:00:49.640> in

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
the monster farmers are interested in

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.560 
the monster farmers are interested in
getting<00:00:50.870> an<00:00:51.620> idea<00:00:52.309> of<00:00:52.640> what<00:00:53.089> the<00:00:53.180> nutrient

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
getting an idea of what the nutrient

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.450 
getting an idea of what the nutrient
concentration<00:00:54.170> is<00:00:54.290> on<00:00:54.500> average<00:00:55.010> over<00:00:55.250> their

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
concentration is on average over their

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.860 
concentration is on average over their
field<00:00:55.699> because<00:00:56.089> they<00:00:56.269> want<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.510> come<00:00:56.629> up<00:00:56.690> with

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
field because they want to come up with

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.100 
field because they want to come up with
a<00:00:56.900> nutrient<00:00:57.290> recommendation<00:00:58.180> so<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.750> field

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
a nutrient recommendation so this field

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.740 
a nutrient recommendation so this field
actually<00:01:00.379> it's<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.739> pretty<00:01:00.890> uniform<00:01:01.430> field<00:01:01.750> and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
actually it's a pretty uniform field and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.210 
actually it's a pretty uniform field and
what<00:01:03.080> we're<00:01:03.229> going<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.379> do<00:01:03.559> in<00:01:03.710> this<00:01:03.830> field<00:01:04.010> is

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
what we're going to do in this field is

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.710 
what we're going to do in this field is
take<00:01:04.430> something<00:01:04.760> called<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:05.000> composite<00:01:05.030> sample

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
take something called a composite sample

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.410 
take something called a composite sample
so<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:06.740> start<00:01:07.010> with<00:01:07.070> your<00:01:07.190> first<00:01:07.520> sample<00:01:08.030> I'll

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
so you start with your first sample I'll

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.120 
so you start with your first sample I'll
take<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:08.780> one<00:01:08.960> from<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.229> shovel<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.890> you

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
take this one from the shovel and you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.600 
take this one from the shovel and you
just<00:01:10.390> put<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.510> in<00:01:11.570> your<00:01:11.720> bucket<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.860> what

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
just put it in your bucket and what

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.340 
just put it in your bucket and what
we're<00:01:13.730> gonna<00:01:13.820> do<00:01:14.120> is<00:01:14.510> we're<00:01:15.170> gonna<00:01:15.230> walk

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
we're gonna do is we're gonna walk

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.100 
we're gonna do is we're gonna walk
across<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.040> field<00:01:16.220> in<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.790> random<00:01:17.210> pattern<00:01:17.450> I'd

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
across the field in a random pattern I'd

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.840 
across the field in a random pattern I'd
like<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.410> do<00:01:18.530> a<00:01:18.560> bit<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.890> zigzag<00:01:19.280> pattern<00:01:19.520> so

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
like to do a bit of a zigzag pattern so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.370 
like to do a bit of a zigzag pattern so
I<00:01:19.910> can<00:01:20.060> keep<00:01:20.180> track<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.450> where<00:01:20.750> I've<00:01:20.930> been<00:01:21.140> and

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
I can keep track of where I've been and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.650 
I can keep track of where I've been and
we're<00:01:21.980> gonna<00:01:22.070> sample<00:01:22.610> probably<00:01:23.390> take<00:01:23.540> about

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
we're gonna sample probably take about

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.890 
we're gonna sample probably take about
20<00:01:24.500> of<00:01:24.680> these<00:01:24.950> samples<00:01:25.550> before<00:01:26.300> we<00:01:26.570> come<00:01:26.750> back

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
20 of these samples before we come back

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800 
20 of these samples before we come back
and<00:01:27.470> take<00:01:28.040> our<00:01:28.250> sub<00:01:28.760> sample<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:29.300> send<00:01:29.510> off<00:01:29.660> to

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
and take our sub sample to send off to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.900 
and take our sub sample to send off to
the<00:01:29.900> lab<00:01:30.190> you<00:01:31.190> know<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.310> lot<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.550> people<00:01:31.820> have

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
the lab you know a lot of people have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.210 
the lab you know a lot of people have
asked<00:01:32.240> me<00:01:32.270> how<00:01:32.360> many<00:01:32.750> samples<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.500> take<00:01:33.740> per

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
asked me how many samples to take per

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.960 
asked me how many samples to take per
field<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:35.600> lot<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.710> time<00:01:36.890> you'll<00:01:37.070> see<00:01:37.280> the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
field a lot of the time you'll see the

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.720 
field a lot of the time you'll see the
recommendation<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:38.720> usually<00:01:39.020> between<00:01:39.140> 15<00:01:39.680> and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
recommendation is usually between 15 and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.480 
recommendation is usually between 15 and
20<00:01:41.110> samples<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.440> take<00:01:42.590> your<00:01:42.740> sub<00:01:42.920> sample<00:01:43.130> from

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
20 samples to take your sub sample from

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.460 
20 samples to take your sub sample from
to<00:01:43.700> make<00:01:43.790> your<00:01:43.970> composite<00:01:44.420> sample<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.290> just

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
to make your composite sample but just

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.260 
to make your composite sample but just
keep<00:01:45.650> in<00:01:45.800> mind<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.460> more<00:01:46.670> samples<00:01:47.120> you<00:01:47.240> take

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
keep in mind the more samples you take

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.290 
keep in mind the more samples you take
the<00:01:47.780> better<00:01:47.960> your<00:01:48.200> average<00:01:48.970> fields<00:01:49.970> with<00:01:50.120> some

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
the better your average fields with some

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.180 
the better your average fields with some
topography<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:51.050> them<00:01:51.230> you'll<00:01:51.710> find<00:01:52.010> that

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
topography to them you'll find that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.680 
topography to them you'll find that
there's<00:01:52.460> variability<00:01:52.880> quite<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.450> bit<00:01:53.600> of

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
there's variability quite a bit of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.240 
there's variability quite a bit of
variability<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.470> soil<00:01:54.740> they're<00:01:55.010> from

biggest thing with soil sampling is to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.470 
biggest thing with soil sampling is to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
value should get per grid but you can

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.520 
value should get per grid but you can

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
lot more samples it can get a little

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.570 
lot more samples it can get a little
more<00:03:05.150> pricey<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.320> then<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.250> know<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.520> just

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
more pricey and then you know it's just

if<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.590> really<00:03:45.920> wanted<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.340> know<00:03:46.460> what<00:03:46.820> soil

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
if you really wanted to know what soil

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.540 
if you really wanted to know what soil
available<00:03:48.020> plant<00:03:48.440> available<00:03:48.860> nutrients<00:03:49.310> are

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
available plant available nutrients are

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.210 
available plant available nutrients are
in<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.060> soil<00:03:50.380> you'd<00:03:51.380> want<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.620> sample<00:03:51.800> the<00:03:52.070> day

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
in the soil you'd want to sample the day

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.830 
in the soil you'd want to sample the day
your<00:03:52.400> crop<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.790> growing<00:03:53.120> technically<00:03:53.660> and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
your crop is growing technically and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.240 
your crop is growing technically and
then<00:03:53.960> you<00:03:54.080> know<00:03:54.230> what<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.500> crop<00:03:54.710> is<00:03:54.860> actually

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
then you know what the crop is actually

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.800 
then you know what the crop is actually
going<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.820> potentially<00:03:56.000> be<00:03:56.270> able<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.630> access

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
going to potentially be able to access

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.560 
going to potentially be able to access
and<00:03:57.320> so<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.010> can<00:03:58.280> sample<00:03:58.640> in<00:03:58.910> the<00:03:59.000> spring<00:03:59.300> you

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
and so you can sample in the spring you

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.230 
and so you can sample in the spring you
can<00:03:59.690> sample<00:03:59.960> before<00:04:00.230> you<00:04:00.560> plant<00:04:00.950> as<00:04:01.160> well<00:04:01.240> but

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
can sample before you plant as well but

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.570 
can sample before you plant as well but
the<00:04:02.360> fall<00:04:02.540> becomes<00:04:03.020> more<00:04:03.650> popular<00:04:04.190> when

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
the fall becomes more popular when

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.610 
the fall becomes more popular when
people<00:04:04.910> are<00:04:05.000> trying<00:04:05.240> to<00:04:05.330> come<00:04:06.140> up<00:04:06.260> with<00:04:06.410> their

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
people are trying to come up with their

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.900 
people are trying to come up with their
plans<00:04:06.860> of<00:04:07.100> what<00:04:07.220> they're<00:04:07.340> going<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.490> do<00:04:07.700> for

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
plans of what they're going to do for

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.760 
plans of what they're going to do for
that<00:04:08.450> following<00:04:08.960> spring<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.470> they<00:04:09.530> want<00:04:09.710> to

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
that following spring and they want to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.170 
that following spring and they want to
order<00:04:09.920> their<00:04:10.100> fertilizer<00:04:10.490> or<00:04:10.640> their<00:04:10.790> lime<00:04:10.970> or

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
order their fertilizer or their lime or

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.990 
order their fertilizer or their lime or
whatever<00:04:11.450> whatever<00:04:12.110> other<00:04:12.290> soil<00:04:12.590> amendment

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
whatever whatever other soil amendment

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.190 
whatever whatever other soil amendment
I'm<00:04:13.480> putting<00:04:13.720> on<00:04:15.720> when<00:04:16.720> you're<00:04:16.870> finished

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
I'm putting on when you're finished

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.289 
I'm putting on when you're finished
sampling<00:04:17.680> your<00:04:17.799> field<00:04:18.040> but<00:04:18.190> you'll<00:04:18.430> get<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:18.880> in

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
sampling your field but you'll get is in

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.000 
sampling your field but you'll get is in
this<00:04:19.690> field<00:04:19.989> actually<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.530> cores<00:04:20.709> have<00:04:20.859> all

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
this field actually the cores have all

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.650 
this field actually the cores have all
remained<00:04:21.310> intact<00:04:21.640> it's<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.030> heavier<00:04:22.360> soil

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
remained intact it's a heavier soil

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.820 
remained intact it's a heavier soil
there's<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.990> bit<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.170> moisture<00:04:23.560> in<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.740> ground

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
there's a bit of moisture in the ground

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.790 
there's a bit of moisture in the ground
so<00:04:24.760> before<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.750> send<00:04:25.930> your<00:04:26.080> sub<00:04:26.290> sample<00:04:26.560> in

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
so before you send your sub sample in

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.020 
so before you send your sub sample in
what<00:04:26.980> you<00:04:27.040> want<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.340> do<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.610> want<00:04:27.730> to<00:04:27.790> break

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
what you want to do is you want to break

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.940 
what you want to do is you want to break
up<00:04:28.240> those<00:04:28.420> course<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:29.200> really<00:04:29.380> make<00:04:29.680> sure<00:04:29.860> you

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
up those course and really make sure you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.760 
up those course and really make sure you
get<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.130> good<00:04:30.660> homogeneous<00:04:31.660> sample<00:04:32.170> again

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
get a good homogeneous sample again

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.470 
get a good homogeneous sample again
we're<00:04:33.190> looking<00:04:33.460> for<00:04:33.640> an<00:04:33.700> average<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.360> average

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
we're looking for an average the average

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.840 
we're looking for an average the average
fertility<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:35.230> this<00:04:35.410> field<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.670> better

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
fertility in this field so the better

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.930 
fertility in this field so the better
you<00:04:37.240> mix<00:04:37.540> up<00:04:37.720> this<00:04:38.590> sample<00:04:39.130> this<00:04:39.490> larger

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
you mix up this sample this larger

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.110 
you mix up this sample this larger
sample<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:41.290> better<00:04:41.470> your<00:04:41.650> results<00:04:41.740> will<00:04:42.190> be

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.120 

so<00:04:46.120> once<00:04:46.419> you've<00:04:46.690> sufficiently<00:04:47.080> mixed<00:04:47.980> up

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
so once you've sufficiently mixed up

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.760 
so once you've sufficiently mixed up
your<00:04:48.280> cores<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.820> broken<00:04:49.120> them<00:04:49.210> apart<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
your cores and broken them apart the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.340 
your cores and broken them apart the
Department<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.370> Agriculture<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.390> the<00:04:53.080> lab

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
Department of Agriculture and the lab

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.300 
Department of Agriculture and the lab
here<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:54.030> Turo<00:04:55.530> has<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.560> number<00:04:56.890> of<00:04:56.950> these<00:04:57.070> soil

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
here in Turo has a number of these soil

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.340 
here in Turo has a number of these soil
sample<00:04:57.700> boxes<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.270> are<00:04:58.419> available<00:04:58.600> at<00:04:59.290> your

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
sample boxes that are available at your

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.700 
sample boxes that are available at your
local<00:05:00.120> agricultural<00:05:01.120> office<00:05:01.570> if<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.620> don't

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
local agricultural office if you don't

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.980 
local agricultural office if you don't
have<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:02.980> box<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.520> bag<00:05:03.700> will<00:05:04.000> will<00:05:04.419> do<00:05:04.690> just<00:05:04.930> fine

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
have a box a bag will will do just fine

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.500 
have a box a bag will will do just fine
as<00:05:05.380> well<00:05:05.530> but<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:06.669> lab<00:05:06.820> will<00:05:07.000> actually<00:05:07.360> air

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
as well but the lab will actually air

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.270 
as well but the lab will actually air
dry<00:05:07.750> these<00:05:07.930> samples<00:05:08.410> once<00:05:08.590> they<00:05:08.740> receive<00:05:09.070> them

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
dry these samples once they receive them

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.740 
dry these samples once they receive them
so<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.490> makes<00:05:09.640> their<00:05:09.820> job<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:10.060> little<00:05:10.240> easier

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
so it makes their job a little easier

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.830 
so it makes their job a little easier
and<00:05:11.050> also<00:05:11.680> they've<00:05:12.610> added<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.270> spot<00:05:13.540> here<00:05:13.750> on

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
and also they've added a spot here on

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.960 
and also they've added a spot here on
the<00:05:13.930> box<00:05:14.110> where<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.470> can<00:05:14.620> label<00:05:15.340> what<00:05:15.730> field

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
the box where you can label what field

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.110 
the box where you can label what field
you<00:05:16.210> sampled<00:05:16.720> in<00:05:16.919> when<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.070> sent<00:05:18.340> labeled<00:05:18.910> or

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
you sampled in when you sent labeled or

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.420 
you sampled in when you sent labeled or
when<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:19.360> when<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.169> sample<00:05:20.380> this<00:05:20.710> you<00:05:21.280> can

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
when you when you sample this you can

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.969 
when you when you sample this you can
also<00:05:21.840> add<00:05:22.840> in<00:05:23.050> your<00:05:23.169> address<00:05:23.350> in<00:05:23.740> your<00:05:23.860> own

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
also add in your address in your own

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.440 
also add in your address in your own
name<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:24.250> it'll<00:05:24.610> keep<00:05:24.729> your<00:05:24.880> samples<00:05:25.240> straight

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
name so it'll keep your samples straight

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.640 
name so it'll keep your samples straight
especially<00:05:25.900> if<00:05:25.960> you've<00:05:26.050> got<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.260> number<00:05:26.590> of

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
especially if you've got a number of

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.060 
especially if you've got a number of
fields<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.040> sample<00:05:27.930> what<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:28.960> would<00:05:29.229> also<00:05:29.380> do<00:05:29.740> is

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
fields to sample what I would also do is

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.430 
fields to sample what I would also do is
make<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.700> little<00:05:30.910> note<00:05:31.150> for<00:05:31.390> yourself<00:05:31.810> what

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
make a little note for yourself what

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.930 
make a little note for yourself what
this<00:05:32.590> field<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:32.979> going<00:05:33.130> to<00:05:33.190> be<00:05:33.280> in<00:05:33.400> next<00:05:33.580> year

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
this field is going to be in next year

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.969 
this field is going to be in next year
and<00:05:34.150> when<00:05:34.780> you<00:05:34.870> drop<00:05:35.110> this<00:05:35.290> off<00:05:35.500> to<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:35.800> lab

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
and when you drop this off to the lab

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.520 
and when you drop this off to the lab
they'll<00:05:36.669> give<00:05:36.910> you<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.050> sample<00:05:38.050> submission

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
they'll give you a sample submission

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.560 
they'll give you a sample submission
form<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.010> the<00:05:39.610> more<00:05:39.820> information<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.360> give

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
form and the more information you give

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.360 
form and the more information you give
them<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.290> more<00:05:41.440> information<00:05:41.919> you<00:05:42.010> get<00:05:42.130> back

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
them the more information you get back

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.820 
them the more information you get back
so<00:05:42.940> make<00:05:43.180> sure<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:43.510> include<00:05:43.840> what<00:05:44.350> crop<00:05:44.650> you're

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
so make sure to include what crop you're

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.750 
so make sure to include what crop you're
going<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.010> be<00:05:45.070> growing<00:05:45.250> next

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
going to be growing next

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.640 
going to be growing next
here<00:05:45.940> this<00:05:46.600> is<00:05:46.750> important<00:05:47.200> because<00:05:47.350> if<00:05:47.560> you

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
here this is important because if you

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.400 
here this is important because if you
don't<00:05:47.920> you<00:05:48.400> won't<00:05:48.580> get<00:05:48.820> your<00:05:48.910> fertility

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
don't you won't get your fertility

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.270 
don't you won't get your fertility
recommendations<00:05:50.410> or<00:05:50.680> your<00:05:51.010> fertility

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
recommendations or your fertility

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.060 
recommendations or your fertility
ratings<00:05:51.940> for<00:05:52.930> that<00:05:53.170> particular<00:05:53.440> crop<00:05:53.890> that

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
ratings for that particular crop that

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.620 
ratings for that particular crop that
you<00:05:54.190> want<00:05:54.340> to<00:05:54.430> grow<00:05:54.610> so<00:05:55.000> for<00:05:55.510> your

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
you want to grow so for your

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.240 
you want to grow so for your
macronutrients<00:05:55.960> they'll<00:05:56.770> give<00:05:57.010> you<00:05:57.130> the

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
macronutrients they'll give you the

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.650 
macronutrients they'll give you the
levels<00:05:57.580> back<00:05:57.790> but<00:05:58.030> it's<00:05:58.150> hard<00:05:58.330> to<00:05:58.360> put<00:05:58.540> those

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
levels back but it's hard to put those

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.870 
levels back but it's hard to put those
in<00:05:58.810> context<00:05:59.410> unless<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.920> have<00:06:00.100> been<00:06:00.280> rated

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
in context unless you have been rated

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.050 
in context unless you have been rated
so<00:06:01.570> with<00:06:01.990> these<00:06:02.170> boxes<00:06:02.440> I<00:06:02.950> just<00:06:03.850> take<00:06:04.030> a

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
so with these boxes I just take a

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.800 
so with these boxes I just take a
subsample<00:06:05.310> and<00:06:06.310> I<00:06:06.430> try<00:06:06.640> to<00:06:06.700> remove<00:06:07.030> any<00:06:07.240> biases

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
subsample and I try to remove any biases

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.630 
subsample and I try to remove any biases
so<00:06:07.960> I<00:06:07.990> don't<00:06:08.200> even<00:06:08.290> look<00:06:08.530> at<00:06:08.680> what<00:06:08.800> I'm<00:06:08.920> putting

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
so I don't even look at what I'm putting

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.040 
so I don't even look at what I'm putting
in<00:06:09.760> the<00:06:09.850> box<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:11.050> it's<00:06:11.920> about<00:06:12.100> two<00:06:12.370> cups<00:06:13.050> you

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
in the box and it's about two cups you

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.260 
in the box and it's about two cups you
can<00:06:14.080> fill<00:06:14.350> it<00:06:14.470> right<00:06:14.620> up<00:06:14.680> to<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:15.010> top

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:33.559 

and<00:06:17.960> there's<00:06:18.139> your<00:06:18.229> sample

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.629
