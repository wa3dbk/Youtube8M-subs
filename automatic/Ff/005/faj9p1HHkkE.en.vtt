I'm going full since I've felt bikes

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.730 
I'm going full since I've felt bikes

of which in the pro category and now
you'll<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.320> learning<00:00:16.619> how<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.710> write<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> BMX

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
you'll be learning how to write the BMX

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.830 
you'll be learning how to write the BMX
with<00:00:18.029> me<00:00:19.970> in<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.150> video<00:00:21.390> you're<00:00:21.630> building

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
with me in this video you're building

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.570 
with me in this video you're building
your<00:00:22.140> bat<00:00:22.289> flip<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> BMX<00:00:22.949> bike<00:00:26.300> ok<00:00:27.300> step<00:00:27.599> 1

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
your bat flip on a BMX bike ok step 1

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.529 
your bat flip on a BMX bike ok step 1
obviously<00:00:29.580> doing<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> bat<00:00:30.060> flip<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.449> are

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
obviously doing the bat flip you are

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.880 
obviously doing the bat flip you are
going<00:00:30.689> upside<00:00:30.929> down<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.439> need<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> make

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
going upside down so you need to make

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
going upside down so you need to make
sure<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.130> initial<00:00:32.669> rotation<00:00:33.420> goes<00:00:33.960> round<00:00:38.660> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
sure that initial rotation goes round to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.190 
sure that initial rotation goes round to
do<00:00:39.780> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
do that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.229 
do that
I'll<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.680> if<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.160> imagine<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
I'll see you if you imagine that so that

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.459 
I'll see you if you imagine that so that
the<00:00:42.390> transition<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> ramp

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the transition of the ramp

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.130 
the transition of the ramp
need<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.270> especially<00:00:45.270> onto<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> fly<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:45.989> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
need to especially onto a fly or this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
need to especially onto a fly or this
you<00:00:46.260> can<00:00:46.379> follow<00:00:46.620> sort<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> momentum<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you can follow sort of the momentum and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.330 
you can follow sort of the momentum and
the<00:00:48.239> transition<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> ramp<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the transition of the ramp just to the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
the transition of the ramp just to the
deck<00:00:50.550> only<00:00:51.180> from<00:00:51.390> trouble<00:00:51.660> too<00:00:51.780> far<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.800> as<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
deck only from trouble too far so as you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.830 
deck only from trouble too far so as you
go<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.850> feel<00:00:54.149> your<00:00:54.270> front<00:00:54.480> wheel<00:00:54.600> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
go up you feel your front wheel just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.660 
go up you feel your front wheel just
bounce<00:00:55.260> off<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> top<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> ramp<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bounce off the top of the ramp and to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.490 
bounce off the top of the ramp and to
throw<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.090> head<00:00:57.210> back<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:58.109> you're<00:00:58.260> looking

upside down you can feel like go around

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.149 
upside down you can feel like go around
look<00:01:05.220> again<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> landing<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:07.070> you<00:01:08.070> know

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
look again for the landing so you know

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.530 
look again for the landing so you know
you're<00:01:08.310> looking<00:01:08.549> twice<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.030> look<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

obviously your legs they're Springs so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.190 
obviously your legs they're Springs so
as<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> come<00:01:36.000> around<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.479> need<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.930> ready
