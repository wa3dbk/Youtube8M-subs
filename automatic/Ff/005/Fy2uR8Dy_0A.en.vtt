 that is being represented and there 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.599
 different movements depending on 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.180
 example if there are good turns the skirts 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.459
 they are going to unfold they are going to open but 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.129
 it is not with the intention of deploying the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.340
 suit but with what is telling the 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.750
 dance there are goddesses women who dance with 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.849
 the skirt because they are 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.879
 seducing either they're scare 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.879
 to represent a river a sea 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.599
 traditional structures structures 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.519
 choreographies that have to do with the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.099
 music with what is playing the 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.819
 music and dance are related 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.290

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.780
 ritual are done both and with the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.480
 I also sing the subject of clothes in the 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.209
 dance is a function of dance to the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.290
 clothes that are appearing today 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:12.189
 it's based on the suits 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.109
 traditional to do the dances of 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.840
 borders the afro ritual dances 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:20.889
 Brazilian real costumes carry 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.139
 more elements plus ornaments some go 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.469
 with the head the covered face they carry 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:29.349
 crowns cloths on the chest women 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.840
 those huge skirts with so much movement 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.419
 and the big collars that are going to talk 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.239
 whose saint is what are his 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.959
 colors the handkerchiefs imply those 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:44.310
 units cover that head not where the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.310
 shore inhabits 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.420
 the dance for me is so adorable and in the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.960
 African dance a few years there's nothing 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.070
 may be working because you have to 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.070
 surrender is a total surrender
