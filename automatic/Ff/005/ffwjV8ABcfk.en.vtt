Thunderbolt rook and tawny owl although
I<00:00:15.870> would<00:00:16.260> substitute<00:00:17.779> Thunderbolt<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:19.050> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
I would substitute Thunderbolt with a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.310 
I would substitute Thunderbolt with a
swallow<00:00:21.500> just<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.880> extra<00:00:24.779> damage<00:00:25.140> is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
swallow just because the extra damage is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
swallow just because the extra damage is
pretty<00:00:25.920> useless<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.750> fight<00:00:29.029> basically

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
pretty useless on this fight basically

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.200 
pretty useless on this fight basically
then<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.650> hard<00:00:32.210> there's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
then this is going to be on hard there's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.060 
then this is going to be on hard there's
going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> couple<00:00:34.020> basic<00:00:34.559> rules<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
going to be a couple basic rules that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.430 
going to be a couple basic rules that
you<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> follow<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.030> fight<00:00:36.380> if<00:00:37.380> he

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you have to follow in this fight if he

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590 
you have to follow in this fight if he
uses<00:00:37.950> Kuenn<00:00:38.309> which<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> basically<00:00:39.210> when<00:00:39.480> he

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
uses Kuenn which is basically when he

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.780 
uses Kuenn which is basically when he
he'll<00:00:39.989> stay<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> little<00:00:41.370> thing

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and there will be electric shield around

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830 
and there will be electric shield around
him<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.520> him<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.450> want<00:00:45.719> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
on this guy bombs as well as throwing

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.020 
on this guy bombs as well as throwing
knives<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.600> very<00:01:45.869> very<00:01:46.170> effective<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> him<00:01:47.070> so

because they will just destroy him
one<00:01:56.700> thing<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.030> avoid<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.930> his<00:01:58.320> um<00:01:58.650> art<00:02:00.380> try

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
one thing to avoid is is his um art try

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.410 
one thing to avoid is is his um art try
not<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.680> parry<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.759> best<00:02:02.939> thing<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
not to parry the best thing to do is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.480 
not to parry the best thing to do is
just<00:02:03.570> completely<00:02:04.020> dodging<00:02:04.619> taxes<00:02:05.190> attacks

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
just completely dodging taxes attacks

are<00:02:05.700> really<00:02:06.060> slow<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.350> will<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> lot

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130
