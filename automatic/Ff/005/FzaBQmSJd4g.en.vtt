got<00:01:38.670> well<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> had<00:01:39.810> three<00:01:40.350> rows<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> day<00:01:40.829> before

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
got well I had three rows the day before

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.120 
got well I had three rows the day before
and<00:01:41.399> then<00:01:42.270> got<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:42.930> yesterday<00:01:43.170> quite<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> few

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and then got it up yesterday quite a few

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.399 
and then got it up yesterday quite a few
rows<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.270> I'm<00:01:45.630> about<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> cut<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.200> piece<00:01:46.380> that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
rows and I'm about to cut the piece that

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.609 
rows and I'm about to cut the piece that
goes<00:01:46.560> above<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.009> window<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.340> there<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.619> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
goes above that window right there and I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.819 
goes above that window right there and I
bought<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.460> more<00:01:50.700> furring<00:01:51.210> strips<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.469> can

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
bought two more furring strips so I can

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.830 
bought two more furring strips so I can
install<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> rest<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.719> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
install the rest up here and the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.359 
install the rest up here and the
downside<00:01:55.289> of<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.469> is<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> I've<00:01:55.979> run<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.219> of

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
downside of this is that I've run out of

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.359 
downside of this is that I've run out of
long<00:01:56.640> pieces<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.149> Hardie<00:01:57.390> siding<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> all<00:01:59.249> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
long pieces of Hardie siding so all the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.179 
long pieces of Hardie siding so all the
siding<00:01:59.609> I<00:01:59.789> have<00:01:59.969> left<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.439> scraps<00:02:01.859> here

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
siding I have left is the scraps here

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.399 
siding I have left is the scraps here
that<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.490> mostly<00:02:03.359> from<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.570> cuts<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.109> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
that are mostly from the cuts on the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.190 
that are mostly from the cuts on the
eight<00:02:04.740> foot<00:02:05.210> walls<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.509> foot<00:02:06.689> wide<00:02:06.810> walls<00:02:07.020> like

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
eight foot walls a foot wide walls like

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.070 
eight foot walls a foot wide walls like
this<00:02:07.350> one<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> front<00:02:08.119> so<00:02:09.119> I'm<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:09.960> to

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
this one on the front so I'm going to

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680 
this one on the front so I'm going to
just<00:02:10.619> kind<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.830> reuse<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> lot<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.790> have<00:02:12.300> one<00:02:12.629> more

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
just kind of reuse a lot I have one more

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.110 
just kind of reuse a lot I have one more
12-foot<00:02:13.680> piece<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.370> hearty<00:02:14.610> siding<00:02:14.909> which<00:02:15.030> is

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
12-foot piece of hearty siding which is

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.400 
12-foot piece of hearty siding which is
going<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.330> go<00:02:15.420> over<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.780> window

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
going to go over that window

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
going to go over that window
and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.770> whole<00:02:16.950> top<00:02:17.250> row<00:02:17.490> right<00:02:17.730> there

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and then that whole top row right there

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.960 
and then that whole top row right there
along<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:18.960> length<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.070> ceiling<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.760> going

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
along the length of the ceiling is going

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630 
along the length of the ceiling is going
to<00:02:21.030> be<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.840> roof<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.380> going<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.430> just

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
to be of the roof is going to be just

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.130 
to be of the roof is going to be just
short<00:02:24.000> pieces<00:02:24.180> probably<00:02:24.630> about<00:02:24.750> four<00:02:25.020> or<00:02:25.050> five

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
short pieces probably about four or five

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.260 
short pieces probably about four or five
feet<00:02:25.470> apiece<00:02:25.920> I'm<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.700> going<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.850> taper<00:02:27.060> them

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
feet apiece I'm just going to taper them

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.270 
feet apiece I'm just going to taper them
through<00:02:27.570> here<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.020> short<00:02:28.620> pieces<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:29.100> there

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
through here and short pieces up there

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.040 
through here and short pieces up there
obviously<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:30.450> part<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.870> law<00:02:31.020> of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
obviously this part of the law of

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.270 
obviously this part of the law of
because<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.410> just<00:02:31.590> don't<00:02:31.740> want<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.920> buy<00:02:32.040> more

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
because I just don't want to buy more

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.410 
because I just don't want to buy more
Hardie<00:02:32.550> siding<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.940> think<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.240> kind<00:02:33.390> of

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
Hardie siding I think it's kind of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.150 
Hardie siding I think it's kind of
wasteful<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:33.990> all<00:02:34.170> these<00:02:34.320> leftover

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
wasteful to have all these leftover

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.380 
wasteful to have all these leftover
pieces<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.170> outside<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.390> here

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
pieces so this is the outside and here

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.070 
pieces so this is the outside and here
are<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.630> seams<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:41.100> did<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.780> did<00:02:42.960> kind

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
are the seams that I did so I did kind

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.700 
are the seams that I did so I did kind
of<00:02:43.170> an<00:02:43.290> alternating<00:02:43.980> seem<00:02:44.810> deal<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.350> with

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
of an alternating seem deal here with

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.230 
of an alternating seem deal here with
the<00:02:46.830> siding<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.580> went<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> little<00:02:47.940> bit<00:02:48.060> further

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
the siding and went a little bit further

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.350 
the siding and went a little bit further
over<00:02:48.600> for<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.930> one<00:02:49.490> then<00:02:50.490> no<00:02:50.700> seams<00:02:51.030> for

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
over for that one then no seams for

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.940 
over for that one then no seams for
these<00:02:51.510> two<00:02:51.660> pieces<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:52.230> xelement<00:02:52.530> right<00:02:52.830> in

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
these two pieces there xelement right in

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.400 
these two pieces there xelement right in
between<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.310> windows<00:02:53.960> and<00:02:54.960> here's<00:02:55.200> an

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
between the windows and here's an

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.020 
between the windows and here's an
interesting<00:02:55.590> thing<00:02:55.950> take<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> look<00:02:56.340> at<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.550> so

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
interesting thing take a look at this so

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.730 
interesting thing take a look at this so
that's<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.360> nail<00:02:57.600> when<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.020> was<00:02:58.170> trying<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.530> use

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
that's a nail when I was trying to use

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.230 
that's a nail when I was trying to use
the<00:02:58.950> nail<00:02:59.130> gun<00:02:59.160> without<00:02:59.490> pre<00:02:59.850> drilling<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
the nail gun without pre drilling the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.460 
the nail gun without pre drilling the
holes<00:03:00.420> because<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:00.960> didn't<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.230> about

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
holes because I just didn't think about

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.370 
holes because I just didn't think about
it<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.970> started<00:03:03.240> pre-drilling<00:03:03.660> and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
it and then I started pre-drilling and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.090 
it and then I started pre-drilling and
got<00:03:04.560> some<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.160> nice<00:03:06.050> flush<00:03:07.050> nails<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.680> here

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
got some really nice flush nails in here

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.560 
got some really nice flush nails in here
and<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.880> what<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.090> looks<00:03:09.240> like<00:03:09.330> if<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
and this is what it looks like if you

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.390 
and this is what it looks like if you
pre-drill<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.500> is<00:03:10.560> kind<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.860> sad<00:03:11.070> that

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
pre-drill and so it is kind of sad that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.100 
pre-drill and so it is kind of sad that
I<00:03:11.670> didn't<00:03:12.420> realize<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.840> should<00:03:13.020> be

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
I didn't realize I should be

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740 
I didn't realize I should be
pre-drilling<00:03:13.620> until<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> very<00:03:14.190> end<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:15.510> our

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
pre-drilling until the very end but our

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.600 
pre-drilling until the very end but our
next<00:03:15.900> tiny<00:03:16.200> house<00:03:16.410> or<00:03:16.710> next<00:03:17.100> project<00:03:17.460> I<00:03:17.550> do

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
next tiny house or next project I do

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.420 
next tiny house or next project I do
with<00:03:17.820> Hardie<00:03:18.060> siding<00:03:18.090> will<00:03:18.570> look<00:03:18.930> very<00:03:19.110> nice

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430

gun<00:03:23.010> alone<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.720> then<00:03:24.920> pre-drilling<00:03:25.920> just

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
gun alone and then pre-drilling just

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.850 
gun alone and then pre-drilling just
nice<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.700> counter<00:03:27.510> sunk<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.900> there<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.740> that's

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
nice and counter sunk in there so that's

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.140 
nice and counter sunk in there so that's
my<00:03:29.100> note<00:03:29.310> 2<00:03:29.340> if<00:03:29.610> you're<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.910> be<00:03:30.000> putting

pre-drill<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.490> stuff<00:03:32.730> first<00:03:32.970> because<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.180> is

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
pre-drill this stuff first because it is

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.800 
pre-drill this stuff first because it is
brittle<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.020> it<00:03:34.110> explodes<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:36.120> much

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
brittle and it explodes and it's much

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.350 
brittle and it explodes and it's much
better<00:03:37.050> if<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.740> pre-drilled<00:03:38.040> holes

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
better if you have pre-drilled holes

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.340 
better if you have pre-drilled holes
that's<00:03:39.360> what<00:03:39.450> I've<00:03:39.540> got<00:03:39.660> for<00:03:39.690> now<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.170> might

of fascia board for that and then the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.940 
of fascia board for that and then the
only<00:04:11.310> thing<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.610> have<00:04:11.760> left<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:12.739> right<00:04:13.739> here

around<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.459> window<00:04:15.140> there's<00:04:16.140> some<00:04:16.350> small

around the window there's some small
pieces<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.130> will<00:04:17.400> go<00:04:17.549> up<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.970> side<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.600> think

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
pieces that will go up the side I think

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.190 
pieces that will go up the side I think
it'll<00:04:19.260> be<00:04:19.290> about<00:04:19.590> four<00:04:20.070> pieces<00:04:20.459> per<00:04:20.880> side<00:04:21.200> and

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
it'll be about four pieces per side and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.170 
it'll be about four pieces per side and
that<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:23.040> besides<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:25.530> house<00:04:25.800> is

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
that is it besides that the house is

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.980 
that is it besides that the house is
cited

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
cited

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.300 
cited
