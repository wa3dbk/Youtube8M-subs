40 gigabyte hard drive and so for half
that's<00:05:20.069> being<00:05:20.370> used<00:05:20.659> doesn't<00:05:21.659> appear<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:21.990> be

that's being used doesn't appear to be
but<00:05:22.439> it<00:05:22.529> is<00:05:22.680> but<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:22.979> do<00:05:23.099> have<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.430> DVD<00:05:23.699> drive<00:05:24.029> on

but it is but I do have a DVD drive on

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.239 
but it is but I do have a DVD drive on
here<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.509> I<00:05:24.539> put<00:05:24.719> on<00:05:24.749> that's<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.830> only<00:05:26.099> way<00:05:26.219> I

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:26.249 
here that I put on that's the only way I

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.179 
here that I put on that's the only way I
was<00:05:26.460> able<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.729> install<00:05:27.060> this<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.830> thing<00:05:29.039> is

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
was able to install this the thing is

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.480 
was able to install this the thing is
about<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.729> seller<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.419> is<00:05:30.689> it's<00:05:31.099> worse<00:05:32.099> than<00:05:32.430> a

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
about the seller on is it's worse than a

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.939 
about the seller on is it's worse than a
Pentium<00:05:32.939> 4<00:05:33.270> just<00:05:33.599> clocked<00:05:33.930> higher<00:05:34.289> and

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
Pentium 4 just clocked higher and

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.719 
Pentium 4 just clocked higher and
somehow<00:05:35.729> was<00:05:36.060> able<00:05:36.089> to<00:05:36.419> manage<00:05:36.749> to<00:05:36.930> run<00:05:37.080> this

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
somehow was able to manage to run this

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.059 
somehow was able to manage to run this
my<00:05:38.729> guess<00:05:38.969> is<00:05:39.150> because<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.979> motherboard<00:05:40.979> on

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
my guess is because the motherboard on

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.119 
my guess is because the motherboard on
this<00:05:41.249> thing<00:05:41.490> is<00:05:41.580> pretty<00:05:41.789> nice<00:05:42.740> it's<00:05:43.740> an<00:05:43.889> older

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
this thing is pretty nice it's an older

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.999 
this thing is pretty nice it's an older
Foxconn<00:05:44.699> motherboard<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.529> andfox<00:05:46.529> come<00:05:46.860> at

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
Foxconn motherboard so andfox come at

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.170 
Foxconn motherboard so andfox come at
the<00:05:47.129> time<00:05:48.080> it<00:05:49.080> was<00:05:49.589> good<00:05:49.620> at<00:05:49.889> the<00:05:50.009> time<00:05:50.189> but<00:05:50.249> now

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
the time it was good at the time but now

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.760 
the time it was good at the time but now
if<00:05:51.389> I<00:05:51.539> were<00:05:51.810> to<00:05:51.930> be<00:05:52.050> building<00:05:52.439> a<00:05:52.529> gaming

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
if I were to be building a gaming

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.469 
if I were to be building a gaming
machine<00:05:53.219> or<00:05:53.339> any<00:05:53.460> kind<00:05:53.699> of<00:05:53.759> nice<00:05:53.939> machine<00:05:54.210> I'd

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
machine or any kind of nice machine I'd

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.230 
machine or any kind of nice machine I'd
have<00:05:54.689> to<00:05:54.870> go<00:05:55.020> with<00:05:55.050> up<00:05:55.349> an<00:05:55.589> Asus<00:05:56.399> thing<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:57.060> can

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
have to go with up an Asus thing you can

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.800 
have to go with up an Asus thing you can
kind<00:05:57.449> of<00:05:57.479> see<00:05:57.659> though<00:05:57.810> how<00:05:58.259> waggy<00:05:58.560> this<00:05:58.919> is<00:05:59.810> all

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
kind of see though how waggy this is all

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.909 
kind of see though how waggy this is all
even<00:06:00.960> scroll<00:06:01.409> here<00:06:01.680> it's<00:06:02.339> really<00:06:02.639> laggy<00:06:03.919> but

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
even scroll here it's really laggy but

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.760 
even scroll here it's really laggy but
it<00:06:05.399> runs<00:06:06.529> hard<00:06:07.529> to<00:06:07.649> believe<00:06:07.979> but<00:06:08.669> it<00:06:08.849> runs

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
it runs hard to believe but it runs

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.200 
it runs hard to believe but it runs

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:17.589 
who do not believe me I'm not lying this
thing<00:06:15.300> is<00:06:15.419> a<00:06:15.449> Celeron<00:06:15.960> it's<00:06:16.229> just<00:06:16.409> incredibly

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
thing is a Celeron it's just incredibly

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:21.769 
thing is a Celeron it's just incredibly
slow<00:06:18.599> and<00:06:18.990> it's<00:06:19.259> just<00:06:19.379> freaking<00:06:20.479> very<00:06:21.479> laggy

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779 
slow and it's just freaking very laggy

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.820 
slow and it's just freaking very laggy
very<00:06:22.469> slow<00:06:23.389> but<00:06:24.389> I'm<00:06:24.779> pretty<00:06:25.199> sure<00:06:25.319> if<00:06:25.649> this

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
very slow but I'm pretty sure if this

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.909 
very slow but I'm pretty sure if this
thing<00:06:25.889> can<00:06:26.339> run<00:06:26.849> this<00:06:27.149> I<00:06:27.449> might<00:06:28.199> actually<00:06:28.379> take

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
thing can run this I might actually take

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.040 
thing can run this I might actually take
Windows<00:06:29.399> 8<00:06:29.550> off<00:06:29.789> this<00:06:30.120> and<00:06:30.360> actually<00:06:30.479> install

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
Windows 8 off this and actually install

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.320 
Windows 8 off this and actually install
Windows<00:06:31.409> 7<00:06:31.800> I<00:06:31.889> had<00:06:32.069> the<00:06:32.189> windows<00:06:32.460> 7<00:06:32.699> disc<00:06:32.999> and

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
Windows 7 I had the windows 7 disc and

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.260 
Windows 7 I had the windows 7 disc and
this<00:06:33.990> is<00:06:34.139> a<00:06:34.169> 64-bit<00:06:34.949> processor<00:06:35.610> I'm<00:06:36.029> pretty

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
this is a 64-bit processor I'm pretty

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.129 
this is a 64-bit processor I'm pretty
sure<00:06:36.659> it<00:06:36.960> can<00:06:37.139> handle<00:06:37.169> a<00:06:37.560> 64<00:06:38.099> bit<00:06:38.249> of<00:06:38.399> Windows<00:06:38.669> 7

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
sure it can handle a 64 bit of Windows 7

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:41.719 
sure it can handle a 64 bit of Windows 7
it's<00:06:40.139> kind<00:06:40.349> of<00:06:40.409> weird<00:06:40.649> about<00:06:40.800> the<00:06:41.249> seller<00:06:41.490> on

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
it's kind of weird about the seller on

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:43.519 
it's kind of weird about the seller on
the<00:06:41.759> seller<00:06:42.089> on<00:06:42.330> is<00:06:42.419> a<00:06:42.479> bit<00:06:42.629> more<00:06:42.899> flexible

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
the seller on is a bit more flexible

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.950 
the seller on is a bit more flexible
than<00:06:44.069> the<00:06:44.099> Pentium<00:06:44.669> 4<00:06:44.969> but<00:06:45.180> the<00:06:45.270> Pentium<00:06:45.689> 4

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
than the Pentium 4 but the Pentium 4

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.029 
than the Pentium 4 but the Pentium 4
definitely<00:06:46.710> had<00:06:46.860> the<00:06:47.009> more<00:06:47.219> power<00:06:47.490> to<00:06:48.270> it<00:06:49.039> but

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
definitely had the more power to it but

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.739 
definitely had the more power to it but
this<00:06:50.129> is<00:06:50.310> an<00:06:50.430> older<00:06:50.729> Celeron<00:06:51.210> not<00:06:51.419> the<00:06:51.569> newer

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:51.749 
this is an older Celeron not the newer

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:57.760 
this is an older Celeron not the newer
ones

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.580

does the whole boot up and everything

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.080 
does the whole boot up and everything
just<00:07:01.590> stands<00:07:02.010> there<00:07:02.160> does<00:07:02.460> nothing<00:07:02.880> for<00:07:03.060> a

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
just stands there does nothing for a

just stands there does nothing for a
second<00:07:03.480> oh<00:07:04.670> wait<00:07:05.670> for<00:07:05.910> it<00:07:05.940> I<00:07:06.860> don't<00:07:07.860> know<00:07:07.920> why

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
second oh wait for it I don't know why

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.470 
second oh wait for it I don't know why
it<00:07:08.130> does<00:07:08.310> that<00:07:08.490> it<00:07:08.580> just<00:07:08.730> kicks<00:07:08.940> in<00:07:09.090> and<00:07:09.330> it

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
it does that it just kicks in and it

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.470 
it does that it just kicks in and it
starts<00:07:09.810> furnace<00:07:10.200> eight<00:07:10.880> and<00:07:11.880> the<00:07:12.060> hard<00:07:12.270> drive

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
starts furnace eight and the hard drive

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.060 
starts furnace eight and the hard drive
in<00:07:12.630> here<00:07:12.840> is<00:07:12.960> like<00:07:13.140> a<00:07:13.170> Western<00:07:13.590> Digital<00:07:13.770> caviar

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
in here is like a Western Digital caviar

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.460 
in here is like a Western Digital caviar
so<00:07:14.790> it's<00:07:14.970> not<00:07:15.180> the<00:07:15.360> fastest<00:07:15.840> hard<00:07:16.050> drive<00:07:16.320> in

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
so it's not the fastest hard drive in

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.830 
so it's not the fastest hard drive in
here<00:07:16.680> which<00:07:17.580> gives<00:07:18.000> it<00:07:18.120> kind<00:07:18.240> of<00:07:18.330> a<00:07:18.420> slow<00:07:18.690> boot

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
here which gives it kind of a slow boot

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.040 
here which gives it kind of a slow boot
up<00:07:18.990> time<00:07:20.030> even<00:07:21.030> though<00:07:21.150> usually<00:07:21.420> Windows<00:07:21.900> 8

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
up time even though usually Windows 8

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.620 
up time even though usually Windows 8
goes<00:07:22.260> faster<00:07:22.680> so<00:07:23.130> I<00:07:23.160> original<00:07:24.030> head<00:07:24.180> xp<00:07:24.600> home

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
goes faster so I original head xp home

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.090 
goes faster so I original head xp home
