00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.510
 cut 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.179
 so you're beautiful you chose a game that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.610
 is called dreaming this game it's a game 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.080
 data east a - yeah it seems that's 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.850
 a catalyst game definitely it's 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.830
 really the eggs of the sport 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.180
 mechanics with robots and stuff 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 and furies and many like you 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.010
 can see this kind of hand game 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 ball or handball and ball because 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 it's a German sport of course you have to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.710
 say in date so here we are immediately 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 will choose an ultra racist team 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.190
 that is to say the Americans the Japanese 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 who are samurai the spaniards who 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.460
 are also samurai the the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.329
 brazilians who have powers 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 psychic 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.450
 the Germans who have heads of cons 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.579
 the British who have heads of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.180
 knight the Italians who are also 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.280
 no matter how 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.390
 and here is the me I take in arabia 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.149
 Saudi Arabia because that's how it flows 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.680
 source 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.480
 go and suddenly I propose that we fight 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.570
 not in one of the exotic countries but 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.120
 in space what made them 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.510
 can choose the space team and get 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.090
 are of course again of course we 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.909
 are teleported into the in the fire 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.450
 the action 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.659
 couscous attacks a button to make 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.540
 passes to the button to type the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.799
 mouth to the whore and especially the more you 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.630
 expect you have a small gauge of 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.200
 fury that which fills up to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.460
 measure to the whore they will be more as 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.619
 and to the extent and suddenly it allows to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.590
 swing like that the firewall to the whore 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.820
