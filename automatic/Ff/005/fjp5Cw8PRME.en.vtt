00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.900
 Hijioka is also killing is the engineering unit 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.900
 Yes I 'm studying for a crew member 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:07.520
 Now Japan is thought that want to get a job, such as he is to challenge certain that the solutions had 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:12.200
 Amid or was limited administrative resources, for example, a person was or money are also limited to what now 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.000

 Who was the professor in developing ips cells 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.140
 Terrific 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:45.080
 The thing that various problems from the very situation as a clinician 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.250
 It's nice to be scooped up and trying to change the organization of Japanese research in the future 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.490
 I think 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.860
 Your name and scholar 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.740
 It is Sato of 8 engineering department Yes 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.640
 That the Earth Engineering Department 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.140
 It is a department but 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.980
 That's where 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.630
 4 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:08.810
 For example, Toka or create a Well bridge or with or made this road 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:12.120
 It's a department that is widely disliked to create such social infrastructure 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 I will make the best use of it at my company 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.010
 It is a head 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.030
 After all 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:25.030
 It is still a road for society to go around well 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.530
 After all, it is necessary to maintain such things well 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.540
 Or a well of transportation Well 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.710
 There is such a thing that flows people , and after all I arrange such things firmly 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.760
 I think that I want to go 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.750
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.610
 I 'm not putting pat now 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.890
 After all 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:52.900
 After all, it is that I think trying to do I we now their is making money Toka kind of do 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.560
 It's not a job that helps people but it's like Numbo . 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.650
 After all that 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:04.480
 After all, people who want to do our for everyone, even at the expense of yourself 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.110
 You are the kind of person I can aim for but I can respect you 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.180
 There Toka that working people 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.810
 that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.080
 Well things like Tteyuu go still with the knowledge to read the full book Well 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.569
 I do 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.660
 Is important 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:24.770
 Is there to read, however likely this Toka with the present of another is important by that large mathematics of ancient people 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.730
 Of my great people and markers 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:35.140
 It's like having a dialogue with you 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:40.390
 Once upon a time people learn that the modern around or finance is the current two feet and read Toka newspaper 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.230
 I think I have to learn from books and have to pause after all 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.159
 Ne 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.159
 goo 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:58.790
 I tried to learn about the name zed and I am a student of the Global Environment School Building Environmental Management Course 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.150
 The Dazai studying 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:14.930
 About environmental problems that are attached to the Global Environment Commission 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:14.930
 Prefecture Masu Ehime or fieldwork 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.840
 Well , I think even if it is a company, I think that I can always know the knowledge I learned about environmental issues 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.440
 Oh dear 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:32.000
 Companies that are already in need of environmental issues 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.050
 I think it is a responsibility that I have to bear, so make use of my knowledge of those things 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.430
 I want to work while 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:45.350
 What kind of person came to the Japanese where the sea is longing 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.500
 New Fuji came in Ireland three months I felt at that time still 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.830
 I feel that Japan Technology is amazing 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:57.110
 Japan Technology always comes from Japan 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.190
 Many pieces many times Japanese manufacturers also have been named went so Toka or a Sony's 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.430
 Things also 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:06.950
 It was is put or TV like a sure say monitor 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.980
 Again Toka liquid crystal appliances or a car I thought so I'm supporting the other side of life 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:16.340
 The Manufacturing of Tteyuu Japan 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:22.180
 Because it is a developed country, such parts are such things while being proud as a Japanese 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.180
 I think it is important to extend more from now 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.220
 Had 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.560
 debuoooo 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.980
 Hmm 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.090
 Hmm 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.610
 Yeah yeah yeah
