gonna make sure it's acid by mixing the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.690 
gonna make sure it's acid by mixing the

soil with peat moss peat boss is a very
acidic<00:01:49.240> material<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.210> when<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.450> mix<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.750> in

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
acidic material and when you mix it in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.810 
acidic material and when you mix it in
with<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.050> soil<00:01:53.080> then<00:01:54.070> we'll<00:01:54.250> have<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.520> nice

now when you're making the mixture it

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.410 
now when you're making the mixture it
needs<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.959> be<00:03:39.110> about<00:03:39.200> 1/2<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:40.340> 1/2<00:03:40.370> or<00:03:40.760> 3/2<00:03:41.180> 1

needs to be about 1/2 and 1/2 or 3/2 1
maybe<00:03:41.660> with<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.349> peat<00:03:42.530> moss<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.010> soil<00:03:43.280> a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
maybe with the peat moss in the soil a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.220 
maybe with the peat moss in the soil a
little<00:03:43.550> bit<00:03:43.640> less<00:03:43.880> peat<00:03:44.120> moss<00:03:44.270> in<00:03:44.540> soil<00:03:44.780> but

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
little bit less peat moss in soil but

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.960 
little bit less peat moss in soil but
nonetheless<00:03:45.440> still<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> lot<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.730> good

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
nonetheless still a lot of that good

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.190 
nonetheless still a lot of that good
acidic<00:03:47.810> organic<00:03:48.680> matter<00:03:48.890> gets<00:03:49.190> mixed<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:50.200> now

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
acidic organic matter gets mixed in now

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.350 
acidic organic matter gets mixed in now
will<00:03:51.349> make<00:03:51.470> us<00:03:51.590> some<00:03:51.680> hole<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.430> middle
