and that's the only thing and then that
just<00:03:09.060> down<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.140> side<00:03:10.320> skirts<00:03:10.560> are

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740

even back here we can only see it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.820 
even back here we can only see it
because<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.160> exhaust<00:03:18.030> pipes<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.710> it<00:03:19.710> just

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
because of the exhaust pipes and it just

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.950

so<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:42.080> would<00:04:43.080> what<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.740> what<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:43.950> had<00:04:44.130> proved<00:04:44.460> on

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
so I would what I what I had proved on

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.890 
so I would what I what I had proved on
it<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:46.940> think<00:04:47.940> II<00:04:48.030> there's<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.390> lot<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.660> can

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
it is I think II there's a lot you can

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.000 
it is I think II there's a lot you can
do<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.080> make<00:04:49.200> it<00:04:49.230> better<00:04:49.320> but<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:50.900> thought<00:04:52.010> one

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
do to make it better but I thought one

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.610 
do to make it better but I thought one
idea<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.310> had<00:04:53.580> is<00:04:53.850> making<00:04:54.630> this<00:04:54.720> car<00:04:55.020> look<00:04:55.350> like

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
idea I had is making this car look like

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.920 
idea I had is making this car look like
a<00:04:55.800> fighter<00:04:56.040> jet<00:04:56.160> like<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.850> fighter<00:04:57.420> jet<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.810> you
