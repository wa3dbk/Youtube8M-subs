00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.610 
what the older guys some of them gone
through<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.660> just<00:03:42.110> went<00:03:42.290> through<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.560> last

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
through I just went through this last

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.190 
through I just went through this last
year<00:03:43.070> six<00:03:43.490> some<00:03:43.640> were<00:03:43.820> renew<00:03:44.510> last<00:03:44.750> year<00:03:45.050> and

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
year six some were renew last year and

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.290 
year six some were renew last year and
year<00:03:45.620> before<00:03:45.770> that<00:03:45.950> we<00:03:46.250> had<00:03:46.370> had<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.030> couple

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
year before that we had had a couple

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.620 
year before that we had had a couple
changes<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:47.990> I<00:03:48.940> think<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.180> older<00:03:50.420> guys<00:03:50.600> and

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
changes so I think the older guys and

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.840 
changes so I think the older guys and
the<00:03:50.930> true<00:03:51.110> ones<00:03:51.370> understand<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.550> this<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:52.820> a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850
