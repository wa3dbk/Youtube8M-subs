00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.399
 afterwards 

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.399
 the 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.610
 that only on ferdi e and that of being that draws such fine Amsterdam 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.089
 a dirty one against the fire 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.189
 these are end 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:14.989
 plots 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:16.490
 the 10 cm 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 year 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.900
 no not really 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.909
 what would it like to do 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.009
 justice 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.560
 viktor fischer 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.899
 and that is never before 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.110
 also like to play against 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.010
 I will also quite like that there is opposition at Ajax 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 to visit earlier 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000
 to talk 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 in the briefcase 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.600
 it's an interview with sporza 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.130
 good thing that is 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.910
 I think it's only fair to be 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.040
 on an ajacied 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.730
 8 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.750
 8 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 what was it all day that the what would be 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 it's about 20 3 percent to be yeah right I've always dreamed of becoming a pro 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.120
 to be able to be but the second set is the pass on my guess 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.120
 with four tenths of fifteen dead that's really off 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 yes about ten times via 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.890
 portas italy 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.149
 when i came to ajax 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.590
 at the age of sixteen I signed with ajax 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 and i went especially seventeenth birthday celebrating the girl nature 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.100
 it was difficult to judge 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.800
 years very difficult point, however, difficult to tell your chickens 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.620
 of course i have tupac with soldiers 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.760
 but my big brother that you do not attend but lives here in the Netherlands 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.730
 sometimes difficult to 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.100
 say goodbye to him 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.460
 also for me the sushi 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.820
 and i want my dad mom and i did i ever find it is it too 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.210
 realize that says very tricky but I knew 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.679
 exactly what i wanted i want to be soccer and 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.189
 i wanted i want the restart ajax so well 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.549
 also difficult or not I wanted it so bad that it really had to 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.059
 ambulance family clothes 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.549
 damn 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.679
 baghdad what do you mean 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.679
 yeah but my brother's brothers didn't come to me with me 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.539
 and 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.769
 he will stay for another year he put down we just have a party 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.399
 so found 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.689
 that it really gets a lot more fun 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.279
 some honor inter 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:42.939
 that's how it is 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.480
 well the top that used to be yes of course when i just came one 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.489
 After a little skinny I went to see the first great rural one of the family members 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.709
 I always have here 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.799
 the placing 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.599
 September went on afterwards, the guests are 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.069
 and I've been there since with two very nice people 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.409
 not really 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.599
 10 in 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.729
 get a good relationship with the press in between 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:12.749
 Ie did not really feel very alone but sometimes when I am in the bad 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.849
 Youth games played and Mike went home to my room 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.869
 if it is there then it will come a bit 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:24.239
 a bit lonely for it but never really and I'll always find your or 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.339
 me and of course even when the family call 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.339
 many months have been shut down 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.939
 why are you best 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.619
 we keep it 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:39.619
 3 to put the scoring 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.309
 I think so too 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.029
 he still cannot improve 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.669
 the hague ado 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.589
 defensive can always be better but certainly refused 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.339
 the 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.419
 defensive stitches 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.099
 still mercy's the tap 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.049
 just like with the games I think you should strive for a lot of mercy and what not 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.049
 I do 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.019
 in and and become a real team player it is it is the most important thing for me 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.129
 you will get it 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.299
 Tintin film gets know in the parish by the jewelry 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.659

 you must of course be employed by the team this is of course it is whole 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:23.759
 important that you 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.999

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.099
 that was for the pieterpad for the ten with the most important is m 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.510
 In addition, you may create your own action here and 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.110

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.789

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.800
 trier favorite position of mine 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:55.710

 also in five years it is allowed 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.999
 that would be that would be stupid 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.159
