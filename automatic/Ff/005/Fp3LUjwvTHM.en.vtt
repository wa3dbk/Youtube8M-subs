00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
I'm sure you'll remember where I left my

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.619 
I'm sure you'll remember where I left my
camera<00:00:32.140> last<00:00:32.439> night<00:00:32.860> well<00:00:33.310> it's<00:00:33.520> same<00:00:34.210> spot

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
but now I'm in the middle of a lake and

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.209 
but now I'm in the middle of a lake and
that's<00:00:37.390> what<00:00:37.600> happens<00:00:37.989> when<00:00:38.800> you're<00:00:39.010> in<00:00:39.070> Death

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.810 
that's what happens when you're in Death
Valley<00:00:39.250> that<00:00:39.699> rains<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:41.020> night<00:00:41.350> long<00:00:41.820> my

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
Valley that rains all night long my

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.340 
Valley that rains all night long my
morning<00:00:43.149> shot<00:00:43.390> really<00:00:43.660> isn't<00:00:43.899> there<00:00:44.140> anymore

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
morning shot really isn't there anymore

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.139 
morning shot really isn't there anymore
it<00:00:45.010> would<00:00:45.160> have<00:00:45.280> been<00:00:45.370> kind<00:00:45.579> of<00:00:45.640> cool<00:00:45.789> I<00:00:45.850> guess

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
it would have been kind of cool I guess

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.700 
it would have been kind of cool I guess
but<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.870> never<00:00:47.050> really<00:00:47.289> know<00:00:49.140> yeah<00:00:50.140> but<00:00:50.559> I'm

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
but you never really know yeah but I'm

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.650 
but you never really know yeah but I'm
in<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.890> lake<00:00:51.070> now<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.910> I'm<00:00:51.969> kind<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.300> slowly

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
in a lake now and I'm kind of slowly

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.340 
in a lake now and I'm kind of slowly
sinking<00:00:53.140> in<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:54.250> this<00:00:54.820> beautiful<00:00:55.350> salty

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
sinking in and this beautiful salty

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:20.430 
sinking in and this beautiful salty
quicksand<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:58.600> known<00:00:58.870> as<00:00:58.899> Death<00:00:59.230> Valley

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.530 

as<00:01:21.430> soon<00:01:21.700> as<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.970> was<00:01:22.060> bright<00:01:22.210> enough<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.420> see

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
as soon as it was bright enough to see

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.150 
as soon as it was bright enough to see
an<00:01:22.690> image<00:01:22.840> on<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.080> ground<00:01:23.290> glass<00:01:23.410> I<00:01:23.860> went

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
an image on the ground glass I went

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.650 
an image on the ground glass I went
ahead<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.550> moved<00:01:24.700> my<00:01:24.850> camera<00:01:25.180> around<00:01:25.240> see<00:01:25.600> if

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
ahead and moved my camera around see if

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.330 
ahead and moved my camera around see if
I<00:01:25.720> could<00:01:25.840> find<00:01:26.020> another<00:01:26.080> composition<00:01:26.560> but<00:01:27.130> I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
I could find another composition but I

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.820 
I could find another composition but I
really<00:01:28.030> couldn't<00:01:28.240> find<00:01:28.450> anything<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:29.020> I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
really couldn't find anything and I

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.740 
really couldn't find anything and I
think<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.220> main<00:01:30.400> reason<00:01:30.430> is<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.390> area<00:01:31.720> I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
think the main reason is that the area I

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.780 
think the main reason is that the area I
selected<00:01:32.110> yesterday<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.250> chose<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.640> for<00:01:33.760> a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
selected yesterday and I chose it for a

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.490 
selected yesterday and I chose it for a
reason<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.270> that<00:01:34.300> reason<00:01:34.690> is<00:01:35.050> it<00:01:35.230> was<00:01:35.380> really

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
reason and that reason is it was really

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.470 
reason and that reason is it was really
well<00:01:35.740> defined<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.460> as<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.030> moved<00:01:37.210> away<00:01:37.360> from

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
well defined and as I moved away from

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.480 
well defined and as I moved away from
that<00:01:37.660> area<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.650> kind<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:38.860> end<00:01:38.980> up<00:01:39.160> getting

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
that area you kind of end up getting

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.460 
that area you kind of end up getting
more<00:01:39.760> of<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.150> ridges<00:01:40.900> that<00:01:41.050> dominate<00:01:41.440> the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
more of the ridges that dominate the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.710 
more of the ridges that dominate the
scene<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.280> dots<00:01:42.580> are<00:01:42.790> less<00:01:42.940> defined<00:01:43.360> and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
scene and the dots are less defined and

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.190 
scene and the dots are less defined and
so<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.950> don't<00:01:45.580> know<00:01:45.730> it's<00:01:46.660> not<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.870> big<00:01:47.020> deal

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
so I don't know it's not a big deal

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.930 
so I don't know it's not a big deal
because<00:01:47.410> there<00:01:48.130> really<00:01:48.160> wasn't<00:01:48.640> any

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
because there really wasn't any

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.610 
because there really wasn't any
interesting<00:01:49.390> light<00:01:49.600> anyways<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.350> was<00:01:50.470> just

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
interesting light anyways it was just

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.070 
interesting light anyways it was just
kind<00:01:50.800> of<00:01:50.860> overcast<00:01:51.280> like<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:51.670> see<00:01:51.850> right<00:01:51.880> now

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
kind of overcast like you see right now

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.810 
kind of overcast like you see right now
but<00:01:53.080> now<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.200> am<00:01:53.500> determined<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.130> move

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
but now I am determined to move

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.580 
but now I am determined to move
somewhere<00:01:55.300> else<00:01:55.360> find<00:01:56.110> something<00:01:56.440> else

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
somewhere else find something else

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.230 
somewhere else find something else
that's<00:01:56.800> interesting<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.250> photograph<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:57.940> got<00:01:58.210> a

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
that's interesting to photograph I got a

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.990 
that's interesting to photograph I got a
few<00:01:58.420> ideas<00:01:58.510> but<00:01:59.440> all<00:01:59.890> those<00:02:00.160> ideas<00:02:00.580> take<00:02:00.850> me

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
few ideas but all those ideas take me

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.630 
few ideas but all those ideas take me
away<00:02:01.420> from<00:02:01.600> here<00:02:01.870> because<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.410> pretty<00:02:02.640> muddy

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
away from here because it's pretty muddy

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.969 
away from here because it's pretty muddy
and<00:02:04.000> nasty<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:05.580> filthy<00:02:06.580> here<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.679> less<00:02:08.679> mud

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
and nasty and filthy here and less mud

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:20.700 
and nasty and filthy here and less mud
would<00:02:09.190> be<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.340> wonderful<00:02:10.270> thing

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.620 

many<00:02:21.370> people<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:21.880> commented<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:22.450> my

many people have commented on my

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.870 
many people have commented on my
patience<00:02:23.050> as<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> photographer<00:02:23.860> though<00:02:24.730> I'm

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
patience as a photographer though I'm

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.640 
patience as a photographer though I'm
indeed<00:02:25.150> quite<00:02:25.390> patient<00:02:25.600> my<00:02:26.230> sense<00:02:26.500> of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
indeed quite patient my sense of

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.320 
indeed quite patient my sense of
motivation<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:27.370> directly<00:02:27.850> linked<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.240> my

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
motivation is directly linked to my

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.260 
motivation is directly linked to my
ability<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.990> capture<00:02:29.230> an<00:02:29.470> image<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:30.270> approach

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
ability to capture an image I approach

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.940 
ability to capture an image I approach
each<00:02:31.450> trip<00:02:31.780> with<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.960> set<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.230> specific<00:02:32.710> goals

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
each trip with a set of specific goals

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.920 
each trip with a set of specific goals
and<00:02:33.280> yesterday's<00:02:34.270> photo<00:02:34.480> was<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
and yesterday's photo was the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.990 
and yesterday's photo was the
realization<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.650> my<00:02:35.710> primary<00:02:36.280> objective

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
realization of my primary objective

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.060 
realization of my primary objective
I<00:02:37.030> was<00:02:38.020> now<00:02:38.230> with<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.530> sense<00:02:38.800> of<00:02:38.950> direction

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
I was now with that a sense of direction

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.250 
I was now with that a sense of direction
so<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:39.940> felt<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.270> trip<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.540> Dante's<00:02:40.930> view<00:02:41.170> would

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
so I felt a trip to Dante's view would

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.530 
so I felt a trip to Dante's view would
help<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:42.090> there's<00:02:43.090> something<00:02:43.300> about

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
help with that there's something about

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.000 
help with that there's something about
sitting<00:02:43.810> atop<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.260> mountain<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.830> brings

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
sitting atop a mountain that brings
