about he's not happy I am that Blizzard
is<00:00:18.750> willing<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.320> break<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> rules<00:00:20.010> again

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
is willing to break the rules again

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.340 
is willing to break the rules again
because<00:00:20.820> usually<00:00:21.029> when<00:00:21.330> they<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.990> ends<00:00:22.260> up

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
because usually when they do it ends up

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.590 
because usually when they do it ends up
being<00:00:22.380> good<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.760> they're<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.449> use

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
being good so they're not going to use

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.540 
being good so they're not going to use
mail<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.170> is<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> least<00:00:25.769> distributed

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
mail which is the least distributed

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.240 
mail which is the least distributed
armor<00:00:26.970> type<00:00:27.240> amongst<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> classes<00:00:28.590> they

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
armor type amongst all the classes they

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580 
armor type amongst all the classes they
will<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> leather<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.480> makes<00:00:30.990> sense<00:00:31.289> for

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
will use the leather it makes sense for

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.350 
will use the leather it makes sense for
them<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> use<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> leather<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.759> does<00:00:32.940> not<00:00:33.149> make

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
them to use the leather it does not make

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360 
them to use the leather it does not make
sense<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.780> them<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.200> mail<00:00:34.469> therefore

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
sense for them to use mail therefore

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
sense for them to use mail therefore
they<00:00:35.550> will<00:00:35.700> use<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> letter<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.110> not

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
they will use a letter they are not

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
they will use a letter they are not
going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> use<00:00:37.739> cloth<00:00:38.540> even<00:00:39.540> though<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> would

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
going to use cloth even though it would

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.690 
going to use cloth even though it would
kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> make<00:00:40.440> sense<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> demon<00:00:41.370> hunters

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
kind of make sense for the demon hunters

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.500 
kind of make sense for the demon hunters
but<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.230> itemize<00:00:44.390> lot<00:00:45.390> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
but they would have to itemize lot of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.799 
but they would have to itemize lot of
cloth<00:00:46.020> items<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.489> agility<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
cloth items to have agility and that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.779 
cloth items to have agility and that
doesn't<00:00:49.170> make<00:00:49.260> sense<00:00:49.579> even<00:00:50.579> though<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.700> just

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
doesn't make sense even though I just

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.549 
doesn't make sense even though I just
assumed<00:00:51.420> they're<00:00:51.660> gonna<00:00:51.780> use<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.989> dirty<00:00:52.230> by

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
assumed they're gonna use a dirty by

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
assumed they're gonna use a dirty by
looks<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.920> they're<00:00:53.070> gonna<00:00:53.190> use<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> gelati

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
looks like they're gonna use the gelati

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.069 
looks like they're gonna use the gelati
because<00:00:54.390> they're<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.780> agile<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.920> instead<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
because they're very agile so instead of

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.319 
because they're very agile so instead of
itemizing<00:00:58.079> cloth<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.190> agility<00:00:59.879> they

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
itemizing cloth to have agility they

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.590 
itemizing cloth to have agility they
will<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:01.199> leather<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:02.430> good<00:01:02.699> happy

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
will just have leather very good happy

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.090 
will just have leather very good happy
with<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.619> thing<00:01:04.949> I'm

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
with that now there is one thing I'm

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.890 
with that now there is one thing I'm
even<00:01:05.309> happier<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.720> they're

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
even happier about because they're

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300 
even happier about because they're
willing<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.229> break<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> rules<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.070> demon

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
willing to break the rules the demon

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.330 
willing to break the rules the demon

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.759 
still kind of mad because we don't know
if<00:03:27.389> it's<00:03:27.569> gonna<00:03:27.870> have<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.109> cool<00:03:28.350> down<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
if it's gonna have a cool down the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.860 
if it's gonna have a cool down the
metamorphosis<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:29.880> if<00:03:30.600> it's<00:03:30.750> gonna

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
metamorphosis that is or if it's gonna

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.080 
metamorphosis that is or if it's gonna
work<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.470> metamorphosis<00:03:32.310> works<00:03:32.549> now<00:03:32.819> for

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
work like metamorphosis works now for

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.289 
work like metamorphosis works now for
demonology<00:03:33.690> warlocks<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.430> in<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.670> case<00:03:35.970> if

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
demonology warlocks and in that case if

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.569 
demonology warlocks and in that case if
it<00:03:36.420> works<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.410> current<00:03:37.650> metamorphosis

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
it works like the current metamorphosis

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.120 
it works like the current metamorphosis
we<00:03:39.060> might<00:03:39.299> run<00:03:39.600> into<00:03:39.660> some<00:03:40.139> serious<00:03:40.410> problems

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
we might run into some serious problems

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.520 
we might run into some serious problems
because<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:42.299> reason<00:03:42.450> demonology<00:03:43.170> warlocks

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
because the reason demonology warlocks

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.259 
because the reason demonology warlocks
were<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.069> strong<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.700> because<00:03:44.730> they<00:03:45.090> had

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
were so strong is because they had

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.620 
were so strong is because they had
on-demand<00:03:45.660> burst<00:03:46.170> at<00:03:46.530> any<00:03:46.980> time<00:03:47.430> they<00:03:48.239> weren't

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
on-demand burst at any time they weren't

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.160 
on-demand burst at any time they weren't
I<00:03:49.079> just<00:03:49.769> say<00:03:49.950> held<00:03:50.340> back<00:03:50.670> by<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.660> 1<00:03:51.930> minute

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
I just say held back by a 1 minute

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.599 
I just say held back by a 1 minute
cooldown<00:03:52.380> or<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.739> two<00:03:52.889> minute<00:03:53.069> cooldown<00:03:53.310> or<00:03:53.549> a

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
cooldown or a two minute cooldown or a

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.370 
cooldown or a two minute cooldown or a
three<00:03:53.790> minute<00:03:53.970> cooldown<00:03:54.239> if<00:03:54.660> something<00:03:55.260> needs

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
three minute cooldown if something needs

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.110 
three minute cooldown if something needs
to<00:03:55.560> done<00:03:55.799> really<00:03:56.069> fast<00:03:56.100> or<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.670> need<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:56.970> go

big dick and DPS boss really hard they

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.759 
big dick and DPS boss really hard they
had<00:03:59.880> metamorphosis<00:04:00.569> for<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.049> really<00:04:01.620> good

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
had metamorphosis for it and really good

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.800 
had metamorphosis for it and really good
demonology<00:04:02.250> warlocks<00:04:02.670> knew<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.450> entire

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
demonology warlocks knew the entire

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.569 
demonology warlocks knew the entire
encounter<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.590> they<00:04:04.709> knew<00:04:04.950> when<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
encounter and they knew when it's the

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.120 
encounter and they knew when it's the
best<00:04:05.880> time<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.690> pop<00:04:06.930> into<00:04:07.139> metamorphosis<00:04:07.980> and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
best time to pop into metamorphosis and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.770 
best time to pop into metamorphosis and
the<00:04:08.549> same<00:04:08.730> thing<00:04:09.000> will<00:04:09.239> happen<00:04:09.269> with<00:04:09.690> the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
the same thing will happen with the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.479 
the same thing will happen with the
demon<00:04:10.019> hunters<00:04:10.319> if<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.709> works<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.220> same<00:04:11.250> way

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
demon hunters if it works the same way

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.220 
demon hunters if it works the same way
they<00:04:11.940> will<00:04:12.060> know<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.419> encounter<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.079> they

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
they will know the encounter and they

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.780 
they will know the encounter and they
will<00:04:13.410> know<00:04:13.620> when<00:04:13.799> it's<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:14.010> best<00:04:14.250> time<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.609> pop

will know when it's the best time to pop

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.610 
will know when it's the best time to pop
into<00:04:15.000> meta<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.510> they<00:04:15.840> will<00:04:16.019> dominate<00:04:16.470> the

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
into meta and they will dominate the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.360 
into meta and they will dominate the
other<00:04:16.739> dps<00:04:17.130> classes<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.630> there<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.620> also<00:04:19.950> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
other dps classes but there is also the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.310 
other dps classes but there is also the
interview<00:04:20.940> with<00:04:21.090> Ian<00:04:21.479> where<00:04:21.750> he<00:04:21.870> said<00:04:22.109> well

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
interview with Ian where he said well

we're<00:04:22.470> nerfing<00:04:22.680> demonology<00:04:23.580> war<00:04:23.729> logs

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
we're nerfing demonology war logs

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.969 
we're nerfing demonology war logs
because<00:04:24.120> we<00:04:24.419> don't<00:04:24.599> like<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.930> play<00:04:25.140> style<00:04:25.440> did

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
because we don't like the play style did

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.770 
because we don't like the play style did
he<00:04:26.220> slay<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.580> because<00:04:27.210> they<00:04:27.450> will

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
he slay that because they will

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.480 
he slay that because they will
holy<00:04:28.230> we<00:04:28.350> have<00:04:28.530> demon<00:04:28.860> hunters<00:04:29.220> coming

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
holy we have demon hunters coming

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.320 
holy we have demon hunters coming
and<00:04:30.620> we<00:04:31.620> want<00:04:31.860> them<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.190> play<00:04:32.370> kind<00:04:32.790> of<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.090> a

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
and we want them to play kind of like a

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.990 
and we want them to play kind of like a
demonology<00:04:34.139> rogue<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:35.400> we<00:04:35.520> want<00:04:35.730> them<00:04:35.850> to

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
demonology rogue and we want them to

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.790 
demonology rogue and we want them to
have<00:04:36.120> metamorphosis<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:36.990> we<00:04:37.139> need<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.410> change

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
have metamorphosis so we need to change

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.129 
have metamorphosis so we need to change
that<00:04:37.980> or<00:04:38.400> was<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.880> genuinely<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.510> them<00:04:39.870> not

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
that or was it genuinely just them not

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.200 
that or was it genuinely just them not
like<00:04:40.380> in<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.620> play<00:04:40.800> style<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.400> in<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.910> case

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
like in the play style and in that case

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.659 
like in the play style and in that case
the<00:04:42.680> metamorphosis<00:04:43.680> for<00:04:43.860> demon<00:04:44.130> hunters<00:04:44.430> will

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
the metamorphosis for demon hunters will

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.640 
the metamorphosis for demon hunters will
probably<00:04:45.120> work<00:04:45.270> differently<00:04:45.900> than<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.320> does

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
probably work differently than it does

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.520 
probably work differently than it does
for<00:04:47.250> demonology<00:04:47.880> warlocks<00:04:48.270> right<00:04:48.540> now<00:04:48.780> but

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
for demonology warlocks right now but

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.230 
for demonology warlocks right now but
once<00:04:49.860> again<00:04:49.980> we<00:04:50.160> don't<00:04:50.280> know<00:04:50.550> all<00:04:50.790> right<00:04:51.120> and

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
once again we don't know all right and

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.330 
once again we don't know all right and
we<00:04:51.480> probably<00:04:51.690> won't<00:04:51.990> know<00:04:52.230> until<00:04:52.590> blizzcon

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
we probably won't know until blizzcon

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.890 
we probably won't know until blizzcon
where<00:04:53.580> they<00:04:53.760> will<00:04:53.820> probably<00:04:54.120> reveal<00:04:54.540> more

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
where they will probably reveal more

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.320 
where they will probably reveal more
about<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.500> demon<00:04:55.860> hunters<00:04:56.250> then<00:04:57.060> there<00:04:57.240> were

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
about the demon hunters then there were

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.310 
about the demon hunters then there were
some<00:04:57.510> people<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.840> were<00:04:58.080> really

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
some people that were really

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.530 
some people that were really
disappointed<00:04:58.500> with<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.580> skill<00:04:59.880> set<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.450> I

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
disappointed with the skill set and I

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.140 
disappointed with the skill set and I
mean<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.960> was<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.440> first<00:05:01.910> sort<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:03.030> like

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
mean it was the first sort of like

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.480 
mean it was the first sort of like
showcase<00:05:03.660> of<00:05:03.840> the<00:05:03.930> demon<00:05:04.200> hunters<00:05:04.530> I<00:05:04.770> think

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
showcase of the demon hunters I think

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.190 
showcase of the demon hunters I think
they<00:05:05.640> just<00:05:05.669> tried<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.360> get<00:05:06.510> a<00:05:06.540> demon<00:05:06.900> hunter

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
they just tried to get a demon hunter

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.140 
they just tried to get a demon hunter

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
people are going nuts over it but from

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.330 
people are going nuts over it but from
what<00:05:51.660> we<00:05:51.840> have<00:05:51.990> seen<00:05:52.020> it<00:05:52.740> doesn't<00:05:53.100> look<00:05:53.280> like

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
what we have seen it doesn't look like

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.060 
what we have seen it doesn't look like
you<00:05:53.640> can<00:05:53.820> jump<00:05:54.240> higher<00:05:54.600> all<00:05:55.560> right<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:55.950> won't

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
you can jump higher all right you won't

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.100 
you can jump higher all right you won't
jump<00:05:56.400> higher<00:05:56.610> you<00:05:56.760> just<00:05:57.060> jump<00:05:57.330> further<00:05:57.630> maybe

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
jump higher you just jump further maybe

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.710 
jump higher you just jump further maybe
you<00:05:58.289> can<00:05:58.410> jump<00:05:58.650> slightly<00:05:59.190> higher<00:05:59.400> that<00:06:00.270> might

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
you can jump slightly higher that might

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.690 
you can jump slightly higher that might
break<00:06:01.110> some<00:06:01.500> of<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.740> battleground<00:06:02.370> maps

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
break some of the battleground maps

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.450 
break some of the battleground maps
where<00:06:03.660> like<00:06:03.990> in<00:06:04.200> warsong<00:06:04.530> gulch<00:06:04.590> you<00:06:04.979> might<00:06:05.250> be

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
where like in warsong gulch you might be

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.100 
where like in warsong gulch you might be
able<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.700> jump<00:06:06.090> over<00:06:06.360> something<00:06:06.810> that<00:06:06.960> other

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
able to jump over something that other

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.140 
able to jump over something that other
classes<00:06:07.590> aren't<00:06:07.710> able<00:06:07.860> to<00:06:08.039> jump<00:06:08.370> over<00:06:08.700> but

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
classes aren't able to jump over but

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.659 
classes aren't able to jump over but
they<00:06:09.330> will<00:06:09.479> deal<00:06:09.750> with<00:06:09.930> that<00:06:10.050> somehow<00:06:10.669> all

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
they will deal with that somehow all

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:12.830 
they will deal with that somehow all
right<00:06:11.820> there<00:06:12.060> will<00:06:12.150> be<00:06:12.210> the<00:06:12.360> best<00:06:12.600> for

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
right there will be the best for

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.020 
right there will be the best for
breaking<00:06:13.260> out<00:06:13.380> of<00:06:13.530> maps<00:06:13.800> that's<00:06:14.370> for<00:06:14.850> damn

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
breaking out of maps that's for damn

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.650 
breaking out of maps that's for damn
sure<00:06:15.410> with<00:06:16.410> a<00:06:16.440> double<00:06:16.890> jump<00:06:17.130> but<00:06:17.700> I<00:06:18.030> think<00:06:18.539> they

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
sure with a double jump but I think they

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.540 
sure with a double jump but I think they
just<00:06:18.840> wanted<00:06:19.380> demon<00:06:19.830> hunters<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.400> have

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
something really cool and that's about

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.360 
something really cool and that's about
it<00:06:22.760> alright<00:06:23.760> and<00:06:24.090> in<00:06:24.720> beta<00:06:25.050> our<00:06:25.320> in<00:06:25.590> alpha<00:06:26.070> when

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
it alright and in beta our in alpha when

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.250 
it alright and in beta our in alpha when
people<00:06:26.700> start<00:06:26.970> jumping<00:06:27.419> over<00:06:27.690> things<00:06:27.720> they

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
people start jumping over things they

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.200 
people start jumping over things they
will<00:06:28.620> start<00:06:28.890> patching<00:06:29.220> them<00:06:29.550> up<00:06:29.729> so<00:06:29.910> demon

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
will start patching them up so demon

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.300 
will start patching them up so demon
hunters<00:06:30.510> can<00:06:30.780> do<00:06:30.990> that<00:06:31.260> alright<00:06:31.979> don't<00:06:32.160> worry

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310

about that too much maybe the first
months<00:06:34.800> after<00:06:35.130> release<00:06:35.160> demon<00:06:35.849> hunters<00:06:36.090> will

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
months after release demon hunters will

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.180 
months after release demon hunters will
be<00:06:36.360> jumping<00:06:36.539> over<00:06:37.110> all<00:06:37.349> sorts<00:06:37.710> of<00:06:37.770> things<00:06:37.919> but

few things that I want to mention is a
spectral<00:06:48.180> site<00:06:48.479> which<00:06:48.810> some<00:06:49.050> people<00:06:49.169> think

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
spectral site which some people think

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.170 
spectral site which some people think
it's<00:06:49.620> gonna<00:06:49.740> be<00:06:49.800> overpowered<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:50.699> I<00:06:50.999> don't

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
it's gonna be overpowered and I don't

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.209 
it's gonna be overpowered and I don't
think<00:06:51.360> it's<00:06:51.449> gonna<00:06:51.569> be<00:06:51.659> nearly<00:06:52.349> as<00:06:52.680> overpower

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:53.219 
think it's gonna be nearly as overpower

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:54.800 
think it's gonna be nearly as overpower
these<00:06:53.340> people<00:06:53.669> think<00:06:53.849> it<00:06:54.029> will<00:06:54.210> be<00:06:54.330> it<00:06:54.779> will

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
these people think it will be it will

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.899 
these people think it will be it will
probably<00:06:55.319> have<00:06:55.439> a<00:06:55.469> very<00:06:55.770> long<00:06:55.979> cooldown<00:06:56.279> any

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:56.909 
probably have a very long cooldown any

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.610 
probably have a very long cooldown any
once<00:06:57.270> again<00:06:57.509> make<00:06:57.689> sense<00:06:58.080> for<00:06:58.289> the<00:06:58.379> demon

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
once again make sense for the demon

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.890 
once again make sense for the demon
hunters<00:06:58.979> you<00:06:59.430> deliberately<00:07:00.090> blind<00:07:00.599> yourself

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
hunters you deliberately blind yourself

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.379 
hunters you deliberately blind yourself
so<00:07:01.469> you<00:07:01.560> can<00:07:01.740> see<00:07:02.099> this<00:07:02.279> kind<00:07:02.550> of<00:07:02.729> stuff<00:07:03.120> it'd

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
so you can see this kind of stuff it'd

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.350 
so you can see this kind of stuff it'd
be<00:07:03.479> kind<00:07:03.689> of<00:07:03.749> funny<00:07:04.020> if<00:07:04.110> outside<00:07:04.770> of<00:07:05.009> this

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
be kind of funny if outside of this

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.369 
be kind of funny if outside of this
vision<00:07:06.360> where<00:07:06.569> you<00:07:06.629> can<00:07:06.779> see<00:07:06.960> through<00:07:07.199> walls

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:07.379 
vision where you can see through walls

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.140 
vision where you can see through walls
and<00:07:07.650> started<00:07:08.069> units<00:07:08.370> the<00:07:08.610> screen<00:07:08.849> would<00:07:08.999> just

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
and started units the screen would just

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.580 
and started units the screen would just
be<00:07:09.270> black<00:07:09.539> and<00:07:09.719> you'll<00:07:09.840> be<00:07:09.930> bumping<00:07:10.409> into

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
be black and you'll be bumping into

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.010 
be black and you'll be bumping into
things<00:07:10.740> and<00:07:11.189> then<00:07:11.819> there<00:07:11.969> was<00:07:12.060> the<00:07:12.240> unrivaled

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
things and then there was the unrivaled

things and then there was the unrivaled
mobility<00:07:13.889> yeah<00:07:14.819> really<00:07:15.599> really<00:07:15.979> though<00:07:16.979> we

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
mobility yeah really really though we

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.159 
mobility yeah really really though we
already<00:07:17.669> have<00:07:17.969> warriors<00:07:18.419> which<00:07:18.659> can<00:07:18.870> charge

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.169 
already have warriors which can charge

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:21.110 
already have warriors which can charge
twice<00:07:19.529> they<00:07:19.889> can<00:07:20.039> heroic<00:07:20.430> leap<00:07:20.610> and<00:07:20.789> they<00:07:20.939> can

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
twice they can heroic leap and they can

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.179 
twice they can heroic leap and they can
intervene<00:07:21.539> we<00:07:22.139> have<00:07:22.289> monks<00:07:22.770> that<00:07:22.889> can<00:07:23.039> have

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:23.189 
intervene we have monks that can have

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:25.640 
intervene we have monks that can have
three<00:07:23.610> roles<00:07:23.939> and<00:07:24.270> the<00:07:24.569> flying<00:07:24.810> serpent<00:07:25.409> cake

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
three roles and the flying serpent cake

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.939 
three roles and the flying serpent cake
for<00:07:25.919> wind<00:07:26.099> Walker's<00:07:26.580> yeah<00:07:27.509> I'm<00:07:27.930> not<00:07:28.349> worried

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:28.949 
for wind Walker's yeah I'm not worried

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.769 
for wind Walker's yeah I'm not worried
about<00:07:29.039> it<00:07:29.279> and<00:07:29.849> we<00:07:29.969> have<00:07:30.090> rogues<00:07:30.389> that<00:07:30.629> can

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:30.779 
about it and we have rogues that can

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:33.890 
about it and we have rogues that can
sprint<00:07:31.199> indefinitely<00:07:32.000> and<00:07:33.000> shadow<00:07:33.300> step<00:07:33.629> so

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 
sprint indefinitely and shadow step so

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.839 
sprint indefinitely and shadow step so
then<00:07:34.500> mobility<00:07:34.979> I<00:07:35.250> don't<00:07:35.520> think<00:07:35.550> it's<00:07:35.729> gonna

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:35.849 
then mobility I don't think it's gonna

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:38.209 
then mobility I don't think it's gonna
be<00:07:35.909> that<00:07:36.060> big<00:07:36.449> of<00:07:36.569> a<00:07:36.659> deal<00:07:36.810> honestly<00:07:37.219> that's

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:38.219 
be that big of a deal honestly that's

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:40.070 
be that big of a deal honestly that's
pretty<00:07:38.460> much<00:07:38.580> it<00:07:38.879> for<00:07:39.180> the<00:07:39.569> demon<00:07:39.810> hunters

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
pretty much it for the demon hunters

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.959 
pretty much it for the demon hunters
it's<00:07:40.319> what<00:07:40.439> I<00:07:40.469> think<00:07:40.770> about<00:07:40.860> them<00:07:41.189> what<00:07:41.789> do<00:07:41.909> you

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:41.969 
it's what I think about them what do you

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:43.909 
it's what I think about them what do you
