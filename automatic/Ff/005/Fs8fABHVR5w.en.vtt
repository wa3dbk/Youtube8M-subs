00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
my first my birthing at eleven which is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.680 
my first my birthing at eleven which is
my<00:00:31.410> past<00:00:31.680> session<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.460> past<00:00:32.910> stands<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.420> peer

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
my past session and past stands for peer

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.710 
my past session and past stands for peer
assisted<00:00:34.170> study<00:00:34.379> scheme<00:00:34.800> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.210> scheme

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
assisted study scheme which is a scheme

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.410 
assisted study scheme which is a scheme
that<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.440> designed<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> help<00:00:38.280> people<00:00:38.520> further

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that is designed to help people further

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.850 
that is designed to help people further
their<00:00:39.720> learning<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.199> long<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.650> thing

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
their learning as long as the over thing

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.080 
their learning as long as the over thing
that<00:00:41.040> people<00:00:41.160> don't<00:00:41.400> understand<00:00:41.879> from

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that people don't understand from

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
that people don't understand from
lectures<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.900> it's<00:00:43.199> run<00:00:43.590> by<00:00:43.620> second<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
lectures and it's run by second and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130 
lectures and it's run by second and
third<00:00:44.400> years<00:00:44.699> and<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.750> sort<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> do

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
third years and so they sort of do

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.330 
third years and so they sort of do
things<00:00:46.290> in<00:00:46.440> different<00:00:46.470> ways<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.190> might<00:00:47.280> be

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
things in different ways so it might be

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.939 
things in different ways so it might be
through<00:00:47.580> a<00:00:47.640> game<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.590> sitting

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
through a game or just through sitting

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.110 
through a game or just through sitting
down<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> explaining<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> slightly

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
down and explaining in a slightly

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.119 
down and explaining in a slightly
different<00:00:51.330> way<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> really<00:00:52.800> good<00:00:52.949> way

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
different way and it's a really good way

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.280 
different way and it's a really good way
of<00:00:53.160> consolidating<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:54.059> knowledge<00:00:54.449> while

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
of consolidating your knowledge while

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.590 
of consolidating your knowledge while
the<00:00:55.440> poskim<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.250> basically<00:00:56.730> tried<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.120> help

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the poskim is basically tried to help

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.040 
the poskim is basically tried to help
them<00:00:58.820> get<00:00:59.820> used<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> university<00:01:00.870> life

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
them get used to the university life

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.810 
them get used to the university life
because<00:01:01.739> after<00:01:02.100> high<00:01:02.250> school<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.760> very

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
because after high school it's very

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.719 
because after high school it's very
important<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.750> used<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.190> how<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.580> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
important to get used to how to be in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060 
important to get used to how to be in
uni<00:01:06.119> how<00:01:06.539> to<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.899> lectures<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
uni how to go to lectures like what to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.400 
uni how to go to lectures like what to
do<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.490> general<00:01:08.940> basically<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.200> do

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
do in general basically and so you do

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.810 
do in general basically and so you do
feel<00:01:10.440> like<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> ask<00:01:11.160> questions<00:01:11.310> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
feel like you can ask questions and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
feel like you can ask questions and
everyone<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.360> gets<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.600> know<00:01:12.690> each<00:01:12.810> other

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
everyone really gets to know each other

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.080 
everyone really gets to know each other
and<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.550> laugh<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.970> everyone

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and you can have a laugh with everyone

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.310 
and you can have a laugh with everyone
oh<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.810> second<00:01:16.050> or<00:01:16.140> third<00:01:16.289> year

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
oh because it's second or third year

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
oh because it's second or third year
they<00:01:16.649> feel<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.220> peers<00:01:17.460> rather<00:01:17.820> than

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
they feel that your peers rather than

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.930 
they feel that your peers rather than
like<00:01:18.270> teachers<00:01:18.750> those<00:01:19.470> people<00:01:20.039> who<00:01:20.399> did<00:01:20.670> pass

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
like teachers those people who did pass

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.150 
like teachers those people who did pass
who<00:01:21.119> attended<00:01:21.539> passed<00:01:21.840> almost<00:01:22.259> every<00:01:22.979> week

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
who attended passed almost every week

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.690 
who attended passed almost every week
didn't<00:01:23.970> tend<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> take<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.990> reset<00:01:25.440> because<00:01:25.770> post

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
didn't tend to take a reset because post

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.570 
didn't tend to take a reset because post
actually<00:01:26.970> does<00:01:27.420> help<00:01:27.750> cause<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:29.160> not<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.550> a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
actually does help cause it's not like a

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.910 
actually does help cause it's not like a
lecture<00:01:29.849> it's<00:01:30.240> more<00:01:30.509> about<00:01:30.780> learning<00:01:31.229> with

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lecture it's more about learning with

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
lecture it's more about learning with
other<00:01:32.160> people<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.660> twelve<00:01:34.050> after<00:01:34.349> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
other people then twelve after a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.580 
other people then twelve after a
biodiversity<00:01:34.950> lecture<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:37.380> at<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
biodiversity lecture and so at the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.730 
biodiversity lecture and so at the
moment<00:01:37.740> we're<00:01:38.039> doing<00:01:38.340> eukaryotes<00:01:39.740> we're

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
moment we're doing eukaryotes we're

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.650 
moment we're doing eukaryotes we're
still<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.130> sort<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.490> very<00:01:42.090> very<00:01:42.330> primitive

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
still on sort of very very primitive

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.230 
still on sort of very very primitive
organisms<00:01:43.080> at<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.709> moment<00:01:44.069> and<00:01:44.640> looking<00:01:45.149> at

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
organisms at the moment and looking at

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.820 
organisms at the moment and looking at
how<00:01:45.360> they<00:01:45.479> interact<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> ecosystem<00:01:46.740> as

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
how they interact with the ecosystem as

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.400 
how they interact with the ecosystem as
well<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.069> how<00:01:47.220> they're<00:01:47.399> important<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> us<00:01:48.410> okay

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
well as how they're important to us okay

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.050 
well as how they're important to us okay
so<00:01:49.440> it's<00:01:49.890> two<00:01:50.099> o'clock<00:01:50.250> now<00:01:50.550> which<00:01:50.759> means<00:01:50.880> I'm

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so it's two o'clock now which means I'm

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
so it's two o'clock now which means I'm
just<00:01:51.090> about<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> start<00:01:51.509> my<00:01:51.720> lab<00:01:51.929> session<00:01:52.410> today

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just about to start my lab session today

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.070 
just about to start my lab session today
we're<00:01:53.220> looking<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.179> absorbance<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> UV

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
we're looking at the absorbance of UV

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.580 
we're looking at the absorbance of UV
light<00:01:55.110> by<00:01:55.440> vitamin<00:01:55.739> b12<00:01:56.599> so<00:01:57.599> at<00:01:57.929> the<00:01:58.050> moment<00:01:58.470> we

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
light by vitamin b12 so at the moment we

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.100 
light by vitamin b12 so at the moment we
are<00:01:58.739> preparing<00:01:59.550> standard<00:02:00.420> solutions<00:02:00.959> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
are preparing standard solutions of

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
are preparing standard solutions of
vitamin<00:02:01.470> b12<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:02.459> we're<00:02:02.580> doing<00:02:02.819> is<00:02:02.910> we're

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
vitamin b12 what we're doing is we're

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.430 
vitamin b12 what we're doing is we're
diluting<00:02:03.209> this<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.929> is<00:02:03.989> our<00:02:04.200> stock

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
diluting this so this is our stock

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.520 
diluting this so this is our stock
solution<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.250> we'll<00:02:06.239> be<00:02:06.450> diluting<00:02:06.989> it<00:02:07.110> with

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
solution and we'll be diluting it with

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.969 
solution and we'll be diluting it with
water<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:09.119> an<00:02:09.300> automatic<00:02:09.899> repair<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
water this is an automatic repair so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.780 
water this is an automatic repair so
rather<00:02:11.459> than<00:02:11.730> having<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> measurements<00:02:12.540> on

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
rather than having the measurements on

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.819 
rather than having the measurements on
sighs<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.510> having<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.900> manually<00:02:14.200> squeeze<00:02:14.590> it

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
sighs and having to manually squeeze it

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.589 
sighs and having to manually squeeze it
it<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.549> makes<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.909> more<00:02:16.030> accurate<00:02:16.480> because

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
it just makes it more accurate because

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.899 
it just makes it more accurate because
it<00:02:16.719> you<00:02:17.290> put<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.950> value<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.579> you<00:02:18.700> want

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
it you put in the value that you want

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.240 
it you put in the value that you want
here<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.349> crank<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.859> and<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.159> will

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
here and you crank it and that will

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.849 
here and you crank it and that will
change<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.730> value<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.409> makes<00:02:23.620> sure<00:02:23.709> that

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
change the value so it makes sure that

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.069 
change the value so it makes sure that
your<00:02:24.370> pathetic<00:02:24.939> is<00:02:25.060> really<00:02:25.269> accurate<00:02:25.420> whereas

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
your pathetic is really accurate whereas

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.020 
your pathetic is really accurate whereas
if<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.439> try<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.680> use<00:02:26.769> one<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.010> these<00:02:27.219> you<00:02:27.849> have

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
if you try and use one of these you have

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.149 
if you try and use one of these you have
to<00:02:28.180> squeeze<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.629> manually<00:02:28.989> so<00:02:29.290> obviously<00:02:30.010> it's

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
to squeeze it manually so obviously it's

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.949 
to squeeze it manually so obviously it's
really<00:02:30.220> easy<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.670> get<00:02:30.879> it<00:02:30.970> wrong<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.569> machine

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
really easy to get it wrong this machine

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.080 
really easy to get it wrong this machine
is<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.290> spectrophotometer<00:02:32.890> which<00:02:33.519> sounds<00:02:34.060> very

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
is a spectrophotometer which sounds very

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.240 
is a spectrophotometer which sounds very
posh<00:02:34.510> but<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.230> basically<00:02:35.349> measures<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
posh but it basically measures the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.800 
posh but it basically measures the
absorbance<00:02:36.849> of<00:02:36.909> light<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:37.569> there's<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
absorbance of light so if there's a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.000 
absorbance of light so if there's a
little<00:02:38.079> it'll<00:02:38.319> shoot<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.650> beam<00:02:38.799> of<00:02:38.980> light

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
little it'll shoot a beam of light

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.690 
little it'll shoot a beam of light
through<00:02:39.159> there

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
through there

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.920 
through there
and<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.120> measure<00:02:40.269> how<00:02:40.450> much<00:02:40.599> comes<00:02:40.840> out

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
and it will measure how much comes out

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.709 
and it will measure how much comes out
the<00:02:41.079> other<00:02:41.200> side<00:02:41.379> right<00:02:42.340> now<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.579> am<00:02:43.120> plotting

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
the other side right now I am plotting

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.720 
the other side right now I am plotting
the<00:02:44.230> graph<00:02:44.439> of<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.829> results<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.310> we<00:02:45.459> just

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
the graph of the results that we just

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.970 
the graph of the results that we just
gathered<00:02:46.150> okay<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:47.379> five<00:02:47.530> o'clock<00:02:47.680> now

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
gathered okay so it's five o'clock now

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.619 
gathered okay so it's five o'clock now
and<00:02:48.159> I've<00:02:48.220> just<00:02:48.250> finished<00:02:48.579> my<00:02:48.790> labs<00:02:49.060> I've<00:02:49.450> had

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
and I've just finished my labs I've had

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.390 
and I've just finished my labs I've had
a<00:02:49.659> really<00:02:49.900> really<00:02:49.989> good<00:02:50.230> day<00:02:50.409> pass<00:02:50.709> was<00:02:50.980> really

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
a really really good day pass was really

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.879 
a really really good day pass was really
really<00:02:51.700> helpful<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.810> I'm<00:02:53.139> off<00:02:53.290> home<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:53.680> and

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
really helpful so I'm off home now and

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.780 
really helpful so I'm off home now and
I'll<00:02:53.980> see<00:02:54.129> you<00:02:54.250> all<00:02:54.280> tomorrow<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:57.040> German<00:02:57.609> is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
I'll see you all tomorrow but German is

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.339 
I'll see you all tomorrow but German is
twice<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.419> think<00:02:58.659> you<00:02:58.750> know<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.930> origin<00:02:59.290> of

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
twice I think you know the origin of

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:14.059 
twice I think you know the origin of
speed<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.829> approaching<00:03:00.459> somebody<00:03:00.849> else

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.129 

you
