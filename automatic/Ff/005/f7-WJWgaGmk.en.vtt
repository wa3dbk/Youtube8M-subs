00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
this we're just in fact I can pretty

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.370 
this we're just in fact I can pretty
much<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.520> sprinkle<00:02:17.730> both<00:02:18.060> sides

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
much just going to sprinkle both sides

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.990 
much just going to sprinkle both sides
so<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> gets<00:02:19.590> pretty<00:02:19.830> even<00:02:20.280> coating<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:23.000> it's

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
so it gets pretty even coating here it's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.070 
so it gets pretty even coating here it's
not<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.480> hard<00:02:24.690> honestly<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.770> then<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:30.080> have

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
not that hard honestly and then I have

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.900 
not that hard honestly and then I have
just<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.880> teensy<00:02:32.880> little<00:02:33.540> Pyrex<00:02:34.530> Bowl<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:35.880> can

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
just a teensy little Pyrex Bowl we can

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.200 
just a teensy little Pyrex Bowl we can
just<00:02:36.270> transfer<00:02:36.990> this<00:02:37.290> into<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.790> some<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
just transfer this into to some of the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:47.750 
just transfer this into to some of the
breadcrumbs<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:41.540> for<00:02:42.540> show<00:02:46.760> and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
breadcrumbs with it just for show and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.490 
breadcrumbs with it just for show and

make sure you wash your hands I wash my

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.900 
make sure you wash your hands I wash my
hands<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.770> five<00:02:49.980> seconds<00:02:50.370> before<00:02:50.640> doing

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
hands like five seconds before doing

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.900 
hands like five seconds before doing
this<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> also<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.460> a<00:02:53.520> little<00:02:53.670> bit<00:02:53.880> of

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
this so also I like a little bit of

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.100 
this so also I like a little bit of
pepper<00:02:54.350> on<00:02:55.350> here<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.970> doesn't<00:02:57.330> really<00:02:57.630> need<00:02:57.900> it

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
pepper on here it doesn't really need it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.810 
pepper on here it doesn't really need it

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820
