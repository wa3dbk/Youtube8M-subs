00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.629
 mortals as they are talking 607 a 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.490
 spectacular new epic adventure here 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.700
 in the blue team with this demand that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.590
 I do not know how he got here in Taiwan 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.900
 you know if you did not see my past video that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.510
 we won a game to the very shabby 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.130
 we could say it but we won it not you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.960
 miss this game either and look at the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 So, obviously, this is going to be 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.500
 an epic game since we have improved 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 a little bit more but we still follow 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 being a cloud because in my third 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.779
 split so please stone in those 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.690
 stone comments please stone 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.739
 I ask them and this starts at 21 and the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.210
 transportation is op 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.380
 as you already know for those who do not know 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.090
 is that you have to protect 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.850
 our beds that will be our 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.680
 respawn if we protect it and we achieve it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.539
 let's show up so it does not matter that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.070
 kill us sometimes we will appear to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.539
 session that the game becomes something 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.969
 that has already happened to me a couple of times 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.579
 in my first video and it only takes you 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.020
 with falling and good is with telling you that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.059
 given a little bit of the high good here 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.129
 let's get more little things we're going to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.390
 get more stones we are going to get 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.489
 more blocks to get to the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.890
 next idea in a quick and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.540
 efficient to get to see we're going to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.010
 see let's put our block 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.720
 we are going to do a little way so to all 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.110
 speed now at full speed thousand 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.960
 hour 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.560
 for now everything depends on your team 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560
 it depends on you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.830
 well there we throw ourselves 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.830
 no please 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.850
 we get to the other we do not have nine no 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.430
 I know if we arrive I think they are needed 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.080
 minimum days to get good we go 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.850
 let's continue on average and continue 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.850
 waiting for the chest to be recharged 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.050
 let's go let's ride face 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.509
 good mortals let's continue here the 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.100
 adventure let's go on we have more things 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.470
 and now we are going to recharge we were going to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.780
 buy things and we will buy what 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.250
 It is mostly iron sword already 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.140
 what I wanted was what I wanted was my 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.330
 dream come true and let's put our 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.830
 iron sword and we are going to catch 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.990
 the good iron here a player finished 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.520
 to build good ends I finished you 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 to build let the blue team 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.210
 this time if he wins something he tells me this 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.840
 hunch that if you win and how you want 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.390
 have a good arch there I would throw them 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.950
 good mental let's continue let's continue 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.840
 that there has been a lot of drama a lot of suspense 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.180
 in these games and I do not know what happens to me but 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 thank you very much a little bit so there's 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.090
 that continue the adventure you have to 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.410
 continue and our team has already done 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.090
 a bridge almost up and we're already 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.800
 practically colonizing the island of in 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.800
 you have to be very careful because 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.489
 If someone takes me, it's going to be my end 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.989
 that we take the blocks quickly and let's go 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.090
 let's go let's go there is nobody there is no 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.470
 nobody is nobody nobody so there is a 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.030
 team where we do not where I am 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.370

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.640
 little memory and memory and memory 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.660

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.410

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.930
 of the good guys how to destroy that 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.910
 ready ready let's stay changing 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.950
 we have a partner luckily we are 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.090
 three so everyone is here we go 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.590
 over here 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.629
 If I can destroy the green base , let's go 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.010
 to destroy the first base as they can 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.940
 seeing is a very long game the truth is 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:01.480
 very long game but while it is a 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:08.319
 company that came between the door by 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.760
 please please and we die we die 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.030
 it matters but as I said in the clyfc 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.620
 there's again we're stuck here 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.169
 good, I 'm going to take the video 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.150
 let him get out of here deadly good ya 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.400
 we came out here from the video so we're going to 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.660
 keep taking more things and people 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.010
 I think he has the problem and my island 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.389
 because they have just put a lot already 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.740
 they are only blue worlds the 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.540
 rest I do not know why our bed is 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.100
 but we learned that the chakras that 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.290
 the game should correct those little ones 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.370
 bugs and errors that it has what it is to see 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.340
 same but it follows me for me it's a 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.539
 the truth is not very long and for 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.780
 those who have problems entering 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.430
 green 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.990
 stress on the green posters but not 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.639
 those that are empty only from in 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.560
 you will see that some greens 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.720
 obviously they will not be able to enter I do not know 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.610
 what but they are errors but when there is already 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.129
 a poster with more than five people 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.139
 from 6 to 16 you are the 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.479
 time indicated that much cluttering 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.069
 because he thinks it's a challenge to almost enter 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.780
 these servers for those who have 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.000
 I tried the truth I apologize 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.889
 but unfortunately it is the only server 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.560
 I know maybe there will be more but 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.050
 good things that as it is very good 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.210
 there are many people also then where 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.830
 the important thing is that I tried to try 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.050
 I tried and can enjoy this adventure 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.520
 eye do not get into the greens that do not 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.930
 they have players because the only thing they 're going 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.099
 to be going to wait as well as giles and 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.370
 they will never be charged of the world 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:30.250
 delivery those who have 5 up 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.389
 of losing the green posters obviously 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.770
 that the red ones are the posters that already 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.139
 have started and the orange ones are the 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.729
 who has taken out the registration can 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.169
 masters serves in the inscription and good and 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.090
 as I see, my team has left me 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.389
 I'm just one so try to defend 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.330
 my blue base i just do spartan i do 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.710
 exports to the 300 Spartans good 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.560
 but I'm not going to advance 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.330
 a lot because I do not think it lasts long 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.979
 in truth, you do not like me either 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.080
 they will fall from 3 and I will not be able to do 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.699
 a lot unfortunately until here I leave the 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.279
 video thanks for watching this video 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.340

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.639

 you can see a lot of fun watching 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:15.520
 My videos look how I suffer when I can 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:19.389
 I suscribe what a fool he takes that is 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:24.570
