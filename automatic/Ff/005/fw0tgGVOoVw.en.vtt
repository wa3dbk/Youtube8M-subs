remember<00:01:10.610> in<00:01:10.820> Africa<00:01:11.600> you<00:01:11.810> can<00:01:11.930> buy

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
remember in Africa you can buy

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.350 
remember in Africa you can buy
headphones<00:01:12.650> for<00:01:12.950> as<00:01:13.220> little<00:01:13.790> as<00:01:14.090> $1<00:01:14.900> apiece

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
headphones for as little as $1 apiece

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.060 
headphones for as little as $1 apiece
now<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.420> first<00:01:17.720> step<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.260> cut<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.619> earbuds

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
now the first step is to cut the earbuds

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.160 
now the first step is to cut the earbuds
off<00:01:19.280> of<00:01:19.640> all<00:01:19.969> the<00:01:20.179> headphones<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:20.929> have

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
off of all the headphones that you have

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.069 
off of all the headphones that you have
so<00:01:21.859> you<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.549> cable<00:01:23.090> with<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.659> phono

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
so you just have a cable with the phono

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:32.230 
so you just have a cable with the phono
plug<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.770> tap<00:01:28.600> here<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.780> will<00:01:29.929> see<00:01:30.109> I<00:01:30.140> cut<00:01:31.240> ear

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
plug a tap here you will see I cut ear

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.419 
plug a tap here you will see I cut ear
bud<00:01:32.539> off<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:32.929> now<00:01:33.499> you<00:01:35.079> slice<00:01:36.079> very<00:01:36.890> carefully

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
bud off and now you slice very carefully

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.859 
bud off and now you slice very carefully
so<00:01:40.429> there<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.759> can<00:01:40.969> pull<00:01:41.179> off<00:01:41.359> the<00:01:41.390> rubber

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
so there you can pull off the rubber

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.719 
so there you can pull off the rubber
casing<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.880> expose<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.569> wire<00:01:44.810> inside<00:01:45.729> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
casing and expose the wire inside the

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.969 
casing and expose the wire inside the
next<00:01:46.999> step<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> complete<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.109> process<00:01:48.409> on

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
next step is to complete this process on

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.969 
next step is to complete this process on
every<00:01:49.700> wire<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.329> both<00:01:50.590> pairs<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.859> your

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
every wire on both pairs of your

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.130 
every wire on both pairs of your
headphones<00:01:52.490> now<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:52.939> will<00:01:53.210> have<00:01:53.359> two<00:01:53.810> wires

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
headphones now you will have two wires

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.989 
headphones now you will have two wires
for<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.530> headphone<00:01:54.950> jack<00:01:54.979> at<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.700> end<00:01:55.880> of

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
for the headphone jack at the end of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.999 
for the headphone jack at the end of
each<00:01:56.149> now<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:56.749> will<00:01:56.990> begin<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.380> process<00:01:57.619> of

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
each now you will begin the process of

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.980 
each now you will begin the process of
twisting<00:01:58.549> together<00:01:58.670> each<00:01:59.119> matching<00:01:59.539> wire

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
twisting together each matching wire

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.289 
twisting together each matching wire
from<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.249> two<00:02:01.700> different<00:02:02.359> cables

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
from the two different cables

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.550 
from the two different cables
remember<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:05.450> are<00:02:05.479> splicing<00:02:06.020> together<00:02:06.170> right

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
remember you are splicing together right

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.910 
remember you are splicing together right
and<00:02:06.799> left<00:02:07.039> side<00:02:07.249> audio<00:02:07.840> channels<00:02:08.840> or<00:02:09.140> cables

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
and left side audio channels or cables

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.040 
and left side audio channels or cables
it<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:10.580> therefore<00:02:10.789> helpful<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.510> keep<00:02:11.720> track<00:02:12.020> of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
it is therefore helpful to keep track of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.920 
it is therefore helpful to keep track of
which<00:02:12.470> wire<00:02:12.740> is<00:02:12.770> which<00:02:13.040> before<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.450> begin<00:02:14.780> the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
which wire is which before you begin the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.140 
which wire is which before you begin the
cutting<00:02:15.290> process

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390 

after<00:02:19.150> twisting<00:02:19.659> together<00:02:20.019> each<00:02:20.290> wire<00:02:20.650> you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
after twisting together each wire you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.479 
after twisting together each wire you
should<00:02:21.640> use<00:02:21.909> some<00:02:22.599> type<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:23.049> notes<00:02:23.230> tape

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
should use some type of notes tape

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.330 
should use some type of notes tape
whether<00:02:25.150> electrical<00:02:25.930> tape<00:02:26.170> or<00:02:26.439> whatever<00:02:27.010> kind

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
whether electrical tape or whatever kind

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.339
