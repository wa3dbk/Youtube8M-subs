00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.810 

our<00:01:25.240> Manette's<00:01:25.810> partners<00:01:26.200> together<00:01:26.350> are

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
our Manette's partners together are

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.130 
our Manette's partners together are
perfectly<00:01:27.820> positioned<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.630> technology

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
perfectly positioned in the technology

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.690 
perfectly positioned in the technology
space<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.470> technology<00:01:33.040> space<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.400> so

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
space but the technology space is so

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.240 
space but the technology space is so
complicated<00:01:34.090> these<00:01:34.600> days<00:01:34.870> that<00:01:35.680> no<00:01:35.950> one

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
complicated these days that no one

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.730 
complicated these days that no one
company<00:01:36.550> can<00:01:37.060> do<00:01:37.210> everything<00:01:37.690> on<00:01:38.110> its<00:01:38.260> own<00:01:38.440> and

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
company can do everything on its own and

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100 
company can do everything on its own and
so<00:01:39.310> this<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:39.760> all<00:01:39.940> about<00:01:40.210> collaboration<00:01:41.050> and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
so this is all about collaboration and

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.050 
so this is all about collaboration and
partnership<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.800> over<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.700> last<00:01:42.880> two

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
partnership and over the last two

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.720 
partnership and over the last two
decades<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.350> evolved<00:01:44.800> into<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.310> arms

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
decades this is evolved into one of arms

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:55.200 
decades this is evolved into one of arms
core<00:01:46.180> competences

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.510 

we<00:01:55.750> see<00:01:55.990> tremendous<00:01:56.230> opportunities<00:01:56.710> as

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
we see tremendous opportunities as

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.000 
we see tremendous opportunities as
communications<00:01:58.300> evolve<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:58.900> advance<00:01:59.440> over

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
communications evolve and advance over

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.790 
communications evolve and advance over
the<00:02:00.160> next<00:02:00.400> decade<00:02:00.760> armed<00:02:01.690> technology<00:02:02.530> and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
the next decade armed technology and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.280 
the next decade armed technology and
energy<00:02:03.460> efficient<00:02:03.910> technology<00:02:04.420> make<00:02:05.050> that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
energy efficient technology make that

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:16.120 
energy efficient technology make that
sort<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.650> thing<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.100> reality
