00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
this video I'm going to show you how to

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.270 
this video I'm going to show you how to
replace<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.550> wheel<00:00:03.480> bearings<00:00:03.899> brakes<00:00:05.240> rotors

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
replace the wheel bearings brakes rotors

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.759 
replace the wheel bearings brakes rotors
and<00:00:08.280> grease<00:00:08.670> seal<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.150> dust<00:00:09.360> cap<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:09.900> my<00:00:10.110> 2001

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
and grease seal and dust cap on my 2001

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
3 litre two-wheel drive Ranger the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.730 
3 litre two-wheel drive Ranger the
reason<00:00:14.580> I'm<00:00:14.670> replacing<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.379> wheel<00:00:16.379> bearing

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
reason I'm replacing the wheel bearing

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.269 
reason I'm replacing the wheel bearing
is<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.930> getting<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.260> clunking<00:00:20.070> noises

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
is because getting some clunking noises

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.550 
is because getting some clunking noises
I<00:00:20.760> already<00:00:21.029> replaced<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.779> ball<00:00:21.960> joints<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
I already replaced the ball joints and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.410 
I already replaced the ball joints and
the<00:00:23.220> sway<00:00:23.400> bar<00:00:23.609> links<00:00:23.880> within<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> past

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the sway bar links within the past

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.990 
the sway bar links within the past
couple<00:00:24.539> years<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.640> haven't<00:00:26.640> driven<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
couple years and haven't driven that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.550 
couple years and haven't driven that
many<00:00:27.180> miles<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:27.750> pretty<00:00:27.869> sure<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
many miles so I'm pretty sure it's the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.980 
many miles so I'm pretty sure it's the
wheel<00:00:28.800> bearing<00:00:29.070> that's<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> problem

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
wheel bearing that's the problem

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.190 
wheel bearing that's the problem
so<00:00:30.990> pop<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.610> cap<00:00:32.610> off<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.180> take<00:00:33.719> off<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> lug

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
so pop the cap off and take off the lug

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.319 
so pop the cap off and take off the lug
nuts<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> lug<00:00:35.670> nuts<00:00:35.850> off<00:00:36.000> take

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
nuts if you get the lug nuts off take

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.229 
nuts if you get the lug nuts off take
the<00:00:36.450> wheel<00:00:36.600> off<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:37.710> you'll<00:00:37.890> see

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
the wheel off this is what you'll see

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.940 
the wheel off this is what you'll see
then<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> remove<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> two<00:00:40.230> caliper

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
then you want to remove the two caliper

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.650

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that's what it looks like with the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
that's what it looks like with the
caliper<00:00:52.379> off<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.520> slide<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> brake

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:05.910 
like the end of your socket wrench or
something<00:02:04.869> down<00:02:04.989> inside<00:02:05.319> the<00:02:05.440> hole<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.830> then

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
something down inside the hole and then

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.130 
something down inside the hole and then
just<00:02:06.160> beat<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:07.270> out<00:02:07.390> with<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.569> hammer<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.959> comes

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
just beat it out with a hammer it comes

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.350 
just beat it out with a hammer it comes
out<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.319> lot<00:02:08.500> easier<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.979> way<00:02:09.129> there's<00:02:10.119> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
out a lot easier that way there's the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.640 
out a lot easier that way there's the
inner<00:02:10.539> bearing<00:02:10.959> which<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.379> bigger<00:02:11.560> one

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
inner bearing which is the bigger one

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.430 
inner bearing which is the bigger one
and<00:02:12.040> then<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.220> inner<00:02:12.370> grease<00:02:12.760> seal<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:14.290> you're

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
and then the inner grease seal if you're

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.259 
and then the inner grease seal if you're
going<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.680> reuse<00:02:14.890> these<00:02:15.400> I'd<00:02:15.790> recommend

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
going to reuse these I'd recommend

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.710 
going to reuse these I'd recommend
getting<00:02:16.450> all<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.870> grease<00:02:17.110> off<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.530> them<00:02:17.709> and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
getting all the grease off of them and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.509 
getting all the grease off of them and
repack<00:02:19.720> them<00:02:19.989> I'll<00:02:20.260> show<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.010> how<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.160> do<00:02:21.340> that

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
repack them I'll show you how to do that

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.490 
repack them I'll show you how to do that
when<00:02:21.849> I<00:02:21.879> pack<00:02:22.330> my<00:02:22.360> new<00:02:22.629> bearings<00:02:22.959> now<00:02:23.440> I'm

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
when I pack my new bearings now I'm

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.780 
when I pack my new bearings now I'm
going<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> clean<00:02:23.860> up<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.099> spindle<00:02:24.459> with<00:02:24.489> some

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
going to clean up the spindle with some

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.660 
going to clean up the spindle with some
carb<00:02:25.030> cleaner<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:26.200> wipe<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.560> down<00:02:26.620> real<00:02:26.980> well

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.630 

next<00:02:30.670> time<00:02:30.760> I'll<00:02:30.879> clean<00:02:31.060> up<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.330> new<00:02:31.450> rotor

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
next time I'll clean up the new rotor

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.790 
next time I'll clean up the new rotor
there<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.879> some<00:02:34.450> nasty<00:02:34.660> grime<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.379> is<00:02:35.500> brand

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
there is some nasty grime this is brand

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.059 
there is some nasty grime this is brand
new<00:02:35.890> there's<00:02:36.730> already<00:02:36.910> some<00:02:37.860> metal<00:02:38.860> shavings

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
new there's already some metal shavings

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.820 
new there's already some metal shavings
in<00:02:39.310> there<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.519> need<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.760> be<00:02:39.790> cleaned<00:02:40.120> out<00:02:40.830> if

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
in there that need to be cleaned out if

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.949 
in there that need to be cleaned out if
you<00:02:41.980> don't<00:02:42.129> clean<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.519> out<00:02:42.670> then<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.870> going

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
you don't clean that out then it's going

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.440 
you don't clean that out then it's going
to<00:02:44.050> ruin<00:02:44.230> your<00:02:44.409> spindle<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.950> your<00:02:45.040> new<00:02:45.129> brakes

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
to ruin your spindle and your new brakes

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.360 
to ruin your spindle and your new brakes
so<00:02:46.450> make<00:02:46.659> sure<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.900> clean<00:02:47.260> that<00:02:47.349> out<00:02:47.409> with<00:02:47.890> a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
so make sure you clean that out with a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.250 
so make sure you clean that out with a
carb<00:02:49.150> cleaner<00:02:49.269> or<00:02:49.569> brake<00:02:49.750> cleaner<00:02:49.989> or

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
carb cleaner or brake cleaner or

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.059 
carb cleaner or brake cleaner or
something<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.769> that

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
something like that

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.800 
something like that
and<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:52.090> I'm<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.330> repack<00:02:52.659> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and then I'm going to repack the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.290 
and then I'm going to repack the
bearings<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.260> reinstall<00:02:53.709> them<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.209> is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
bearings and reinstall them so this is

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.850 
bearings and reinstall them so this is
how<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.420> bearing<00:02:55.750> comes<00:02:55.989> comes<00:02:56.650> with<00:02:56.800> an

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
how the bearing comes comes with an

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.410 
how the bearing comes comes with an
extra<00:02:57.099> piece<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.730> that's<00:02:57.909> not<00:02:58.060> needed

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
extra piece on it that's not needed

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.649 
extra piece on it that's not needed
which<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.349> bearing<00:02:59.620> sits<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:01.330> bearing<00:03:01.599> is

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
which the bearing sits in the bearing is

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.360 
which the bearing sits in the bearing is
going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> fit<00:03:02.019> right<00:03:02.050> in<00:03:02.230> here<00:03:02.620> like<00:03:03.129> this

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
going to fit right in here like this

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.949 
going to fit right in here like this
make<00:03:03.819> sure<00:03:03.849> you<00:03:04.030> have<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.269> hole<00:03:04.480> cleaned<00:03:04.780> out

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
make sure you have that hole cleaned out

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.270 
make sure you have that hole cleaned out
and<00:03:05.200> then<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.409> bearing<00:03:05.650> swivels<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.129> there

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and then the bearing swivels in there

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.489 
and then the bearing swivels in there
like<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.629> then<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.780> grease<00:03:07.989> seal<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.349> going

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:08.499 
like that then the grease seal is going

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.649 
like that then the grease seal is going
to<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:08.799> top<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:10.090> if<00:03:10.329> you<00:03:10.510> have<00:03:10.629> a

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
to go on top like that if you have a

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.300 
to go on top like that if you have a
socket<00:03:10.989> that's<00:03:11.319> big<00:03:11.499> enough<00:03:11.530> get<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.040> that's

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
socket that's big enough get one that's

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.550 
socket that's big enough get one that's
big<00:03:12.520> as<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.910> set<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:13.930> there<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.200> then<00:03:14.319> tap

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
big as that set it on there and then tap

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.020 
big as that set it on there and then tap
it<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.770> with<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.980> hammer<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.520> goes<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.880> nice

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
it in with the hammer so it goes in nice

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.790 
it in with the hammer so it goes in nice
and<00:03:16.239> evenly<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:17.080> just<00:03:17.110> make<00:03:17.560> sure<00:03:17.709> you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
and evenly if not just make sure you

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.210 
and evenly if not just make sure you
don't<00:03:17.890> bend<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.280> when<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.520> install<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:20.220> and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
don't bend it when you install it and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.710 
don't bend it when you install it and
this<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.610> how<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:23.560> can<00:03:23.709> pack<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.099> barrel

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
this is how you can pack the barrel

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.150 
this is how you can pack the barrel
basically<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:25.900> group<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.530> bunch<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:26.950> stuff

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
basically just group a bunch this stuff

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.449 
basically just group a bunch this stuff
right<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.489> your<00:03:27.550> hand<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.950> then<00:03:30.099> just<00:03:30.130> pack

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
right in your hand and then just pack

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.890 
right in your hand and then just pack
the<00:03:30.640> bearing<00:03:30.910> down<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.090> top<00:03:31.390> of<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.660> like<00:03:31.810> that

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.230 

go<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:38.050> do<00:03:38.170> bullpens<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:39.490> pack<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.880> stuff<00:03:40.090> in

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
go on do bullpens just pack the stuff in

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.040 
go on do bullpens just pack the stuff in
there<00:03:40.390> is<00:03:40.420> what<00:03:40.660> best<00:03:40.990> you<00:03:41.140> can

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
there is what best you can

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.630 
there is what best you can
once<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.260> grease<00:03:44.710> starts<00:03:45.040> coming<00:03:45.370> out<00:03:45.490> the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
once the grease starts coming out the

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.250 
once the grease starts coming out the
other<00:03:45.790> side<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.450> wheels<00:03:46.690> that's<00:03:47.080> how<00:03:47.200> you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
other side of the wheels that's how you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.600 
other side of the wheels that's how you
know<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.500> got<00:03:47.620> enough<00:03:47.920> grease<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.340> there<00:03:48.460> it's

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
know you got enough grease in there it's

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.650 
know you got enough grease in there it's
made<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.850> all<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> way<00:03:49.150> through<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.600> then

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
made it all the way through and then

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.880 
made it all the way through and then
you're<00:03:49.780> going<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.930> want<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.230> spin<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.740> few

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
you're going to want to spin it a few

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.350 
you're going to want to spin it a few
times<00:03:51.040> after<00:03:51.460> you<00:03:51.490> get<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:51.910> there<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:52.270> that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
times after you get it in there so that

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.190 
times after you get it in there so that
it<00:03:52.480> doesn't<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.810> weight<00:03:53.020> of<00:03:53.050> the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
it doesn't have the weight of the

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.559 
it doesn't have the weight of the
vehicle<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.740> it

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.479 

I'm<00:04:01.290> actually<00:04:01.440> going<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.739> use<00:04:01.800> that<00:04:02.129> extra

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
I'm actually going to use that extra

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.979 
I'm actually going to use that extra
piece<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.879> bearing<00:04:03.180> came<00:04:03.360> with<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.750> set<00:04:03.900> it

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
piece the bearing came with and set it

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.199 
piece the bearing came with and set it
right<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.230> top<00:04:04.379> of<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.739> grease<00:04:05.700> seal<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.120> then

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
right on top of the grease seal and then

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.300 
right on top of the grease seal and then
try<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> tap<00:04:06.659> it<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:09.680> now<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.709> put<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:10.920> whole<00:04:11.129> bunch

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
try to tap it in now I put a whole bunch

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.059 
try to tap it in now I put a whole bunch
of<00:04:11.430> grease<00:04:11.670> on<00:04:11.909> the<00:04:12.000> inside<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.950> where<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
of grease on the inside of where the

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.599 
of grease on the inside of where the
spindle<00:04:14.430> goes<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.970> behind<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:16.500> bearing<00:04:16.919> now

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
spindle goes and behind the bearing now

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.099 
spindle goes and behind the bearing now
I'm<00:04:17.760> going<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.970> grease<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.510> other<00:04:18.660> bearing

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
I'm going to grease the other bearing

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.490 
I'm going to grease the other bearing
and<00:04:19.290> then<00:04:20.250> reinstall<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.970> rotor<00:04:21.500> I'll

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
and then reinstall the rotor I'll

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.719 
and then reinstall the rotor I'll
reinstall<00:04:23.010> your<00:04:23.070> outer<00:04:23.400> bearing<00:04:25.729> then

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
reinstall your outer bearing then

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:36.350 
reinstall your outer bearing then
reinstall<00:04:27.389> your<00:04:27.570> washer

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:51.150 

and<00:04:36.840> reinstall<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.530> bolt<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.580> outside

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.710 

what<00:04:51.640> I'd<00:04:51.700> like<00:04:51.790> to<00:04:51.850> do<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.420> put<00:04:52.630> an

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
what I'd like to do is I like to put an

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.810 
what I'd like to do is I like to put an
adjustable<00:04:53.260> wrench<00:04:53.410> on<00:04:53.710> there<00:04:53.860> tighten<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.310> a

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
adjustable wrench on there tighten it a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.940 
adjustable wrench on there tighten it a
pretty<00:04:55.570> good<00:04:55.750> amount<00:04:55.960> not<00:04:56.410> as<00:04:56.590> hard<00:04:56.770> as<00:04:56.860> you

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
pretty good amount not as hard as you

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.190 
pretty good amount not as hard as you
can<00:04:57.130> or<00:04:57.280> anything<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:57.820> then<00:04:58.540> loosen<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.080> up

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
can or anything and then loosen it up

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.220 
can or anything and then loosen it up
until<00:04:59.680> the<00:05:00.040> rotor<00:05:00.700> is<00:05:00.970> free<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:01.690> can<00:05:01.840> spin<00:05:02.200> a

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
until the rotor is free and can spin a

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.390 
until the rotor is free and can spin a
little<00:05:02.560> bit<00:05:04.110> if<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.320> over<00:05:05.590> tighten<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:06.070> then

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
little bit if you over tighten it then

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.160 
little bit if you over tighten it then
it<00:05:07.120> will<00:05:07.210> put<00:05:07.330> too<00:05:07.450> much<00:05:07.570> pressure<00:05:07.900> on<00:05:08.020> the

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
it will put too much pressure on the

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.230 
it will put too much pressure on the
bearing<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.740> will<00:05:08.860> seize<00:05:09.130> up<00:05:09.340> so<00:05:10.090> make

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
bearing and it will seize up so make

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.370 
bearing and it will seize up so make
sure<00:05:10.270> you<00:05:10.450> don't<00:05:10.570> over<00:05:10.840> tighten<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.200> if<00:05:11.320> you

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
sure you don't over tighten it if you

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.690 
sure you don't over tighten it if you
have<00:05:11.470> it<00:05:11.560> too<00:05:11.680> loose<00:05:11.920> it's<00:05:12.190> going<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.400> clunk

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
have it too loose it's going to clunk

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.940 
have it too loose it's going to clunk
and<00:05:12.990> your<00:05:13.990> alignment<00:05:14.200> will<00:05:14.470> get<00:05:14.590> messed<00:05:14.770> up

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
and your alignment will get messed up

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.740 
and your alignment will get messed up
and<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:15.310> few<00:05:15.490> other<00:05:15.670> minor<00:05:15.730> things<00:05:16.300> like<00:05:16.540> that

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
and a few other minor things like that

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.970 
and a few other minor things like that
so<00:05:17.080> if<00:05:17.230> you're<00:05:17.380> going<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.590> do<00:05:17.680> one<00:05:17.860> or<00:05:17.950> the

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
so if you're going to do one or the

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.410 
so if you're going to do one or the
other<00:05:18.070> make<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.490> mistake<00:05:18.790> of<00:05:18.820> putting<00:05:19.180> it<00:05:19.330> on

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
other make the mistake of putting it on

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.930 
other make the mistake of putting it on
there<00:05:19.570> too<00:05:19.720> loose<00:05:19.990> not<00:05:20.290> too<00:05:21.130> tight<00:05:21.400> like<00:05:21.820> I

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
there too loose not too tight like I

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.880 
there too loose not too tight like I
said<00:05:22.210> just<00:05:22.240> tighten<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:23.080> pretty<00:05:23.710> good

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
said just tighten it a pretty good

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.560 
said just tighten it a pretty good
amount<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.370> then<00:05:24.610> loosen<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.060> until<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.420> have

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
amount and then loosen it until you have

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.400 
amount and then loosen it until you have
some<00:05:25.860> some<00:05:26.860> free<00:05:27.100> movement<00:05:27.340> on<00:05:27.670> the<00:05:27.790> rotor<00:05:28.030> and

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
some some free movement on the rotor and

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.090 
some some free movement on the rotor and
you're<00:05:29.410> going<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.560> want<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:29.800> install<00:05:30.040> your

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
you're going to want to install your

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.520 
you're going to want to install your
castle<00:05:30.640> nut<00:05:30.760> and<00:05:31.000> then<00:05:31.630> put<00:05:31.930> your<00:05:31.990> cotter<00:05:32.260> pin

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
castle nut and then put your cotter pin

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.200 
castle nut and then put your cotter pin
through<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.800> hole<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.310> bend<00:05:33.670> it<00:05:33.760> over<00:05:34.030> so

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
through the hole and bend it over so

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.930 
through the hole and bend it over so
that<00:05:34.240> your<00:05:34.450> castle<00:05:34.810> not<00:05:34.960> camping<00:05:35.790> all<00:05:36.790> righty

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
that your castle not camping all righty

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.970 
that your castle not camping all righty
you<00:05:37.090> got<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.390> bolt<00:05:38.080> tighten<00:05:38.530> or<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.800> nut

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
you got the bolt tighten or the nut

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.510 
you got the bolt tighten or the nut
tightened<00:05:39.370> down

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
tightened down

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.610 
tightened down
that's<00:05:40.240> about<00:05:40.480> the<00:05:40.720> movement<00:05:41.110> I<00:05:41.170> have<00:05:41.380> on<00:05:41.530> the

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
that's about the movement I have on the

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.730 
that's about the movement I have on the
rotor<00:05:41.830> you<00:05:42.190> give<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.000> spin<00:05:43.290> if<00:05:44.290> they<00:05:44.440> tighter

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
rotor you give it a spin if they tighter

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.080 
rotor you give it a spin if they tighter
than<00:05:44.920> that<00:05:44.980> when<00:05:45.310> it<00:05:45.400> heats<00:05:45.520> up<00:05:45.700> it's<00:05:45.880> going<00:05:46.030> to

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
than that when it heats up it's going to

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.820 
than that when it heats up it's going to
expand<00:05:46.510> a<00:05:46.630> little<00:05:46.720> bit<00:05:46.840> so<00:05:47.530> you're<00:05:47.680> going<00:05:47.800> to

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
expand a little bit so you're going to

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.080 
expand a little bit so you're going to
have<00:05:47.980> a<00:05:48.010> little<00:05:48.130> bit<00:05:48.310> less<00:05:48.460> movement<00:05:48.940> than
