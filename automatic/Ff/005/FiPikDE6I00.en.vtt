00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
very good reason it actually senses

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.820 
very good reason it actually senses
inside<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.510> inner<00:00:21.660> dermal<00:00:22.170> layers<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.680> your

inside the inner dermal layers of your

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.800 
inside the inner dermal layers of your
skin<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.400> let<00:00:24.060> me<00:00:24.150> show<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.390> some<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
skin and let me show you some of the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.900 
skin and let me show you some of the
benefits<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> that

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
benefits of that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.810 
benefits of that
here<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:29.210> my<00:00:30.210> finger<00:00:30.539> prints<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.700> what<00:00:32.700> we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
here is my finger prints and what we

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.120 
here is my finger prints and what we
have<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.469> these<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.800> dots

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
have here is see all these little dots

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.630 
have here is see all these little dots
inside<00:00:35.730> those<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.210> actually<00:00:36.540> sweat<00:00:36.809> pores

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
inside those are actually sweat pores

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
inside those are actually sweat pores
inside<00:00:38.640> my<00:00:38.940> fingerprint<00:00:39.450> ridges<00:00:39.739> okay<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
inside my fingerprint ridges okay and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
inside my fingerprint ridges okay and
all<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.030> them<00:00:42.149> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:42.960> gray

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
all of them if you see the little gray

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
all of them if you see the little gray
areas<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> side<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.399> ridges<00:00:44.760> that's

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
areas to the side of my ridges that's

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.310 
areas to the side of my ridges that's
actually<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> three-dimensional<00:00:46.110> side

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
actually the three-dimensional side

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.779 
actually the three-dimensional side
those<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> rigid<00:00:47.160> those<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> ink

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
those are the rigid those are the ink

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.590 
those are the rigid those are the ink
lines<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.450> ridges<00:00:49.579> okay<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.180> why<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
lines of your ridges okay so why is that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.170 
lines of your ridges okay so why is that
important<00:00:52.260> let's<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.489> prints<00:00:54.000> for

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
important let's do one more prints for

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.189 
important let's do one more prints for
here<00:00:54.360> perhaps<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> why<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> important

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
here perhaps so why is that important

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.380 
here perhaps so why is that important
image<00:00:58.500> quality<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.160> biometrics<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> most

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
image quality and biometrics is the most

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.700 
image quality and biometrics is the most
important<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> V

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
important thing if you have a V

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920 
important thing if you have a V
establish<00:01:02.190> solid<00:01:02.579> image<00:01:02.820> quality<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.780> can

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
establish solid image quality you can

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
establish solid image quality you can
take<00:01:04.080> advantage<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.280> case<00:01:05.549> if

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
take advantage of that in this case if

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.429 
take advantage of that in this case if
you<00:01:06.390> think<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:06.990> sound<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.360> dolphins

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
you think of it like sound so dolphins

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.929 
you think of it like sound so dolphins
communicating<00:01:10.439> through<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> ocean<00:01:11.159> sound

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
communicating through the ocean sound

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.640 
communicating through the ocean sound
travels<00:01:12.420> through<00:01:12.450> moisture<00:01:13.020> extremely<00:01:13.530> well

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
travels through moisture extremely well

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.950 
travels through moisture extremely well
this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> exact<00:01:14.460> same<00:01:14.640> premise<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.780> had

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this is exact same premise if you had

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.770 
this is exact same premise if you had
condensation<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:16.950> lotion<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.670> sunscreen

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
condensation or lotion or sunscreen

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
condensation or lotion or sunscreen
you'll<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.380> able<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> work<00:01:19.830> directly<00:01:20.040> through

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you'll be able to work directly through

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.859 
you'll be able to work directly through
the<00:01:20.520> finger<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> actually<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> fingerprint

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the finger and actually the fingerprint

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.780 
the finger and actually the fingerprint
is<00:01:21.990> even<00:01:22.259> better<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> little<00:01:23.670> bit

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is even better if you have a little bit

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
is even better if you have a little bit
of<00:01:23.909> moisture<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.390> sweat<00:01:24.799> another<00:01:25.799> great

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
of moisture like sweat another great

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.190 
of moisture like sweat another great
advantage<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.820> not<00:01:27.090> conductive<00:01:27.720> base<00:01:27.900> which

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
advantage it's not conductive base which

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.980 
advantage it's not conductive base which
most<00:01:28.500> capacitive<00:01:29.159> technologies<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.750> are

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
most capacitive technologies are we are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
most capacitive technologies are we are
ultrasonic<00:01:31.439> bastes<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> scan<00:01:33.150> through

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
ultrasonic bastes so we can scan through

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.230 
ultrasonic bastes so we can scan through
glass<00:01:34.040> plastic<00:01:35.040> even<00:01:35.310> some<00:01:35.759> metals<00:01:35.939> like

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
glass plastic even some metals like

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.480 
glass plastic even some metals like
aluminum<00:01:36.750> stainless<00:01:37.079> steel<00:01:37.470> here's<00:01:38.310> an

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
oh sure

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.499 
oh sure
so<00:02:08.740> because<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.550> amount<00:02:09.700> of<00:02:09.850> detail<00:02:10.270> we

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
so because of the amount of detail we

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.960 
so because of the amount of detail we
see<00:02:10.540> it's<00:02:11.470> actually<00:02:11.920> much<00:02:12.190> more<00:02:12.220> difficult<00:02:12.850> to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
see it's actually much more difficult to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.240 
see it's actually much more difficult to
spoof<00:02:13.240> or<00:02:13.510> occult<00:02:13.720> anti-spoofing<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:15.010> we're

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
spoof or occult anti-spoofing and we're

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.040 
spoof or occult anti-spoofing and we're
also<00:02:15.370> working<00:02:15.520> on<00:02:15.970> technology<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.870> called

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
also working on technology is called

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.690 
also working on technology is called
liveness<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.680> we<00:02:17.800> can<00:02:17.920> detect<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> difference

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
liveness so we can detect the difference

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.250 
liveness so we can detect the difference
between<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.970> real<00:02:19.210> finger<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> fake<00:02:19.930> finger

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
between a real finger and a fake finger

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.890 
between a real finger and a fake finger
which<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.920> also<00:02:21.070> very<00:02:21.400> important<00:02:21.910> for<00:02:22.240> most

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
which is also very important for most

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900 
which is also very important for most
accusative<00:02:23.350> cases<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.950> extremely<00:02:24.550> important

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
accusative cases and extremely important

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.000 
accusative cases and extremely important
for<00:02:25.390> institutions<00:02:25.990> like<00:02:26.260> banks<00:02:26.290> or

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
for institutions like banks or

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.350 
for institutions like banks or
governments<00:02:27.880> as<00:02:28.000> well<00:02:29.130> yes<00:02:30.130> an<00:02:30.550> example<00:02:31.150> use

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
governments as well yes an example use

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.770 
governments as well yes an example use
case<00:02:31.510> using<00:02:32.200> our<00:02:32.520> fingerprint<00:02:33.520> sense<00:02:33.850> idea<00:02:34.180> 3d

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
case using our fingerprint sense idea 3d

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.250 
case using our fingerprint sense idea 3d
technology<00:02:35.290> with<00:02:35.830> phyto<00:02:36.250> client<00:02:37.260> integrated

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
technology with phyto client integrated

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260 
technology with phyto client integrated
together<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.670> case<00:02:39.880> we<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.240> a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
together so in this case we have a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.720 
together so in this case we have a
healthcare<00:02:40.660> app<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.550> use<00:02:42.700> a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
healthcare app and we can use a

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.390 
healthcare app and we can use a
fingerprint<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.510> login<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:44.230> think<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.010> didn't

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
fingerprint to login I think I didn't

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.860 
fingerprint to login I think I didn't
roll<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.680> there<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:47.740> go<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:49.810> I'm

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
roll in this there you go and so I'm

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.900 
roll in this there you go and so I'm
visiting<00:02:50.050> my<00:02:50.350> doctor's<00:02:50.740> office<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.700> want

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
visiting my doctor's office and I want

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.600 
visiting my doctor's office and I want
to<00:02:51.970> transmit<00:02:52.470> my<00:02:53.470> information<00:02:54.220> in<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:54.550> case

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
to transmit my information in this case

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.170 
to transmit my information in this case
out<00:02:54.910> myself<00:02:55.060> let<00:02:55.720> me<00:02:55.810> clear<00:02:56.080> this<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.250> now

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
out myself let me clear this so now

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.640 
out myself let me clear this so now
again<00:02:58.300> I<00:02:58.720> think<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.020> key<00:02:59.140> with<00:02:59.230> using<00:02:59.560> my

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
again I think the key with using my

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.720 
again I think the key with using my
fingerprint<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.560> will<00:03:02.739> tap<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.459> on<00:03:03.580> this

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
fingerprint and I will tap it on this

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.509 
fingerprint and I will tap it on this
NFC<00:03:04.239> car<00:03:04.450> reader<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.920> transmits<00:03:06.340> that

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
NFC car reader and it transmits that

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.959 
NFC car reader and it transmits that
information<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.510> doctor's<00:03:07.840> office
