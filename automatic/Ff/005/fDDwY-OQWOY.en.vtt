and what i think is going to be on it so

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.230 
and what i think is going to be on it so
let's<00:00:07.350> start<00:00:07.560> off<00:00:07.680> with<00:00:07.710> saying<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.580> i<00:00:08.880> think

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
let's start off with saying that i think

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.570 
let's start off with saying that i think
it's<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.510> be<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> verizon<00:00:10.260> iphone<00:00:10.380> if<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
it's going to be a verizon iphone if the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.400 
it's going to be a verizon iphone if the
verizon<00:00:11.940> iphones<00:00:12.360> get<00:00:12.660> released<00:00:12.929> by<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.170> end

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
verizon iphones get released by the end

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.480 
verizon iphones get released by the end
of<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.650> year<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.160> early<00:00:14.990> 2011<00:00:15.990> then<00:00:16.859> iphone<00:00:17.310> 5

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
of this year or early 2011 then iphone 5

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.670 
of this year or early 2011 then iphone 5
will<00:00:17.670> definitely<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> verizon<00:00:19.020> iphone<00:00:19.230> i

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
will definitely be a verizon iphone i

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.500 
will definitely be a verizon iphone i
also<00:00:20.250> think<00:00:20.520> it'll<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:21.060> bit<00:00:21.240> thinner

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
also think it'll be a little bit thinner

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.689 
also think it'll be a little bit thinner
and<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.369> they're<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
and I don't think that they're going to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.689 
and I don't think that they're going to
have<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.359> new<00:00:24.630> total<00:00:25.619> look<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.099> new<00:00:26.400> device

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
have a new total look to this new device

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.140 
have a new total look to this new device
the<00:00:27.420> iphone<00:00:27.720> 5<00:00:27.930> i<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.470> will<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.680> an

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
the iphone 5 i think it will be an

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.519 
the iphone 5 i think it will be an
evolutionary<00:00:30.150> device<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> revolutionary

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
evolutionary device not a revolutionary

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
evolutionary device not a revolutionary
device<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:32.520> means<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.880> they'll<00:00:33.000> change<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
device which means that they'll change a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.590 
device which means that they'll change a
few<00:00:33.480> things<00:00:33.710> but<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.770> won't<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.300> like<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
few things but it won't be like the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.330 
few things but it won't be like the
iphone<00:00:36.989> 3gs<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> iphone<00:00:38.760> 4<00:00:39.410> um<00:00:40.410> i<00:00:40.500> also

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
iphone 3gs to the iphone 4 um i also

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.940 
iphone 3gs to the iphone 4 um i also
think<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.059> 32<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.930> n<00:00:43.230> 64

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
think it's going to have 32 to n 64

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.940 
think it's going to have 32 to n 64
gigabyte<00:00:44.460> memory<00:00:45.170> slightly<00:00:46.170> larger<00:00:46.530> screen

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
gigabyte memory slightly larger screen

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.970 
gigabyte memory slightly larger screen
and<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.579> slightly<00:00:47.850> faster<00:00:48.180> device<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.770> also

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and a slightly faster device it's also

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.580 
and a slightly faster device it's also
going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> redesign<00:00:52.110> flash

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
going to have probably a redesign flash

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.069 
going to have probably a redesign flash
and<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.699> better<00:00:53.879> camera<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> front<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and a better camera on the front and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.889 
and a better camera on the front and
probably<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> back<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:57.120> might<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
probably the back and we might see a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
probably the back and we might see a
change<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.800> materials<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.820> how<00:00:59.940> they

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
change of materials you know how they

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.319 
change of materials you know how they
have<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.539> glass<00:01:00.750> front<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> glass<00:01:01.410> back

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
have the glass front in the glass back

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
have the glass front in the glass back
reports<00:01:03.329> are<00:01:03.449> saying<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.140> slider<00:01:04.379> cases

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
reports are saying that the slider cases

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
reports are saying that the slider cases
are<00:01:05.360> cracking<00:01:06.360> screens<00:01:06.840> they're<00:01:07.320> leaving

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
are cracking screens they're leaving

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.609 
are cracking screens they're leaving
little<00:01:08.460> cracks<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> time

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
little cracks in it and then as the time

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.620 
little cracks in it and then as the time
goes<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> heat<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.580> shatters<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> glass

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
goes on the heat it shatters the glass

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.429 
goes on the heat it shatters the glass
like<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.350> windshield<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> car<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.439> apples

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
like a windshield in a car and apples

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.820 
like a windshield in a car and apples

in an update before the iphone 5 and we
might<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.710> field<00:01:35.009> communications

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
adding a touch screen around the side

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the speaker and the bottom down there

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.800 
the speaker and the bottom down there
and<00:02:16.530> they<00:02:17.069> could<00:02:17.250> add<00:02:17.459> like<00:02:18.000> volume<00:02:18.360> buttons

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.680 
and they could add like volume buttons
without<00:02:19.080> having<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.950> put<00:02:20.129> on<00:02:20.310> these<00:02:20.819> actual

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690

metal<00:02:21.870> volume<00:02:22.379> buttons<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.430> that's<00:02:23.610> all<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
metal volume buttons so that's all I

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.009 
metal volume buttons so that's all I
think<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.300> they're<00:02:24.540> going<00:02:24.629> to<00:02:24.690> do<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
think that they're going to do for the

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.750
