the<00:03:39.080> now<00:03:39.319> playing<00:03:39.650> button<00:03:39.980> which<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.280> don't

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
the now playing button which I don't

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.550 
the now playing button which I don't
actually<00:03:40.640> use<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:41.330> don't<00:03:41.600> see<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:41.990> lot<00:03:42.230> of<00:03:42.260> people

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
actually use I don't see a lot of people

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.680 
actually use I don't see a lot of people
using<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.069> now<00:03:43.520> playing<00:03:43.910> track<00:03:44.330> but

obviously this is in a lot of tweaked so
I<00:03:47.720> just<00:03:48.319> assume<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.920> a<00:03:48.950> lot<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.160> people<00:03:49.250> do

I just assume that a lot of people do
use<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.270> but<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:50.870> can<00:03:51.020> use<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.440> up<00:03:51.740> you<00:03:52.100> can

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.890 
use this but you can use this up you can
toggle<00:03:52.370> on<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.730> now<00:03:52.850> playing<00:03:53.120> button<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.660> you

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
toggle on the now playing button and you

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.630
