00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 Hello, I did not want to meet you 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.490
 tell you about several cases for 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.230
 iphone 6 and 6 plus as well as a pair of bags and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.269
 so in the end it turned out that they are all from 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.269
 hard graph companies that are enough 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.700
 tightly hooked after reviews of their products 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.770
 the last on iphone 5s is wonderful 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.720
 cover you'll find on the channel too 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.210
 it turned out that the last time is not necessary 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580
 carry your macbook pro retina 15 inch 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.600
 with one place before use 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 so gigantic 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.160
 photo backpack from the company Leva about the whole 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 wonderful but not very compact 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.989
 big enough you want something more 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.120
 mobile and today tell you what I 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.579
 eventually chose and also show on my 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 Look one of the best covers for iphone 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.879
 6 and 6 plus 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.739
 Apple discounts went to all subscribers 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.600
 from partner and apple store just.ru than 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.489
 one of the advantages of the apple technique is 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.710
 what do a huge amount for them 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.530
 accessories including bag covers and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.329
 just like that of course 15 4 inches 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.980
 fairly common diagono 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.329
 here it is not so critical from both 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.609
 smartphones and tablets 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.220
 but nevertheless just like that of macbook pro 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.830
 13 years old retina which I use 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.080
 constantly despite the presence of mac pro and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.659
 in the end, my eyes fell on this 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.659
 great bag from hard graph then she 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.060
 made of leather and here we have something 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.680
 like tarpaulin and with leather version 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 an apron but it seemed to me like that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.310
 cool she actually worn 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.990
 great and yet good enough 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.689
 wear resistant material in the end we 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.450
 in fact there is only one pocket or 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.930
 one room over here 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.570
 the blame 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.130
 this is our macbook with you and it hits 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.390
 the truth is inside you'll find another 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.920
 additional compartment 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.570
 then you can put the charge 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.659
 any other little things so they don't 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.590
 scratched your laptop so he lived 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.570
 quietly and did not suffer now i go there 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.280
 I will put it, we'll see how it is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.930
 looks really cleaned up he 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.600
 just enough pain of that if you 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.490
 wear it in some protective 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.009
 clothes support clothes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.899
 wrappers it can also be done here 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.820
 so it looks and accordingly you 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.530
 you can wear it both over the shoulder and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.209
 throw yourself on your back 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.739
 mounts this implies more than that 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.180
 here special bolts are possible 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.750
 unscrew and carry it all as a folder 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.769
 that is quite mobile and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.959
 multifunctional thing in the end I 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.269
 so much for the big bag that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.269
 I took a small one that is suitable for 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.700
 wearing an 11 inch macbook air or 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.349
 ipad itself technologically it 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.500
 performed exactly the only thing that 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.379
 you can not remove the strap will have to go with her 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.260
 and here is placed without problems ipad 9 and 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.840
 7 inches or any other 10 inch 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.579
 tablet well and as i said macbook air and 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.769
 again we have an office for 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.700
 all sorts of little things do you see that 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.409
 it is quite narrow and does not imply 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.919
 stuff and all sorts of stuff that is it 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.040
 such 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:56.019
 brush for your laptop is worth it all 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.730
 expensive references where you can buy 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.189
 leave in the description will not score you 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.439
 head and not to be scared of this 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.909
 there is leather wool in general hard graft 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.159
 There is a hard graft from this nowhere 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.870
 getting away before you my treasures here it is 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.849
 the same hard grease case which 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.340
 started my love for this company before 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.379
 of this i loved the hay about which 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.540
 told here do not like diet 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:19.090
 first pronounced quite culturally 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.720
 unlike the original case which 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.489
 did it 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.979
 and although I almost never used it 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.900
 after all, he fell into disrepair in obvious stages 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:28.060
 saw people with almost black 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.280
 red covers it becomes 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.560
 sad and see what I always 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.970
 liked the phone fit easily and there is 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.829
 a wonderful pocket where you can 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.870
 shove anything from money 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.970
 cards I finish the Komi ticket and in 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.009
 review we laughed like garbage lose 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.340
 immediately and phone cards anything 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:47.109
 In fact, it turned out to be mega super convenient and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.040
 great that had hail released 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.590
 second version 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.989
 continuation of this idea for iphone 6 plus 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.090
 Here is such a gray color and it is on 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.949
 i am not very happy about me 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.790
 brown somehow comes more but 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.349
 koyuki series 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.139
 at least they are different it is different 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.970
 great here the only thing cool in 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.769
 first deliveries you are already starting actively 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.780
 uses it fits very easily 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.180
 the phone at the beginning know always goes tight 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.639
 but if you understand what I always tell you 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.439
 goes tight then easier so here in 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.709
 The difference from this cover as much as two 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.539
 pocket 1 and 2 and see what kind of thing 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.669
 here you can put for example money 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.500
 cards and here I have a little 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.870
 life hack lives such a thing called 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.330
 charge as which allows you to charge 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.880
 your device wherever you are in yusb 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.040
 and paste in the lightning paste and this 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.780
 your wand wand despite being 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.020
 what the iphone 6 plus battery has become 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.310
 much better and even with mine 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.260
 active use is enough for a day 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.300
 anyway it's great I get 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.470
 such a complex design which 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.090
 lets me not be afraid to go out in the city 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.620
 moreover here you can see there 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.170
 special headphone openings 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.850
 Generally everything is thought out orders fellows topics 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.010
 that they have everything really in mind 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.960
 enough compact thing well 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.180
 and as far as can be judged I will reach 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.940
 iphone 6 plus healthy but nonetheless 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.100
 look there is still cool design i 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.290
 long thought how could I use but 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.020
 this one i took so fu fu fan that 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.260
 called this such purse which 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.860
 you can often get me out 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.350
 pocket 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:23.900
 you put iphone 6 plus there for example 6 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.340
 I love shift + but in this case 6 and y 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.930
 we have such a construction 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.580
 where you can shove again 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.290
 cards where you can put money 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.350
 but it's more like 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.820
 on the wallet and the question is how much 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.740
 it is convenient to get not like this 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.330
 get the phone and see what 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.610
 the story soon comes out apple watch 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.710
 you have all the reminders on hand therefore 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.110
 phone access during the day is possible and 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.520
 don't need them well for me 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.080
 it's really incomprehensible but there are people 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.970
 who love similar designs 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.010
 who today do not walk with the phone in 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.220
 this mode then put it 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.050
 and all but I am one of those who love their phone 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.419
 but does not like to get it 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.250
 lived in some kind of similar floor 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.810
 bumper because once again the screen 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.610
 still scratched despite 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.570
 protected glass in spite of all these 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.020
 things are cool 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.210
 the screen is scratched and in the light it is very 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.280
 noticeable in the sun even more so 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.060
 the original here are these new covers we also 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.280
 it was discussed 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.840
 improved in relation to the old but still 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.120
 time when you start using 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.250
 hard graph products as far as they are comfortable 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.590
 thought out how all this ergonomic 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.780
 cool done and high quality leather up 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.580
 inside we are just full of wool 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.340
 archive it is completely different 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.500
 perceived therefore keep in mind that 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.639
 such things are also a great gift and 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.819
 yourself and to whom 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:40.370
 and be from familiar relatives so here 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.289
 such here I have new clothes told and 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.819
 bags cool covers cool and 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.349
 write in the comments that you 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.990
 liked not liked the price tags 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.219
 Of course they are not budgetary to the need 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.439
 understand that it is very 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:53.419
 high-quality products for which 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:56.330
 It is not a pity to pay because 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:58.009
 phone is your second I am where and how 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.900
 you wear it it is very important my 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.840
 position and yet I love when the phone 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.599
 you can touch its original form 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.460
 without all sorts of additional canopies 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:08.300
