00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
this is what I do but I try to let it

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.680 
this is what I do but I try to let it
kind<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.260> sit<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.860> dry<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.580> little<00:03:23.850> bit<00:03:24.120> so

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
kind of sit and dry a little bit so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.420 
kind of sit and dry a little bit so
don't<00:03:24.840> actually<00:03:25.350> let<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.710> be<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:25.980> very<00:03:26.370> last

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
don't actually let this be the very last

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.130 
don't actually let this be the very last
thing<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.030> do<00:03:27.300> before<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.720> go<00:03:27.900> out<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
thing that you do before you go out the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.960 
thing that you do before you go out the
door<00:03:28.410> because<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:28.920> think<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.700> don't<00:03:29.820> have<00:03:29.910> a

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
door because I think if you don't have a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.970 
door because I think if you don't have a
mirror<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.630> might<00:03:30.780> end<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.080> on<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> smudging<00:03:31.770> it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
mirror you might end up on a smudging it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.490 
mirror you might end up on a smudging it
funny<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.490> don't<00:03:33.240> know<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.960> not<00:03:34.050> like<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> red

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500

together<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.480> then<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.930> will<00:03:37.080> like<00:03:37.290> creep

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
together and then it will like creep

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.250 
together and then it will like creep

it's now fall but this is one of those
things<00:04:16.709> where<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:17.040> think<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.700> whole<00:04:17.880> point<00:04:18.090> is

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
things where I think the whole point is

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.110 
things where I think the whole point is
you<00:04:18.660> can<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.410> layer<00:04:19.770> them<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.790> that's<00:04:20.940> why<00:04:21.060> I

you can like layer them so that's why I

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.880

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
which is also why it's super

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.870 
which is also why it's super
long-lasting<00:05:15.260> it's<00:05:16.260> not<00:05:16.560> transfer<00:05:17.220> resistant
