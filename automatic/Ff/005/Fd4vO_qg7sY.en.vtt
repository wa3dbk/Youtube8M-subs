fresh<00:00:24.480> blood<00:00:24.750> from<00:00:25.019> military<00:00:25.410> go<00:00:25.619> States<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
fresh blood from military go States and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
fresh blood from military go States and
raven<00:00:26.730> black<00:00:26.910> from<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> normal<00:00:27.570> range<00:00:27.750> of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
raven black from the normal range of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
raven black from the normal range of
color<00:00:28.199> mix<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.920> together<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.789> testing

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
color mix them together here I'm testing

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.400 
color mix them together here I'm testing
it<00:00:30.240> out<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.480> my<00:00:30.599> finger<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.019> doesn't<00:00:31.320> really

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
it out on my finger it doesn't really

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.930 
it out on my finger it doesn't really
look<00:00:31.619> like<00:00:31.679> blood<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.219> I'm<00:00:32.309> gonna<00:00:32.430> add<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.700> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
look like blood so I'm gonna add in a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000 
look like blood so I'm gonna add in a
little<00:00:32.969> bit<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.420> black<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> simulate

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
little bit more black just to simulate

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.560 
little bit more black just to simulate
the<00:00:35.160> ayran<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> minerals<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> have

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the ayran and the minerals that you have

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.119 
the ayran and the minerals that you have
in<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.809> blood<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:37.320> why<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.860> use

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
in your blood that's why i don't use

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.700 
in your blood that's why i don't use
transparent<00:00:39.120> black<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.540> i<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.989> solid

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
transparent black but i use a solid

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.889 
transparent black but i use a solid
color<00:00:40.890> black<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> i<00:00:41.510> mix<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
color black and i mix it up to a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.630 
color black and i mix it up to a
consistency<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.800> think<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.250> looks<00:00:44.280> like

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
consistency where I think it looks like

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
consistency where I think it looks like
blood<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.120> finger<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.840> apply<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
blood on my finger and then I apply it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.020 
blood on my finger and then I apply it
to<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> model<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.520> would<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to the model if you would be in a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.549 
to the model if you would be in a
situation<00:00:48.239> where<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.079> would<00:00:49.110> not<00:00:49.500> have

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
situation where you would not have

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.670 
situation where you would not have
access<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.210> minitor<00:00:51.600> ghost<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.469> you

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
access to the minitor ghost it's you

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700 
access to the minitor ghost it's you
could<00:00:52.829> always<00:00:53.039> grab<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.699> bottle<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.180> tamiya<00:00:54.870> x27

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
could always grab a bottle of tamiya x27

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
could always grab a bottle of tamiya x27
clear<00:00:56.160> red<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.600> job<00:00:57.629> plenty

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
clear red which will do the job plenty

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.810 
clear red which will do the job plenty
enough<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> mix<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.010> with<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.219> normal<00:00:59.609> black

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
enough and mix it up with a normal black

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310 
enough and mix it up with a normal black
and<00:01:00.149> you're<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> able<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.199> achieve

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and you're going to be able to achieve

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
and you're going to be able to achieve
the<00:01:01.680> result<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> basically<00:01:02.910> how<00:01:03.300> i

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the result so this is basically how i

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
the result so this is basically how i
made<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> door<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.409> model<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> also<00:01:05.189> how

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
made the door on this model and also how

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.120 
made the door on this model and also how
i<00:01:05.369> made<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> boron<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> zombie<00:01:06.840> model<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
i made the boron the zombie model that I

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.840 
i made the boron the zombie model that I
really<00:01:08.580> said<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.119> long<00:01:09.390> ago<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:09.990> my<00:01:10.260> own

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
really said not long ago from my own

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.310 
really said not long ago from my own

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
range of miniature me and then estranged

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
range of miniature me and then estranged
from<00:01:13.560> each<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> our<00:01:14.070> studio<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> lot<00:01:15.479> of

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
from each of our studio so a lot of

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.359 
from each of our studio so a lot of
people<00:01:15.810> ask<00:01:16.020> me<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.710> tutorial<00:01:17.189> so
