00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
almost these exercises give the muscle a

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.009 
almost these exercises give the muscle a
reason<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.560> stick<00:03:05.920> around<00:03:05.950> or<00:03:06.610> burn<00:03:07.390> off<00:03:07.750> this

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019

doing ten reps and then I am switch into
reverse<00:05:35.599> and<00:05:36.370> I'm<00:05:37.370> kind<00:05:37.819> of<00:05:37.969> treating<00:05:38.389> the

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479
