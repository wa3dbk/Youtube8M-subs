00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
knew I wanted to work in science but I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.520 
knew I wanted to work in science but I
wasn't<00:00:36.590> too<00:00:36.860> sure<00:00:37.070> which<00:00:37.789> area<00:00:38.539> I<00:00:38.719> think<00:00:39.110> I

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
wasn't too sure which area I think I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.049 
wasn't too sure which area I think I
mainly<00:00:39.770> focused<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:40.340> wanting<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.820> work<00:00:40.940> in

forensic science but then when I went to

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.049 
forensic science but then when I went to
