00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
we're gonna do is place a block here

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.050 
we're gonna do is place a block here
here<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.140> read<00:01:32.009> some<00:01:32.250> dust<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.700> lead<00:01:32.850> into

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
here and read some dust will lead into

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600 
here and read some dust will lead into
this<00:01:33.329> block<00:01:33.600> right<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.159> being<00:01:35.159> powered<00:01:35.490> by

this redstone block is gonna be arrested
on<00:02:01.979> dust<00:02:02.310> leading<00:02:02.700> into<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.000> block<00:02:03.299> leading

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
on dust leading into this block leading

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
on dust leading into this block leading
into<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.930> torch<00:02:04.399> powering<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.610> block

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
into that torch powering that block

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.240 
into that torch powering that block
powering<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.829> would<00:02:07.829> he<00:02:07.890> call<00:02:08.099> this

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
powering this would he call this

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.809 
powering this would he call this
repeater<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.660> way<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.530> four<00:02:10.800> okay<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.730> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
repeater all the way to four okay we can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.410 
repeater all the way to four okay we can
place<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.090> block<00:02:12.300> here<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:13.200> we

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
place a block here but we

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.180 
place a block here but we
before<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:13.990> do<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.230> we're<00:02:14.740> gonna<00:02:14.830> take<00:02:15.040> care

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
before we do that we're gonna take care

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.040 
before we do that we're gonna take care
of<00:02:15.310> these<00:02:15.460> two<00:02:15.520> Pistons<00:02:16.030> here<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:16.930> we're

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
of these two Pistons here so what we're

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.200 
of these two Pistons here so what we're
gonna<00:02:17.110> do<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.740> place<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> repeater<00:02:18.460> right<00:02:18.850> here

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
gonna do is place a repeater right here

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.960 
gonna do is place a repeater right here
and<00:02:19.530> set<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.890> four<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.430> well<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:24.520> is

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and set that to four as well and this is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.990 
and set that to four as well and this is
okay<00:02:25.600> this<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.650> come<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.490> block<00:02:27.790> is

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
okay this this is come on this block is

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.210 
okay this this is come on this block is
gonna<00:02:28.090> power<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.470> repeater<00:02:29.980> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
gonna power that that repeater that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.940 
gonna power that that repeater that
piston<00:02:30.940> which<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.570> me<00:02:31.690> powered<00:02:31.990> by<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.200> dot

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
piston which is me powered by this dot

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.440 
piston which is me powered by this dot
of<00:02:33.190> redstone<00:02:33.670> dust<00:02:33.940> which<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.210> going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.390> be

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
of redstone dust which is going to be

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.000 
of redstone dust which is going to be
powered<00:02:34.660> by<00:02:34.720> this<00:02:34.840> block<00:02:35.290> powered<00:02:35.740> by<00:02:35.950> this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
powered by this block powered by this

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.130 
powered by this block powered by this
repeater<00:02:36.880> right<00:02:37.060> here<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:37.690> takes<00:02:37.840> care

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
repeater right here so that takes care

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.670 
repeater right here so that takes care
of<00:02:38.200> that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
of that

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.820 
of that
now<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.340> could<00:02:39.670> place<00:02:39.910> our<00:02:40.320> block<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.560> power

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
now we could place our block that power

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.100 
now we could place our block that power
is<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.160> dispenser<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:43.090> that's<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:44.080> that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
is this dispenser and that's it for that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.350 
is this dispenser and that's it for that
okay<00:02:44.709> right<00:02:45.370> on<00:02:45.490> top<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:45.910> block<00:02:46.180> we're

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
okay right on top of this block we're

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.600 
okay right on top of this block we're
gonna<00:02:46.450> place<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.959> redstone<00:02:47.380> torch<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:48.490> is

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
gonna place a redstone torch this is

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.640 
gonna place a redstone torch this is
gonna<00:02:48.730> send<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.060> signal<00:02:49.390> upward<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:50.440> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
gonna send the signal upward for the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.580 
gonna send the signal upward for the
double<00:02:51.010> piston<00:02:51.190> extenders<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.750> let's<00:02:53.200> start

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
double piston extenders so let's start

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.740 
double piston extenders so let's start
on<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.860> now<00:02:54.250> okay<00:02:54.820> just<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.390> couple<00:02:55.570> blocks

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
on that now okay just a couple blocks

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.660 
on that now okay just a couple blocks
here<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.260> give<00:02:56.440> us<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.650> good<00:02:56.890> start<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.580> the
