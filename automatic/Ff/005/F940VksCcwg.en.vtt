really everybody felt that way it's odd
to<00:00:23.550> me<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.119> he<00:00:24.960> would<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.320> picked<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.769> that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
to me that he would have picked up that

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.290

album and had to have been moved enough

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
album and had to have been moved enough

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to not just look at it and drop it but

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.819 
to not just look at it and drop it but
to<00:00:32.340> actually<00:00:32.579> take<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.480> him<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> get

to actually take it with him and get

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.520 
to actually take it with him and get
back<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.149> boat<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.630> get<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:37.020> onto<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
back on the boat to get back onto the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.970 
back on the boat to get back onto the
ship<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.180> bring<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> home<00:00:39.540> there's<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
ship and bring it home there's kind of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
ship and bring it home there's kind of
like<00:00:41.219> something<00:00:41.790> he<00:00:41.910> couldn't<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.390> rid<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
like something he couldn't get rid of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.330 
like something he couldn't get rid of
you<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.170> something<00:00:43.649> was<00:00:43.860> profoundly

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you know something was profoundly

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.700 
you know something was profoundly
happening<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.270> gave<00:00:45.539> him<00:00:45.690> an<00:00:45.870> inside<00:00:46.260> Dinda

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
happening that gave him an inside Dinda

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.940 
happening that gave him an inside Dinda
I<00:00:46.950> think<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.239> actual<00:00:48.660> major<00:00:48.989> award<00:00:49.559> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
I think what the actual major award is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.150 
I think what the actual major award is
and<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.289> doing<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> each<00:00:52.829> other

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and and what are we doing to each other

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
and and what are we doing to each other
on<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.969> planet<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.809> why<00:00:56.210> there<00:00:57.210> wouldn't<00:00:57.449> be

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
on this planet and why there wouldn't be

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.279 
on this planet and why there wouldn't be
a<00:00:57.809> story<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.559> wasn't<00:00:59.070> account<00:00:59.870> that<00:01:00.870> woman

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
a story there wasn't account that woman

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.240 
a story there wasn't account that woman
would<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.120> can't<00:01:03.719> disappear<00:01:04.589> she

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
would not that that can't disappear she

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.080 
would not that that can't disappear she
wanted<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.880> connection

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
wanted at that connection

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.279 
wanted at that connection
magical<00:01:07.960> things<00:01:08.170> happen<00:01:09.689> besides<00:01:10.689> me

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
magical things happen besides me

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.459 
magical things happen besides me
something<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:14.500> means<00:01:15.210> closure<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.689> knew<00:01:17.259> when

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
something it means closure I knew when

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.559 
something it means closure I knew when
we<00:01:17.500> found<00:01:17.859> the<00:01:18.069> book<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.490> found<00:01:18.609> out<00:01:18.909> what<00:01:19.539> it

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
we found the book and found out what it

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.679 
we found the book and found out what it
was<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:20.200> when<00:01:20.829> his<00:01:21.069> shipmate<00:01:21.819> said<00:01:22.090> duke<00:01:22.479> was

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
was and when his shipmate said duke was

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.749 
was and when his shipmate said duke was
really<00:01:23.020> upset<00:01:23.500> about<00:01:23.530> finding<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.399> and

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
really upset about finding this and

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.090 
really upset about finding this and
someone<00:01:25.569> had<00:01:25.719> lost<00:01:25.959> it<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.319> he<00:01:26.439> really<00:01:26.770> wanted

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
someone had lost it and he really wanted

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.490 
someone had lost it and he really wanted
said<00:01:27.789> he<00:01:27.909> wanted<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.240> return<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.810> someday<00:01:29.229> I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
said he wanted to return it someday I

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.240 
said he wanted to return it someday I
knew<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.819> was<00:01:31.209> the<00:01:31.359> last<00:01:31.569> thing<00:01:31.929> I<00:01:32.229> could<00:01:33.130> do

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
knew that was the last thing I could do

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.270 
knew that was the last thing I could do
for<00:01:33.280> him<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:35.969> really<00:01:36.969> believe<00:01:37.359> that<00:01:37.390> when<00:01:37.929> Duke

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
for him I really believe that when Duke

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.940 
for him I really believe that when Duke
opened<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.489> album<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.599> saw<00:01:40.810> baby<00:01:41.349> pictures

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
opened that album and saw baby pictures

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.160 
opened that album and saw baby pictures
and<00:01:42.250> pictures<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.939> little<00:01:43.119> children<00:01:43.450> having

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
and pictures of little children having

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.499 
and pictures of little children having
just<00:01:44.439> become<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.009> father<00:01:45.130> himself<00:01:45.579> I<00:01:46.119> really

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
just become a father himself I really

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.039 
just become a father himself I really
think<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:47.920> hit<00:01:48.549> him<00:01:48.819> hard<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.689> we<00:01:49.899> are

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
think it just hit him hard that we are

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.800 
think it just hit him hard that we are
all<00:01:50.259> family<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.789> we<00:01:51.909> have<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.209> take<00:01:52.360> care<00:01:52.689> of

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
all family and we have to take care of

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.229 
all family and we have to take care of
each<00:01:52.899> other<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:54.579> this<00:01:54.819> trip<00:01:55.329> to<00:01:55.390> be<00:01:56.140> one<00:01:56.890> of

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
each other I want this trip to be one of

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.199 
each other I want this trip to be one of
healing<00:01:58.239> and<00:01:58.629> forgiveness<00:01:59.469> and<00:02:00.340> peace

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
healing and forgiveness and peace

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.899 
healing and forgiveness and peace
because<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.530> think<00:02:02.619> that's<00:02:03.129> what<00:02:03.369> we<00:02:03.489> all<00:02:03.640> need

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909
