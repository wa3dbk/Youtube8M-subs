00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.930
 that there are friends of youtube this time 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:11.710
 I bring a good video in which they 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.790
 I will teach how to pass the applications 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.740
 This is called as card cd 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:25.240
 good ones that can be moved this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.529
 to start in the xperia type this one 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.259
 and unfortunately, so to speak 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.880
 applications that we download whether that 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.590
 can move like games 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.100
 x 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.020
 and can be moved to storage 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.090
 internal that brings by default that they are 2 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.900
 more gigas can not be moved to the 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.950
 sd card itself but I was looking for 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:56.730
 and I found a way to make the 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:01.800
 team recognize the sd card as 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.080
 the internal default storage is 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.619
 say already with this power so pass 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.510
 the applications to the sd itself thanks to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.370
 the sd not to the storage that brings 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.390
 default 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.950
 good what we need is to download 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.480
 some files that he told them in the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.060
 description 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.100
 in these files are two system 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.009
 very well since they have downloaded 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.130
 the pass them to your sd card are the 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.789
 files that call bold fast or something like that 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.840
 I do not remember well and for this 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.759
 we will need a manager 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.670
 files to apply the changes to them 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.630
 I recommend that you use the root explorer 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.539
 since it is easier and good 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.120
 once already passed the files to a 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.190
 the sd that are these we're going 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.409
 I have them in this folder these two 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 phases of belfast punto back 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:08.280
 what we will do is this 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:12.050
 how is it called copying those files to a 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:18.099
 system folder that is we will go to the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:22.400
 main screen of the explorer and in 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:25.579
 down to the system we give you and so on 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.140
 or etc how come work will see a 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.379
 file that is this 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.849
 bolt point f 7 goes before copying the 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.549
 another file we will have to do the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.800
 endorsement of this so that in case 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.080
 want to return it 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.700
 Because I do not recognize your memory 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.550
 they can as it's called undo what 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.680
 have done so we give you copy 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.830
 and we are going to preferably 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.780
 I recommend that the backup do it in 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.840
 your sd card not to be deleted 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.900
 so 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.390
 we go to the serial card in this 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.160
 case recognizes it as highlighting and in this 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.580
 case since in the folder that was called 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.660
 caps 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.690
 and here we will paste the file once 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.020
 done this we will go to the file that 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.750
 we download and copy what is 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.500
 This has the same name we give 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.500
 copy 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.350
 we go back to system 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:35.270
 etc etc 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.610
 and here we will paste the good file 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.580
 we will have to put ride up to 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.380
 being able to copy it very well says that the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.670
 file already exists that if we want 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.319
 replace it 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.299
 we give him yes 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.459
 and very well once this is done 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.209
 we will leave and we will have to make a 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.659
 reboot and we will have changed the memory 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:01.450
 internal by the sd card so let's go 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:04.780
 to turn it off and restart it very well 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.410
 once restarted we hope that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.850
 load the sd card 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.240
 to see and as you know by default 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.300
 this 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.780
 this equipment brought gb storage 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.700
 internal and we will go to storage and 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.650
 as you can see storage now 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.270
 internal goes but sorry in this case 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.110
 I have a memory of 2 installed 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:33.260
 gigas because I use it to make the 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.380
 no videos and that the one that I have to use 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.180
 with my files, something does not happen to him 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.050
 as you can see storage now 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.730
 internal marked 123 gigabytes 1.23 in 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.470
 This case recognizes me that way because I 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.930
 I have made a partition in this 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.470
 memory and now on the sd card 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.090
 will appear the two gigas that 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.710
 appeared earlier in storage 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.440
 internally this is to say that we change the 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.450
 values ​​with the files or we change 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.080
 that internal storage 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:06.710
 recognize as the sd and with this happen 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.170
 the applications now yes that very well to 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.000
 the sd card itself to that of 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.940
 internal storage 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.740
 this can be checked by passing some 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:21.170
 application and you will see that you pass them to the 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.590
 In this case, it would be advisable 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.010
 they had an 8gb card 4 not one of 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.280
 two that would be almost the same but I just 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:35.139
 I did it to try but that's all 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.439
 only they have to do and then because 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:43.860
 remember to like and subscribe 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.860
 I hope you served them and country
