00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.110
 the logo of the world cup generated many 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.450
 controversial because it contains errors 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.960
 very serious and no one can explain 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.750
 which means the design was considered 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.629
 by design around the world as a 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.980
 Bad design made poorly that with error 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.230
 typography, for example 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.949
 three hands to represent a sport 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.750
 that is played with the feet and 2014 with 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.269
 red letters

 watch this video all the way to see 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.780

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 subliminal 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.650
 considered by many professionals a 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.010
 improvised cartoon without grace 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.830
 the professional and with typographical errors 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.170
 The logo of the Brazil 2014 Cup was 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.909
 chosen by notable people among 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.420
 they ivete sangalo paulo coelho and oscar 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.390
 I do not know 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.729
 Let's see the first mistake now 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.070
 besides using hands to represent a 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.320
 sport that is played with the feet 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.049
 the drawing shows a person with their hands 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.810
 in the face as one who laments 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.439
 those who believe that the logo of the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.939
 world would be an allusion to the 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.060
 deceased medium spiritist boy xavier 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.829

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.579
 lowered his head and laid his hand on 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:02.810
 the party and the eyes second mistake 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:05.200
 the red color should soon include 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.220
 Only the colors of the brazilian flag 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.260
 correct because the color is red not blue 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.850
 will the brazilian flag have the color blue 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.620
 not red on social networks 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.930
 Some say that the color red 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.480
 represents the blood that will run in the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.150
 demonstrations and protests during 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.640
 after the cup 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.120
 others think that the squid had put 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:46.200
 referring to former President Lula 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.840

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.780
 in the name of the country of Brazil and it seems that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.750
 there was the least concern about the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.390
 typography because never a designer 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.750
