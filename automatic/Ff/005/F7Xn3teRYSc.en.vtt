00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello everyone again redcrafting 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.639
 and today we will develop news from 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.810
 versions 13 17th and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.880
 here we have forgotten something a man with a nickname 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.949
 biscuit he is hello dear friends and 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.939
 the first innovation that brought us 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.660
 this snapshot 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.890
 these are such strange blocks this 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.559
 clay blocks 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.980
 that is, not just clay blocks about 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.649
 roasted makeup 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.360
 so say here it is here we rummage 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.780
 from the usual blocks green and it turns out 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 such a solid 3 can be just their 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.930
 use for construction think not 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 more basically there is still such 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.360
 the likelihood that they may be soon 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.399
 will be performed in the desert biome and 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.760
 there will be zombies 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.280
 but because a mahjong company let's say 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.250
 showed us an unusual screenshot on 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.549
 which depicts a house of this clay and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.500
 zombie stands next to but in principle it 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.170
 unlikely but still might be too 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.939
 and with minor innovations what 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 now you are on the screws recreative 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 if we go over this one here 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.689
 with the search blocks will be shown 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.310
 signature with 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.229
 where they come from i mean what 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.720
 bookmarks this is our building 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.390
 blocks so decorative and so on 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.030
 This principle is convenient for searching for blocks 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.060
 now the desert biome is no longer 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.850
 water is generated of course there will remain 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.610
 lava lakes but the water there is more to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.930
 Unfortunately there will be no more there was a slight 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.270
 fix now 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.390
 craft mats become more logical 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.299
 now when we put two blocks to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.170
 brighten to rica but we get not one but 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.720
 three whole rugs that are more logical and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.640
 correct want think 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.700
 it would be even more correct to receive 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.500
 probably somewhere 16 of these coatings because 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.080
 that all the same blocks are thick and colic 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.420
 thin also in minecraft appeared not 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.880
 quite ordinary function when we beat 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.720
 zombies there is a small chance that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.880
 one more zombie will be born from it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.360
 it happens very very rarely but 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.730
 still sometimes it happens a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 it looks like a zombie crashes 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.560
 little zombies and quickly let's say 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.380
 rises to big so here we are now 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.250
 try to fill them up like that 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.260
 way that more zombies appear but their 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.970
 a dozen a lot not all they want 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.740
 appear in general the chance of this occurrence 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.660
 the zombie is still very small in full 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.430
 Well, in principle, if he was too 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.200
 great we would just not have time 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.740
 kill zombies that would come on 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 help their fellows and so time from 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.070
 the time when you see the sense of a zombie 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.550
 start attacking then be 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.000
 attentive to you may not from nowhere 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.420
 to arrive in time their not comrades who 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.030
 help you eat and while we tested 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.940
 zombies we noticed one weird 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.739
 the feature is most likely a tank then what 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.380
 they are such an incomprehensible way 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.750
 help you can say so here you see 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.269
 they hang in one place and then they 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.220
 can abruptly run after you if you 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.400
 go far away that is incredible 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.440
 speed hope that it will fix and 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.980
 these were all innovations on you on 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.880
 something 13 17th with you were sims face 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.950
 sponge cake he is a bunch of lagging zombies 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.710
