00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.570

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.619
 round what yes i'm ok guys we're going 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.699
 to make some small image shoots to 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:59.260
 I'm going on a hit just to see 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:01.479
 story of warming up ap cameron is 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.820
 already passed ben thank you george is for 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.820
 they balloon his sauce it's gone 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.009
 that programs have noticed 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.579
 little programs it's a little bit more 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.960
 complex 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.060
 what is needed is really adapting 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.380
 with what not to go too hard 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.180
 otherwise they will be badly trained 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.320
 when even grow here we go 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.880
 try to avoid that a bit but that's 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.229
 good we were last year we were 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.390
 in France 2012 2013 was a year with 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 the founders of the movement in the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.399
 founders there is my big brother ilian 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.710
 our fight months the two who are there 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.530
 and robin dassonneville that he could not 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.069
 come summer in France a year ago to 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.750
 evry 91 essonne we did a little tour 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.200
 with the founders because they are 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.200
 seven 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.209
 but we could not see them all we saw 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.209
 there are two will note schobel william bell 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.509
 and ghislain boyer who with laurent 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.540
 piemontesi game almost 6 like that we have 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.009
 we also gave classes with 20 in 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.830
 their cadres in their academy there are 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.429
 a few they have in paris to evry 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.989
 Courchevel did a little tour and we 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.180
 was a little strong but with them it's 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.000
 that now we have the experience to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.010
 learn and we also have the techniques 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.840
 because yes I just want to clarify 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.500
 also that there are many who are 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.880
 melt and genre movies because 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.440
 like my brother this is one of 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.450
 many founders think this is 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 him who taught us everything and everyone 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.280
 not at all actually we learned everything about 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.290
 the heap we really started from a game at 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.440
 start it's really a game a part 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.569
 in kamikaze mode actually to learn 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.040
 and took really all alone 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.870
 only after when we went to France 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.100
 he told us you have all the basics 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.700
 it's good but we just want them 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.019
 sharpening thin is a bit mystical and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 the way to say it but that's it 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.110
 and that balla now we have 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.329
 the experience to learn and to 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.329
 persevere in the art of displacement 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.720
 that's a lot for me 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.700
 represents a lot of things for me 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.040
 because already when I started to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.900
 practice ben it changed me completely 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.660
 actually because if you want my life 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.230
 she was a bit more complicated than 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.480
 christopher at the base and in fact it's 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.920
 when I returned to the group that 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.170
 well when traveling he will really 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.950
 change in fact then there really is this 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.880
 family spirit there the group there it is 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.500
 with the family there that I had after 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.300
 when I got back there that it did not 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.770
 really changed because they are 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.700
 really like christopher told him 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.570
 just now they are really 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.580
 openly and well they did not reject who 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.990
 did not welcome right away and that's 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.709
 that really touched me 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.959
 the spirit of sharing is here it is 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.380
 is a family help this is it 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.500
 what I picked up from the beginning and me 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.360
 but that touched me on the spot 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.330
 and suddenly ben samassa me right away 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.269
 what I started practicing 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.489
 with them 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:53.120
 the a4 below 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:56.069
 what I do is that when I 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.560
 begin to move ben it's like I 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:01.590
 am free I have no I do not put myself 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.270
 rule I do not have two but one rule 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.180
 it is to cross the obstacles that I have 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.550
 in front of me and that it helps me too 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.240
 evacuate all those sprays that I had 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.240
 The problems 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.760
 and frankly thank you for the ski rex 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.040
 and here he has a big room in everything 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.160
 and it's good for young people same time 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.270
 it makes discovering something other than 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.340
 cannabis alcohol and finally I'm doing a 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.980
 little game just pass a little message to 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.810
 every shot there go on like that the 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.000
 Guys the fight continues 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.330
 we must continue so that ours 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.520
 our youth and our country is advancing 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.520
 evolves every day 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.360
 I 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.750
 from pig to hockey a little message 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:39.350

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.290
