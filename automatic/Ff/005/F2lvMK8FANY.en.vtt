00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.149
 two tremors of magnitude 2.5 in the night 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.610
 in emilia seismic swarm also in 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 calabria while the mayors of the municipality of 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.050
 pollino urge the government to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.079

 a tree after losing control 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.880
 of the car probably because of the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.979
 bad weather and high speed 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.420
 a Polish citizen is drowned at 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.189
 the most critical situations in Lazio and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.560
 Venice until next Saturday 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.689
 bad weather will grant a truce that will be 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.189
 but of short duration 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.890
 and let's move on to the silvio policy 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.170
 Berlusconi lowers the tone while you are 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.020

 the former premier reported in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.560
 an interview released on Monday 29 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.869
 October but made public only yesterday 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.299
 it also addressed the topic 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.579
 of the electoral law rejects the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.200

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.840
 Italian 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 and we go beyond Chicago tragedy 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.740
 a woman stabbed her to death 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.920

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.890
 the devil six days ago a similar case 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.850
 also in new york

 five days after the vote for the house 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.170

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.970
 President Barack Obama's Policies c 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.130
 will reduce to a situation of 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.440
 difficulties like the one in europe 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.950
 we see in countries like in Italy 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.720
 Spain 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.510

 comizia in virginia hurricane sandy 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.420
 therefore seems to have favored obama 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.340
 in fact from the last polls the boss 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.480
 of the white house seems to be in 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.490
 benefit 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.070
 he will also use his travels in the 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.590
 been key to convincing the undecided 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.440
 to give him a second term 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.380
 and let's move to soccer sport la 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.650
 Florentine dispels the taboo transfer in 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.150

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.580
