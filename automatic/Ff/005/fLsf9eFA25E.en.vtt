00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.780
Alex, today we have a good toy to you accelerate here in the 'Fast Lap'

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.720
The 600cc champion in the World Supersport

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.420
To a rookie rider, maybe here is a better place to be?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.900
Yeah, but never forget: 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.860
Before you have to do the 300cc, after the 500cc and then this one

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.820
This bike is closer to the 1000cc than the 500cc

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:43.780
The jump of power, suspension, tyre, speed and brakes is closer to the 1000cc

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.060
So, here we are talking about the concept of true sportive bikes

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.340
Is a bike that have a lot of power in the exit of the corners

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.200
You can't incline too much when you are on throttle

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.720
The bike will do whellies

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.660
For a professional rider, is an easy bike to ride

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.260
Because have less power and do everything more easily

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.220
But to an amateur, this bike is more complicated 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.220
I wanna see your performance, let's go?

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.420
Let's go!

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.440
Is a pretty compact bike, appears to be very small

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.100
I feel very big here

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.020
This bike puts you more on the front

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.099
To you have a more sportive ride

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.010
It's a bike very focused in competition, it's the 2014 Supersport World Champion

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.000
Let's be careful with these new tyres

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.540
Let's warm a little bit more the tyre

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.120
You don't have the clutch to do the antiwheelie, that the 1000cc have today

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.360
When you brake you feel your body coming to the front

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.500
Now the tyre is faster, so we can have more efficiency

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.960
Let's do another lap!

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.920
I will have to ride in high rotation, it's not like the 1000cc

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.540
The good torque is over 10000 rpm

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100
It's a versatile bike, fellows

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.673
Good power, let's see in the 'Fast Lap'

00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:07.497
'Fast Lap with Alex Barros'

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.460
The CBR was very good, but stayed behind of the S1000 R which contiunue as our leader

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.000
Next month we will have one more 'Fast Lap' with me

00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:23.631
See you!

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.900
You have to be in a higher torque

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.400
But you cannot lean too much in the corners
