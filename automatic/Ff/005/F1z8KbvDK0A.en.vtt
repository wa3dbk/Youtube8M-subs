00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.910
 she is stuck 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:20.230
 it's not what you see 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:37.420
 realize rallye wherever 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:38.500
 How do you write the gates? 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.020
 I got that back then 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.930
 be met on the in gronau 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.930
 is then come to me because we 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.760
 are real people heartfelt human 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.090
 is down to earth happy that he is here 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.090
 is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:52.090
 the russians are not afraid 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:02:01.780
 but about politics who knows what I have 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:03.280
 we Germans following this is up 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.610
 German translates a dense blow 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.769
 that means a poet goes to the stage 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.269
 performs his poem not pours the 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.959
 just down but rather worried 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.200
 that's what yelling in bottles of wine 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.400
 bring 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.640
 everything else is simple and salad that 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.930
 he sounds a bit stupid that he 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.910
 not in school and then over 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.850
 Street 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.720
 what do you want to do are not so 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.870
 common 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:40.109
 as show act compassion and now but the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.680
 ask where I was or not boring 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.680
 may be 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.200
 The box was super bright and show 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.850
 Look what it looks like because of you 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.010
 most have the problem if they say so 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.900
 yes, you write poems or not 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.360
 the hardest to be creative 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.440
 what should i be about a book about 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.340
 writes you know the problem and you 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.160
 think of anything 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.709
 write about that we are not quite 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.510
 just passive then about that way 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.110
 a poem I have only twelve or 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.110
 even written 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.280
 should I tell you something totally 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.290
 fucking is going on for hours 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.180
 a shit now the mentioned effects 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.730
 your brain eats and afterwards 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.010
 noticed that is totally on is one 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.200
 theme without scissors a thought without meaning 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.709
 a life after the aspiring actually 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.209
 am 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.950
 all that and more comes together 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.950
 is not hard to lose heart 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.780
 if he de-escalates what should i do about it 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.420
 Still say how long should I stay here 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.459
 Circulations are so many stupid questions 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.980
 are out to beat my tie 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.170
 but new theme followers is better 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.250
 with urge to have a good one more now 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.019
 I finally rest 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.840
 the times are over 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.980
 tormenting was too soon 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.980
 again separated 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.530
 that's how we show it can look like this 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.870
 but you can mix it for this 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.660
 be with a tree to the formula thing 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.550
 a little actor can go along with 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.560
 hint that you say okay 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.240
 That's why I'll show you a short while 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.700
 poem from it again later if there 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.580
 it comes closest to me that hung 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:43.520
 that means time is the time 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.160
 Let us feel the time back 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.860
 I still thought of that instant 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.480
 I had it for eternity 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.030
 before eight 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:59.990
 I 've got time forever here 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:03.080
 a break at 20 o'clock it said after 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.990
 home after me why this stress 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.680
 and showed relaxed and was too 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.460
 To suffer 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.430
 but a klaus oestermann oh I have 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.360
 yes, forever shows I did not write it 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.390
 so far 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.419
 I went lichtlein also feeling without 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:33.919
 meal provides the time it passes 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:37.160
 much too fast once it is day after 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.470
 lob is perfect I will tell you times 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.560
 the situation is now wrong have already 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.260
 Your sign is set by what begins 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.720
 and not from what the wind blows 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.150
 here the present has passed 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.760
 are the ones in the area and before 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.979
 showing one more powerful such way 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.530
 something pan begins to plan 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.890
 look into the future after all 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.860
 I finally have enough to say 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:10.060
 not much to say the way it is 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:10.060
 goal and stops thank you
