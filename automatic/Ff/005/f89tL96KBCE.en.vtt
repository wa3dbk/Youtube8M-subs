00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
then the towers collapse like this which

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.380 
then the towers collapse like this which
makes<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.610> very<00:02:40.850> yard<00:02:41.209> over<00:02:41.420> storage<00:02:43.390> it's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
makes it very yard over storage it's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.340 
makes it very yard over storage it's
very<00:02:45.080> easy<00:02:45.380> movement<00:02:46.840> there's<00:02:47.840> later<00:02:48.019> things

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
very easy movement there's later things

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.320 
very easy movement there's later things
that<00:02:48.500> they<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.650> do<00:02:49.010> with<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.300> moving<00:02:50.300> the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
that they can do with it moving the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.500 
that they can do with it moving the
figures<00:02:50.810> about<00:02:51.850> just<00:02:52.850> have<00:02:53.000> loads<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.360> our

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
figures about just have loads of our

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.710 
figures about just have loads of our
benches<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.050> seems<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.470> taking<00:02:54.800> ages<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:56.510> one

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
benches it seems for taking ages the one

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.330 
benches it seems for taking ages the one
thing<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.080> really<00:02:57.350> like<00:02:57.650> about<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:58.100> toy

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
thing that I really like about this toy

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.460 
thing that I really like about this toy
is<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.570> on<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> same<00:03:00.019> scale<00:03:00.440> as

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
is that and it's on the same scale as

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.280 
is that and it's on the same scale as
the<00:03:00.709> final<00:03:01.190> sound<00:03:01.459> playset<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.080> means

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
the final sound playset so that means

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.840 
the final sound playset so that means
that<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.530> can<00:03:03.709> really<00:03:04.040> kind<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.640> have

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
that you can really kind of have

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.309 
that you can really kind of have
adventures<00:03:05.630> with<00:03:06.010> building<00:03:07.010> towers<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:07.819> then

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
adventures with building towers and then

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.990 
adventures with building towers and then
finally<00:03:09.319> sound<00:03:09.560> rescuing<00:03:10.250> people<00:03:10.459> when<00:03:10.850> the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
finally sound rescuing people when the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.090 
finally sound rescuing people when the
tails<00:03:11.269> catching<00:03:11.840> fire<00:03:12.110> all<00:03:12.440> sorts<00:03:12.769> of<00:03:12.890> things

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
tails catching fire all sorts of things

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.670 
tails catching fire all sorts of things
and<00:03:13.340> I've<00:03:13.430> noticed<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:15.170> boys<00:03:15.350> play<00:03:15.650> with

it like that medical girl was two and a

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.110 
it like that medical girl was two and a
half<00:03:18.320> see<00:03:18.920> that's<00:03:19.100> joining<00:03:19.640> these<00:03:19.760> vehicles

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
half see that's joining these vehicles

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.059 
half see that's joining these vehicles
around<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.780> then

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
around and then

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.660 
around and then
with<00:03:21.519> us<00:03:22.230> solid<00:03:23.230> big<00:03:23.439> was<00:03:23.680> exactly<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
with us solid big was exactly like the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.270 
with us solid big was exactly like the
ones<00:03:24.849> in<00:03:24.999> the<00:03:25.060> show<00:03:25.359> so<00:03:25.749> that's<00:03:25.959> great<00:03:26.139> I<00:03:26.530> don't

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
ones in the show so that's great I don't

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.739 
ones in the show so that's great I don't
think<00:03:27.340> there's<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.730> great<00:03:27.939> deal<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.540> can

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:28.749 
think there's a great deal I can

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.709 
think there's a great deal I can
criticize<00:03:29.230> about<00:03:29.379> this<00:03:29.709> boy<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:31.180> really

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:31.719 
criticize about this boy it's really

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.470 
criticize about this boy it's really
good<00:03:31.900> value<00:03:32.439> for<00:03:32.469> money<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:34.090> boys<00:03:34.269> have

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
good value for money the boys have

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.720 
good value for money the boys have
really<00:03:34.510> loved<00:03:35.109> playing<00:03:35.409> with<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:35.980> it's<00:03:36.549> great

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
really loved playing with it it's great

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.599 
really loved playing with it it's great
it's<00:03:37.090> in<00:03:37.299> between<00:03:37.389> levels<00:03:38.459> because<00:03:39.459> there

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
it's in between levels because there

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.330 
it's in between levels because there
aren't<00:03:39.760> actually<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.180> many<00:03:40.540> toys<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:41.340> column

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
aren't actually that many toys a column

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.670 
aren't actually that many toys a column
three<00:03:43.049> levels<00:03:44.049> so<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.260> can<00:03:44.409> have<00:03:44.530> all<00:03:44.560> kinds

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
three levels so you can have all kinds

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.770 
three levels so you can have all kinds
of<00:03:45.069> different<00:03:45.250> approaches<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.090> can<00:03:46.150> build<00:03:46.599> in

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
of different approaches you can build in

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.690 
of different approaches you can build in
a<00:03:47.129> bit<00:03:48.129> role<00:03:48.430> playing<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:49.650> stuff<00:03:50.700> definitely

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
a bit role playing and stuff definitely

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.199 
a bit role playing and stuff definitely
in<00:03:51.819> this<00:03:52.030> house<00:03:52.299> we<00:03:52.540> give<00:03:52.959> us<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.439> step<00:03:54.250> 5<00:03:54.909> out<00:03:55.180> of

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
in this house we give us a step 5 out of

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.420 
in this house we give us a step 5 out of
5<00:03:55.389> I<00:03:55.840> can't<00:03:56.139> praise<00:03:56.379> more<00:03:56.739> highly<00:03:57.069> know<00:03:57.219> it's

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
5 I can't praise more highly know it's

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.789 
5 I can't praise more highly know it's
been<00:03:57.700> really<00:03:57.969> popular<00:03:58.299> kept<00:03:58.989> them<00:03:59.169> up<00:03:59.290> of<00:03:59.590> a

been really popular kept them up of a

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.530 
been really popular kept them up of a
very<00:04:00.040> long<00:04:00.219> time<00:04:00.459> actually<00:04:00.760> use<00:04:01.299> their

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
very long time actually use their

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.519 
very long time actually use their
imagination<00:04:02.199> so<00:04:02.919> I<00:04:02.949> think<00:04:03.219> it's<00:04:03.370> great
