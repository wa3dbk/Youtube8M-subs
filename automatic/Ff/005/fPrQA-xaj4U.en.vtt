00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.090
 and we will continue with the development 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.920
 of the last level of rubik's cube in 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.160
 we already had the face to 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.310
 yellow face already completed now what 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.730
 we want is that these sides remain 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.939
 of the same color 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.000
 and only one can be left in this case 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.759
 there were two you can not then 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.410
 we have to turn and check that it does not 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.440
 there is one left here 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.910
 If you do not have any left if you always 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.850
 it stays two no matter how many times what 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.460
 they can still do this algorithm in 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.430
 either side this is the algorithm which 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.920
 is what I turn the whole cube to 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.410
 left 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.690
 I check what color this is color 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.440
 blue of the twists twice 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.390
 it's blue the blue edge is here 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.480
 Joaquin 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.960
 as it is on the other side I am wearing the blue 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.290
 to the blue that are going to blue now we look at the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.620
 yellow side cube 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.420
 this line is horizontal and 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.549
 vertical 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.710
 So what we want is that we 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.909
 change of meaning that is not here but 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.909
 that is here then we went 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.670
 we give it two laps and lower it 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.780
 if they do not understand they can return the video 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.220
 already for the next step is to return 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.500
 this white line to the white then yes 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.899
 we would return the white line 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.009
 in this way lowering the two times not 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.049
 would fit us well then we have to 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.110
 organize it so that this yellow line 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.670
 match this then if this line 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.070
 yellow is here this white line 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 is here we make them match and the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.079
 we rotate twice to return a 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.580
 white and yellow fish and the edges 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.580
 we were ready 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.900
 Now what we need is to put these 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.520
 last three corners of the in the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.580
 it makes sense 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.780
 that are the only corner that he gave us was 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.490
 this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.319
 now the next algorithm for 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.980
 organize this corner to go here 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.440
 and it is here and it is here is the following 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.940
 without any of the corners I say 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.100
 can they do this the same algorithm in 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.530
 any of the corners in any 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.850
 from the sides until I give them the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.520
 next algorithm has to be done 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.250
 that the corner that gave them is up to 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.470
 the left now looking at the face 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.410
 yellow we do the following algorithm 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.580
 right twice 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.580
 up twice 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.370
 straight 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.799
 clockwise 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.290
 down sense clock right sense 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:08.220
 counter-clockwise 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.630
 up twice 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:18.090
 right clockwise 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:23.280
 and down counterclockwise 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.560
 and right clockwise 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.050
 now if they changed us is the one 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.700
 was here is already here what is 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.350
 here is already here that was here already 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.450
 is here in still not being us 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.850
 organized we have to perform is the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.480
 algorithm once more 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.850
 right twice 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.830
 up twice 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:50.200
 right sense time below sense 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:54.129
 schedule 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.580
 right counterclockwise up two 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.580
 times 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.330
 right clockwise and down sense 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.140
 counter-clockwise 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.680
 and the right sense 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.520
 schedule and we were resolved our 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.520
 Rubik's Cube
