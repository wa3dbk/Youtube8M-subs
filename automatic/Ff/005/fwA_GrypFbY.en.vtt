give<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.610> bit<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> head<00:01:24.180> nod<00:01:24.390> or

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
give them a little bit of a head nod or

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.070 
give them a little bit of a head nod or
something<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.250> could<00:01:26.400> also<00:01:26.430> be

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
something like that that could also be

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.380 
something like that that could also be
changed<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.740> switched<00:01:29.729> out<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> wave

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
changed up or switched out for the wave

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
changed up or switched out for the wave
the<00:01:30.689> other<00:01:30.900> thing<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.500> suppose<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the other thing I suppose with it is and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 
the other thing I suppose with it is and
maybe<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> deeper<00:01:33.840> question<00:01:34.320> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
maybe this is the deeper question is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.550 
maybe this is the deeper question is
what<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> weight<00:01:36.119> towards

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
what do you do do you weight towards

what do you do do you weight towards
cruisers<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> stuff<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.700> my

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
cruisers and stuff like that and my

it is kind of with the reason why you

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.640 
it is kind of with the reason why you
don't<00:03:27.459> see<00:03:27.639> very<00:03:27.790> many<00:03:28.000> cruisers<00:03:28.569> waving<00:03:29.560> at

cruisers and you know there's kind of

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.160 
cruisers and you know there's kind of
like<00:03:32.829> just<00:03:32.950> that<00:03:33.340> uh

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
like just that uh

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.650 
like just that uh
a<00:03:34.290> little<00:03:34.709> bit<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.630> tension<00:03:36.630> between

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
a little bit of like a tension between

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.710 
a little bit of like a tension between
the<00:03:37.200> two<00:03:37.230> groups<00:03:37.530> possibly<00:03:38.360> there's<00:03:39.360> just<00:03:39.599> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
the two groups possibly there's just a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.630 
the two groups possibly there's just a
bunch<00:03:40.050> of<00:03:40.170> different<00:03:40.260> factors<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.830> play<00:03:41.010> and

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
bunch of different factors that play and

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.979 
bunch of different factors that play and
I'm<00:03:41.849> not<00:03:42.000> really<00:03:42.120> sure<00:03:42.239> why<00:03:42.599> there<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:42.959> this

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
I'm not really sure why there is this

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.380 
I'm not really sure why there is this
rivalry<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:44.280> seems<00:03:44.610> like<00:03:44.700> there<00:03:44.910> always<00:03:45.090> has

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
rivalry it seems like there always has

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.540 
rivalry it seems like there always has
been<00:03:45.420> an<00:03:45.690> issue<00:03:45.840> or<00:03:46.349> some<00:03:46.950> sort<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.280> fight

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550

sure it's the attitude to other people
on<00:03:58.770> cruisers<00:03:59.280> or<00:03:59.610> if<00:03:59.880> it's<00:04:00.000> out<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.450> tubes

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
on cruisers or if it's out of the tubes

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
of the people on sports bikes I'm sure

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.670 
of the people on sports bikes I'm sure
it's<00:04:02.640> actually<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> combination<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.480> both<00:04:03.680> but

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
it's actually a combination of both but

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.290 
it's actually a combination of both but
nonetheless<00:04:05.010> i<00:04:05.550> understand<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.239> know

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
so I can kind of go against the norm

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.740 
so I can kind of go against the norm
maybe<00:04:16.829> convince<00:04:17.250> somebody<00:04:17.639> to<00:04:17.850> start<00:04:18.389> waving

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
to what I said earlier if I see a

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.480 
to what I said earlier if I see a
cruiser<00:04:22.590> broke<00:04:22.889> down<00:04:23.070> on<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.190> side<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
cruiser broke down on the side of the

road<00:04:23.610> I'm<00:04:23.729> definitely<00:04:23.850> going<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.180> stop<00:04:24.360> and

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
road I'm definitely going to stop and

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.300 
road I'm definitely going to stop and
ask<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.139> can<00:04:25.200> do<00:04:25.380> anything<00:04:25.620> for<00:04:25.770> them<00:04:26.160> if<00:04:26.250> I

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
ask if I can do anything for them if I

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.400 
ask if I can do anything for them if I
see<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> sports<00:04:26.820> bike<00:04:27.000> broken<00:04:27.479> down<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.810> would<00:04:28.320> do

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
see a sports bike broken down I would do

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.080 
see a sports bike broken down I would do
the<00:04:28.440> same<00:04:28.530> thing<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:29.070> scooter<00:04:29.460> same<00:04:29.820> thing

the same thing a scooter same thing

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.320 
the same thing a scooter same thing
doesn't<00:04:30.479> really<00:04:30.600> matter<00:04:30.840> so

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
doesn't really matter so

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.300 
doesn't really matter so
I<00:04:32.449> would<00:04:32.990> hope<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.199> that's<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.949> that's<00:04:34.189> the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
I would hope that that's the that's the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.679 
I would hope that that's the that's the
mindset<00:04:34.699> and<00:04:34.970> those<00:04:35.090> are<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.270> thoughts<00:04:35.539> of
