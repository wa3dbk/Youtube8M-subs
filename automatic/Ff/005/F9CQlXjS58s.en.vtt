just<00:03:11.350> yesterday<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.920> used<00:03:12.460> it<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.910> make<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
just yesterday I used it to make a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.140 
just yesterday I used it to make a
stop-motion<00:03:14.290> video<00:03:14.980> using<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.640> software

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
stop-motion video using this software

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.750 
stop-motion video using this software
I'm<00:03:17.020> not<00:03:17.320> sure<00:03:17.650> if<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:19.800> ruined<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:20.890> camera<00:03:21.190> or

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
I'm not sure if it ruined the camera or

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.199 
I'm not sure if it ruined the camera or
whatever<00:03:22.270> it<00:03:22.510> did<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:23.080> got<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.530> from

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
whatever it did I got it from

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.640 
whatever it did I got it from
download.com<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:26.050> I<00:03:26.110> don't<00:03:26.290> think<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.560> could

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
download.com so I don't think it could

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.320 
download.com so I don't think it could
have<00:03:26.709> any<00:03:26.980> kind<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.220> virus<00:03:27.610> attached<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.180> it
