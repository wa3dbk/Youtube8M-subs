00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
yeah the secret is currently in the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.440 
yeah the secret is currently in the
second<00:01:10.740> finger<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.039> I<00:01:11.460> had<00:01:11.970> never<00:01:12.149> heard<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
second finger and I had never heard that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.600 
second finger and I had never heard that
before<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.350> started<00:01:13.710> incorporating<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
before and I started incorporating it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.120 
before and I started incorporating it
into<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:15.000> technique<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.690> sure<00:01:16.500> enough<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
into my technique and sure enough it

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
into my technique and sure enough it
creates<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> more<00:01:17.940> relaxed<00:01:18.690> feeling<00:01:19.229> by

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
creates a more relaxed feeling by

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.250 
creates a more relaxed feeling by
curling<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> second<00:01:20.790> finger<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.360> refresh<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
curling the second finger to refresh a

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.140 
curling the second finger to refresh a
little<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.280> basic<00:01:23.790> octave

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
little bit about the basic octave

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.490 
little bit about the basic octave
technique<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> comes<00:01:25.200> from<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
technique is that it comes from the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.740 
technique is that it comes from the
wrist<00:01:25.770> because<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> arms<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.420> fast

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
wrist because the arms are not fast

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
wrist because the arms are not fast
enough<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.260> play<00:01:28.470> octaves<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.640> could

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
enough to play octaves as I could

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.580 
enough to play octaves as I could
demonstrate

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.679 

of<00:01:33.950> course<00:01:34.939> when<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.210> play<00:01:35.360> with<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.600> wrists

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
of course when you play with the wrists

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.710 
of course when you play with the wrists
they<00:01:38.689> can<00:01:38.810> go<00:01:38.899> much<00:01:39.259> more<00:01:39.500> quickly<00:01:39.939> but<00:01:40.939> what

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
they can go much more quickly but what

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.840 
they can go much more quickly but what
is<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.960> about<00:01:42.049> curling<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.100> thumb<00:01:43.369> under<00:01:43.700> that

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850

something to do with how it impacts the
muscles<00:02:05.869> because<00:02:06.440> as<00:02:06.560> I've<00:02:06.679> described<00:02:07.130> before

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220

creating<00:02:08.149> an<00:02:08.330> octave<00:02:08.720> technique<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.319> like<00:02:09.560> an

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
creating an octave technique is like an

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.120 
creating an octave technique is like an
arch<00:02:10.900> equalizing<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.049> power<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.769> pinkie

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
arch equalizing the power of the pinkie

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.699 
arch equalizing the power of the pinkie
to<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.459> strong<00:02:13.850> thumb<00:02:14.299> yuku<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.530> can

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
to the strong thumb yuku you can

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.470 
to the strong thumb yuku you can
actually<00:02:15.860> impart<00:02:16.580> equal<00:02:17.030> weight<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.390> both

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
actually impart equal weight on both

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.070 
actually impart equal weight on both
fingers<00:02:18.470> by<00:02:18.680> utilizing<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.400> arch<00:02:19.580> by<00:02:20.540> curling

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
fingers by utilizing the arch by curling

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.410 
fingers by utilizing the arch by curling
the<00:02:21.140> second<00:02:21.560> finger<00:02:21.769> it<00:02:22.160> makes<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:22.880> position

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
the second finger it makes this position

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.140 
the second finger it makes this position
much<00:02:23.780> more<00:02:24.019> effortless<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.310> when<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.000> get

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
much more effortless so when you get

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.789 
much more effortless so when you get
into<00:02:26.269> an<00:02:26.420> octave<00:02:26.690> position<00:02:26.780> try<00:02:27.200> curling<00:02:27.709> your

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
into an octave position try curling your

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.400 
into an octave position try curling your
second<00:02:28.190> bigger<00:02:28.340> that's<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.849> tip<00:02:29.060> today

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410
