00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.579

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.920
 that 3 you have to find some for the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.400

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.700

 a region of tutorials 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.630

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.680
 many times I have called attention 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.680
 asked about inbox and by mail 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.890
 as you can see 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.800
 there are many models 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.310
 they are some motorcycles that we must 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.180
 have it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.259
 so we must place it by memory 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.060
 externally and then behind by copper and 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.490
 pose it is simple once did not delay 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.240

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.240
