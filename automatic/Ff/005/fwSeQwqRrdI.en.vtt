 presented by photoshop podcast.de her 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.700
 profi cast for digital image processing 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.840
 small workshop like the comic look 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.900
 Martial character of a scene still 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.360
 Strengthened and how to achieve the look 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 this film illustrates in this 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.470
 I show you how to film them 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.689
 Comic effect with this grid 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.730
 this exit photo in a few 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 can achieve and that is 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 I just go to the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 output file and first of all 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.879
 we have to duplicate the plane and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.150
 so we turned remain flexible 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.559
 then we call this in a smart object 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.930
 I now just the filter gallery 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.690
 on because I need more filter than the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.909
 which we find here and indeed need 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.000
 We two filters and I filter to myself 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.500
 times on window fitting you see the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.119
 Here also looks quite good sound 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.430
 separation and edge emphasis that is 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.470
 for comic-like effects is the gar 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.880
 not so bad can here 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.590
 the separation also sink and already 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.330
 we have such a comic-like effect 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.650
 but that's what this video is all about 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 not but he should be a little different 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.409
 look and I use here for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.149
 stylization the stamp filter in the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.780
 default setting yes there he does not 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.520
 so much ago 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.590
 I'll just put it on now 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.679
 other values ​​and that increases first 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.450
 once the light dark balance look 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.999
 Let's see what that looks like 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.289
 few more details back and the 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.299
 Smoothing we need a little bit 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.399
 go back with more details 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.759
 come to light as you can see already 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.899
 what happens and I would say that 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.659
 bright dark balance we can still one 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.670
 increase a bit 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.249
 Let's see what that looks like at 43 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.659
 yes that looks pretty good I think that 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:49.460
 Smoothing maybe to a minimum 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.079
 put 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.909
 that's too much of a good one I think 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.499
 with four that was very good 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.179
 stylized way and now we build 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.530
 another filter and leave it 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.749
 I do not even the filter gallery until 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 but I'm stacking it right here 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.039
 the stamp filter in which I here one 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.929
 new effect level investor has now been 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.729
 here the stamp effect applied 2 times 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.760
 but what I want to apply now is 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.350
 the restaurants effect in the mode 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.910
 line already set here 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.400
 and there I would like to have a something 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.950
 thicker line so we have to take 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.200
 just a line in the thick of 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.720
 3 and the contrast can be a little higher 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.340
 his 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:31.240
 the whole thing is not so gray 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.890
 Let's have a look at 26 27 das 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.190
 is quite good we'll stay with you 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.000
 so they value 27 and they like that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.860
 I'm fine now 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.880
 I confirm all and everything 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.500
 we have to do that now 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.670
 rastering effect here in the sky going on 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.410
 because he likes me there 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.810
 not at all and we will do it all 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.800
 color the picture a little bit more 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.330
 First of all we have to go to heaven 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.010
 We'll do that best here 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.130
 in the original picture I just take it 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.090
 the quick - selection tool and choose 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.459
 Here's the sky and look that is 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.810
 not exactly okay in these 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.130
 there are enough areas and me 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.750
 see with the quick selection changes 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.250
 I will not come here 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.260
 that's why i press control and the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.630
 Let's take the color empire 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.490
 selection namely localized color 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.450
 Groups have a low tolerance clique 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.160
 once in the sky 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.420
 and I have almost achieved what I have 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.640
 I would like to here is the sky 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.430
 Add and there and that's it 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.390
 I can work at a smaller area 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.170
 here also with held old key 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.110
 deduct these areas so that the house 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.120
 Do not overflow with rhine in here 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.280
 this choice if it is still a bit 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.560
 with it in it does not matter 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.019
 is stylized yes anyway ok now 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.310
 I'm ok with that after I go here 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.090
 the small areas still added 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.459
 have so and now just lay over the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.280
 level that we have stylized here one 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.769
 color area to the then has automatically 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.000
 as mask the just created selection 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.830
 and you see now the sky is beautiful 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.110
 clean and that looks much better 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.280
 from marl in before-and-after comparison 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.950
 before, afterwards 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.989
 It is clear that we are at a comic 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.670
 Implementation more pretty clear areas 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.870
 need and that supports this 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.400
 just now I have the whole thing 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.980
 I'll just do one more with you 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.810
 a course I take so here 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.390
 take a two-tone course what 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.700
 We're just taking blue 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.620
 orange look how that looks like and 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.479
 So that color with the underground 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.160
 we will offset the whole 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.030
 simply negative in the flat mode 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.530
 multiply 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.330
 that looks pretty good i would 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.690
 maybe the bright tones still in one 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.890
 pure red transform and I do that 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.889
 by double-clicking on it 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.780
 make 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.030
 and here the hue towards red 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.969
 move and now we have the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.680
 Result achieved what I in the original 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.930
 had you see this is blue 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.669
 maybe a little different maybe 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.710
 a little too bright I like that 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.569
 in the thus created version almost still 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.939
 better and you see how easy that is 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.840
 with the help of the filter gallery and one 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.840
 course filling
