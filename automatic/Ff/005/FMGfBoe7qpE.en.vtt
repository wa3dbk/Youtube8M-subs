00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.259

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.259

 they left their winrar as well as this we give 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.420
 right click extract here once 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.429

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.920
 folder that is to install whatsapp for 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.049
 pcs in error we open them and as you see 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.270
 here in the installer of the program this 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.759
 program is the same as you can 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.170
 download from the official page but if 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.670
 you download it from the page 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.789
 official will download the version 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.069
 newest of this program and because this 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.020
 program my name works because my 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.640
 computer does not meet the requirements 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.070
 to install in what would be the 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.480
 program of the official page and then if 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.400
 this is an older version of the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.680
 program then this version if I 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.960
 they grab then this is in the case for 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.700
 that you have a PC many areas and 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.100
 as they watch it they download it by average 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.110
 external firewall if you have a 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.810
 very fast pc they download it from the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.080
 good official page I downloaded the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.540
 of the mediafire page read double 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.910

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.880
 installer of the program we give in 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.080

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.000
 state 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.710
 we hope that if it does not come out what 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.340
 would the program this program towards 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.800
