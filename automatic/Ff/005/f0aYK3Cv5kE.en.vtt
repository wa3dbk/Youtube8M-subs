00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
have to walk through here here we have

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
have to walk through here here we have
some<00:02:01.890> computers<00:02:02.490> which<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.360> added<00:02:03.540> later

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
some computers which will be added later

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.889 
some computers which will be added later
because<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.460> sign<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:06.810> we

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
because now it's just a sign and then we

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.279 
because now it's just a sign and then we
can<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.560> here

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.000 

looks<00:02:10.890> pretty<00:02:11.280> isn't<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.560> even<00:02:13.709> found

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
looks pretty isn't it and I even found

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.100 
looks pretty isn't it and I even found
little<00:02:14.310> mistake<00:02:14.730> all<00:02:15.360> right<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.690> then<00:02:15.810> here

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
little mistake all right and then here

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990 
little mistake all right and then here
there<00:02:16.349> will<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.650> plane<00:02:17.010> out<00:02:17.280> later<00:02:17.819> on

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
there will be a plane out later on

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.110 
there will be a plane out later on
because<00:02:18.420> now<00:02:18.599> it's<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.019> empty<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.120> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
because now it's just empty and the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.839 
because now it's just empty and the
first<00:02:21.390> plane<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.739> for<00:02:23.430> now<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:23.790> just

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
first plane that we have for now is just

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.470 
first plane that we have for now is just
this<00:02:24.450> plane<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.349> looks<00:02:25.590> rather<00:02:26.129> cool<00:02:26.760> ultimate

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
this plane it looks rather cool ultimate

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320 
this plane it looks rather cool ultimate
this<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.769> only<00:02:28.920> thing<00:02:29.129> which<00:02:29.549> isn't<00:02:29.879> built

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
this is the only thing which isn't built

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.650 
this is the only thing which isn't built
for<00:02:30.569> me<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:31.410> um<00:02:32.340> yeah<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.299> told<00:02:33.540> my

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.220 
parts of the airport so far it's really
very<00:03:20.250> realistic<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.900> 200<00:03:22.410> meters<00:03:23.060> 175

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230

first<00:04:09.359> let's<00:04:09.540> take<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.750> better<00:04:10.590> look<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.340> at

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
first let's take a better look to you at

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.420 
first let's take a better look to you at
the<00:04:11.849> windows<00:04:12.209> here<00:04:12.419> it's<00:04:12.599> actually<00:04:13.280> know<00:04:14.280> my

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
the windows here it's actually know my

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.849 
the windows here it's actually know my
role<00:04:14.669> did<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:15.000> because<00:04:15.599> those<00:04:15.750> are<00:04:15.959> all<00:04:16.079> snow

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
role did it because those are all snow

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.130 
role did it because those are all snow
layers<00:04:17.130> above<00:04:17.579> each<00:04:17.760> other<00:04:18.030> which<00:04:18.750> yeah

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
layers above each other which yeah

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.190 
layers above each other which yeah
created<00:04:19.979> very<00:04:20.280> nice

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
created very nice

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.680 
created very nice
oh<00:04:21.910> yeah<00:04:22.910> detail<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.480> think<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:26.330> then<00:04:26.480> those

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
oh yeah detail I think and then those

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.350 
oh yeah detail I think and then those
arches<00:04:27.260> here<00:04:27.500> it's<00:04:27.800> just<00:04:28.220> yeah<00:04:28.610> add<00:04:28.850> some

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
arches here it's just yeah add some

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.570 
arches here it's just yeah add some
detail<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:29.930> add<00:04:30.140> some<00:04:30.380> support<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:31.130> the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
detail and add some support to the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.660 
detail and add some support to the
molding<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.120> guess<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.830> yeah<00:04:34.190> here<00:04:34.460> we<00:04:34.580> have

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
molding I guess and yeah here we have

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.380 
molding I guess and yeah here we have
like<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:35.120> huge<00:04:35.420> pedestrian<00:04:36.230> walk<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.970> anyways

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
like a huge pedestrian walk the anyways

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.990 
like a huge pedestrian walk the anyways
this<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.050> like<00:04:39.260> also<00:04:39.920> a<00:04:39.950> very<00:04:40.400> nice<00:04:40.580> fence

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
this is like also a very nice fence

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.230 
this is like also a very nice fence
design<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.570> think<00:04:42.610> then<00:04:43.610> we<00:04:43.640> when<00:04:44.270> we<00:04:44.420> are<00:04:44.600> here

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
design I think then we when we are here

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.380 
design I think then we when we are here
in<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.540> airport<00:04:47.990> we<00:04:48.230> will<00:04:48.530> be<00:04:48.740> able<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.390> access

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
in the airport we will be able to access

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.110 
in the airport we will be able to access
the<00:04:50.810> outside<00:04:51.230> later<00:04:51.530> on<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:52.490> then<00:04:52.700> watching

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
the outside later on to then watching

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.960 
the outside later on to then watching
tower<00:04:53.360> which<00:04:54.170> will<00:04:56.110> lead<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.320> those<00:04:57.980> doors<00:04:58.310> we

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
tower which will lead to those doors we

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.880 
tower which will lead to those doors we
can<00:04:59.150> get<00:04:59.300> out<00:04:59.420> but<00:04:59.600> still<00:04:59.900> it's<00:05:00.080> pretty<00:05:00.380> dark<00:05:00.650> I

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
can get out but still it's pretty dark I

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.670 
can get out but still it's pretty dark I
will<00:05:01.160> work<00:05:01.310> on<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.520> later<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.870> very<00:05:03.440> nice

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
will work on it later and a very nice

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.100 
will work on it later and a very nice
feature<00:05:03.950> here<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:05.060> is<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.360> office<00:05:05.630> building

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
feature here this is the office building

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.800 
feature here this is the office building
and<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.790> office<00:05:07.790> building<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.180> connected

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
and the office building is connected
