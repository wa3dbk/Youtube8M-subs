00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and things that you could use just a

whole load of stuff that I felt would

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.400 
whole load of stuff that I felt would
really<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> waste<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.570> money<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.170> didn't

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
really be a waste of money if I didn't

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.950 
really be a waste of money if I didn't
at<00:00:52.620> least<00:00:52.680> use<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.520> good<00:00:54.030> portion<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.780> rather

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
at least use a good portion of it rather

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
at least use a good portion of it rather
than<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.559> single<00:00:55.800> arm<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.090> weapon<00:00:57.539> set

than just a single arm and weapon set
for<00:00:57.960> each<00:00:58.050> character<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.280> i<00:00:59.930> decided<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.020> i

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
for each character so i decided that i

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
for each character so i decided that i
was<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> magnetize<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.219> much<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.640> each

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
was going to magnetize as much of each

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
was going to magnetize as much of each
of<00:01:02.879> these<00:01:02.969> models<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.600> could<00:01:03.899> um<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> then

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
of these models as I could um and then

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.490 
of these models as I could um and then
I'd<00:01:05.790> secured<00:01:06.210> there's<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> slight<00:01:06.689> problem<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
I'd secured there's a slight problem so

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.630 
I'd secured there's a slight problem so
I<00:01:07.530> decided<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> put<00:01:08.159> together<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.430> little

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
I decided to put together a little

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.920 
I decided to put together a little
tutorial<00:01:08.909> show<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.270> how<00:01:09.450> I've<00:01:09.600> been<00:01:09.720> using

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
tutorial show you how I've been using

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.890 
tutorial show you how I've been using
green<00:01:10.229> stuff<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.799> rectify<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> issue<00:01:11.900> okay

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
green stuff to rectify that issue okay

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.440 
green stuff to rectify that issue okay
so<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.760> lease<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.909> minus<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
so this is the lease of minus all that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
so this is the lease of minus all that
I'm<00:01:15.509> working<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.869> currently<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.740> guy

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.010 
that's going to be holding the standard
and<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.170> decided<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:19.830> make<00:01:20.100> him<00:01:20.369> a

single<00:01:22.020> solid<00:01:22.380> creature<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.580> his<00:01:23.759> arms

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
single solid creature so his arms

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
single solid creature so his arms
they're<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.020> magnetized<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.770> any<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.820> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
they're not magnetized in any way but I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.190 
they're not magnetized in any way but I
decided<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.810> guys<00:01:28.020> who

do that obvious I'm going to have to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.310 
do that obvious I'm going to have to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
problem with the beastmen is that sorry

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.039 
problem with the beastmen is that sorry
with<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> monitors<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.909> where<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.899> arm

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
with the monitors is that where the arm

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.410 
with the monitors is that where the arm
connects<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.420> regular

connects you have these little regular

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.920 
connects you have these little regular
sort<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:52.100> triangular<00:01:53.100> sections<00:01:53.810> which<00:01:54.810> are

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
sort of triangular sections which are

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.880 
sort of triangular sections which are
perfect<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.950> mounting<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.030> magnet<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.890> however

not<00:01:59.729> all<00:01:59.790> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> arms<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.110> an<00:02:01.229> exact<00:02:01.590> copy

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
not all of the arms have an exact copy

not all of the arms have an exact copy
of<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.670> shape<00:02:03.030> where<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> would<00:02:03.899> attach

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
of that shape where you would attach

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
of that shape where you would attach
them<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.649> they<00:02:05.219> actually<00:02:05.399> attach<00:02:05.729> around<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
them and they actually attach around the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.969 
them and they actually attach around the
rim<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.259> there's<00:02:07.439> nowhere<00:02:07.770> really

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
rim like this so there's nowhere really

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.120 
rim like this so there's nowhere really
suitable<00:02:08.459> there<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.270> attach<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.810> magnet

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
suitable there to attach a magnet

suitable there to attach a magnet
and<00:02:12.130> it's<00:02:12.340> not<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.520> complicated<00:02:12.880> but<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.720> I'm

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
and it's not a complicated but all I'm

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.059 
and it's not a complicated but all I'm
going<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.080> do<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.290> take<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.530> little<00:02:14.709> freshly

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
going to do is take a little freshly

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.830 
going to do is take a little freshly
molted<00:02:15.400> green<00:02:15.760> stuff<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:18.390> sculpting<00:02:19.390> tool<00:02:19.390> this

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
molted green stuff a sculpting tool this

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.600 
molted green stuff a sculpting tool this
is<00:02:19.990> one<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.350> gale<00:02:20.530> force<00:02:20.709> nine<00:02:20.830> ones<00:02:21.280> but

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
is one of the gale force nine ones but

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
is one of the gale force nine ones but
anything<00:02:22.330> will<00:02:22.420> do<00:02:22.630> anything<00:02:22.900> metal<00:02:23.200> with<00:02:23.470> a

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
anything will do anything metal with a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.460 
anything will do anything metal with a
little<00:02:23.770> flat<00:02:24.100> bit<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:25.569> have<00:02:26.140> some<00:02:26.319> water

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
little flat bit on it I have some water

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.199 
little flat bit on it I have some water
off<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.950> side<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.580> want<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.910> model

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
off to the side and I want the model

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.090 
off to the side and I want the model
that<00:02:28.330> I'm<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.350> magnetize<00:02:29.770> also<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.920> what

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
that I'm going to magnetize also so what

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.440 
that I'm going to magnetize also so what
I'm<00:02:33.160> going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.610> take<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.030> little<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
I'm going to do is take a little of the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.070 
I'm going to do is take a little of the
green<00:02:34.660> stuff<00:02:36.150> push<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.330> down<00:02:37.480> into<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> arm

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
green stuff push it down into the arm

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.570 
green stuff push it down into the arm
flatten<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.069> with<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.600> sculpting<00:02:40.600> tool<00:02:40.810> I

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
flatten it out with the sculpting tool I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.350 
flatten it out with the sculpting tool I
remember<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.640> need<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.850> be<00:02:42.940> dipping<00:02:43.269> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
remember you need to be dipping the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.940 
remember you need to be dipping the
sculpting<00:02:43.750> tool<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.050> water<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
sculpting tool in water so that the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.310 
sculpting tool in water so that the
green<00:02:45.130> stuff<00:02:45.340> doesn't<00:02:45.670> stick<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.120> but<00:02:47.050> so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
green stuff doesn't stick to that but so

00:02:47.320 --> 00:03:05.520 
green stuff doesn't stick to that but so
that<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.590> only<00:02:47.739> sticks<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.430> arm

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.110 

now<00:03:06.530> it's<00:03:06.680> almost<00:03:06.890> certainly<00:03:07.250> too<00:03:07.700> much<00:03:07.850> green

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
now it's almost certainly too much green

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.640 
now it's almost certainly too much green
stuff<00:03:08.360> there<00:03:08.660> but<00:03:08.690> that's<00:03:08.900> okay<00:03:09.200> because<00:03:09.230> it's

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
stuff there but that's okay because it's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.710 
stuff there but that's okay because it's
going<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.830> come<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.220> sides<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.790> do<00:03:11.600> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
going to come out the sides and I do the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.320 
going to come out the sides and I do the
next<00:03:11.900> bit<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.610> for<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.700> next<00:03:13.730> bit<00:03:14.030> what<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.180> want

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
next bit so for the next bit what I want

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.880 
next bit so for the next bit what I want
to<00:03:14.390> do<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.540> make<00:03:14.930> sure<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.260> there's<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.440> little

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
to do is make sure that there's a little

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.470 
to do is make sure that there's a little
bit<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.130> water<00:03:16.280> covering<00:03:16.820> all<00:03:17.000> around<00:03:17.300> this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
bit of water covering all around this

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.760 
bit of water covering all around this
area<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:17.990> I<00:03:18.050> don't<00:03:18.170> want<00:03:18.290> any<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.560> green

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
area so I don't want any of the green

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.190 
area so I don't want any of the green
stuff<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.160> stick<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.580> that<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.660> I'm<00:03:20.750> gonna<00:03:21.050> dip

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
stuff to stick to that so I'm gonna dip

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.260 
stuff to stick to that so I'm gonna dip
my<00:03:21.320> finger<00:03:21.590> in<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.800> water<00:03:22.090> spread<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.180> on

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
my finger in the water spread it on

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.720 
my finger in the water spread it on
there<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:24.280> make<00:03:25.280> sure<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:25.550> nice<00:03:25.670> and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
there like that make sure it's nice and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.300 
there like that make sure it's nice and
damp<00:03:26.150> all<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.480> way<00:03:26.570> around<00:03:27.040> all<00:03:28.040> you're<00:03:28.220> going

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
damp all the way around all you're going

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.050 
damp all the way around all you're going
to<00:03:28.370> do<00:03:28.520> then<00:03:29.440> just<00:03:30.440> take<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.800> arm<00:03:30.950> line<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:31.940> up

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
to do then just take the arm line it up

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.470 
to do then just take the arm line it up
the<00:03:32.209> way<00:03:32.330> you<00:03:32.390> want<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:32.989> push<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.010> down

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
the way you want it and push it down

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.970 
the way you want it and push it down
onto<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.510> monitor

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.649 

but<00:03:44.550> a<00:03:44.580> bit<00:03:44.760> too<00:03:44.849> much<00:03:44.940> green<00:03:45.209> stuff<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.510> there

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
but a bit too much green stuff in there

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.420 
but a bit too much green stuff in there
so<00:03:45.870> going<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.290> push<00:03:46.440> quite<00:03:46.680> hard<00:03:46.920> and<00:03:47.280> you'll

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
so going to push quite hard and you'll

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.580 
so going to push quite hard and you'll
see<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.670> all<00:03:47.730> squid<00:03:48.120> out<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.390> size<00:03:48.569> you<00:03:49.440> don't

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
see it all squid out the size you don't

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.080 
see it all squid out the size you don't
leave<00:03:49.769> on<00:03:49.920> too<00:03:50.129> long<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.489> just<00:03:50.640> immediately

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
leave on too long so just immediately

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.930 
leave on too long so just immediately
pull<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.110> away<00:03:52.230> from<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.739> monitor<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.400> what

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
pull it away from the monitor and what

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.509 
pull it away from the monitor and what
you're<00:03:54.090> left<00:03:54.239> with<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.780> an<00:03:55.739> impression<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.340> the

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
you're left with is an impression in the

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.460 
you're left with is an impression in the
green<00:03:56.730> stuff<00:03:56.970> exactly<00:03:57.690> how<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.870> minor<00:03:58.170> tours

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
green stuff exactly how the minor tours

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.180 
green stuff exactly how the minor tours
I<00:04:01.670> guess<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:02.819> the<00:04:02.849> shoulder<00:04:03.330> section<00:04:03.780> is

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
I guess it's the shoulder section is

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.410 
I guess it's the shoulder section is
presented<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.879> that<00:04:05.910> will<00:04:06.120> give<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.360> a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
presented and that will give you a

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.509 
presented and that will give you a
perfect<00:04:06.690> flat<00:04:07.680> spot<00:04:07.980> so<00:04:08.129> I'm<00:04:08.220> going<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.400> be

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
perfect flat spot so I'm going to be

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.210 
perfect flat spot so I'm going to be
mounting<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:08.879> magnet<00:04:09.180> here<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:10.040> one<00:04:11.040> on<00:04:11.190> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
mounting a magnet here and one on the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.710 
mounting a magnet here and one on the
same<00:04:12.739> same<00:04:13.739> flat<00:04:14.370> plane<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:15.060> inside<00:04:15.510> where

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
same same flat plane just inside where

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.990 
same same flat plane just inside where
the<00:04:15.810> green<00:04:15.989> stuff<00:04:16.199> is<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:17.430> just<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.669> finish<00:04:17.850> up

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the green stuff is and just to finish up

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.979 
the green stuff is and just to finish up
I'm<00:04:18.150> going<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.359> take<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:19.410> flat<00:04:20.660> knife<00:04:21.660> like

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
I'm going to take the flat knife like

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.270 
I'm going to take the flat knife like
side<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.410> this<00:04:22.470> sculpting<00:04:22.889> tool<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.160> just

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
side of this sculpting tool and just

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.930 
side of this sculpting tool and just
trim<00:04:23.460> away<00:04:23.610> or<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.870> excess<00:04:25.229> green<00:04:25.470> stuff

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
trim away or the excess green stuff

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.969 
trim away or the excess green stuff
let's<00:04:26.940> come<00:04:27.270> up<00:04:27.300> on<00:04:27.690> there<00:04:28.110> before<00:04:28.560> any<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.860> it

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
let's come up on there before any of it

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.300 
let's come up on there before any of it
dries<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.280> could<00:04:30.000> become<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.479> problem<00:04:30.539> later<00:04:31.169> on

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
dries it could become a problem later on

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.140 
dries it could become a problem later on
obviously<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.370> could<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.669> with<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> hobby

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
obviously you could do this with a hobby

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.770 
obviously you could do this with a hobby
knife<00:04:33.919> or<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:34.979> craft<00:04:35.370> knife<00:04:35.610> whatever<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.090> like

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.779 

so<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.020> have<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.169> one<00:04:40.500> armed<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.010> ready

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
so there you have it one armed and ready

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.790 
so there you have it one armed and ready
to<00:04:41.910> be<00:04:42.030> magnetized<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.930> used<00:04:43.320> in<00:04:43.590> multiple

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
to be magnetized and used in multiple

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.400 
to be magnetized and used in multiple
scenarios<00:04:44.419> on<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.570> side<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.900> beast<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.229> my
