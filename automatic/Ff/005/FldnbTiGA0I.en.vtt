00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.189 
called the XD v70 yeah hey Kyle we're
here<00:00:13.830> showing<00:00:14.040> our<00:00:14.280> X<00:00:14.519> dv7t<00:00:15.389> digital<00:00:15.990> wireless

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
here showing our X dv7t digital wireless

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.800 
here showing our X dv7t digital wireless
system<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.850> unique<00:00:18.270> way<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.510> do

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
system this is a unique way to do

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.769 
system this is a unique way to do
wireless<00:00:19.400> we've<00:00:20.400> ended<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.850> with<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.480> most

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
wireless we've ended up with the most

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
wireless we've ended up with the most
reliable<00:00:22.140> wireless<00:00:22.680> system<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> market

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
reliable wireless system on the market

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.210 
reliable wireless system on the market
because<00:00:24.300> we're<00:00:24.869> sending<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> digital<00:00:25.830> signal

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
because we're sending a digital signal

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
because we're sending a digital signal
through<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> air<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.449> send<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
through the air and we send it to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.390 
through the air and we send it to
multiple<00:00:28.439> receivers<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.250> actually

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
multiple receivers so we actually

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.609 
multiple receivers so we actually
scattered<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> signal<00:00:30.720> over<00:00:31.320> for

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
scattered that signal over for

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.690 
scattered that signal over for
individual<00:00:32.579> receivers<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:34.260> way<00:00:34.610> being<00:00:35.610> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
individual receivers that way being that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.450 
individual receivers that way being that
it's<00:00:35.760> digital<00:00:36.300> information<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:37.050> audio<00:00:37.460> we

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
it's digital information not audio we

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's digital information not audio we
don't<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.149> actually<00:00:39.360> collect<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
don't have to actually collect all the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.510 
don't have to actually collect all the
data<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.719> reconnect<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.950> make<00:00:44.190> audio

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
data to to reconnect and make audio

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.549 
data to to reconnect and make audio
again<00:00:44.850> much<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> CD<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> turn

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
again much like with a CD if you turn

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
again much like with a CD if you turn
your<00:00:46.680> CDs<00:00:47.010> over<00:00:47.219> they've<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.520> scratches<00:00:47.789> but

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
your CDs over they've got scratches but

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.490 
your CDs over they've got scratches but
when<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.539> put<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:48.870> player<00:00:49.110> all<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
when you put them in your player all the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
when you put them in your player all the
music<00:00:49.800> happens<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> computer<00:00:51.239> can

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
music happens because the computer can

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
music happens because the computer can
simply<00:00:51.660> figure<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.050> what's<00:00:52.260> missing<00:00:52.410> unlike

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
simply figure out what's missing unlike

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.790 
simply figure out what's missing unlike
analog<00:00:53.760> when<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> computer<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.750> no<00:00:55.410> computer

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
analog when the computer is no computer

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.319 
analog when the computer is no computer
but<00:00:55.949> when<00:00:56.160> something<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.550> missing<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.180> know

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
but when something is missing you know

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.000 
but when something is missing you know
about<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.870> dropouts<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.500> pops<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
about it you get dropouts and pops and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.740 
about it you get dropouts and pops and
stuff<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.699> impossible<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.570> system

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
stuff that's impossible with this system

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.799 
stuff that's impossible with this system
this<00:01:01.020> system<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.500> totally<00:01:01.680> interference-free

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
this system is totally interference-free

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.910 
this system is totally interference-free
that<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.170> thing<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.530> never<00:01:04.710> become

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that kind of thing can never become

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
that kind of thing can never become
audio<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.670> system<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.930> end<00:01:07.049> up

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
audio in your system so what we end up

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.520 
audio in your system so what we end up
with<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:08.010> simple<00:01:08.400> system<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> use<00:01:09.530> also

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
with is a very simple system to use also

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280 
with is a very simple system to use also
with<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.610> being<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> 2.4<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.869> using<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
with this at being a 2.4 and using the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.289 
with this at being a 2.4 and using the
four<00:01:13.500> channel<00:01:13.920> hopping<00:01:14.280> method<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.119> do

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
four channel hopping method that we do

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
four channel hopping method that we do
it<00:01:15.780> means<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.290> never<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> scan<00:01:17.159> for

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
it means that you never have to scan for

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.640 
it means that you never have to scan for
a<00:01:17.430> channel<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.330> simply<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:19.080> assign<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
a channel you simply just assign a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170 
a channel you simply just assign a
channel<00:01:20.159> click<00:01:20.430> any<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> channels

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
channel click any one of the channels

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
channel click any one of the channels
they<00:01:21.509> always<00:01:21.900> work<00:01:22.140> everywhere<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
they always work everywhere on the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
they always work everywhere on the
planet<00:01:22.970> without<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.119> license<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.409> 12

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
planet without a license so we have 12

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.920 
planet without a license so we have 12
channels<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> 70<00:01:26.790> model<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
channels in the 70 model and we have a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
channels in the 70 model and we have a
30<00:01:28.259> model<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.799> well<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.189> has<00:01:29.310> six<00:01:29.549> channels

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
30 model as well that has six channels

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.910 
30 model as well that has six channels
and<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.869> never<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> change<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and so you never have to change the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
and so you never have to change the
channels<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.670> venue<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> venue<00:01:33.420> they

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
channels from venue to venue they

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
channels from venue to venue they
continue<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> work<00:01:34.829> wherever<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.460> off

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
continue to work wherever you get off

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.090 
continue to work wherever you get off
the<00:01:35.700> tour<00:01:35.850> bus<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:37.079> work

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the tour bus they work

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.270 
the tour bus they work
in<00:01:38.820> our<00:01:39.000> v70<00:01:39.720> system<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.890> here

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
in our v70 system which is this one here

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
in our v70 system which is this one here
this<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.640> our<00:01:41.790> 12<00:01:42.060> channel<00:01:42.390> system<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:43.320> also

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
this is our 12 channel system we also

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.649 
this is our 12 channel system we also
because<00:01:44.400> we're<00:01:44.549> line<00:01:44.759> six<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> we've<00:01:45.420> done<00:01:45.630> a

because we're line six that we've done a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.180 
because we're line six that we've done a
lot<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.900> modeling<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
lot of modeling we're actually the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.010 
lot of modeling we're actually the
world's<00:01:47.460> experts<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.909> modeling<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.659> decided

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
world's experts in modeling we decided

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
world's experts in modeling we decided
well<00:01:49.259> hey<00:01:49.409> let's<00:01:49.979> give<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> whole<00:01:50.490> bunch<00:01:50.520> of

microphones just at the push of a button

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.990 
microphones just at the push of a button
you<00:01:59.130> maybe<00:01:59.430> never<00:01:59.640> had<00:01:59.820> that<00:01:59.940> opportunity

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you maybe never had that opportunity

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
you maybe never had that opportunity
you've<00:02:00.659> been<00:02:00.780> stuck<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.350> mic<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:02.130> maybe

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you've been stuck with one mic but maybe

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.680 
you've been stuck with one mic but maybe
your<00:02:02.520> voice<00:02:02.670> sounds<00:02:03.000> better<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.390> different

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
your voice sounds better in a different

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.149 
your voice sounds better in a different
mic<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:04.049> you've<00:02:04.229> got<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.500> chance<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.920> try

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
mic now you've got the chance to try

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.550 
mic now you've got the chance to try
simply<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.090> push<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> buttons<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.409> can

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
simply just push the buttons and you can

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.070 
simply just push the buttons and you can
scroll<00:02:07.830> through<00:02:07.890> six<00:02:08.780> different<00:02:09.780> microphones

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
scroll through six different microphones

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.290 
scroll through six different microphones
and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.100> our<00:02:11.250> own<00:02:11.280> seventh<00:02:11.880> model

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and then we have our own seventh model

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.170 
and then we have our own seventh model
which<00:02:12.870> we've<00:02:13.260> added<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.920> advantage<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.580> DSP

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
which we've added the advantage of DSP

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.820 
which we've added the advantage of DSP
too<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.900> we've<00:02:16.050> actually<00:02:16.170> created<00:02:16.530> a

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
too so we've actually created a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.530 
too so we've actually created a
microphone<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.489> can't<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:18.000> built<00:02:18.269> without

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
microphone that can't be built without

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.229 
microphone that can't be built without
diving<00:02:19.350> by<00:02:19.590> normal<00:02:19.950> means<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.670> got<00:02:20.819> DSP

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
diving by normal means we it's got DSP

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.790 
diving by normal means we it's got DSP
processing<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.350> can<00:02:22.410> get<00:02:22.620> different

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
processing you can get different

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.820 
processing you can get different
sounding<00:02:23.519> microphones<00:02:24.090> oh<00:02:24.360> yeah<00:02:24.830> we've

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
sounding microphones oh yeah we've

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.040 
sounding microphones oh yeah we've
created<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.340> microphone<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:27.720> can't<00:02:27.989> be

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
created a microphone that just can't be

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.770 
created a microphone that just can't be
built<00:02:28.350> by<00:02:28.650> any<00:02:29.130> ordinary<00:02:29.489> means<00:02:29.850> because<00:02:30.600> it's

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
built by any ordinary means because it's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.160 
built by any ordinary means because it's
digitally<00:02:31.260> enhanced<00:02:31.769> on<00:02:32.130> top<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:33.170> very

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
digitally enhanced on top of that very

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.680 
digitally enhanced on top of that very
simple<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.620> use<00:02:35.000> standard<00:02:36.000> two<00:02:36.239> double<00:02:36.569> A

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
simple to use standard two double A

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.240 
simple to use standard two double A
batteries<00:02:36.720> eight<00:02:37.410> hours<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.739> life<00:02:39.920> not<00:02:40.920> really

batteries eight hours of life not really

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.100 
batteries eight hours of life not really
much<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.790> turn<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.480> such<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.780> panel

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
much to do just turn it on such a panel

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.550 
much to do just turn it on such a panel
and<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:43.350> good<00:02:44.160> job<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.549> yeah<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:45.030> basically

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
and go good job with yeah we basically

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.990 
and go good job with yeah we basically
sound<00:02:46.560> quality<00:02:47.070> with<00:02:47.190> digital<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.880> course

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
sound quality with digital is of course

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.660 
sound quality with digital is of course
excellent<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:49.590> microphone<00:02:50.070> sounds<00:02:50.459> just

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
excellent this microphone sounds just

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.520 
excellent this microphone sounds just
exactly<00:02:51.030> like<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.360> wired<00:02:51.660> mic<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.260> without<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
exactly like a wired mic but without the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.620 
exactly like a wired mic but without the
wire<00:02:52.829> so<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.609> don't<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.850> anything<00:02:54.060> dragging

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
wire so you don't have anything dragging

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.140 
wire so you don't have anything dragging
around<00:02:54.720> tripping<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.910> full<00:02:56.910> frequency

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
around tripping on you full frequency

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.199 
around tripping on you full frequency
response<00:02:57.840> actually<00:02:58.140> by<00:02:58.410> being<00:02:58.650> digital<00:02:59.209> we

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
response actually by being digital we

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.420 
response actually by being digital we
don't<00:03:00.420> come<00:03:00.630> under<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.959> rules<00:03:01.530> for<00:03:01.799> analog

their bandwidth they're limited so

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.009 
their bandwidth they're limited so
you'll<00:03:05.489> never<00:03:05.730> get<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.239> full<00:03:06.450> sound<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.930> your

microphone to go through an analog radio

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.210 
microphone to go through an analog radio
it<00:03:09.299> has<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.840> be<00:03:09.900> cut<00:03:10.109> off<00:03:10.230> by<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.500> FCC<00:03:10.859> rules

it has to be cut off by the FCC rules

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.099 
it has to be cut off by the FCC rules
but<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.150> doesn't<00:03:12.420> apply<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.690> us<00:03:12.900> being

but that doesn't apply to us being

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.599 
but that doesn't apply to us being
digital<00:03:13.530> because<00:03:13.709> we're<00:03:13.829> not<00:03:13.950> sending<00:03:14.130> sound

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
digital because we're not sending sound

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.449 
digital because we're not sending sound
we're<00:03:14.940> sending<00:03:15.299> data<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.840> data<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.859> laser

we're sending data and data is a laser
thin<00:03:17.970> little<00:03:19.250> little<00:03:20.250> stream<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.730> goes

thin little little stream that goes

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.890 
thin little little stream that goes
through<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> band<00:03:21.329> we're<00:03:21.480> not<00:03:21.570> trying<00:03:21.750> to

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
send full thick sound ok so the FCC lets

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.319 
send full thick sound ok so the FCC lets
us<00:03:25.290> slide<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.769> frequency<00:03:26.220> response<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.030> full

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329
