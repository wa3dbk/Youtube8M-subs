about a minute that took about a minute
48<00:00:25.470> right<00:00:25.949> what<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.460> think<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.699> normal

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
48 right what do you think your normal

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.410 
48 right what do you think your normal
for<00:00:27.150> her<00:00:28.880> 15<00:00:29.880> yeah<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.810> 115<00:00:31.529> right<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.420> we're

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
for her 15 yeah like 115 right so we're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
for her 15 yeah like 115 right so we're
using<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.380> an<00:00:34.829> example<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
using this just as an example but the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.250 
using this just as an example but the
fact<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.270> how<00:00:36.510> many<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> those<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.899> think

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
fact is is how many of those you think

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
fact is is how many of those you think
you<00:00:37.350> could<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.620> today<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:39.270> hult<00:00:39.600> doing

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you could do today at one at hult doing

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.150 
you could do today at one at hult doing
about<00:00:40.260> 148<00:00:40.980> each<00:00:41.250> time<00:00:42.530> that's<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:43.980> make

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
about 148 each time that's not so make

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
about 148 each time that's not so make
maybe<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.730> couple<00:00:44.940> more<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.329> might<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
maybe a couple more you might do with a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959 
maybe a couple more you might do with a
little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> recovery<00:00:46.829> between<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.670> so

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
little bit of recovery between right so

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.600 
little bit of recovery between right so
the<00:00:48.180> idea<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.559> want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.190> set<00:00:50.489> up

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the idea here is that we want to set up

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
the idea here is that we want to set up
workouts<00:00:51.090> now<00:00:51.329> even<00:00:51.660> though<00:00:51.780> we've<00:00:51.930> posted

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
workouts now even though we've posted

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.660 
workouts now even though we've posted
either<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.649> cross<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.070> indirectly<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
either on cross it indirectly and get a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.920 
either on cross it indirectly and get a
workout<00:00:54.000> posted<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:56.129> idea<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
workout posted the idea is that if you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
workout posted the idea is that if you
can<00:00:58.109> handle<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.590> pace<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> handle<00:00:59.789> all<00:00:59.879> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
can handle that pace and handle all that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.260 
can handle that pace and handle all that
stuff<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.230> set<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.309> where<00:01:02.489> you're

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
stuff is to set that up to where you're

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
stuff is to set that up to where you're
not<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.350> where<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.799> no<00:01:04.949> longer

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
not going to where you can no longer

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.090 
not going to where you can no longer
handle<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:06.299> pretty<00:01:06.720> simple<00:01:07.110> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> kind

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
handle it I'm pretty simple kind of kind

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
handle it I'm pretty simple kind of kind
of<00:01:08.220> concept<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.880> fortunately<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.720> very

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of concept and fortunately it's not very

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.210 
of concept and fortunately it's not very
simply<00:01:11.000> put<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.270> place<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.740> people<00:01:14.040> do

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
simply put into place so what people do

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.730 
simply put into place so what people do
is<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:14.670> tend<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> overshoot<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.080> end<00:01:16.530> up

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is they tend to overshoot it and end up

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.670 
is they tend to overshoot it and end up
going<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.040> lot<00:01:17.189> slower<00:01:17.479> but<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.259> other<00:01:19.409> end

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
going a lot slower but on the other end

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.170 
going a lot slower but on the other end
we've<00:01:19.979> got<00:01:20.009> athletes<00:01:20.610> who<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:20.790> actually

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
we've got athletes who are actually

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
we've got athletes who are actually
going<00:01:21.540> who<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.200> go<00:01:22.320> multiples<00:01:22.830> let's<00:01:23.040> say

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
going who can go multiples let's say

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
going who can go multiples let's say
we've<00:01:23.250> got<00:01:23.400> athletes<00:01:23.820> who<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.210> handle<00:01:24.360> six

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
we've got athletes who can handle six

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.109 
we've got athletes who can handle six
eight<00:01:25.049> ten<00:01:25.500> maybe<00:01:25.770> twelve<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.670> hundreds

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
eight ten maybe twelve for hundreds

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.960 
eight ten maybe twelve for hundreds
doing<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.049> stuff<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> appropriate

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
doing this stuff if the appropriate

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
doing this stuff if the appropriate
scaling<00:01:30.570> falls<00:01:30.869> ends<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:31.409> okay<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.829> I've

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
scaling falls ends we're okay if I've

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.060 
scaling falls ends we're okay if I've
got<00:01:32.100> 12<00:01:32.460> maybe<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.880> should<00:01:33.090> probably<00:01:33.920> speed<00:01:34.920> up

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
got 12 maybe I should probably speed up

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.760 
got 12 maybe I should probably speed up
the<00:01:35.220> 400<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:35.880> find<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.299> where<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.740> where<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the 400 or find out where that where I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
the 400 or find out where that where I
could<00:01:38.070> make<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.490> work<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.240> bit

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
could make that work out a little bit

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
could make that work out a little bit
better<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.979> would<00:01:41.670> weigh<00:01:41.820> curve<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
better so this would weigh curve is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
better so this would weigh curve is
actually<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> good<00:01:42.810> example<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.409> don't<00:01:43.590> need

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
actually a good example you don't need

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
actually a good example you don't need
to<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.920> out<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.420> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to go out and get one just to do this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.240 
to go out and get one just to do this
but<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> could<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.290> regular<00:01:46.890> interval

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
but you could do regular interval

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.380 
but you could do regular interval
training<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> track<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:49.520> out<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.880> street

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
set up the training to where it's most

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.420 
set up the training to where it's most
effective<00:01:56.479> okay<00:01:57.479> how<00:01:58.229> many<00:01:58.290> times<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.340> we

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
effective okay how many times are we

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.399 
effective okay how many times are we
going<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.420> be<00:02:00.479> able<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.659> put<00:02:00.780> him<00:02:00.960> through<00:02:01.229> this

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
going to be able to put him through this

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.590 
going to be able to put him through this
to<00:02:01.649> where<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.130> no<00:02:02.490> longer<00:02:02.520> effective<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to where it's no longer effective and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.060 
to where it's no longer effective and
that's<00:02:03.810> where<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's where you have to be have the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.039 
that's where you have to be have the
ability<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.490> understand<00:02:06.060> appropriate

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
ability to understand appropriate

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.230 
ability to understand appropriate
scaling<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> workout<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.459> hope<00:02:08.910> that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
scaling for the workout so hope that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.710 
scaling for the workout so hope that
sense<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:10.350> we<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.220> use<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.580> future<00:02:12.090> on

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
sense and we can use that to future on

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.060 
sense and we can use that to future on
anything<00:02:13.140> even<00:02:13.680> when<00:02:13.710> we<00:02:13.950> occurred<00:02:14.190> thanks
