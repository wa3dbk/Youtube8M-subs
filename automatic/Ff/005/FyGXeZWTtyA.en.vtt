00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
have to face because it fell off and I

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.060 
have to face because it fell off and I
lost<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.630> body<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:18.320> ribbon<00:03:18.770> from<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
lost the body just the ribbon from the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.300 
lost the body just the ribbon from the
wrapped<00:03:19.400> present<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.590> kept<00:03:21.590> only<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:22.040> ribbon

wrapped present I kept only the ribbon

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.850 
wrapped present I kept only the ribbon
because<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:23.060> present<00:03:23.510> was<00:03:23.750> too<00:03:24.080> thick<00:03:24.500> and

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
because the present was too thick and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.490 
because the present was too thick and
thicker<00:03:25.700> creases<00:03:26.270> are<00:03:26.450> much<00:03:26.750> harder<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.230> try

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
thicker creases are much harder to try
