over<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.530> lot<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> stuff<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.039> not<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.519> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
over a lot of stuff that's not in the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.759 
over a lot of stuff that's not in the
manual<00:02:11.910> as<00:02:12.120> well<00:02:12.180> too<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.560> I'm<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
manual as well too and then I'm going to

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.500 
manual as well too and then I'm going to
tell<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.459> what<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.000> do<00:02:15.150> throughout<00:02:15.390> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
tell you what to do throughout this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.660 
tell you what to do throughout this
entire<00:02:15.720> less<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> plan<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.890> everything<00:02:17.130> we're

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
entire less a plan for everything we're

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.670 
entire less a plan for everything we're
going<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.880> explain<00:02:18.180> everything<00:02:18.600> step<00:02:19.019> by<00:02:19.049> step

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
going to explain everything step by step

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.390 
going to explain everything step by step
so

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.890 
so
before<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> start<00:02:23.550> for<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.940> first<00:02:24.180> time<00:02:24.420> you

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
how they work with the machine now for

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.089 
how they work with the machine now for
example<00:06:28.659> here<00:06:28.690> my<00:06:29.529> transport<00:06:30.250> section<00:06:31.979> and<00:06:32.979> I

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
example here my transport section and I

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.529 
example here my transport section and I
can<00:06:33.219> go<00:06:33.310> up<00:06:33.430> to<00:06:33.550> back<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:33.819> program<00:06:34.210> will<00:06:34.360> say

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
can go up to back the program will say

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.879 
can go up to back the program will say
oh<00:06:34.569> so<00:06:34.840> sequence<00:06:35.259> will<00:06:35.409> say<00:06:35.560> and<00:06:35.800> Express<00:06:37.889> and
