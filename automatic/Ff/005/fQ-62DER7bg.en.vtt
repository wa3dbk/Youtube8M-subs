so much snow and so much ice we've got
something<00:00:20.280> a<00:00:20.370> little<00:00:20.520> bit<00:00:20.610> special<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.090> clear

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
something a little bit special to clear

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:33.189 
something a little bit special to clear
the<00:00:21.390> way<00:00:21.540> stick<00:00:22.230> around

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.290 

now<00:00:33.710> every<00:00:34.010> once<00:00:34.190> in<00:00:34.339> a<00:00:34.429> while<00:00:34.609> we<00:00:35.059> get<00:00:35.269> a

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
now every once in a while we get a

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.029 
now every once in a while we get a
little<00:00:35.510> bit<00:00:35.750> more<00:00:35.960> snow<00:00:36.079> than<00:00:36.769> what's

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
little bit more snow than what's

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.770 
little bit more snow than what's

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
was predicted and that makes moving at

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.639 
was predicted and that makes moving at
real<00:00:40.879> rough<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:41.809> we<00:00:41.960> have<00:00:42.229> to<00:00:42.409> sometimes

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
real rough so we have to sometimes

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.869 
real rough so we have to sometimes
resort<00:00:43.399> to<00:00:44.739> energetics<00:00:45.739> will<00:00:46.039> say<00:00:46.219> energetic

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
resort to energetics will say energetic

resort to energetics will say energetic
ways<00:00:47.089> of<00:00:47.420> moving<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.260> snow<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.769> this<00:00:49.250> is<00:00:49.399> one

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
ways of moving the snow and this is one

00:00:49.610 --> 00:01:05.649 
ways of moving the snow and this is one
way<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.360> clear<00:00:50.600> out<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.930> range<00:01:04.449> now<00:01:05.449> that

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
way that we clear out the range now that

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.740 
way that we clear out the range now that
makes<00:01:05.869> really<00:01:06.140> short<00:01:06.679> work<00:01:07.179> out<00:01:08.179> of<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.450> really

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
makes really short work out of a really

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:33.010 
makes really short work out of a really
big<00:01:08.960> project<00:01:09.200> don't<00:01:09.679> you<00:01:09.800> think<00:01:31.690> so<00:01:32.690> as<00:01:32.869> you

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
big project don't you think so as you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.870 
big project don't you think so as you
can<00:01:33.200> see<00:01:33.259> where<00:01:33.920> there<00:01:34.069> was<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.340> huge<00:01:34.970> obstacle

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
can see where there was a huge obstacle

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.459 
can see where there was a huge obstacle
actually<00:01:37.880> there's<00:01:38.090> just<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.359> big<00:01:38.509> hole<00:01:38.659> now<00:01:38.869> so

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
actually there's just a big hole now so

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.289 
actually there's just a big hole now so
we<00:01:39.680> can<00:01:39.890> come<00:01:40.340> in<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.609> clean<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.880> rest<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.210> it

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
we can come in and clean the rest of it

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.389 
we can come in and clean the rest of it
up<00:01:41.359> properly<00:01:41.740> see<00:01:42.740> how<00:01:42.799> easy<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.100> makes

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
up properly see how easy that makes

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.310 
up properly see how easy that makes
things<00:01:43.670> better<00:01:44.060> living<00:01:44.390> through<00:01:44.509> energetics

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
things better living through energetics

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.620 
things better living through energetics
that<00:01:45.500> should<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.920> name<00:01:46.039> of<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.630> no
