00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.680
 yes 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.000
 hi how was i am dry white 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.889
 welcome in the channel once again 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.779
 well today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.810
 throws to make a spear what 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.830
 we need are two stone that the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.570
 we have here on the side 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.410
 we are going to use this time this one here and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.780
 now we have a little more at hand 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.060
 2 perfect stone here we have a 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.720
 here we have 2 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.150
 we need 5 wood is the most 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.610
 easy of the world as long as everything 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.140
 we have obviously on hand at the coast 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.050
 there are usually these 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.450
 that kind of like rocks and there are many 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.520
 trees so I do not think it 's I do not think 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.520
 that you like to be able to raise it 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.050
 if you cut the tree like it's worth now 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.710
 perfect how much we have we have 4 us 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.710
 missing one more 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.200
 perfect 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.780
 well then well we give it to spears 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.480
 that would be the option of spear is like the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.760
 build 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.240
 and immediately we will have the spear 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.119
 craft eada so let's see 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.840
 perfect we already have a good spear 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.899
 pretty 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.689
 with the 1 we can change the ax and with 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.960
 On the 2nd we have the plant, I'm going to 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.420
 take advantage and I'll tell you how 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.659
 manufacture or as kraft create 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.330
 the bow today we're going to do everything all of 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.310
 weapons 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.460
 for the arch we also need what 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.830
 Also on 5 wood and 2 stone it is the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.490
 abduction is equal to that of the spear equal 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.490
 the same 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.409
 so 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.770
 for people like me who have a lot 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.770
 memory 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.370
 now wait wait wait 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.730
 I'm in fact I've cut 3 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.720
 I chopped three rocks was two good no 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.850
 nothing happens 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.060
 one of the things that I also see is 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.240
 example as now to mop nothing else 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.240
 what 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.970
 look for bow we need five of wood 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.850
 and two good stone then right now 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.800
 I have three stone and what bothers me 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.730
 quite 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.730
 I need one more 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.640
 for example when there is something left over 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.970
 There is a stone left over or a wood is left over 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.340
 in this case they would be to make the arch 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.870
 They are two stone and five wood 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.730
 Well, what would we have left over from 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.190
 stone if we build the bou the arch 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.630
 you will see that the box disappears without 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.550
 leave us the stone that we have left this is 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.950
 a small mistake that I find that 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.870
 they should rectify but well 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.900
 it's too important but here 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.510
 we have the bow to make us arrows is 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.020
 as easy as the same we give access 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.510
 Quick 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.510
 the ax we leave a trunk here 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.950
 we leave two more 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.970
 Well, do not give me the option of arrows 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.950
 I guess 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.360
 when you spend arrows 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.320
 of bastards 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:32.630
 and I'm going here to the option of a rose rose 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.800
 you know it is built with 2 with 2 with 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.690
 two woods with two wooden trunks 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.690
 so it's a very easy thing 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.870
 now what would come and I like to teach 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.020
 it's also how to build a shield for 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.680
 knowing the shield is also very easy 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.680
 we need four wooden 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.400
 Y 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.040
 and two stone 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.030
 the easiest thing there but I'm 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.470
 a little more of the throat forgive me 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.130
 in these lands where I am living 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:11.400
 it's very cold now so forgive me 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:14.959
 today I have four wooden 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.959
 I'm going to get two more stone 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.919
 those two stone ones that are what I 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.919
 missing 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.000
 we squeezed was and isild shield that shield 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.930
 so so so so so so so so so so 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.930
 we go with after after 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.689
 we go 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.250
 perfect already we want shield 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.810
 also some things that fail me is that 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.160
 luck in shield 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.230
 with the left button we protect ourselves 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.560
 the time of ramming or an arrow that 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.110
 we could fall so this would be the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.790
 shield is quite beautiful since what 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:04.419
 I would like to build are the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.419
 famous balls 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.200
 and for that I think they are also two of 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:10.900
 stone 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.200
 and four of wood this one I do not have 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.190
 annotated forgive me 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.190
 a small lack of 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.080
 of practicality but 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.510
 to be seen with four and two that no luck and 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.680
 the may have 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.449
 look if they are wood counts and two of 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.009
 stone with this we build 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.009
 the balls 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.040
 Let's go there 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.010
 come balls balls 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.060
 there we have the balls to use them 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.639
 the same left button of the mouse goes 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.729
 spinning 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.740
 and the spears 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.980
 very practical now I do not have any 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.849
 dinosaur in sight to be able to say 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:04.169
 and try them but good 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:05.249
 I think that everything would be in the 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.490
 next chapter I will teach how 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.839
 do the cage and the totem so in 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.389
 sport comes video in life favorites 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:15.709
 comment and see you in the next 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.709
 chapter until then
