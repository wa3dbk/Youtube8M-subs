00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
the mountain right so I pulled over and

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.770 
the mountain right so I pulled over and
it<00:02:37.849> was<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.359> commissioners<00:02:38.720> were

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
it was like the commissioners were

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.080

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.220 
over the place it was a snowy mountain
and<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.819> went<00:02:44.599> over<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.780> kind<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.079> edge

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
and so I I went over to kind of the edge

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.190 
and so I I went over to kind of the edge
and<00:02:45.530> somehow<00:02:46.310> i<00:02:46.459> lost<00:02:46.670> my<00:02:47.269> footing<00:02:47.629> and<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.019> just

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
and somehow i lost my footing and I just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.830 
and somehow i lost my footing and I just
slipped<00:02:48.650> alright<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:49.909> I<00:02:50.120> could<00:02:50.659> not

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
stop and I was tumbling down the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.009 
stop and I was tumbling down the
mountain<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.669> like<00:02:53.359> I<00:02:53.510> thought<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.900> was

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
mountain and like I thought this was

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.289 
mountain and like I thought this was
going<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.470> end<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:55.310> luckily<00:02:55.970> there

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
going to be the end but luckily there

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.270 
going to be the end but luckily there
was<00:02:56.389> a<00:02:56.419> shrubbery<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.109> stuck<00:02:57.650> out<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:58.189> the
