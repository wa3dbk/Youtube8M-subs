00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.020
 that's tim tim is often tired 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.940
 In the evening he can barely 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.490
 focus and work is more likely 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.500
 flabby and burned out and it will be 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.220
 getting worse 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.170
 what's up with tim 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.840
 To do this we need to team up something 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.840
 take a closer look 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.740
 Tim is just a bit simplistic 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.910
 team consists of once brain a few 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 lung 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:38.200
 Once in a while, kidney twice 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.040
 glandular hair mucous membrane 206 bones 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.730
 and once stomach intestinal canal 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.680
 cellular metabolism and immune system 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.530
 develop teams together 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.320
 self-healing powers but the basis for 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:57.570
 his health is made up of these three 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.570
 Organs would remain bowel and kidney 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.829
 the immune system keeps alert and 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.090
 Decides what is allowed to stay in the body 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.969
 and what needs to be combated 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.740
 the acid base balance ensures 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.439
 the optimal environment for ours 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.689
 Cell metabolism is the excretory and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.330
 detoxification function is ours 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.890
 garbage collection 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.170
 by hesse option will be 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.920
 vital substances were added 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.530
 preserved and recycled 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.270
 so the body can grow renewed 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 be able and to peak performances 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.030
 but our organs are often today 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.320
 overloaded because our sense organs 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.789
 Although we were natural 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.979
 pollutants like mold or 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.560
 spoiled egg white but not before 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.109
 invisible hazards and environmental toxins 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 for example, lead and aluminum 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.920
 Mercury can be in so many 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.829
 be included daily hire 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.060
 in medications in toothpaste the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.310
 Steam industry 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.340
 in canned fumes in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.500
 sea ​​animals in the picture in salt in 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.509
 fillings in drinking water in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.610
 energy saving lamps in cosmetics 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.470
 and so on three ways 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.599
 pollutants and heavy metals in our 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.209
 Body taken over the one and a half 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.670
 square of our skin the 80 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.840
 square meters of our lungs and over the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.900
 400 square meters of our intestinal mucosa 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.760
 our organs are mainly liver and gall 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.980
 detoxify so constantly but that takes 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.470
 later, 95% of the given 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.660
 bile again on the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.120
 to recycle valuable substance 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.280
 unfortunately , he also reserves the same in it 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.620
 dissolved harmful substances again 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.510
 it comes to the so-called re-poisoning 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.330
 and the harmful substances are in the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.790
 body stored 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.280
 gradually a chronic arises 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.320
 poisoning condition 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.020
 and now back to tim, that's why he feels 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.220
 So energy is increasingly going on 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.740
 the symptoms of a chronic 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.160
 poisoning over the years always 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.750
 become more pronounced hypertension and 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.550
 bleeding disorders stomach 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.400
 bowel problems as well as liver and 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.760
 kidney problems daytime tiredness and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.240
 bad night sleep quality 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.690
 drive weakness and 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.380
 Concentration problems premature 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.570
 aging allergies and skin problems 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.990
 chronic pain and increased 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.990
 infection-susceptibility 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.440
 So tim needs a solution that does not 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.780
 Pollutants already there where they 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.930
 be absorbed by the body just in 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.970
 stomach gut and then safely out 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.830
 derives from the body and so the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.070
 natural detoxification flows 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.020
 balance between the organs 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.540
 Restores only the medicine product 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.440
 talks apr event works this way 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.610
 the zeolites contained in it are 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.800
 Highly effective mineral sponges the the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.110
 body targeted and effective by 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.390
 pollutants do not cleanse back 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.190
 more teams cleaned the poison 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.710
 Body not only feels better 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.290
 but also responds better to many 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.510
 other therapy impulses weaker 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.840
 medications side effects better 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.080
 wound healing after surgery 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.680
 nutritional supplements and vitamin 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.900
 Preparations unfold their true potential 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.480
 his general energy level is rising 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.950
 Strong and teams head feels more alert 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.070
 and clearer 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.860
 in short, a better sense of life 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.080
 full of joy and ease and 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.620
 By the way, boxer present is a 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.620
 natural product 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.410
 fox immune products are currently available for 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.350
