use a different product if you want I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.289 
use a different product if you want I
use<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.540> high<00:01:36.900> gloss<00:01:37.340> Minwax<00:01:38.340> exterior

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
use the high gloss Minwax exterior

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.679 
use the high gloss Minwax exterior
polyurethane<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.280> mixed<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> 50/50<00:01:42.509> with

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
polyurethane and I mixed it 50/50 with

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
polyurethane and I mixed it 50/50 with
naphtha<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.860> idea<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.420> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
naphtha and the idea was I'm going to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.389 
naphtha and the idea was I'm going to
hand<00:01:45.720> rub<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.140> there's<00:01:46.649> other<00:01:46.890> people<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
hand rub it there's other people like to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.510 
hand rub it there's other people like to
spray<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> paint<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.540> thick<00:01:49.340> several<00:01:50.340> other

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
spray it paint it on thick several other

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069 
spray it paint it on thick several other
ways<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> hand<00:01:51.240> rubbing<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> takes<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
ways I think the hand rubbing it takes a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.889 
ways I think the hand rubbing it takes a
little<00:01:52.229> more<00:01:52.350> time<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.909> idea<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.600> prevent

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
little more time the idea is to prevent

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.039 
little more time the idea is to prevent
air<00:01:55.200> bubbles<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> finish<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
