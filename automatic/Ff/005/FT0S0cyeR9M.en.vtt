00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
made him wear a blindfold because he

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.180 
made him wear a blindfold because he
seems<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.010> be<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> little<00:02:45.370> bit<00:02:45.520> shy<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.090> she<00:02:47.190> you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
seems to be a little bit shy so she you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.240 
seems to be a little bit shy so she you
know<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:49.230> she<00:02:50.230> just<00:02:50.470> needed<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.890> give<00:02:51.010> him<00:02:51.040> a

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
know it's she just needed to give him a

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.830 
know it's she just needed to give him a
little<00:02:51.370> bit<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.670> confidence<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.570> seemed

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
little bit of confidence and it seemed

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.530 
little bit of confidence and it seemed
to<00:02:52.990> work<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.730> think<00:02:55.090> he<00:02:55.180> took<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
to work but I think he took the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.750 
to work but I think he took the
blindfold<00:02:55.690> off<00:02:56.260> too<00:02:56.530> soon<00:02:56.770> or<00:02:57.130> he<00:02:57.550> could<00:02:57.730> have

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
blindfold off too soon or he could have

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.400 
blindfold off too soon or he could have
just<00:02:57.850> given<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.390> learn<00:03:00.780> finales<00:03:01.780> personal

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
just given it to learn finales personal

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.230 
just given it to learn finales personal
best<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.980> was<00:03:03.100> still<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> hot<00:03:03.520> mess<00:03:03.760> yeah

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
best but it was still a hot mess yeah

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.300

but<00:03:04.660> he<00:03:04.750> improved<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.230> little<00:03:05.320> bit<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:05.980> still<00:03:06.010> I

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
but he improved a little bit but still I

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.949
