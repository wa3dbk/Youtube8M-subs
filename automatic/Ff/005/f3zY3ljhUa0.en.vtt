what what's recorded intro outside do

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.709 
what what's recorded intro outside do
something<00:00:13.469> different<00:00:13.889> because<00:00:14.340> how<00:00:15.240> often<00:00:15.450> do

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
something different because how often do

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.029

kind<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.600> cool<00:00:18.660> because<00:00:19.410> we're<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.859> hiking

but the cut the topic I wanted to talk

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.150 
but the cut the topic I wanted to talk
about<00:02:14.660> though<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.080> just<00:02:15.440> kind<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.830> video

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
about though is just kind of like video

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.890 
about though is just kind of like video
games<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:16.940> youtube<00:02:17.720> in<00:02:17.870> general

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
games and like youtube in general

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.630 
games and like youtube in general
because<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.500> hard<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.830> separate<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> two<00:02:19.520> at

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
because it's hard to separate the two at

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.180 
because it's hard to separate the two at
this<00:02:19.790> point<00:02:20.260> especially<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.680> my<00:02:21.890> world

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
this point especially in my world

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.010 
this point especially in my world
because<00:02:22.819> you<00:02:22.970> know<00:02:23.060> video<00:02:23.300> games<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.750> YouTube

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
because you know video games and YouTube

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.140 
because you know video games and YouTube
kind<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.290> go<00:02:24.380> hand<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.709> hand<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:25.069> think<00:02:25.099> that<00:02:25.489> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
kind of go hand in hand I think that the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.670 
kind of go hand in hand I think that the
reason<00:02:26.180> why<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.599> can<00:02:26.930> do<00:02:27.050> these<00:02:27.230> commentaries

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
reason why you can do these commentaries

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.290 
reason why you can do these commentaries
over<00:02:28.099> video<00:02:28.250> game<00:02:28.550> plays<00:02:28.849> it's<00:02:29.090> because

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
over video game plays it's because

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.910 
over video game plays it's because
something<00:02:29.569> people<00:02:29.870> can<00:02:30.019> relate<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.709> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
something people can relate to and I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.650 
something people can relate to and I
think<00:02:30.950> that's<00:02:31.250> important<00:02:31.730> when<00:02:32.569> you're

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
think that's important when you're

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.059 
think that's important when you're
trying<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.930> talk<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.260> people<00:02:33.530> about<00:02:33.590> stuff

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
trying to talk to people about stuff

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.460 
trying to talk to people about stuff
like<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.459> but<00:02:34.810> mainly<00:02:35.810> what<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.110> wanted<00:02:36.380> to

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
like this but mainly what I wanted to

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.699 
like this but mainly what I wanted to
discuss<00:02:36.590> was<00:02:37.069> kind<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.489> how<00:02:38.290> how<00:02:39.290> people

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709
