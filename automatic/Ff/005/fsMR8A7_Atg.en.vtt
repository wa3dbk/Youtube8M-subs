00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 thank you very much do mommy and to do 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.319
 possible this video that there is reason this 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.240
 video let's make a comparison 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.130
 between a two-tone gabanelli accordion 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.230
 against a two-tone anacletus 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.900
 if you want to see which of the two is better 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.000
 keep watching this video first we have 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.560
 this nelly range of two compact shades 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 thirty four buttons six 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.359
 records and without bass is in my tone 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.970
 and sun is manufactured in Italy and its price 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 approximate is about 60 thousand pesos per 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.150
 the other side we find the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.250
 German brand with him with his line of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.130
 accordions anacleto also of 34 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.410
 buttons 6 registers and without bass in tone 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 of fa and me is also compact its price 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.280
 approximate of about 60 thousand pesos also 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 I want you to be one of the best accordions 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.640
 what can you buy for music 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 regional Mexican from now I say 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.510
 that I do not know which one to choose the two are 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.250
 excellent accordions as we can see 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.620
 they have a very different style in the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.539
 grill and in the records also the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.399
 bulk are a little more out there and the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 of the general decree are a little more 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.020
 hidden but everything else is very 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.609
 similar to the design the horner anacleto is 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.500
 a relatively new brand in the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.110
 market but as far as I could 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 Try are excellent and are designed 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.750
 by anacleto bulk 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.670
 On the other hand we have the brand 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.070
 gabanelli that this brand already has more 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.590
 years in the market your chords are very 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.750
 good and are designed by mike evans 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.160
 and the general athlete is quite light 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.050
 I personally like the grill 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.030
 quite the bulk and it's also pretty 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.680
 lightweight and the design of your grill 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.300
 he is also very father going back to 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.890
 anacleto the bellows of the accordion is 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.630
 excellent in reality there is not much that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 say of these chords is also very 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.930
 good to the gallon bellows and read the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.190
 buttons of the two accordions feel 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.500
 quite well done when I was 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.360
 touching I thought that one was better but 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.250
 then started to touch the other and think 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.190
 the opposite that this one was better so 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.509
 It was very difficult to decide which one is better 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.160
 straps on the two accordions are very 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.869
 similar feel pretty good 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.210
 although I would like it to be a little more 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.740
 wide so they were more like 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.509
 The protective pillow is exactly 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.490
 the same in both chords very well now 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.600
 let's go listen to these two accordions 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.600
 and see which one they like best 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.870
 and 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.180
 and 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.100
 t 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.230
 yes 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:36.950
 and you order stays with which 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.740
 choose as you can see it is quite 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.660
 fought the battle so to speak the 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.670
 two are excellent accordions but 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.950
 what would you choose if you ask me 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.410
 I really do not know it's very difficult to choose 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.970
 Obviously I bought the Gabanelli 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.590
 blue they are seeing on the screen but 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.390
 they were for other reasons I 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.400
 I would recommend that you choose the one that best 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.620
 of the technical service best guarantee 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.760
 better I try the one that they like more the 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.740
 design and so on 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.660
 both are very good performances but 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.970
 If you are going to buy one, I recommend you 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.770
 First try it if you follow this 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.840
 video if you liked do not forget to like 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.760
 share it and if you have not subscribed to 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.050
 channel I invite you to do it so that 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.520
 so youtube tells you when we are 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.110
 uploading the new videos are very 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.580
 good so it is that if I were you I know 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.580
 I would write, see you next video
