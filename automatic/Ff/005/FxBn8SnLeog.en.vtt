00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
this is $1 $2 fix you got a controller

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.300 
this is $1 $2 fix you got a controller
so<00:01:24.240> basically<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:24.869> put<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:25.950> small

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so basically you just put a little small

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.899 
so basically you just put a little small
dot<00:01:26.640> right<00:01:26.880> here

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.539 

just<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.990> small<00:01:34.290> dot<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.369> when

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
just a small dot like that because when

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.120 
just a small dot like that because when
you<00:01:35.579> push<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.509> gonna<00:01:36.630> spread

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
you push down on it it's gonna spread

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.450 
you push down on it it's gonna spread
and<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.250> don't<00:01:38.399> want<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> overflow<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and you don't want to overflow into the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.529 
and you don't want to overflow into the
controller<00:01:41.460> right<00:01:42.170> here<00:01:43.399> joint<00:01:44.420> then<00:01:45.420> you're

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
controller right here joint then you're

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.590 
controller right here joint then you're
screwed<00:01:45.960> okay<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.039> again<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:48.179> put<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> dot

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
screwed okay so again just put a dot

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.010 
screwed okay so again just put a dot
right<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:53.210> just<00:01:54.210> put<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.600> dot<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:54.990> there

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
right here just put one dot right there

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.999 
right here just put one dot right there
not<00:01:55.590> big<00:01:55.799> no<00:01:56.009> bigger<00:01:56.310> than<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.659> next<00:01:58.009> just

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.050 

you<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.590> let<00:02:23.710> it<00:02:23.740> sit<00:02:24.040> there<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.490> good<00:02:24.640> 15

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
you just let it sit there for a good 15

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.670 
you just let it sit there for a good 15
minutes<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.660> think<00:02:25.900> that's<00:02:26.230> what<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.500> says

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
minutes I think that's what it says

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.720 
minutes I think that's what it says
right<00:02:26.710> there<00:02:26.980> 15<00:02:27.490> minutes<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:30.070> then<00:02:30.220> BOOM

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
right there 15 minutes and then BOOM

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.890 
right there 15 minutes and then BOOM
look<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.240> looks<00:02:31.270> like<00:02:31.510> it's<00:02:31.660> brand

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
look at that it looks like it's brand

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.370 
look at that it looks like it's brand
new<00:02:32.020> again

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
new again
