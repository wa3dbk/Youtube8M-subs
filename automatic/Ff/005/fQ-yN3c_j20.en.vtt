areas to be avoided it's all very well

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.809

that<00:01:34.990> these<00:01:35.140> devices<00:01:35.470> look<00:01:35.979> more<00:01:36.280> exciting

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
that these devices look more exciting

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.999 
that these devices look more exciting
than<00:01:37.000> your<00:01:37.149> average<00:01:37.299> cleaning<00:01:37.929> equipment<00:01:38.500> but

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
than your average cleaning equipment but

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.100 
than your average cleaning equipment but
the<00:01:39.100> question<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:39.789> how<00:01:40.450> well<00:01:40.720> do<00:01:40.959> they

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
the question is how well do they

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.429 
the question is how well do they
actually<00:01:41.679> do<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.130> job<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:43.390> we<00:01:43.659> devised<00:01:44.110> a

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
actually do the job so we devised a

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.770 
actually do the job so we devised a
little<00:01:44.520> experiment<00:01:45.520> which<00:01:46.090> may<00:01:46.360> not<00:01:46.509> be<00:01:46.660> the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
little experiment which may not be the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.080 
little experiment which may not be the
most<00:01:46.959> scientific<00:01:47.800> but<00:01:48.310> should<00:01:48.580> give<00:01:48.789> us<00:01:48.910> a

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
most scientific but should give us a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.300 
most scientific but should give us a
little<00:01:49.450> indication<00:01:49.929> of<00:01:50.289> whether<00:01:50.590> these<00:01:50.890> bots

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
little indication of whether these bots

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.979 
little indication of whether these bots
are<00:01:51.580> up<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.209> the<00:01:52.360> challenge

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
are up to the challenge

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.369 
are up to the challenge
clean<00:01:53.709> floor<00:01:54.039> meet<00:01:54.700> some<00:01:55.000> talcum<00:01:55.330> powder<00:01:55.569> on

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
cleaning the talc my traditional vacuum

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.600 
cleaning the talc my traditional vacuum
which<00:01:58.959> cost<00:01:59.289> around<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.739> third<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.310> price

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
which cost around a third of the price

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.690 
which cost around a third of the price
did<00:02:01.209> pretty<00:02:01.629> well<00:02:01.780> only<00:02:02.769> leaving<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.459> slight

did pretty well only leaving a slight

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.859 
did pretty well only leaving a slight
