00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Welcome from bremen dtb is 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.390
 Thomas Wolter greeted Thomas 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.429
 Just me and asked jÃ¶rg swing 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.559
 again new club but that should 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.150
 Do not give up because we are on the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 search for the regionalliga stars and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 of course there's the u23 here 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.510
 by werder bremen currently tables 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.730
 first yes and we meet in today 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 defender felix big and den 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 top scorers of the regionalliga nord max 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 wegner felix on werder.de is getting big 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 Titled historical season start it works 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.279
 not to the professor around the u23 in 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.230
 the regional league 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.260
 would you have thought that's so good 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.120
 starts yes I have already believed too 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.230
 because we think one in this season 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 take on a favorite role 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.879
 in the league and this one too 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.680
 and I think that we 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.180
 The first four games are very good 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.520
 and so it really has to be 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 go on 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.530
 You have not been one for a few games 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.969
 offensive tribe player more sun 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 defenders take on a new role for 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.100
 me since the preparation finally too 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.270
 in the pros I played this and 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.519
 I think I accepted the role well 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.400
 and feel very comfortable on the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.979
 position and now another two goals 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.340
 Then it looks very good 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.659
 Actually this was your idea mine 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 Idea what not that was already from 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.990
 Coach to try it out 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 and because I worked so well 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 it's actually a good one now 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.950
 option for me she has trainer 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.400
 Thomas Wolter will give you the new role 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 taught less he explained that was 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 rather thomas schaaf also 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.360
 had it comes with thomas wolter 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.430
 and believed did not want that at all 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 really believe is, and but when he 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.540
 then that's it, that's it 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 worked as well as continue 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.750
 tried and as I said that went well 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.759
 and it can go on like this 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.829
 you stabilized the defense two 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.950
 Goals so far in and offensive 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.140
 max wegner makes furore a two 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
 sentences to him maybe so maximum 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.390
 already shown that he has the potential to do so 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.979
 has many goals to shoot now think 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.210
 I thus just what you in the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.860
 first play meets the one as 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.390
 striker gets after the run and me 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.840
 of course hope for him and for us that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.129
 it goes on what distinguishes him 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.230
 forensic combat strength 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.420
 So I think that he already has many 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.920
 Qualities owns four games 7 goals 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.730
 Can you explain why it's up to you ? 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.769
 not running yes i think the felix im 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.540
 swim out as if the first match 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.859
 the two doors makes getting on small 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.500
 run and of course self-confidence 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.609
 strengthened and then go also gates 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.900
 Rhein where you can maybe I believe 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.730
 that you have to go in because of one 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.989
 sensational quote thomas schaaf above 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.439
 he had to cancel soon 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:42.269
 active would actually Seriously 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.750
 in how far is the way up for 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.010
 you yes I think that now last 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.540
 friend game played that was 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.099
 of course for me first a little one 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.819
 dream that came true 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.680
 one with the game 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.669
 yes and now I try over the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.840
 second team performance 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.470
 and then maybe sometime around 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.030
 purely to slip 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.500
 you already have some profi use 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.269
 going under the hand but 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 How satisfied are you at the moment? 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.510
 I am not 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.980
 satisfied 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.280
 just to run that's clear that 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.709
 would be wrong too I like to play games 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.849
 in the team also there as well 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.280
 leadership role 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.650
 and come back to my game practice 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.379
 but of course that is the primary goal 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.970
 to play the niger and I will 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.260
 continue to monitor takes him 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.120
 a bit of courage when you see 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.500
 up there, those in the storm commit to 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.900
 and gradually and do not even look 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.859
 your own u23 yes i think that yourself 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.569
 maybe an inexperienced player 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.519
 that's why and of course that's right 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.569
 that the players commit that too 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.530
 a bit of experience to bring the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.190
 I think if you're up there 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.109
 wants to play 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.400
 that's why I do not really care 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.389
 the fighting spirit but on the contrary 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.829
 give gas again 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.239
 last question felix kroos as 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.569
 defender, how satisfied are you 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.430
 remained 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.870
 I'm pretty happy as well as that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.729
 statistics shows two goals 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.650
 He can read the game and has one 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.699
 good positional game and we say so 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.600
 would have to go slow now 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:57.310
 then shoot everything would be great 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.310
 that was south stream
