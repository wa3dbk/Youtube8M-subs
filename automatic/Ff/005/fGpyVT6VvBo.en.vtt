00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
bit pretentious because if we look at

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.900 
bit pretentious because if we look at
makers<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.230> Vassar<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:31.920> Constantine<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
makers like Vassar and Constantine I

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
makers like Vassar and Constantine I
know<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.540> my<00:00:33.570> own<00:00:33.899> vintage<00:00:34.290> bachelor<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
know if my own vintage bachelor and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.360 
know if my own vintage bachelor and
Constantine<00:00:35.520> which<00:00:35.670> uses<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> Geneva<00:00:36.510> steel

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370

k100<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.610> movement<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.350> over

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
k100 one movement it's a little bit over

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.959 
k100 one movement it's a little bit over
the<00:00:40.710> top<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.129> say<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> should<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.850> an

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the top to say it should have an

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
the top to say it should have an
in-house<00:00:42.300> movement<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> movement

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
in-house movement because the movement

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.479 
in-house movement because the movement
was<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.100> designed<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.840> AP<00:00:45.840> VC<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.920> j<00:00:47.250> LC

e<00:00:51.539> bosch<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:53.520> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> comment<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.570> think

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
e bosch so that kind of comment I think

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.450 
e bosch so that kind of comment I think
it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.530> bit<00:00:55.710> off-putting<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
it's a little bit off-putting it's a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.150 
it's a little bit off-putting it's a
little<00:00:56.640> bit<00:00:56.730> being<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.329> smartass

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
little bit being a bit of a smartass

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.220 
little bit being a bit of a smartass
however<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.430> think<00:00:59.489> every<00:00:59.969> man<00:01:00.539> should<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
however I think every man should have a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.790 
however I think every man should have a
wristwatch

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800

over $4,000 and it needs to be a luxury

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.149 
over $4,000 and it needs to be a luxury
wristwatch<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:07.290> let's<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> look<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.010> this
