00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.360
 yesterday so much grip today I must let go 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.119
 because I do not notice your skin even if you love me 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.970
 play because I do not know who I am though 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.790
 nothing goes wrong maybe we never conceive to be 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.950
 of others perhaps back to the routine of 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.200
 make the synergy with the micro and my 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.900
 pain making music my only women 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.850
 My best castle is sadness and loneliness 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.770
 the time my arms the word and the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500
 I really swear it was yesterday when 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.600
 we play an eternal love at the same time 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.420
 that we stopped seeing each other because of that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.909
 I preach not do anything good time 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 if music that heals crying builds 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.420
 in a desert a cabin with my 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.790
 tears smoking my dreams with a 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.400
 palms locked in my permanent oasis 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.650
 and a sun nothing complicated me because everything is 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.110
 transient seeing your eyes so that 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.970
 see who I am loose ideas giving of 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.400
 eat with good music that waits for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.500
 my best after these criticisms I did it for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 you today I think about the future and yesterday 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.600
 dynamite I do not seek comfort without satisfying to 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.060
 my goddess I swear I wrote the best 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.890
 phrases for it does not look for the bitch or the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.570
 good nor the beautiful I go with mario 'with 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.570
 careful in case I fall into the pit 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.870
 I look in the mirror and say who I am 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.690
 I have turned with skinny pants and 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.000
 I wanted to be a lawyer, I followed his advice 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.350
 and now I give up so many blows 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.350
 as a boy that in the end I 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.840
 used to live alive between potholes 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.730
 I write and I bend over and continue between sentences 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.560
 I no longer write only tacho 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.690
 I'm not a male I'm crying for 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.970
 nights another night that I wake up and I 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.130
 I die horn a bit and have you 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.530
 how many times have I lost if you go out 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.290
 never depressed and fun nights by 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.630
 I say that thanks to life for my mother 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.060
 thanks to my mother for my life and I 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.560
 I wake up when I discover a lie 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.959
 because once they've lied to you 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.660
 you know what is true love without you 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.970
 it's only hurt like a beach without a sea 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.430
 it's just a desert, I'm going to write a 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.010
 theme I'm going to change schemes I'm going to live 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.650
 for me not for others and I'm very much 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.180
 I go there so many times that before I said 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.180
 bullshit and now I'm an asshole 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.820
 but like anybody I'm afraid 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.950
 fear of the known not to the different 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.320
 fear of ending up living like all the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.040
 people fear never knowing when it is 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.890
 enough 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.930
 sorry that I would be the person for you 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.719
 problem is that it does not let me be this 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.239
 system burns me inside to be like the 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.079
 do not touch me in the notebook that 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.390
 this is my zone 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.730
 I'm not discarded I think the logo 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.980
 insomnia I'm not lechowski I do not 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.109
 I write to hate everything I write 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.970
 I owe it to Diego is what I say for my 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.970
 parents my brothers my friends
