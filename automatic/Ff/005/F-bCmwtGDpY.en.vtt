magic chalk ink to edge each of the
petals<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.970> little<00:00:21.240> bit<00:00:21.390> darker<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
petals in a little bit darker of a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.679 
petals in a little bit darker of a
purple<00:00:22.560> color<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:23.880> hold<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> pedal

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
purple color so I just hold the pedal

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.250 
purple color so I just hold the pedal
and<00:00:25.189> rub<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.640> ink<00:00:26.880> around<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> edges<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:30.260> give

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
and rub the ink around the edges to give

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.290 
and rub the ink around the edges to give
some<00:00:31.500> different<00:00:31.830> dimension<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.940> flower

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.540 

I'm<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> third<00:00:37.290> panel<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
I'm just going to do the third panel and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.010 
I'm just going to do the third panel and
they<00:00:38.610> usually<00:00:38.820> don't<00:00:39.120> care<00:00:39.390> how<00:00:39.510> messy<00:00:39.870> this

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
they usually don't care how messy this

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
they usually don't care how messy this
is<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> doesn't<00:00:41.370> matter<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is because it doesn't matter on the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.139 
is because it doesn't matter on the
finished<00:00:43.079> product<00:00:46.670> I'm<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
finished product I'm going to do the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:01:00.900 
finished product I'm going to do the
bottom<00:00:48.500> two<00:00:49.500> petals<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.100> well

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.610 

now<00:01:01.910> I'm<00:01:02.120> going<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.360> use<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.630> different<00:01:03.050> color

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
now I'm going to use a different color

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.820 
now I'm going to use a different color
ink<00:01:05.260> for<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.380> center<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.430> flower<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.710> I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
ink for the center of the flower and I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.230 
ink for the center of the flower and I
just<00:01:10.010> rub<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.280> over<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:12.590> center<00:01:12.980> and<00:01:13.760> it's<00:01:14.120> a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
just rub it over the center and it's a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.230 
just rub it over the center and it's a
it's<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.810> pink<00:01:15.050> color<00:01:20.320> next<00:01:21.320> I'm<00:01:21.440> gonna<00:01:21.620> take

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
it's a pink color next I'm gonna take

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.930 
it's a pink color next I'm gonna take
the<00:01:23.240> top<00:01:23.450> petals<00:01:24.260> again<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:25.220> we<00:01:25.370> use<00:01:25.490> my<00:01:25.700> bone

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
the top petals again and we use my bone

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.500 
the top petals again and we use my bone
folder<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:27.340> curl<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.490> petals<00:01:28.670> outward<00:01:29.210> it's

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
folder to curl the petals outward it's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.690 
folder to curl the petals outward it's
sort<00:01:29.810> of<00:01:29.870> like<00:01:30.020> curling<00:01:30.470> ribbon<00:01:30.680> but<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.520> like

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
sort of like curling ribbon but I like

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.520 
sort of like curling ribbon but I like
to<00:01:31.880> use<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.150> bone<00:01:32.330> folder<00:01:32.360> because<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.350> has

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
to use the bone folder because it has

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.500 
to use the bone folder because it has
that<00:01:33.710> flat<00:01:34.040> edge<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.970> petal<00:01:35.300> layer

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
that flat edge so that the petal layer

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.620 
that flat edge so that the petal layer
doesn't<00:01:35.780> get<00:01:36.020> bent<00:01:37.270> I'm<00:01:38.270> gonna<00:01:38.390> do<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.600> same

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
doesn't get bent I'm gonna do the same

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.410 
doesn't get bent I'm gonna do the same
on<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.110> bottom<00:01:45.790> now<00:01:46.790> I'm<00:01:46.820> going<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.060> take<00:01:47.240> the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.130 
top layer again and there's these little
tabs<00:01:49.640> I've<00:01:49.940> created<00:01:50.270> then<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.690> want<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.930> bend

more<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.930> be<00:01:56.960> more<00:01:57.220> three-dimensional<00:01:58.420> so

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
more and be more three-dimensional so

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.210 
more and be more three-dimensional so
after<00:01:59.720> bending<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.259> tabs<00:02:00.590> I'm<00:02:00.890> going<00:02:01.160> to

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
after bending in the tabs I'm going to

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.820

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
little bit of glue on each tab then I'm

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.120 
little bit of glue on each tab then I'm
going<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:07.970> here<00:02:08.390> these<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.649> surrounding
