00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
different forms I tried to do this in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200

all<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.800> rooms<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.610> appeared<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.090> be

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
all of the rooms but it appeared to be

only come 7 7 and - apparently able to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.310 
only come 7 7 and - apparently able to
get<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.250> got<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.789> cam<00:01:00.090> 10<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> 4<00:01:01.079> as

get this but I got in cam 10 and 4 as
well<00:01:01.559> from<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.070> video<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.910> put<00:01:03.149> up

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
well from my video of just put up

well from my video of just put up
earlier<00:01:05.000> here<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> three<00:01:06.420> different

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
earlier here are the three different

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.410 
earlier here are the three different
forms<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> marionette<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.970> camera

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
forms of the marionette in the camera

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570 
forms of the marionette in the camera
one<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> where<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.400> its

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
one of them is where you can see its

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.399 
one of them is where you can see its
full<00:01:11.970> body<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.840> looks<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.260> actually

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
full body it looks like it's actually

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.670 
full body it looks like it's actually
floating<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> air<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.750> second<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
floating in the air the second one is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.100 
floating in the air the second one is
where<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.189> full<00:01:17.640> face<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.509> looking<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
where it's full face is looking at the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.670 
where it's full face is looking at the
camera<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.460> final<00:01:21.000> form<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.470> it's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
camera and the final form is where it's

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
camera and the final form is where it's
actually<00:01:22.799> looking<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> camera<00:01:23.490> again<00:01:24.180> but

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
actually looking at the camera again but

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.950 
actually looking at the camera again but
slightly<00:01:24.810> tilting<00:01:25.770> upwards<00:01:26.479> now<00:01:27.479> because<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
slightly tilting upwards now because we

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.719 
slightly tilting upwards now because we
don't<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.320> whether<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.829> an<00:01:29.009> elucidation

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
don't know whether it's an elucidation

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
don't know whether it's an elucidation
or<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> ghost<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.869> very<00:01:31.110> hard<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.470> speculate

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
or a ghost it's very hard to speculate

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.789 
or a ghost it's very hard to speculate
is<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.299> marionette<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> ghost<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
is the marionette a ghost is the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
is the marionette a ghost is the
marionette<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.520> an<00:01:35.759> animatronic<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.750> or

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
marionette not an animatronic at all or

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
marionette not an animatronic at all or
and<00:01:37.380> has<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.860> an<00:01:37.979> endoskeleton<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and has got an endoskeleton because it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.719 
and has got an endoskeleton because it
seems<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.509> very<00:01:39.540> skinny<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:41.070> fit<00:01:41.280> inside<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
seems to be very skinny to fit inside a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.480 
seems to be very skinny to fit inside a
robot<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.890> endoskeleton<00:01:43.890> inside<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
robot and endoskeleton inside of that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.569 
robot and endoskeleton inside of that
costume<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.259> could<00:01:46.500> possibly<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> ghost

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
costume so it could possibly be a ghost

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.240 
costume so it could possibly be a ghost
or<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.689> mind<00:01:48.960> playing<00:01:49.409> tricks<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
or it's you mind playing tricks on you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.179 
or it's you mind playing tricks on you
with<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> camera<00:01:50.880> would<00:01:51.600> only<00:01:52.200> spawns<00:01:52.799> when

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
with the camera would only spawns when

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.149 
with the camera would only spawns when
it<00:01:53.280> escapes<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.119> music<00:01:54.570> box<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
it escapes the music box so it is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.910 
it escapes the music box so it is
