00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.630 
them to come out with Spanx for bathing
suits<00:00:19.470> but<00:00:19.590> they're<00:00:19.710> probably<00:00:19.830> not<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.520> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.160 
suits but they're probably not going to
do<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.029> think<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.300> future<00:00:21.840> so

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
do that I don't think that future so

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.300 
do that I don't think that future so
there<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.439> treatments<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.160> available

there are treatments that are available

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.820 
there are treatments that are available
to<00:00:23.880> help<00:00:24.029> reshape<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.050> backside<00:00:25.500> what<00:00:25.680> are

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to help reshape the backside what are

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.040 
to help reshape the backside what are
they<00:00:26.010> bill<00:00:26.220> well<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:27.000> lot<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.390> folks<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.869> need

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
they bill well a lot of folks just need

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.200 
they bill well a lot of folks just need
a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.260> lift<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.920> maybe<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.699> little

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
a little lift and maybe a little

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.030 
a little lift and maybe a little
tightening<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.929> Thermage<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> great

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
tightening and Thermage is a great

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.180 
tightening and Thermage is a great
choice<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.170> probably<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.800> uses

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
choice for that so it probably it uses

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.459 
choice for that so it probably it uses
radio<00:00:35.460> frequency<00:00:35.600> heating<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.840> tighten<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
radio frequency heating to tighten the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
radio frequency heating to tighten the
skin<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.370> probably<00:00:38.790> about<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.180> best

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
skin and this probably about the best

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.619 
skin and this probably about the best
procedure<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:41.030> doing<00:00:42.030> say<00:00:42.300> light

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
procedure out there for doing say light

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.110 
procedure out there for doing say light
on<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> buttocks<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.890> real<00:00:44.219> nice<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:45.030> we

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.729 
on the buttocks so it's real nice but we
have<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> lot<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> other<00:00:45.899> things<00:00:46.260> kind<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.620> you

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
back there okay so Thermage we know is a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.340 
back there okay so Thermage we know is a
known<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> trusted<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> shape<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
known and trusted way to shape and to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.959 
known and trusted way to shape and to
tighten<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.070> want<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
tighten but if you want more with the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.290 
tighten but if you want more with the
size<00:00:57.690> say<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.640> things<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.180> use

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
size say what what things can we use

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.689 
size say what what things can we use
well<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.289> both<00:01:01.530> ways<00:01:01.559> sometimes<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.430> size

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
well we go both ways sometimes on size

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.000 
well we go both ways sometimes on size
so<00:01:03.120> we<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.110> use<00:01:04.290> we<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> lot<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
so we I like to use we do a lot of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.300 
so we I like to use we do a lot of
liposuction<00:01:05.519> combined<00:01:06.390> with<00:01:06.780> fat<00:01:07.140> transfer

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
liposuction combined with fat transfer

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.469 
liposuction combined with fat transfer
so<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.729> shape<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> buttocks

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
so we can kind of shape the buttocks

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.320 
so we can kind of shape the buttocks
with<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.189> liposuction<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.850> take<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
with the liposuction and then take that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.510 
with the liposuction and then take that
fat<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.960> put<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.650> into<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> butt<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
fat and put it back into the butt to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.600 
fat and put it back into the butt to
make<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:15.540> lifted<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.799> give<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> fuller

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
make it more lifted and give it a fuller

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.340 
make it more lifted and give it a fuller
more<00:01:17.790> rounded<00:01:18.540> appearance<00:01:18.659> yeah<00:01:19.140> that's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
more rounded appearance yeah that's

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.690 
more rounded appearance yeah that's
pretty<00:01:19.530> good<00:01:19.680> because<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.220> would<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.369> when

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
pretty good because you would think when

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.130 
pretty good because you would think when
you<00:01:20.790> first<00:01:21.000> hear<00:01:21.240> about<00:01:21.270> transfer<00:01:21.930> anything

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
you first hear about transfer anything

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.450 
you first hear about transfer anything
the<00:01:22.290> butt<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.890> maybe<00:01:23.070> don't<00:01:23.310> need

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the butt you think I maybe don't need

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
the butt you think I maybe don't need
volume<00:01:23.820> back<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.049> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
volume back there but when you see it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
volume back there but when you see it
Nexen<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.710> actually<00:01:26.009> does<00:01:26.189> shape<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> die<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
Nexen it actually does shape and die it

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390 
Nexen it actually does shape and die it
really<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:28.020> make<00:01:28.259> from<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> kind<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really can really make from a kind of

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.420 
really can really make from a kind of
shapeless<00:01:30.350> posterior<00:01:31.350> -<00:01:31.590> very<00:01:31.829> nice<00:01:32.040> shapely

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
shapeless posterior - very nice shapely

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
shapeless posterior - very nice shapely

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
one okay what if I need lift and shaping

one okay what if I need lift and shaping
but<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.619> want<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> add<00:01:34.950> volume<00:01:35.670> yeah<00:01:36.329> if

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
but I don't want to add volume yeah if

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480 
but I don't want to add volume yeah if
you<00:01:36.509> don't<00:01:36.689> want<00:01:36.960> much<00:01:37.229> volume<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you don't want much volume you like the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
you don't want much volume you like the
size<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.630> feel<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:39.960> you've<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:40.380> of

size but you feel like you've kind of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.039 
size but you feel like you've kind of
fallen<00:01:40.979> there's<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.579> new<00:01:42.240> technique<00:01:42.780> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
fallen there's a new technique that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.929 
fallen there's a new technique that
we're<00:01:43.530> calling<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> Brazilian<00:01:44.369> thread<00:01:44.670> lift

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
we're calling the Brazilian thread lift

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.780 
we're calling the Brazilian thread lift
and<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.740> suture<00:01:46.740> lift<00:01:47.159> we're<00:01:47.399> using

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and it's a suture lift we're using

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.749 
and it's a suture lift we're using
sutures<00:01:48.030> or<00:01:48.329> threads<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.460> nice

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
sutures or threads and it's really nice

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.030 
sutures or threads and it's really nice
because<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.390> done<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> office<00:01:52.680> under

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
because it's a done in the office under

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.090 
because it's a done in the office under
local<00:01:53.189> anesthesia<00:01:53.880> -<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.840> hour<00:01:55.020> sessions<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
local anesthesia - one hour sessions and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920 
local anesthesia - one hour sessions and
what<00:01:56.250> makes<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> special<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> sutures

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
what makes it special is the sutures

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
what makes it special is the sutures
have<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.469> cones<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.490> cause<00:01:59.759> your<00:02:00.000> body

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
have little cones that cause your body

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.389 
have little cones that cause your body
to<00:02:00.329> develop<00:02:00.930> ligament<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.369> come

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
to develop ligament so that when we come

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.389 
to develop ligament so that when we come
back<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.969> lift<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.990> very<00:02:04.200> smooth<00:02:04.740> even

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
back and lift it's a very smooth even

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.180 
back and lift it's a very smooth even
lift<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.240> lift<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.350> nice<00:02:07.680> round

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
lift so we can get lift and a nice round

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.080 
lift so we can get lift and a nice round
look

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
look

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.710 
look
without<00:02:09.860> having<00:02:10.860> more<00:02:11.069> volume<00:02:11.640> okay<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
without having more volume okay and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.059 
without having more volume okay and
that's<00:02:12.840> oh<00:02:12.959> that's<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.290> really<00:02:13.770> exciting

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
that's oh that's a really exciting

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.830 
that's oh that's a really exciting
innovation<00:02:14.730> there<00:02:15.000> because<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.540> not

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
innovation there because I have not

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
innovation there because I have not
heard<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.170> too<00:02:16.530> much<00:02:16.650> before<00:02:17.069> it's<00:02:18.030> brand

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
heard that too much before it's brand

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.820 
heard that too much before it's brand
new<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.720> part<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.110> country<00:02:19.290> there's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
new to this part of the country there's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.140 
new to this part of the country there's
only<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.040> couple<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.340> their<00:02:20.459> practices<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
only a couple of their practices in the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.030 
only a couple of their practices in the
in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.690> United<00:02:21.989> States<00:02:22.230> doing<00:02:22.440> okay<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:22.830> can

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
in the United States doing okay so can

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.140 
in the United States doing okay so can
you<00:02:23.130> combine<00:02:23.310> these<00:02:23.520> procedures<00:02:23.970> together

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
you combine these procedures together

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.570 
you combine these procedures together
yeah<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.750> particular<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.440> combine<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> lot<00:02:26.250> of

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
yeah in particular we combine a lot of

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.930 
yeah in particular we combine a lot of
the<00:02:27.180> fat<00:02:27.360> transfer<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.040> string<00:02:29.489> let<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the fat transfer with the string let the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.570 
the fat transfer with the string let the
thread<00:02:30.180> lift<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.620> get<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:32.130> lot<00:02:32.519> of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
thread lift so that we can get a lot of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.330 
thread lift so that we can get a lot of
lift<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.140> little<00:02:34.349> more<00:02:34.530> fullness<00:02:34.860> and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
lift and then a little more fullness and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.550 
lift and then a little more fullness and
volume<00:02:35.400> for<00:02:36.209> those<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.630> need<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.050> okay<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
volume for those that need that okay and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.259 
volume for those that need that okay and
the<00:02:37.650> consultation<00:02:38.130> process<00:02:38.250> becomes<00:02:38.819> very

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
the consultation process becomes very

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.490 
the consultation process becomes very
important<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.080> can<00:02:40.200> see<00:02:40.349> which

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
important so that you can see which

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.229 
important so that you can see which
combinations<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.220> need<00:02:41.400> before<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:41.940> afters

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
combinations you need before and afters

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.660 
combinations you need before and afters
always<00:02:42.600> speak<00:02:42.840> volumes<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.160> use<00:02:44.519> that

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
always speak volumes if we can use that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.490 
always speak volumes if we can use that
term<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.690> let's<00:02:45.720> take<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.019> look<00:02:46.230> at<00:02:46.350> some<00:02:46.470> of

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
term so let's take a look at some of

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.080 
term so let's take a look at some of
your<00:02:46.709> clients<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.489> explain<00:02:47.850> what<00:02:47.970> we're

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
your clients and I explain what we're

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.280 
your clients and I explain what we're
seeing<00:02:48.269> here<00:02:48.480> what<00:02:48.600> procedures<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.140> had

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
seeing here what procedures they had

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.120 
seeing here what procedures they had
done<00:02:49.470> well<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.519> combination<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
done well this is the combination of the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.520 
done well this is the combination of the
Brazilian<00:02:53.130> lift<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.030> fat<00:02:54.269> transfer<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
Brazilian lift or fat transfer and the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.070 
Brazilian lift or fat transfer and the
thread<00:02:55.799> lift<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.459> can<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.880> before<00:02:57.120> it's

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
thread lift so you can see before it's

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.320 
thread lift so you can see before it's
very<00:02:58.470> flat<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.190> kind<00:02:59.640> of<00:02:59.700> shapeless<00:03:00.299> and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
very flat and kind of shapeless and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.839 
very flat and kind of shapeless and
afterwards<00:03:01.049> not<00:03:01.200> only<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.920> shaped<00:03:02.580> it

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
afterwards not only have we shaped it

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.210 
afterwards not only have we shaped it
but<00:03:03.209> giving<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.720> much<00:03:04.080> better<00:03:04.349> definition<00:03:04.590> and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
but giving it much better definition and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.580 
but giving it much better definition and
around<00:03:05.549> or<00:03:05.730> fuller<00:03:06.000> appearance<00:03:06.480> how<00:03:07.380> about

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
around or fuller appearance how about

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.970 
around or fuller appearance how about
here

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
here

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.890 
here
this<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.489> thread<00:03:08.760> lift<00:03:09.000> by<00:03:09.180> itself<00:03:09.569> and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
this is the thread lift by itself and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.860 
this is the thread lift by itself and
it's<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:11.069> kind<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.730> fallen<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.630> first

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
it's just kind of fallen in the first

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.900 
it's just kind of fallen in the first
picture<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.440> when<00:03:13.829> we<00:03:13.920> came<00:03:14.130> back<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.670> did

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
picture and when we came back and did

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.180 
picture and when we came back and did
the<00:03:15.150> Brazilian<00:03:15.780> thread<00:03:15.989> lift<00:03:16.230> afterwards<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the Brazilian thread lift afterwards you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.160 
the Brazilian thread lift afterwards you
can<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.549> now<00:03:17.850> we're<00:03:18.209> back<00:03:18.420> up<00:03:18.630> where<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:19.019> would

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
can see now we're back up where we would

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.900 
can see now we're back up where we would
like<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.799> have<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> little<00:03:20.400> bit<00:03:20.609> fuller

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
like it and have a little bit fuller

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
like it and have a little bit fuller
appearance<00:03:21.630> as<00:03:21.840> well<00:03:22.049> when<00:03:22.500> do<00:03:22.590> we<00:03:22.650> see<00:03:22.890> these

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
appearance as well when do we see these

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.539 
appearance as well when do we see these
results<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.549> they<00:03:23.640> pretty<00:03:23.820> immediate<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
results are they pretty immediate the

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.430 
results are they pretty immediate the
fat<00:03:26.549> transfer<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.660> pretty<00:03:27.959> immediate

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
fat transfer is pretty immediate

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.349 
fat transfer is pretty immediate
although<00:03:28.829> we<00:03:29.340> really<00:03:29.790> think<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.090> being

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
although we really think that being

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.789 
although we really think that being
about<00:03:30.540> three<00:03:30.930> months<00:03:31.230> four<00:03:31.440> you're<00:03:31.560> looking

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
about three months four you're looking

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680 
about three months four you're looking
at<00:03:31.890> your<00:03:32.010> final<00:03:32.310> results<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.540> same

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
at your final results and the same

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.030 
at your final results and the same
that's<00:03:33.840> pretty<00:03:34.079> true<00:03:34.319> with<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> thread<00:03:34.829> lift

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
that's pretty true with the thread lift

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.160 
that's pretty true with the thread lift
because<00:03:35.280> when<00:03:35.489> we<00:03:35.609> do<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.209> initial<00:03:36.900> placement

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
because when we do the initial placement

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.710 
because when we do the initial placement
we<00:03:37.920> place<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.430> sutures<00:03:38.850> then<00:03:39.090> we<00:03:39.209> wait<00:03:39.510> for

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
we place the sutures then we wait for

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.059 
we place the sutures then we wait for
about<00:03:39.870> three<00:03:40.200> months<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.650> those<00:03:40.829> are<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
about three months so those are the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.129 
about three months so those are the
ligaments<00:03:41.430> form<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.450> come<00:03:42.600> back<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.930> three

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
ligaments form and we come back in three

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.979 
ligaments form and we come back in three
months<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.560> pull<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.889> tight<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.430> then<00:03:45.209> from

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
months and pull it tight and then from

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.110 
months and pull it tight and then from
that's<00:03:46.170> on<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.530> second<00:03:46.920> session<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.880> see

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that's on that second session you see

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.789 
that's on that second session you see
exactly<00:03:48.510> where<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.049> are<00:03:49.109> in<00:03:49.380> fact<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.680> can

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
exactly where you are in fact we can

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.640 
exactly where you are in fact we can
adjust<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.400> if<00:03:50.910> we<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.269> that's<00:03:51.870> good<00:03:52.170> options

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
adjust it if we like that's good options

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.289 
adjust it if we like that's good options
