00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.200
 hi friends from youtube i am your friend 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.730
 Carlos RamÃ­rez with a new tutorial 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.400
 for his gta san andreas 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.980
 now I bring you a new one in very series 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.960
 good and apart is low-income for 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.939
 those who do not know what this is because it is 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.550
 something that changes graphics a lot 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.160
 of the gta gives reflection to the cars 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.020
 look better at the water and several other things and 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.300
 with the low resources I mean 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.730
 which is for computers that are not so 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.530
 fast and with other Euroseries is 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.629
 slow down when activated 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.220
 good with this will not happen and if the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.559
 activate it makes you slow 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.290
 then admit it your pc is crap 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.120
 hahaha good let's start to download 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.580
 we have to go to the link that gives them 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.710
 I left in the description and in this link in 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.470
 the upper right part will appear 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.809
 that we wait five seconds we wait and 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.030
 we will give you here in jumping advertising a 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.309
 Once done this will send us to mediafire and 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.500
 here we just download the file giving it 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.390
 in download I do not download it because 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.250
 I have it but once the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.409
 download will be a file like 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.190
 this to which we will give right click and 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.190
 extract here 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.190
 once finished extracting we will be left 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.530
 these three files that are those of lem 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.080
 series and good to install them in the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.600
 gta san andreas then we go to where 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.750
 we have it installed in my case I'm going 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.000
 to local disk ce program files 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.190
 rockstargames and gta san andreas as you see 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 I have several gta but in my case what 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.420
 install other is the ring since 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.700
 in which he used frequently I already have 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.009
 one that is medium-sized good 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.140
 we open the folder of our gta iv 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.479
 we move the files here and ready 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.270
 once this is done they will have a swing 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 series clarified if when you open your gta san 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.009
 andreas and suddenly he does not open the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 So, do not worry, I will not fuck you 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.789
 what happens is that then you 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.240
 computer is not compatible with this 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.070
 mod 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.990
 if it is not compatible and it does not open the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.330
 gta just deletes the lem files 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 series to reopen you good 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.670
 Now let's go to the game so they can see how 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.860
 it is used here we are in the gta san 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.440
 andreas and as you can see I have four cars 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.170
 that look normal but if we activate 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.040
 the in series will look much better for 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.860
 activate it 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.110
 we just press shift + f 12 and as you see 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.690
 the graphics changed a lot 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.940
 now our gta is much better 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.070
 they see very well the cars were put on 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.260
 better reflections to the cars and also 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.660
 the sea looks better the water looks 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.420
 crystal clear in my opinion with the m series 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.090
 it looks better the good gta friends that's 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.519
 I hope everything will be a greeting and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.650
