holiday and be in the movie all merged
into<00:03:40.800> this<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:42.530> yes<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.769> why<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.250> so

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
into this and yes that's why this is so

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.000 
into this and yes that's why this is so
huge<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.810> doesn't<00:03:46.080> have<00:03:46.200> all<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.560> animated

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
huge it doesn't have all the animated

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.640 
huge it doesn't have all the animated
series<00:03:47.130> episodes<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.880> has<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.480> think<00:03:49.260> two

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
series episodes it has I think two

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.199 
series episodes it has I think two
volumes<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.280> might<00:03:50.400> have<00:03:50.550> about<00:03:50.700> like<00:03:50.970> 10

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
volumes so it might have about like 10

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.310 
volumes so it might have about like 10
episodes<00:03:51.630> on<00:03:51.840> here<00:03:52.220> um<00:03:53.720> but<00:03:54.720> yeah<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.200> is
