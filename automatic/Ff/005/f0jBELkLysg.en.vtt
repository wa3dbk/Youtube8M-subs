00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
round of the actual braid itself so what

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.400 
round of the actual braid itself so what
we're<00:03:02.209> going<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.360> do<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:02.959> all<00:03:03.110> done<00:03:03.260> in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
we're going to do is it's all done in

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.380 
we're going to do is it's all done in
Perl<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.040> bring<00:03:04.250> your<00:03:04.370> yarns<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.060> front

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
Perl so bring your yarns to the front

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.900 
Perl so bring your yarns to the front
and<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.770> first<00:03:06.980> stitch<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.220> blue<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:07.820> I'm

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
and the first stitch is blue so I'm

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.479 
and the first stitch is blue so I'm
going<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.120> wrap<00:03:08.360> with<00:03:08.750> blue<00:03:09.430> over<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.610> top

going to wrap with blue over the top

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.740 
going to wrap with blue over the top
pick<00:03:13.489> up<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.730> next<00:03:13.910> stitch<00:03:14.150> which<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.360> green

with blue over the top green wrap around
and<00:03:28.280> you'll<00:03:28.430> see<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.790> yarns<00:03:29.090> are<00:03:29.269> sort<00:03:29.450> of

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
and you'll see the yarns are sort of

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.370 
and you'll see the yarns are sort of
helicoptering<00:03:30.800> over<00:03:31.160> each<00:03:31.280> other<00:03:31.550> and<00:03:32.170> as<00:03:33.170> I

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
helicoptering over each other and as I

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.900 
helicoptering over each other and as I
progress<00:03:33.590> they're<00:03:34.190> going<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.400> become<00:03:34.670> quite

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
progress they're going to become quite

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.870 
progress they're going to become quite
twisted<00:03:35.890> but<00:03:36.890> that's<00:03:37.070> okay<00:03:37.340> because<00:03:37.370> they

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
twisted but that's okay because they

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.520 
twisted but that's okay because they
will<00:03:38.030> untwist<00:03:38.510> on<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.810> following<00:03:39.230> round<00:03:41.530> this

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
will untwist on the following round this

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:51.520 
will untwist on the following round this
is<00:03:42.680> actually<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.250> base<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.810> braid

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.660 

one<00:03:52.530> thing<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.830> keep<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.130> mind<00:03:53.340> as<00:03:53.550> you're

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
one thing to keep in mind as you're

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.360 
one thing to keep in mind as you're
working<00:03:53.730> your<00:03:54.120> braid<00:03:54.480> is<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.040> needs<00:03:56.250> to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
working your braid is that it needs to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.980 
working your braid is that it needs to
be<00:03:56.460> worked<00:03:56.640> on<00:03:56.910> an<00:03:57.330> even<00:03:57.630> number<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.900> stitches

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
be worked on an even number of stitches

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.130 
be worked on an even number of stitches
and<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:59.760> works<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.090> lot<00:04:00.180> better<00:04:00.240> if<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.840> are

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
and it works a lot better if you are

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.080 
and it works a lot better if you are
knitting<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.710> round<00:04:01.800> if<00:04:02.730> you're<00:04:02.910> knitting

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
knitting in the round if you're knitting

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.730 
knitting in the round if you're knitting
flat<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.900> do<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.200> but<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.530> quite

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
flat you can do it but it's quite

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.490 
flat you can do it but it's quite
complicated<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.930> it's<00:04:06.930> just<00:04:07.080> easier<00:04:07.440> when

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
complicated and it's just easier when

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:19.160 
complicated and it's just easier when
worked<00:04:07.860> in<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.160> round

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.539 

now<00:04:20.170> you'll<00:04:20.380> see<00:04:20.620> here<00:04:20.829> I'm<00:04:20.950> coming<00:04:21.100> up<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.430> the

now you'll see here I'm coming up to the

end of my round a couple more stitches
to<00:04:25.570> do<00:04:25.750> here<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.850> now<00:04:27.850> we've<00:04:28.030> been<00:04:28.240> wrapping

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
to do here and now we've been wrapping

to<00:04:35.380> wrap<00:04:35.560> from<00:04:35.800> underneath<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.570> instead<00:04:37.960> of

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
to wrap from underneath so instead of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.230 
to wrap from underneath so instead of
wrapping<00:04:38.430> over<00:04:39.430> this<00:04:39.610> way<00:04:39.850> we're<00:04:40.090> going<00:04:40.120> to

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
wrapping over this way we're going to

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.290 
wrapping over this way we're going to
wrap<00:04:40.480> under<00:04:41.290> this<00:04:41.560> way<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.850> again<00:04:43.120> we're

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
wrap under this way so again we're

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.320 
wrap under this way so again we're
keeping<00:04:43.600> our<00:04:43.720> colors<00:04:44.050> correct<00:04:44.820> wrap<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.030> blue

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
keeping our colors correct wrap the blue

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.610 
keeping our colors correct wrap the blue
from<00:04:47.050> underneath<00:04:48.510> green<00:04:49.510> from<00:04:50.260> underneath

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
from underneath green from underneath

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.280 
from underneath green from underneath
and<00:04:51.010> again<00:04:51.280> we're<00:04:51.430> still<00:04:51.580> purling<00:04:52.290> but

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
and again we're still purling but

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.460 
and again we're still purling but
instead<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.710> wrapping<00:04:54.040> around<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.370> top<00:04:55.470> we're

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
instead of wrapping around the top we're

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.030 
instead of wrapping around the top we're
wrapping<00:04:56.830> from<00:04:57.190> underneath<00:04:58.500> this<00:04:59.500> forms<00:04:59.860> the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
wrapping from underneath this forms the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.820 
wrapping from underneath this forms the
top<00:05:00.070> bar<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:01.590> your<00:05:02.590> braid<00:05:07.410> now<00:05:08.410> this<00:05:08.590> braid

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
top bar of your braid now this braid

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.550 
top bar of your braid now this braid
that<00:05:08.950> we've<00:05:09.130> worked<00:05:09.310> points<00:05:09.820> to<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.090> left<00:05:10.560> and

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
that we've worked points to the left and

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.170 
that we've worked points to the left and
here<00:05:11.770> we<00:05:11.919> bring<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.190> yarns<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.700> back<00:05:12.880> I

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
here we bring the yarns to the back I

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.860 
here we bring the yarns to the back I
think<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:13.750> can<00:05:13.930> see<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.290> quite<00:05:14.470> well<00:05:14.740> if<00:05:15.870> you

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
think you can see that quite well if you

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.240 
think you can see that quite well if you
want<00:05:17.050> your<00:05:17.169> braid<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:17.380> point<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:17.860> opposite

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
want your braid to point the opposite

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.550 
want your braid to point the opposite
direction<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.030> right<00:05:19.290> you<00:05:20.290> would

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
direction to the right you would

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.890 
direction to the right you would
actually<00:05:20.740> change<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.520> sequence<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:22.270> which

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
actually change the sequence in which

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.040 
actually change the sequence in which
you<00:05:23.169> wrap<00:05:23.380> your<00:05:23.590> yarns<00:05:24.190> so<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:25.419> first<00:05:25.690> round

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
you wrap your yarns so the first round

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.100 
you wrap your yarns so the first round
you<00:05:26.380> would<00:05:27.070> wrap<00:05:27.250> them<00:05:27.280> from<00:05:27.729> below<00:05:28.060> as<00:05:28.360> we're

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
you would wrap them from below as we're

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.700 
you would wrap them from below as we're
doing<00:05:29.350> right<00:05:29.530> now<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:31.500> following<00:05:32.500> round

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
doing right now and the following round

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.500 
doing right now and the following round
you<00:05:32.919> would<00:05:33.040> wrap<00:05:33.250> them<00:05:33.280> from<00:05:33.700> above<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.240> that

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
you would wrap them from above and that

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.360 
you would wrap them from above and that
would<00:05:34.660> change<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:35.050> direction<00:05:35.200> of<00:05:35.530> your<00:05:35.590> braid

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
would change the direction of your braid

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.310 
would change the direction of your braid
so<00:05:36.910> go<00:05:37.060> ahead<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.300> try<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.600> see<00:05:38.020> what<00:05:38.200> you

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
so go ahead and try it see what you

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:47.399 
so go ahead and try it see what you
think

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.469 

you
