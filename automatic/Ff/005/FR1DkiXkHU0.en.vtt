00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
explain that it's kind of hard to do so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.639

I<00:00:33.270> mean<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> don't<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.469> this

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I mean if you don't know how to do this

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.360 
I mean if you don't know how to do this
I<00:00:34.950> wouldn't<00:00:35.790> attempt<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> do<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.350> if<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
I wouldn't attempt to do it but if you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you know you don't know how to do it you

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.450 
you know you don't know how to do it you
know<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> put<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
know you put it in there and then you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.729 
know you put it in there and then you
saw<00:00:47.700> down<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.660> move<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.320> saw

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
saw down you move it a little bit saw

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
saw down you move it a little bit saw
down<00:00:49.980> move<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.910> now<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
down move it a little bit so now you can

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
down move it a little bit so now you can
see<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> grooves<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.000> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
see have the grooves in there and you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
see have the grooves in there and you
can<00:00:54.149> smooth<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.440> know<00:00:56.370> there's

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
can smooth that out but you know there's

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.279 
can smooth that out but you know there's
no<00:00:56.670> point<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.030> smoothing<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
no point in smoothing it out if you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.049 
no point in smoothing it out if you
don't<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.829> see<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.079> mean<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:02.670> fits<00:01:02.910> in

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
don't need to see so I mean it fits in

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.590 
don't need to see so I mean it fits in
there<00:01:03.210> real<00:01:03.780> well<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.909> you're<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.270> had<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
there real well so you're gonna I had to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940 
there real well so you're gonna I had to
do<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> that's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
do that if you have to do that that's

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.330 
do that if you have to do that that's
kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> solution<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:10.590> other<00:01:10.740> thing<00:01:11.010> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
kind of the solution the other thing I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.940 
kind of the solution the other thing I
ran<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:11.939> which<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.659> my<00:01:13.020> problem<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.680> fault

that it would go ahead and you can do it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.010 
that it would go ahead and you can do it
well<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.710> cut<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.070> pieces<00:01:23.280> too<00:01:23.580> small<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.900> what

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
there um make sure the longer one the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.100 
there um make sure the longer one the
piece<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.830> goes<00:03:34.890> right<00:03:35.190> here<00:03:35.750> I'm<00:03:36.750> trying<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110

videotape<00:03:37.350> sideways<00:03:38.090> goes<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> little<00:03:39.480> bit

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
videotape sideways goes a little bit

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.080 
videotape sideways goes a little bit
longer<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.530> way<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:41.459> completely<00:03:41.880> flush

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
longer so that way it's completely flush

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.220 
longer so that way it's completely flush
otherwise<00:03:42.510> you're<00:03:42.660> gonna<00:03:42.720> run<00:03:42.930> into<00:03:42.959> my

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
said building something like this

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.590 
said building something like this
will<00:04:19.730> cost<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:20.680> anywhere<00:04:21.680> from<00:04:21.889> $100<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.790> $150

will cost you anywhere from $100 to $150
depending<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.050> wood<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:24.650> if<00:04:25.070> you<00:04:25.310> have<00:04:25.400> to

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
depending on the wood and if you have to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.600 
depending on the wood and if you have to
buy<00:04:25.700> everything<00:04:26.330> so<00:04:27.169> I<00:04:27.590> mean<00:04:28.130> I<00:04:28.190> don't<00:04:28.250> have<00:04:28.430> to

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
buy everything so I mean I don't have to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.580 
buy everything so I mean I don't have to
buy<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.790> screws<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.510> don't<00:04:30.080> have<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.380> buy<00:04:30.530> the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590

paint<00:04:31.190> or<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.550> primer<00:04:32.480> or<00:04:32.930> some<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:33.980> stuff

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
paint or the primer or some of the stuff

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.379 
paint or the primer or some of the stuff
