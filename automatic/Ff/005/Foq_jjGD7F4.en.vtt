 all the videos in scan questions 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.480
 comments urgency preview the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.949
 photos that we have done here 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.210
 we simply enter the 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.440
 photo gallery we enter the reel 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 Here we can see which ones are 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.600
 they are made in burst and what not by 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.329
 example of these photos that we see here 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.090
 they are simple but the one here is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 you can see that there are like three pictures a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.600
 on top of the other 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.820
 those are burst is to say that these two 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.719
 that are here are in bursts and those 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.719
 others are normal 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.840
 ready then to visualize all the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.760
 photos that we have taken there in this 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.729
 burst we just click on the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.940
 burst but very let's go that way we move 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.409
 so to the side we see the other photo 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.050
 earlier that we had that is also 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.750
 burst and then we see the photo that you 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.270
 it follows that it does not burst but we are interested in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.920
 see the 12 photos that are in that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.229
 moment for example in this burst for 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 see that we just click here 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.820
 below where is to select favorites 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.550
 we can immediately see here a great 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.070
 number of photos and so easily 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.460
 we can visualize all the photos that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.950
 we take in the burst 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.310
 the phone will automatically select 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.720
 his tour which is the best photo as 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 we can see here below there is a dot 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.150
 gray according to the phone love photo is this 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.270
 if we agree or not with that we give 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.540
 click here we give chulito then you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.759
 we give ok here he's going to tell me he's going to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.950
 ask if we want to keep all 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.899
 which we take a picture or floor 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 keep what we have favor and how 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.400
 favorite the ideal would be to no longer keep 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.010
 which for us seemed love photo 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.080
 we click there and ready 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.690
 here the phone already separated the photo that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.430
 we chose and removed the other photos that 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.349
 we take in burst 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.390
 remember that before there was another war 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.420
 faca of 5000 and then the one that is nothing 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.400
 so it's simple we can visualize and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.799
 select the best photo from a photo 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.180
 taken burst is mostly for this 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.370
