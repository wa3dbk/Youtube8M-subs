00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.180
 but hello 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:10.490
 This is a quick review and if you haven't 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.339
 know this series of short reviews on 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.320
 interesting things in my opinion if 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.480
 you will want something from the express reviews 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.060
 write a full big issue 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.070
 in the comments here and i will then do 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.410
 this video will be for you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.270
 comparisons detailed reviews much more 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.640
 Today, in the express review hit 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.600
 space landing designer from 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.700
 sluban companies 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.220
 I found this designer interesting 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.490
 so that it contains such things 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.950
 robots and in this case in this series 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.230
 three robots from which you can assemble 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.820
 one big also this constructor 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 can be found not only in the Internet 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.900
 the store but also in large stores 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.120
 toys and so these sets more 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.450
 available for purchase let's 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.530
 let's unpack and see what's inside 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.989
 3 2 bags of stickers here fell out here 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.480
 instruction in a set of 108 tito lei 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.729
 most of them are large and looking 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.289
 On the instructions, I think that I will collect it 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.869
 fast enough and it will be easy 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:11.090
 quality of parts no claim they are 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.579
 durable bottom boats are present 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.920
 interesting elements like you see 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.229
 which should provide good 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.719
 mobility until it resembles 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.819
 some chicken robot but maybe 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.270
 remember the opponent robocop a from the first 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.179
 parts 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.299
 but actually with the build process too 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.030
 all is well and no effort is not particularly 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.170
 need to be used for connections 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.020
 details everything firmly in place and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.390
 no problems arise yet 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.270
 Bonus remained spare parts and our 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.259
 the fur is ready well it looks pretty 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.420
 cool 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.720
 despite the fact that he has not ceased to be 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.430
 like a robocop chicken 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.860
 movable elements in the legs 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.190
 the body can rise and fall and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.180
 he may try to fly when masha 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.250
 with their wings 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.920
 that this model might try 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.020
 take off tells us and the propeller which 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.869
 located behind and so here 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.869
 rotates but there is a small note 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.489
 the cabin was made too heavy and if 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.680
 our robot is trying to bend see legs 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.140
 it can not stand but in principle on 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.730
 the picture is drawn so slightly 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.730
 rejected back 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.069
 so in this position when he 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.500
 call a little understood he stands confidently 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.870
 Well, now I do the same figure pilot 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.170
 collected head from his hands all over the place 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.480
 nothing falls off and not 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.549
 spilota falls apart everything is still good 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.579
 he has such a suit or suit 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.000
 which we can wear and looks like it in 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.100
 it is cool like this a small accessory 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.650
 can change the figure and turn it into 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.870
 Space Marines in the instructions do not 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.150
 it is written how to stick stickers so 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.489
 we can stick as we want but we will 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.680
 orient yourself to this image and here 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.359
 robot with a paratrooper assembled he looks 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.630
 really interesting it seems to me 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.780
 would look good with the sets 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.510
 low tide 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.790
 Series exo force which unfortunately also 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.640
 an hour is not allowed but I want to buy myself 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.100
 collection and put their row wait for 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.200
 me 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.520
 there is an analogue and run for force now 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.040
 I will bring while I do not have wai 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.320
 I will do the original league of this series 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.630
 at least like this on this constructor 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.240
 By the way was a review of one of my first 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.430
 releases and yes we see that they fit 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.200
 according to the style of each other the quality of it 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.350
 the designer is no match 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.090
 comes with quality in the company the servant is made 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.850
 from set really cool with 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.010
 small remarks but cool to me 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.980
 like sure to put on the shelf and 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.410
 if you want something else, I'll do a review on 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.060
 other constructors of this power to me 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.190
 it seems that this set can take off 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.580
 here in this position so it's still 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.920
 some kind 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.320
 transformers so player it turns out 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.150
 what a spaceship or such a space 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.640
 some small ship 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.070
 well , so far everyone thanks for watching 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.370
 put like flew to meet new 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.370
 to a look
