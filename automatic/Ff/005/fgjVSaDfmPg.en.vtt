00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
one with the controller for the same

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.470 
one with the controller for the same
price<00:03:05.310> because<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.760> was<00:03:05.849> rated<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.150> five

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
price because it was rated a five

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.860 
price because it was rated a five
instead<00:03:07.140> of<00:03:07.200> six<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.730> one's<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.030> 66<00:03:09.720> is

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
instead of six and this one's a 66 is

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.890 
instead of six and this one's a 66 is
excellent<00:03:10.410> five<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.920> average<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.760> i<00:03:12.030> figured<00:03:12.810> i

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
excellent five is average so i figured i

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.530 
excellent five is average so i figured i
would<00:03:13.049> rather<00:03:13.230> have<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.980> pristine<00:03:14.640> console

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
would rather have a pristine console

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.020 
would rather have a pristine console
then<00:03:16.200> one<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.010> kind<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.489> beat<00:03:17.640> up<00:03:17.670> and

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
then one that is kind of beat up and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.949 
then one that is kind of beat up and
comes<00:03:18.209> with<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.480> kind<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.780> beat-up

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
comes with the kind of beat-up

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.440 
comes with the kind of beat-up
controller<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.459> this<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:20.910> candy<00:03:21.239> then<00:03:21.359> the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
controller so this is candy then the
