00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Thanks to the victory over Cagliari and the simultaneous defeat of Milan in the derby 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 we secured the championship one day early 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 moreover in the summer market, Marotta will try to buy Van Persie 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 thus providing for the lack of a 15-20 goal striker per season ... 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.450
 Perfect, so together with Del Piero, they will form an invincible couple 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 My fuhrer ... 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.600
 Del Piero... 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.000
 Del Piero will not renew the contract at the end of the season ... 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 President Agnelli has so decided ... 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 Everyone who wasn't there in 2006 in B ... leaves the room 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.800
 What the fuck are you telling me !!? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 How the fuck is this possible? !! 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.700
 How the fuck can you not renew your captain's contract! 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 I can't believe you fucking! 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 He even followed us in B! 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.500
 rejecting millionaire offers from the strongest teams in the world and repaying it that way! 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.000
 My Fuhrer but the president has decided, we can't do anything about it! 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.000
 The eternal father may have decided not to give a fuck! 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 My Fuhrer, we can't do anything about it now, he's already looking for another team! 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.000
 Agnelli is a jerk, I would blow him up like a kick and punch! 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 I'll go look for it! 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 I would drown him by taking his breath away so he knows what I feel when I don't see Del Piero play at Juve! 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 It has nothing to do with his uncle! 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 He praised him, loved him, he could not do at least the captain! 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 He defended him from everyone and everything, he always believed in him and gave him nicknames! 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 As you watch what his nephew does ... 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 The well served in November at the press conference! 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.800
 Better not think about it or fuck it all up! 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 How disgusting! 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.500
 That sucks, I feel like crying shit! 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 That asshole keeps us at bay with the promise of the three stars! 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 I already know we won't put them in the end! 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.000
 The more I think about it, the more I get pissed! 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 I'll have to see shit buying! Other than Van Persie! 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Quiet, it's just venting, now it calms down .. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000
 Caressa is right ... 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.500
 He only goes there to lose ... 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 One.. 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.800
 Like Del Piero ... 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.500
 You don't even find it if you buy Messi or any other player in the world ... 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Goodbye Captain ...
