not<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.270> big<00:00:33.450> game<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.649> was<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.040> by

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
not a very big game and it was little by

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.549 
not a very big game and it was little by
iconic<00:00:35.850> games<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:37.110> game<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
iconic games the game is is a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.139 
iconic games the game is is a
third-person<00:00:37.920> overhead<00:00:38.399> shooter<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:38.910> does

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
third-person overhead shooter which does

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.060 
third-person overhead shooter which does
not<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.510> multiplayer<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> survival<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
not have multiplayer but a survival and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.979 
not have multiplayer but a survival and
campaign<00:00:41.579> modes<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.450> I'll<00:00:42.510> come<00:00:42.660> back<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
campaign modes so I'll come back to the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.910 
campaign modes so I'll come back to the
campaign<00:00:43.320> later<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.860> essentially<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
campaign later but it's essentially a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.779 
campaign later but it's essentially a
group<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.070> missions<00:00:47.399> which<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.670> will

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
group of missions which you will

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.510 
group of missions which you will
complete<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.210> by<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> most<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.890> them<00:00:50.100> are

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
complete one by one and most of them are

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
complete one by one and most of them are
rather<00:00:51.329> redundant<00:00:51.930> doges<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.620> something

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
rather redundant doges are something

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
rather redundant doges are something
I've<00:00:52.949> been<00:00:52.980> noticing<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.789> lot<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.420> indie

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
mentioned is this group of missions I
have<00:01:23.820> complete<00:01:24.210> they're<00:01:24.659> pretty<00:01:24.869> linear<00:01:25.080> kind

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
have complete they're pretty linear kind

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.070 
have complete they're pretty linear kind
of<00:01:25.619> boring<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.939> really<00:01:27.240> negative<00:01:27.659> part

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of boring it's one really negative part

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.170 
of boring it's one really negative part
of<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.350> game<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.579> imaginative

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
of this game it's not really imaginative

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.660 
of this game it's not really imaginative
but<00:01:30.990> anyway<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.220> fun<00:01:32.340> part<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
but anyway one really fun part of this

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.830 
but anyway one really fun part of this
game<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.030> fact<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.600> have

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
game is the fact that you actually have

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.380 
game is the fact that you actually have

a lot of cool features but sometimes it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.720 
a lot of cool features but sometimes it
can<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.350> hard<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> notice<00:02:20.490> this

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
still recommend it to you but it is not

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.090 
still recommend it to you but it is not
a<00:02:30.620> dive<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:32.130> piece<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.760> software
