for all skin types today Colleen is here
and<00:00:14.070> Colleen<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> coming<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
and Colleen is coming in to to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.250 
and Colleen is coming in to to
revitalize<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.279> skin<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.869> are<00:00:19.020> going<00:00:19.170> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
revitalize for skin so we are going to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.740 
revitalize for skin so we are going to
be<00:00:19.380> doing<00:00:19.560> show<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.460> exactly<00:00:20.970> how<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.359> peel

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
be doing show you exactly how this peel

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.220 
be doing show you exactly how this peel
works<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:26.670> first<00:00:26.939> step<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.359> process<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
works the first step of this process is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.640 
works the first step of this process is
just<00:00:28.560> using<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> cleaning<00:00:31.410> it's

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
just using it's really a cleaning it's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.040 
just using it's really a cleaning it's
just<00:00:32.899> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.370> get<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> excess<00:00:36.450> oils

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
just going to get all of the excess oils

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.869 
just going to get all of the excess oils
off<00:00:37.440> cholena<00:00:38.250> has<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.489> fan<00:00:38.879> you'll<00:00:39.450> notice<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
off cholena has a fan you'll notice and

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.650 
off cholena has a fan you'll notice and
because<00:00:41.879> some<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:43.640> has<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> rather<00:00:45.149> strong

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
because some of this has a rather strong

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.580 
because some of this has a rather strong
odor<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> she<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:52.110> using<00:00:52.320> her

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
odor and so she is going to be using her

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:22.090 
odor and so she is going to be using her
fan<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.100> she<00:00:53.309> needs<00:00:53.550> to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:35.410 

bit<00:01:23.100> more<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.550 

how<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.539> you<00:01:36.600> doing<00:01:36.810> coming<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:37.740> great

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
how are you doing coming I'm doing great

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.109 
how are you doing coming I'm doing great
and<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> step<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.939> their

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and this is the step two of their

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.450 
and this is the step two of their
process<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> actually<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> peeling

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
process this is actually the peeling

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.469 
process this is actually the peeling
solution<00:01:46.429> it<00:01:47.429> has<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> couple<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.090> different

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
solution it has a couple of different

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:58.160 
solution it has a couple of different
kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> acids<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.920> may<00:01:57.170> create

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
kind of acids in it and this may create

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:12.830 
kind of acids in it and this may create
angle<00:02:00.530> again<00:02:01.530> she<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.189> fan<00:02:02.459> she<00:02:02.880> needs<00:02:03.119> to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.430 

we<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:13.860> use<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> little<00:02:14.489> pressure<00:02:15.260> when<00:02:16.260> we're

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
we do use a little pressure when we're

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.699 
we do use a little pressure when we're
applying<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.760> you're<00:02:18.030> actually

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
applying this because you're actually

00:02:18.709 --> 00:03:00.510 
applying this because you're actually
one<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> solution

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.320 

still<00:03:01.270> on<00:03:01.390> step<00:03:01.660> two<00:03:02.790> well<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:03.910> put<00:03:04.150> your

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
still on step two well I put your

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.520 
still on step two well I put your
completed<00:03:04.690> sector

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.630 

we've<00:03:08.530> let<00:03:08.740> that<00:03:08.920> set<00:03:09.130> for<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> couple<00:03:09.580> of

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
we've let that set for a couple of

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.520 
we've let that set for a couple of
minutes<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.150> now<00:03:10.690> we're<00:03:11.080> going<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> go<00:03:11.380> with

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
minutes and now we're going to go with

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.590 
minutes and now we're going to go with
step<00:03:11.800> three<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.340> step<00:03:12.580> three<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.150> retinoic

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
step three and step three is a retinoic

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:29.940 
step three and step three is a retinoic
acid<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:26.040> again<00:03:27.040> she<00:03:27.370> may<00:03:27.580> need<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:29.650> use<00:03:29.680> your

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
acid and again she may need to use your

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:40.160 
acid and again she may need to use your
fan

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.470 

one<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> great<00:03:41.250> things<00:03:41.760> about<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.209> skin

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
one of the great things about the skin

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.540 
one of the great things about the skin
medica<00:03:42.780> feels<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.920> they<00:03:44.099> are<00:03:44.130> self

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
medica feels is that they are self

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.960 
medica feels is that they are self
neutralizing<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.530> with<00:03:46.890> other<00:03:47.160> pills<00:03:47.550> where

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
neutralizing so with other pills where

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.790 
neutralizing so with other pills where
you<00:03:48.360> get<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:49.130> lot<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.400> burning<00:03:50.880> sensation<00:03:51.800> this

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
you get a lot of burning sensation this

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.670 
you get a lot of burning sensation this
may<00:03:53.280> tingle<00:03:53.940> for<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> few<00:03:54.450> minutes<00:03:54.690> but<00:03:55.200> it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
may tingle for a few minutes but it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.650 
may tingle for a few minutes but it
neutralizes<00:03:56.280> itself<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.180> goes<00:03:57.480> away

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
neutralizes itself and that goes away

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.330 
neutralizes itself and that goes away
very<00:03:58.350> quickly<00:03:59.690> you<00:04:00.690> will<00:04:00.900> notice<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.340> she's

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
very quickly you will notice that she's

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.280 
very quickly you will notice that she's
getting<00:04:02.520> kind<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.030> yellow<00:04:03.390> cast<00:04:03.750> that's

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
getting kind of a yellow cast that's

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.259 
getting kind of a yellow cast that's
because<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.920> retinoic<00:04:05.340> acid<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.880> also

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
because of the retinoic acid that also

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:14.780 
because of the retinoic acid that also
goes<00:04:06.450> away

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.009 

and<00:04:16.049> then<00:04:17.049> what<00:04:17.290> will<00:04:17.440> happen<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:19.660> about

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
and then what will happen is in about

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.170 
and then what will happen is in about
two-and-a-half<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.829> three<00:04:21.160> days<00:04:21.400> Colleen

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
two-and-a-half to three days Colleen

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.290 
two-and-a-half to three days Colleen
will<00:04:22.330> start<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.780> peel<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:24.550> she's<00:04:24.910> not<00:04:25.120> going

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
will start to peel just she's not going

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.530 
will start to peel just she's not going
to<00:04:25.330> be<00:04:25.479> burned<00:04:25.750> she's<00:04:26.380> not<00:04:26.560> going<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.830> have<00:04:27.070> any

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
to be burned she's not going to have any

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.719 
to be burned she's not going to have any
ill<00:04:28.540> side<00:04:28.960> effects<00:04:29.470> but<00:04:31.949> she<00:04:32.949> will<00:04:33.250> start<00:04:33.610> to

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
ill side effects but she will start to
