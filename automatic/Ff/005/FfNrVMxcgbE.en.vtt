so<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> difficulties<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.490> we've

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
so one of the difficulties that we've

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.370 
so one of the difficulties that we've
had<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.910> promoting<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.570> game<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.080> people

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
had in promoting the game is that people

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.500 
had in promoting the game is that people
have<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.100> preconception<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.119> melee

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
have this preconception that melee

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
have this preconception that melee
combat<00:00:21.840> sucks<00:00:22.230> because<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.800> most<00:00:22.920> games<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
combat sucks because in most games it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.099 
combat sucks because in most games it
does<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.330> thrown<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> end

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
does because it's thrown in on the end

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.349 
does because it's thrown in on the end
is<00:00:25.289> something<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.619> they<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:25.800> focus<00:00:26.039> on

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
is something that they don't focus on

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.550 
is something that they don't focus on
and<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.599> unfortunate<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.380> with

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and that's really unfortunate but with

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.439 
and that's really unfortunate but with
chivalry<00:00:28.859> we've<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.580> made<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.910> core

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
chivalry we've really made the core

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.269 
chivalry we've really made the core
focus<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> game<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:31.859> our<00:00:31.980> design

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
focus of the game and all our design

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.459 
focus of the game and all our design
efforts<00:00:32.669> towards<00:00:33.030> making<00:00:33.180> melee<00:00:33.719> combat<00:00:34.140> fun

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
efforts towards making melee combat fun

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.560 
efforts towards making melee combat fun
so<00:00:35.100> we've<00:00:35.250> designed<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.820> entire<00:00:36.120> combat

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
so we've designed the entire combat

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
so we've designed the entire combat
system<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.079> try<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.410> capture<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.890> feel<00:00:38.280> that

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
system to try and capture the feel that

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.610 
system to try and capture the feel that
you<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:38.790> medieval<00:00:39.480> combat<00:00:39.989> movies

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you get from medieval combat movies

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.889 
you get from medieval combat movies
where<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.550> these<00:00:41.700> epic<00:00:42.450> fights<00:00:42.719> between

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
guys going back and forth with exchanges

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
guys going back and forth with exchanges
of<00:00:45.149> blocks<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.840> parries<00:00:46.200> attacking<00:00:47.160> each

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340 
of blocks and parries attacking each
other<00:00:47.399> ducking<00:00:47.879> under<00:00:48.059> blows<00:00:48.329> we're<00:00:49.050> trying

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
other ducking under blows we're trying

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.110 
other ducking under blows we're trying
to<00:00:49.469> bring<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.980> experience<00:00:50.190> those<00:00:50.760> epic

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to bring that experience those epic

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.850 
to bring that experience those epic

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
moments that you get from movies in the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.549 
moments that you get from movies in the
medieval<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> pre<00:00:53.610> medieval<00:00:54.000> era<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.750> 300

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
medieval and pre medieval era like 300

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.099 
medieval and pre medieval era like 300
Troy<00:00:55.890> gladiator<00:00:56.579> King<00:00:56.940> Arthur<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.510> bring

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
Troy gladiator King Arthur and bring

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
Troy gladiator King Arthur and bring
that<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> hands<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> gamer<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.180> do

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that to the hands of a gamer and to do

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
that to the hands of a gamer and to do
that<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.719> had<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> way<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.010> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that we had to do it in a way that it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910 
that we had to do it in a way that it's
not<00:01:02.579> pure<00:01:02.850> realism<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:04.019> pure<00:01:04.500> arcade

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
not pure realism it's not pure arcade

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.010 
not pure realism it's not pure arcade
it's<00:01:05.220> somewhere<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.760> between<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it's somewhere in between and all the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.960 
it's somewhere in between and all the
timings<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.590> based<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.979> human<00:01:08.430> reaction<00:01:08.939> time

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
timings are based on human reaction time

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.120 
timings are based on human reaction time
so<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.900> something<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.500> fast<00:01:10.830> but

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
so it's something that's really fast but

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.160 
so it's something that's really fast but
still<00:01:11.369> has<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.119> strategic<00:01:12.750> combat

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
still has that level of strategic combat

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
still has that level of strategic combat
to<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.860> make<00:01:14.040> choices<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.700> mean

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
to it so you can make choices that mean

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.230 
to it so you can make choices that mean
something

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
something

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.400 
something
so<00:01:17.240> what<00:01:17.420> are<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.600> difficulties<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.260> other

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
so what are the difficulties in other

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.020 
so what are the difficulties in other
games<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.130> you're<00:01:19.280> not<00:01:19.460> really<00:01:19.610> attached

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
games is that you're not really attached

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.910 
games is that you're not really attached
to<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> objectives<00:01:20.870> you<00:01:21.020> know<00:01:21.200> you're<00:01:21.740> told

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
to the objectives you know you're told

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.260 
to the objectives you know you're told
to<00:01:22.010> go<00:01:22.160> to<00:01:22.190> point<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.670> you're<00:01:22.850> told<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.120> go<00:01:23.240> to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
to go to point a you're told to go to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.420 
to go to point a you're told to go to
point<00:01:23.570> B<00:01:23.810> you're<00:01:24.020> told<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.350> plan<00:01:24.560> a<00:01:24.590> bond<00:01:24.860> here

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
point B you're told a plan a bond here

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.580 
point B you're told a plan a bond here

wants to be doing them all the time and
the<00:01:36.500> way<00:01:36.620> we<00:01:36.740> do<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:37.070> is<00:01:37.130> we<00:01:37.250> make<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
the way we do that is we make the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.850 
the way we do that is we make the
objectives<00:01:38.120> actually<00:01:38.630> tied<00:01:38.900> into<00:01:39.140> dramatic

and<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.260> see<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.770> scale<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.100> things<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.610> are

and you see the scale of things that are

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.510 
and you see the scale of things that are
happening<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:45.140> medieval<00:01:45.740> army<00:01:46.040> wouldn't<00:01:46.310> go

up front brutality guy you got to get in

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.940 
up front brutality guy you got to get in
there<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:35.660> just<00:02:35.840> go<00:02:35.959> berserk<00:02:36.320> or<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.590> people's

there and just go berserk or on people's
faces<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.720> creates<00:02:38.989> this

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
faces and and so it creates this

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.080 
faces and and so it creates this
interesting<00:02:39.440> dynamic<00:02:39.980> where<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.580> weapon<00:02:40.970> you

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
interesting dynamic where the weapon you

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.000 
interesting dynamic where the weapon you
use<00:02:41.330> actually<00:02:41.959> affects<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.500> play<00:02:42.709> style

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
use actually affects the play style

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.590 
use actually affects the play style
that's<00:02:43.280> most<00:02:43.640> appropriate<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.420> play

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
that's most appropriate for you to play
