human beings on the planet genetically
speaking<00:04:11.169> which<00:04:12.169> is<00:04:12.349> which<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.949> know<00:04:13.159> I

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
speaking which is which you know I

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.360 
speaking which is which you know I
wouldn't<00:04:13.579> venture<00:04:13.699> to<00:04:13.849> say<00:04:14.090> at<00:04:14.180> this<00:04:14.329> point

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
wouldn't venture to say at this point

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.399 
wouldn't venture to say at this point
but<00:04:16.370> there<00:04:16.639> is<00:04:16.789> also<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.479> material<00:04:17.930> from<00:04:18.019> Ravi

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
but there is also the material from Ravi

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.699 
but there is also the material from Ravi
F<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:19.250> there<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.549> also<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:20.500> fairly<00:04:21.500> plain

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
F and then there is also a fairly plain

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.710 
F and then there is also a fairly plain
statement<00:04:22.340> in<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.550> New<00:04:22.669> Testament<00:04:23.240> by<00:04:23.330> Jesus

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
statement in the New Testament by Jesus

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.839 
statement in the New Testament by Jesus
you<00:04:23.750> know<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.680> indicates<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.460> there<00:04:25.699> are

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
you know that indicates that there are

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.930 
you know that indicates that there are
people<00:04:26.090> who<00:04:26.419> are<00:04:26.630> children<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.349> another<00:04:27.620> God

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
people who are children of another God

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.930 
people who are children of another God
so<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:28.970> say<00:04:30.190> so<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:32.720> know<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:33.250> for<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.400> ASEP

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
so to say so you know it for the ASEP

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.189 
so to say so you know it for the ASEP
ends<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.449> give<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.289> a<00:04:36.520> precise<00:04:37.520> definition

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
ends to give it a precise definition

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.839 
ends to give it a precise definition
that<00:04:39.199> mesh<00:04:39.740> is<00:04:39.770> more<00:04:40.130> or<00:04:40.190> less<00:04:40.340> with<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.639> work

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
that mesh is more or less with the work

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.980 
that mesh is more or less with the work
of<00:04:41.030> morovia<00:04:42.099> as<00:04:43.099> well<00:04:43.729> as<00:04:43.969> work<00:04:44.270> of<00:04:44.419> Castaneda

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
of morovia as well as work of Castaneda

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.339 
of morovia as well as work of Castaneda
is<00:04:45.260> quite<00:04:46.070> interesting<00:04:46.639> so<00:04:46.880> I<00:04:47.659> would<00:04:47.960> say<00:04:48.139> that

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
is quite interesting so I would say that

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.010 
is quite interesting so I would say that
there<00:04:48.500> is

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
there is

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.989 
there is
considerable<00:04:51.020> lateral<00:04:51.529> and<00:04:51.860> vertical

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:51.999 
considerable lateral and vertical

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.659 
considerable lateral and vertical
support<00:04:52.999> for<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:53.360> idea<00:04:53.779> and<00:04:54.339> also<00:04:55.339> the

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
support for that idea and also the

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.159 
support for that idea and also the
research<00:04:55.999> into<00:04:56.300> psychopathy<00:04:56.659> and

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
research into psychopathy and

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.260 
research into psychopathy and
personality<00:04:57.860> disorders<00:04:58.369> gives<00:04:58.669> us<00:04:58.819> a<00:04:58.999> little

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
personality disorders gives us a little

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.820 
personality disorders gives us a little
bit<00:04:59.449> more<00:04:59.599> of<00:04:59.659> a<00:04:59.719> scientific<00:05:00.139> basis<00:05:00.649> to<00:05:00.680> look

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
bit more of a scientific basis to look

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.010 
bit more of a scientific basis to look
at<00:05:01.129> it<00:05:01.279> so<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.789> know<00:05:02.539> it's<00:05:02.689> something<00:05:02.869> that

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
at it so you know it's something that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.329 
at it so you know it's something that
should<00:05:03.259> be<00:05:03.409> being<00:05:03.589> worked<00:05:03.830> on<00:05:03.979> by<00:05:04.129> real

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:04.339 
should be being worked on by real

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.129 
should be being worked on by real
scientist<00:05:04.909> you<00:05:05.210> know<00:05:05.330> not<00:05:05.539> just<00:05:05.569> you<00:05:06.050> know

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
speculated on by you know by by just me

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.510 
speculated on by you know by by just me
or<00:05:11.199> groups<00:05:12.199> of<00:05:12.379> people<00:05:12.559> who<00:05:12.949> want<00:05:13.189> to<00:05:13.279> play
