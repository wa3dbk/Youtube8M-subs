00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
cooked meat now let's do the test with

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.280 
cooked meat now let's do the test with
pigs<00:01:04.850> since<00:01:05.850> pigs<00:01:06.210> drop<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.049> meat

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
prevent more from falling and then you

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.330 
prevent more from falling and then you
flick<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.910> off<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.769> then<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.920> cows<00:02:43.100> are<00:02:43.220> on

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
fire and then you would kill them with a

looting<00:02:45.080> sword

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
looting sword

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.759 
looting sword
there's<00:02:47.510> another<00:02:47.719> option<00:02:47.989> when<00:02:48.379> using<00:02:48.680> this

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
there's another option when using this

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.190 
there's another option when using this
machine<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.310> well<00:02:49.569> after<00:02:50.569> you've<00:02:50.719> loaded<00:02:50.930> up

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
machine as well after you've loaded up

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.770 
machine as well after you've loaded up
all<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.469> cows<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:52.579> can<00:02:52.849> manually<00:02:53.299> light<00:02:53.659> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
all the cows you can manually light the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.390 
all the cows you can manually light the
netherrack<00:02:54.170> with<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:54.739> flint<00:02:55.159> and<00:02:55.250> steel

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
netherrack with your flint and steel

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.640 
netherrack with your flint and steel
that<00:02:55.939> will<00:02:56.120> save<00:02:56.299> on<00:02:56.480> fire<00:02:56.750> charges<00:02:57.319> although

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
that will save on fire charges although

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.500 
that will save on fire charges although
it<00:02:57.799> will<00:02:57.920> use<00:02:58.189> up<00:02:58.219> with<00:02:58.549> flint<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:58.879> steel<00:02:59.120> and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
it will use up with flint and steel and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.229 
it will use up with flint and steel and
then<00:03:00.439> it<00:03:00.590> works<00:03:00.799> exactly<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.340> same<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.969> drop

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
then it works exactly the same you drop

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.059 
then it works exactly the same you drop
them<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:03.349> still<00:03:03.530> have<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.769> pull<00:03:03.920> that

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
them in you still have to pull that

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.740 
them in you still have to pull that
lever<00:03:04.250> though<00:03:04.489> because<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.120> pulls<00:03:05.359> down<00:03:05.569> the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
lever though because it pulls down the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.449 
lever though because it pulls down the
nether<00:03:05.959> rack<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.379> shuts<00:03:06.709> off<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.010> fire<00:03:07.189> so

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
nether rack and shuts off the fire so

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.729 
nether rack and shuts off the fire so
that<00:03:07.609> the<00:03:07.700> drops<00:03:07.970> don't<00:03:08.209> burn<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:08.720> there<00:03:09.620> you

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
that the drops don't burn and there you

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.890 
that the drops don't burn and there you
have<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:09.920> my<00:03:10.250> own<00:03:10.280> looting<00:03:10.939> and<00:03:11.090> cooking<00:03:11.689> meat

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
have it my own looting and cooking meat

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.199 
have it my own looting and cooking meat
