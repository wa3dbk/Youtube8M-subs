00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.340
 a blood sample comes in a so-called 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.260
 The individual will become a centrifuge in her 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.550
 components of the blood from each other 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.980
 Separately the blood sample is stirring now 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 with more than 3000 revolutions per minute 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:26.720
 in a circle after a few minutes the sample 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 will be taken out again 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.990
 there is a clear yellow at the top 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.960
 liquid that is the so-called 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.270
 blood plasma below have the solid ones 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 components of the blood deposed the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.840
 blood cells in a vein of the body like 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.300
 swim the blood cells in the liquid 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.040
 blood plasma one recognizes three 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.470
 different cell types 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.470
 they have different functions 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.230
 the big cells with the conspicuous 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.190
 Colored cell nuclei are the white ones 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.650
 blood corpuscle 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.760
 They are among others for defense 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.490
 responsible for the pathogens 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.900
 Round plates are counted 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 the red blood cells 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.610
 they are the oxygen through the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.320
 transport body and give it to the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.250
 blood the red coloring the little ones 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.740
 platelet 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.350
 you are after for the wound closure 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.450
 an injury in charge they form 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.290
 with other components of the blood 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:42.640
 so-called hundt sharp and which 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.640
 Function has the blood plasma 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.189
 in this blood fluid the swim 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.259
 Blood cells through the body as well 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.960
 becomes the largest due to the blood plasma 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.729
 proportion of the carbon dioxide from the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.130
 Organs and muscles so lung 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.189
 transported where is then exhaled 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.189
 becomes
