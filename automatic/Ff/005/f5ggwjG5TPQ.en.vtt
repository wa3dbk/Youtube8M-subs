hi everyone look at how much in

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.329 
hi everyone look at how much in
photography<00:00:03.389> record<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.780> UK<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.440> this<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.310> a

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
photography record a UK and this is a

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.680 
photography record a UK and this is a
video<00:00:05.640> about<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.560> nikon<00:00:07.560> d800<00:00:08.309> files<00:00:08.790> twelve

video about the nikon d800 files twelve
bit<00:00:09.929> versus<00:00:10.530> forty<00:00:10.920> bit<00:00:23.960> okay<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:26.180> what<00:00:27.180> done

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
bit versus forty bit okay so what done

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.759 
bit versus forty bit okay so what done
is<00:00:27.510> I've<00:00:27.630> taken<00:00:27.810> two<00:00:28.080> pictures<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> exact

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
is I've taken two pictures the exact

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.349 
is I've taken two pictures the exact
same<00:00:28.920> pictures<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> same<00:00:29.939> settings

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
same pictures with the same settings

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.590 
same pictures with the same settings
that<00:00:30.630> were<00:00:31.439> bitten<00:00:31.710> fourteen<00:00:32.250> bit<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
that were bitten fourteen bit and as you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.920 
that were bitten fourteen bit and as you
can<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.050> size<00:00:34.290> difference<00:00:34.320> aids<00:00:35.899> quite<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
can see the size difference aids quite a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.700 
can see the size difference aids quite a
lot<00:00:37.230> actually

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
lot actually

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.060 
lot actually
it<00:00:38.340> goes<00:00:38.520> from<00:00:38.730> 30<00:00:39.000> megabyte<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.350> 12<00:00:40.800> bit

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
it goes from 30 megabyte for the 12 bit

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.639 
it goes from 30 megabyte for the 12 bit
to<00:00:41.460> 39<00:00:42.239> megabyte<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.180> 14<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.320> let's

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
to 39 megabyte for the 14 bit so let's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.060 
to 39 megabyte for the 14 bit so let's
have<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> look<00:00:48.500> at<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> file

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
have a look at the file

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.639 
have a look at the file
so<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.000> was<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.500> 12<00:00:52.500> bit<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:55.469> one

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so this one was the 12 bit and this one

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.279 
so this one was the 12 bit and this one
is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> 14<00:00:57.469> 12<00:00:58.550> 14<00:00:59.809> okay<00:01:00.809> let's<00:01:01.079> put<00:01:01.230> them

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
is the 14 12 14 okay let's put them

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.969 
is the 14 12 14 okay let's put them
side-by-side

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.020 

so<00:01:05.610> let's<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.450> zoom<00:01:06.539> in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.070 

okay<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:12.470> speed<00:01:12.860> was<00:01:13.130> 1/6<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.330> second<00:01:14.780> so

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
okay so the speed was 1/6 of a second so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.450 
okay so the speed was 1/6 of a second so
I<00:01:15.640> wasn't<00:01:16.640> using<00:01:16.909> a<00:01:17.590> remote<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.159> it's<00:01:19.280> possible

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
I wasn't using a remote so it's possible

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.330 
I wasn't using a remote so it's possible
that<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.030> was<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.210> bit<00:01:20.420> shaky<00:01:20.869> as<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:21.979> can<00:01:22.159> see

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
that it was a bit shaky as you can see

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.249 
that it was a bit shaky as you can see
it's<00:01:22.430> not<00:01:22.549> a<00:01:22.729> sharp<00:01:23.060> shot<00:01:23.330> there

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
it's not a sharp shot there

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.469 
it's not a sharp shot there
I<00:01:24.290> used<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.189> 15<00:01:25.549> milliliter<00:01:25.880> 1.4<00:01:26.810> @f<00:01:27.380> 2.8<00:01:28.479> iso

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
I used a 15 milliliter 1.4 @f 2.8 iso

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.539 
I used a 15 milliliter 1.4 @f 2.8 iso
100<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:30.409> as<00:01:30.950> long<00:01:31.159> as<00:01:31.250> i<00:01:31.369> can<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:33.159> really<00:01:36.549> okay

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
100 so as long as i can and really okay

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.649 
100 so as long as i can and really okay
here<00:01:37.909> i<00:01:37.939> can<00:01:38.210> see<00:01:38.450> it's<00:01:38.689> a<00:01:38.960> bit<00:01:39.170> as<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.740> bit<00:01:40.039> more

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
here i can see it's a bit as a bit more

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:48.219 
here i can see it's a bit as a bit more
color<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.929> color<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.229> bit<00:01:42.590> stronger<00:01:43.520> here<00:01:47.229> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
color the color a bit stronger here the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.870 
color the color a bit stronger here the
difference<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.979> not<00:01:51.429> you'll<00:01:52.429> have<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.729> be

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
difference is not you'll have to be

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.719 
difference is not you'll have to be
really<00:01:53.119> pixel<00:01:53.600> peeping<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.080> really<00:01:54.350> find<00:01:54.830> a

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
really pixel peeping to really find a

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.580 
really pixel peeping to really find a
difference<00:01:56.720> here

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
difference here

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.929 
difference here
I<00:01:59.289> just<00:02:00.289> can't<00:02:00.560> personally<00:02:01.190> can't

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.839 

now<00:02:06.600> okay<00:02:08.030> let's<00:02:09.030> look<00:02:09.209> at<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.640> texture<00:02:11.640> here

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
now okay let's look at the texture here

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.720 
now okay let's look at the texture here
on<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.900> ad

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.170 

I<00:02:16.819> get<00:02:17.510> very<00:02:17.930> very<00:02:18.200> hard<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.650> say<00:02:18.830> so

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
I get very very hard to say so

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.309 
I get very very hard to say so
I've<00:02:20.750> always<00:02:20.930> been<00:02:21.610> up<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:23.269> using<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.019> best

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
I've always been up for using the best

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.399 
I've always been up for using the best
residue<00:02:25.220> best<00:02:25.430> setting<00:02:26.120> possible<00:02:26.629> but<00:02:26.870> if

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.409 
residue best setting possible but if

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.949 
residue best setting possible but if
this<00:02:27.709> can<00:02:27.920> save<00:02:28.129> me<00:02:28.340> 10<00:02:28.580> megabyte<00:02:29.030> or<00:02:29.360> with<00:02:29.930> a

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
this can save me 10 megabyte or with a

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.009 
this can save me 10 megabyte or with a
15<00:02:30.440> mega<00:02:30.620> byte<00:02:30.830> per<00:02:31.069> picture<00:02:31.810> when<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.840> do<00:02:32.989> a

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
15 mega byte per picture when I do a

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.440 
15 mega byte per picture when I do a
wedding<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:33.860> take<00:02:34.069> over<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.940> thousand

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
wedding and I take over a thousand

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.869 
wedding and I take over a thousand
picture<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.709> can<00:02:36.860> make<00:02:37.040> quite<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.610> big

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
picture that can make quite a big

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.000 
picture that can make quite a big
difference<00:02:38.090> oh<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.629> will<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:39.019> further<00:02:39.680> tests

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
difference oh I will do further tests

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.400 
difference oh I will do further tests
outdoors<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.360> maybe<00:02:41.569> with<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.840> landscapes

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
outdoors and maybe with the landscapes

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.490 
outdoors and maybe with the landscapes
us<00:02:42.650> with<00:02:43.340> more<00:02:43.640> details<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.269> see<00:02:44.510> if<00:02:44.900> we<00:02:45.319> can

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
us with more details and see if we can

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.949 
us with more details and see if we can
actually<00:02:45.620> see<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.099> difference<00:02:46.700> but<00:02:46.879> so<00:02:47.390> far<00:02:47.629> I

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
actually see a difference but so far I

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.430 
actually see a difference but so far I
can't<00:02:48.379> and<00:02:49.160> if<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.400> can<00:02:49.549> save<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:50.120> bit<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:51.250> memory

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
can't and if I can save a bit of memory

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.539 
can't and if I can save a bit of memory
to<00:02:54.440> actually<00:02:54.709> know<00:02:54.920> lose<00:02:55.099> pretty<00:02:55.370> much

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
to actually know lose pretty much

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.400 
to actually know lose pretty much
anything<00:02:57.970> yeah<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.180> will<00:02:59.569> be<00:02:59.780> using<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.170> twelve

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
anything yeah I will be using the twelve

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.380 
anything yeah I will be using the twelve
bits<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:00.920> let's<00:03:01.519> do<00:03:01.640> further<00:03:01.819> tests<00:03:02.150> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
bits but let's do further tests and
