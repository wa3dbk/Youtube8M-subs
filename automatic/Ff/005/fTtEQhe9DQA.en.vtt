the<00:01:54.560> braid<00:01:54.770> length<00:01:55.010> is<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:55.820> go<00:01:55.970> up<00:01:56.150> to

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the braid length is so if we go up to

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.420 
the braid length is so if we go up to
the<00:01:56.479> top<00:01:56.720> of<00:01:56.900> my<00:01:57.080> braid<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:57.979> kind<00:01:58.310> of

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the top of my braid it's kind of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.430 
the top of my braid it's kind of
difficult<00:01:58.670> for<00:01:59.060> me<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.600> see<00:01:59.810> where<00:01:59.990> my<00:02:00.140> hair<00:02:00.410> is

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
difficult for me to see where my hair is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.710 
difficult for me to see where my hair is
but<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.280> noticed<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.760> I<00:02:01.850> have<00:02:02.120> a<00:02:02.150> few<00:02:02.479> pieces

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
but I noticed that I have a few pieces

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.500 
but I noticed that I have a few pieces
of<00:02:02.930> hair<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.260> stick<00:02:03.710> out<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.610> would<00:02:04.940> say<00:02:05.210> at

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
of hair that stick out so I would say at

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.340 
of hair that stick out so I would say at
the<00:02:06.020> least<00:02:06.830> my<00:02:07.250> hair<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.880> probably<00:02:08.600> about<00:02:08.810> this

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
the least my hair is probably about this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.199 
the least my hair is probably about this
long<00:02:09.740> even<00:02:10.160> though<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.580> see<00:02:10.610> my<00:02:10.910> hair<00:02:11.120> up

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
long even though I can see my hair up

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.630 
long even though I can see my hair up
here<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.260> make<00:02:12.440> sure<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.920> do<00:02:12.980> not<00:02:13.280> cut

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
here but to make sure that I do not cut

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.000 
here but to make sure that I do not cut
my<00:02:13.850> hair<00:02:14.120> I'm<00:02:14.390> gonna<00:02:14.840> double<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.500> length<00:02:15.830> and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
my hair I'm gonna double this length and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.240 
my hair I'm gonna double this length and
actually<00:02:16.459> cut<00:02:16.760> aways<00:02:17.150> down<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:18.290> trim<00:02:18.650> my<00:02:18.680> weave

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
actually cut aways down to trim my weave

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.760 
actually cut aways down to trim my weave
this<00:02:20.060> ensures<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.840> will<00:02:20.990> not<00:02:21.230> cut<00:02:21.530> your

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
this ensures that you will not cut your

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.590 
this ensures that you will not cut your
hair<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.370> you've<00:02:22.550> cut<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.820> safe<00:02:23.239> length

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
hair and that you've cut a safe length

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.160 
hair and that you've cut a safe length
so<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.290> can<00:02:24.500> take<00:02:24.770> down<00:02:25.040> your<00:02:25.100> braids<00:02:25.610> so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
so that you can take down your braids so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
so that you can take down your braids so
we're<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.380> cut<00:02:27.620> here

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.050 

and<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.590> optional<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.490> could<00:02:32.700> simply

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and this is optional you could simply

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.140 
and this is optional you could simply
just<00:02:33.240> cut<00:02:33.450> off<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.690> bottom<00:02:33.960> in<00:02:34.470> alone<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.640> go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
just cut off the bottom in alone or go

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.970 
just cut off the bottom in alone or go
up<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.450> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.960> ways<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> braid<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
up a little bit of ways on the braid and

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.160 
up a little bit of ways on the braid and
cut<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> hair<00:02:38.610> as<00:02:38.700> well<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:39.180> not<00:02:39.840> at<00:02:39.990> this

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
cut the hair as well so not at this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.990 
cut the hair as well so not at this
point<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.100> gonna<00:02:41.310> take<00:02:41.610> your<00:02:41.790> fingers

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
point it's just gonna take your fingers

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.330 
point it's just gonna take your fingers
and<00:02:42.210> unravel<00:02:42.990> your<00:02:43.290> braid<00:02:43.350> until<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.160> reach

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and unravel your braid until you reach

00:02:44.340 --> 00:03:00.020 
and unravel your braid until you reach
the<00:02:44.550> roots<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:45.000> your<00:02:45.150> hair<00:02:58.460> so<00:02:59.460> now<00:02:59.640> once<00:02:59.880> you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
reach the top sometimes it's pretty easy

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.880 
reach the top sometimes it's pretty easy
to<00:03:02.130> slide<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.820> hair<00:03:03.060> out<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.710> are

hair sticking out here but I'm gonna

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.210 
hair sticking out here but I'm gonna
estimate<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.990> say<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.470> my<00:03:25.620> hair<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:25.920> this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.550 
estimate and say that my hair is this
long<00:03:26.490> then<00:03:27.330> I'm<00:03:27.510> gonna<00:03:27.660> take<00:03:28.050> double<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
long then I'm gonna take double the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.520 
long then I'm gonna take double the
length<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.310> space<00:03:29.760> go<00:03:30.750> down<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.260> braid

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
length of that space go down the braid

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.780 
length of that space go down the braid
and<00:03:31.880> that's<00:03:32.880> where<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.120> will<00:03:33.270> trim<00:03:34.520> just<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.670> be

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
and that's where I will trim just to be

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.140 
and that's where I will trim just to be
safe

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150
