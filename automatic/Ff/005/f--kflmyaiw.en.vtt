00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
and i always care in the same way

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.330 
and i always care in the same way
support<00:01:27.659> aside<00:01:28.080> i'm<00:01:28.380> doing<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> same<00:01:29.040> thing

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
support aside i'm doing the same thing

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
support aside i'm doing the same thing
that<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.759> say<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.329> grow<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.869> outwards

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that is to say that I grow it outwards

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.580 
that is to say that I grow it outwards
so<00:01:32.040> obviously<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:37.500> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
so obviously this is like so and I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.819 
so obviously this is like so and I
really<00:01:37.979> cool<00:01:38.250> it'll<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> roots<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.420> my<00:01:39.630> hair

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so then when one row is done I'm going

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.980 
so then when one row is done I'm going
to<00:01:43.079> spray<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.880> extra<00:01:45.659> hold

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
to spray that with a really extra hold

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.980
