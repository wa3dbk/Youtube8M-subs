00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 one of the tent that has not been here yet 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.670
 at the compact family tents 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.899
 test is a cotton tibby in this 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.320
 case a tentipi 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.780
 a-47 cp in the bag is of course the tent 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.269
 Stick pegs and a lot of fun 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.990
 device for placing the pegs and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.990
 have a ground cell 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.320
 to stake out the herring at a teepee 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.390
 has devised and type something else and dust 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.919
 requires you for the cheaper versions and 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.590
 very nice wooden points you for the 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.570
 more expensive version it works as follows you 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.640
 pricks 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:42.910
 tighten your string around it and up 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.910
 the string there are numbers 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.210
 5 7 well we have one 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.360
 a-47 so I have to fall to this length 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.360
 already 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.980
 the fun of the typical natural pussy of 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.350
 just a baton 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.350
 yes it's not stick slots with club 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200
 one size fits 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.859
 there are already nice and the stress of it 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.859
 door and get in 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:39.570
 I am level 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:42.210
 from high and they are also very beautiful 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.440
 buckles because when you tighten it 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.440
 can easily disconnecting their 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.910
 passes through 30 pairs of times I do mounted 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.830
 you this is just 5 minutes that is anyway 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.510
 The advantage of a stick is one 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.430
 yes the ground should still do i need 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.890
 not to lift the dust to 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.729
 place a groundsheet thanks to a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.729
 volatile zipper system 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.479
 imagine that button that simply fixed 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.700
 with 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.350
 scoop connection to agree 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.660
 with this nice weather it is not necessary 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.420
 windless but for the form 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.420
 there are plenty of guy lines 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.459
 Well, tent must of course also be possible 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.560
 ventilate space here natural large 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.390
 ventilation opening in the dock 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.090
 but there are also three whole ones on the side 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.599
 large ventilation when in the uni 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.660
 here 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.790
 ventilation opening also nice for the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.349
 children are watching by outside 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.540
 as mentioned a type also has one 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.530
 ventilation openings at the top 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.860
 of course a roof you have to sit on 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.910
 because otherwise it rains when it rains 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.170
 before that are always old you see what 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.290
 I can't reach the top of the tent 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.150
 then me 169 not allowed to do these 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.459
 ventilation eyes to throw it is whole 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.599
 easy pulls a rope here 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.560
 this track side is of course normal 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.630
 just below 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.239
 because there are also group clips 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.980
 and as you can see they are six strings 6 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.160
 other side just depends on 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.160
 the wind direction 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.569
 clip on it 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.130
 yes well the citizen can come in 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.130
 be solved 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.400
 bridge close nicest to the typical that 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.500
 you also get it in the spring and fall 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.930
 or or just white wins because it is 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.620
 namely never cold and then if you like that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.560
 prefers 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.220
 how it can stand box is a heater 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.220
 with chimney 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.430
 and the rest of it still when the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.430
 within 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.880
 Yes 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:12.959
 and to have here further special 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.959
 chimney opening 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.030
 No 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.440
 there goes fact by the bar all the way 5 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.239
 is double-walled 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.650
 it never touches the canvas so you can 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.650
 that simply a trouble firing 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.250
 small disadvantage if you do not have the heater 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.960
 he cleans camped without fire 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.940
 makers of mine do not camp so yes 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.419
 That is why I am such a crazy brand 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.419
 in the back 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.780
 deal with the match and some birch bark 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.550
 talk sheep in europe with the fire 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.440
 burning 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.880
 the conclusions of the team lay in the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.010
 Firstly, it offers a lot of space 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.330
 you can stand in it so it can be with 7 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.010
 sleeping in people 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.690
 everyone will like it there 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.130
 in this case there is no inner tent such that 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.300
 you have an inner tent than it is in 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.070
 the space of the little one 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.050
 you can use the groundsheet that you have to open 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.100
 slippery if you are not allowed at the cash register and also 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.600
 when it rains 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.460
 it typically has its disadvantages because 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.410
 as you see every time you do that 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.000
 zipper open and the entrance opens then 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.370
 actually just likes bimbo 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.440
 good if you have fallen asleep for one day 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.030
 then you still very often end up on the 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.460
 somehow gives a type anyway 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.450
 a species or that really belongs to me 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.450
 very nice camping 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.980
 what do you eat today no no yes
