control<00:00:23.119> pic<00:00:24.119> plc<00:00:25.109> board<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.990> what<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.140> did<00:00:28.349> is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
control pic plc board and what we did is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.459 
control pic plc board and what we did is
if<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.510> use<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> bluetooth<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.550> TTL<00:00:32.550> converter

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
if we use a bluetooth to TTL converter

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.209 
if we use a bluetooth to TTL converter
and<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.969> stead<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> connecting<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
and the stead of connecting it to the

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.100 
and the stead of connecting it to the
rs-232<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:39.200> remove<00:00:40.200> some<00:00:41.899> pins<00:00:42.899> from

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
rs-232 we just remove some pins from

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.600 
rs-232 we just remove some pins from
here<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.649> solder<00:00:44.280> two<00:00:44.460> wires<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.750> rxtx

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.400 

connected<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> bluetooth<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> TTL<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
connected this bluetooth to TTL to the

connected this bluetooth to TTL to the
power<00:00:53.120> ground<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.920> transmitter<00:00:55.920> which

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
power ground and the transmitter which

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.979 
power ground and the transmitter which
will<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.660> pic<00:00:58.850> receiver<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.780> my

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
will go into this pic receiver so on my

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.070 
will go into this pic receiver so on my
android<00:01:01.890> mobile<00:01:02.309> i<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:03.480> installed<00:01:03.840> this

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
android mobile i have installed this

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.640 
android mobile i have installed this
bluetooth<00:01:04.559> controller<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:06.330> i<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.720> set<00:01:07.409> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
bluetooth controller and i have set this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.880 
bluetooth controller and i have set this
keys<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> four<00:01:11.330> on<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.689> its<00:01:12.930> 01<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.729> fun<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.890> f1

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
keys so four on one its 01 of fun is f1

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.510 
keys so four on one its 01 of fun is f1
and<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.479> set<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.380> keys

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.490 

now<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.549> will<00:01:25.850> press<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.330> Scan<00:01:26.630> button<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:27.200> scan

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
now I will press the Scan button to scan

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.910 
now I will press the Scan button to scan
the<00:01:27.650> Bluetooth<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.630> sees<00:01:30.049> 06

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
the Bluetooth and this is that sees 06

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.740 
the Bluetooth and this is that sees 06
it<00:01:33.920> has<00:01:34.070> connected<00:01:34.580> if<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.909> asks<00:01:35.180> for<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
it has connected if it asks for the

you<00:02:27.630> just<00:02:27.900> need<00:02:28.410> our<00:02:28.650> pic<00:02:29.580> PLC<00:02:30.210> board<00:02:30.960> the

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
you just need our pic PLC board the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.170 
you just need our pic PLC board the
serial<00:02:31.950> control<00:02:33.230> relay<00:02:34.230> board<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.970> just

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
serial control relay board and you just

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.330 
serial control relay board and you just
need<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:38.180> view<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.600> TTL<00:02:40.020> module<00:02:40.380> there<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.160> no

need a view to to TTL module there is no

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.270 
need a view to to TTL module there is no
programming<00:02:41.910> needed<00:02:42.270> because<00:02:42.570> our<00:02:43.500> serial

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
programming needed because our serial

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.610 
programming needed because our serial
