and<00:02:32.150> then<00:02:32.360> we<00:02:32.480> create<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.870> sort<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.230> an<00:02:33.319> organism

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and then we create a sort of an organism

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.770 
and then we create a sort of an organism
with<00:02:34.160> its<00:02:34.340> own<00:02:34.550> life<00:02:40.239> Bogdanovic<00:02:41.239> agriculture

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
with its own life Bogdanovic agriculture

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.500 
with its own life Bogdanovic agriculture
also<00:02:42.019> looks<00:02:42.260> at<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.340> farm<00:02:43.640> as<00:02:44.000> being<00:02:44.300> an

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
also looks at the farm as being an

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.890 
also looks at the farm as being an
entire<00:02:45.440> hall<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.820> suddenly<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.630> human

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
entire hall and and suddenly the human

entire hall and and suddenly the human
being<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.260> part<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:49.570> we<00:02:50.570> don't<00:02:50.750> want<00:02:50.959> people

it has to learn in the same way a farm
is<00:04:05.550> born<00:04:05.880> in<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.480> sense<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.200> start

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
is born in a sense that you start

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.280 
is born in a sense that you start
creating<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.760> diversified<00:04:09.360> elements<00:04:09.959> and

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
creating the diversified elements and

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.210 
creating the diversified elements and
then<00:04:11.160> slowly<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.440> integrate<00:04:13.440> these<00:04:13.620> elements

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
then slowly you integrate these elements

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.370 
then slowly you integrate these elements
so<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.430> they<00:04:14.700> start<00:04:15.030> really<00:04:15.600> performing<00:04:16.260> as

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
so that they start really performing as

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.280 
so that they start really performing as
organs<00:04:17.040> within<00:04:17.880> this<00:04:18.180> farm<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:19.140> each
