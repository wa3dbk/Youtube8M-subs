cardiovascular training and what I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
cardiovascular training and what I
wanted<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.640> today<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.180> show<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.630> what<00:00:28.560> I

to<00:01:10.799> any<00:01:10.950> significant<00:01:11.640> degree<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.210> had<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to any significant degree so we had to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.609 
to any significant degree so we had to
do<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> lot<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.140> upper<00:01:13.890> body<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.640> lower<00:01:15.360> body

cardiovascular<00:01:16.619> training<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.060> like

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
cardiovascular training so what I like

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
cardiovascular training so what I like
to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.479> today<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.930> show<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.799> call<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to do today is show you what I call a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.450 
to do today is show you what I call a
functional<00:01:21.270> aerobic<00:01:21.960> circuit<00:01:22.470> how<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
functional aerobic circuit how you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
functional aerobic circuit how you
choose<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> exercises<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.110> functional

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
choose the exercises for a functional

choose the exercises for a functional
broken<00:01:25.979> circuit<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.299> look<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> call

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
broken circuit is to look at what I call

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530 
broken circuit is to look at what I call

for your favorite run through a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
for your favorite run through a
functional<00:01:55.770> cardiovascular<00:01:56.670> circuit<00:01:57.179> using

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
functional cardiovascular circuit using

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.240 
functional cardiovascular circuit using
movements<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.409> would<00:01:58.530> carry<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:59.069> to<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
movements that would carry over to a

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.120 
movements that would carry over to a
wide<00:01:59.549> variety<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.209> activities<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.130> the

wide variety of activities and the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.279 
wide variety of activities and the
secret<00:02:02.549> here<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.119> build<00:02:03.299> work<00:02:03.630> tolerance

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
secret here is to build work tolerance

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.949 
secret here is to build work tolerance
not<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.770> go<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> exhaustion<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.719> build

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
not to go to exhaustion but to build

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.770 
not to go to exhaustion but to build
work<00:02:07.229> tolerance<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.099> I'll<00:02:08.250> work<00:02:08.519> through<00:02:08.879> I'll

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
work tolerance so I'll work through I'll

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.240 
work tolerance so I'll work through I'll
wait<00:02:10.140> till<00:02:10.349> my<00:02:10.500> heart<00:02:10.649> rate<00:02:10.920> drops<00:02:11.250> down<00:02:13.250> again

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
wait till my heart rate drops down again

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.940 
wait till my heart rate drops down again
and<00:02:14.730> I'll<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.569> until<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.049> start<00:02:16.709> losing

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and I'll do that until I start losing

00:02:16.950 --> 00:05:29.709 
and I'll do that until I start losing
consciousness<00:02:17.720> here's<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.989> looks<00:02:19.140> like

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719

okay<00:05:31.119> that's<00:05:32.119> one<00:05:32.389> surrogate<00:05:34.809> you<00:05:35.809> can<00:05:36.019> either

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
okay that's one surrogate you can either

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.419 
okay that's one surrogate you can either
rest<00:05:36.759> for<00:05:37.759> a<00:05:37.819> specific<00:05:38.029> rest<00:05:38.479> period<00:05:39.339> or<00:05:40.339> you

it's<00:05:47.539> 135<00:05:48.759> and<00:05:49.759> then<00:05:50.629> go<00:05:50.809> again<00:05:51.699> anywhere
