 is I did not escape the voice of the congo 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.369
 son, but let's start if we saw that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.310
 had a slight special touch with my 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.670
 first impressions of the 17th 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.970
 a price the ecca mass of face fear 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.880
 I really liked kicking and in aabb stacks 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 sang there the new opening I really liked 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 of opening despite those 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.000
 This review is from: 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.850
 store opening I separated some things 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.100
 to comment other than the 629 that the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 first of three very cool roses on 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.460
 my future here is not lacking here and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.800
 Let's comment the guys I really liked 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
 news is being received all over the world 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.980
 It's cool, we see it on that hook. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.410
 to give certain details of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.690
 characters oab samuel reporter bee 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.879
 It was really cool this chapter was 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.530
 Chapter 7 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 one had a lot of cool because 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 usually in this chapter of number 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.710
 closed of a hundred wave puts something 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.200
 ethical better after all a boat in the sleeve 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.950
 it very good old dn chat and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.619
 musician in flamenco has been there it was in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 new age everybody rode a horse 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.880
 a lot of tension stayed the guys were 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.560
 behaving there by the image with the shirt 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.960
 from frank jklmn 1 p 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.720
 It's very good and it was funny too, and I 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.250
 okay how are you treated in uol and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.070
 entering the world's climate does not look 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.070
 he ate sandwich link he has rodeo bread 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.790
 very good, I liked it when you spoke 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.130
 I think it's a good focus. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.810
 legal alcan swore that he does not send sometimes 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.180
 I forget a little that they are also with 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.130
 this goal of finding the dog swore them 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.290
 I'll tell you, but it was really cool, Frank. 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.070
 crying urubu repeating that fall there 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.689
 I think that in this aspect the mood is 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420
 cool because it makes the scene last longer 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.920
 a little that fixes but in your head 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.409
 very good also liked the Flemish 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.410
 entering room 2 between the lines to 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.910
 this scene is not had in hangar and five 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.200
 opening the door as far as I remember 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.000
 it looks like it's already there 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 saulo is only at the end of the chapter as the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.260
 people see this episode itself but 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.690
 I really liked him coming into the room there. 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.610
 a bm fab kind serving him with that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.830
 government employee outfit 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.569
 Mexican is good but at last I liked it 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.090
 I really liked that there is more I like and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.849
 also much of the navy talking about chibo 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.610
 Old pier I even paused and so I tried 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.099
 have you had a certain style falls there in the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.069
 even if you have the images in the image is 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.620
 there because type in a manga only has the image 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.690
 them on the page I do not remember this 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.910
 The picture that Brazil is talking about seems 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.799
 which has but finally I tried not you 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.900
 I got it clear and I really liked the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.049
 parent bank bank that pauses the better 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.299
 the type drops blog he takes the series 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.060
 starting in bulk 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:03.360
 You thought I would not divulge 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.370
 and it was really cool is a lot of showbol mean 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.920
 this a child is a way to make a 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.079
 interesting movie is to eat a little of 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.200
 they did something dynamic 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.150
 this old glittering fucking and aimed 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.010
 I really liked it, cool, Brazil. 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.870
 also beating in the bathroom 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.910
 I liked it a lot and then we also saw the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.230
 color scheme new voices after all 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.730
 several characters are not being 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.859
 presented to us 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.410
 I liked the voice mike vine and the diamond 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.359
 is that to make that goal giving what to speak 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.000
 in the end I'm going to fight like 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.670
 Manee, I really liked him and 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.889
 Diamond I also found normal voices but 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.139
 I liked seeing you saw it already seen 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.970
 the voice of time and from there the day I liked it 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.260
 a lot of his voices also liked the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.370
 color scheme in the end, people in 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.889
 other episodes 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.200
 we had seen them in the gloom 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.569
 old woman suffers as I think because 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.970
 Coast lounge is a head of the penis 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.609
 old a fucking ornament that gave birth 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.190
 but he likes and also the voice and 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.040
 colors of travel to answer emails works 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.480
 and his voice might have left a little 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.310
 I think that for those who accompany a 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.620
 claw saw I think it was more or less 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.400
 the line that your son will see what 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.400
 It will be on the ball. 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.810
 but whatever is mere emanuel is shining 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.810
 also an interesting resource that 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.760
 animation transition is smaller and has 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.770
 That's cool, we know there's 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.390
 name does not shine but it was a suspense 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.980
 cool to see 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.660
 It was nice also for each side with the 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.910
 flashes of disease and war in 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.890
 Moment was fuck and the best average in the hand 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.080
 of flamenco only in that scene you're already 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.390
 a little helpless snow lived that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.970
 fruit there with him enjoyed the 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.970
 pronunciation pronunciation of the name more 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.890
 Latin is that the Flemish you have 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.570
 tomorrow's reason 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.790
 Dude, I really liked him talking. 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.650
 Japanese artist was very 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.080
 dead people we have arrived 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.390
 in dress rosana personal that promise of 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.790
 the previous episode of the next episode was 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.310
 very cool, very dynamic, I stayed 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.000
 too crazy to see even this saga is 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.380
 fuck 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.540
 I think you noticed that 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.060
 Fucking happening you will not realize 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.130
 I think from the opening review that I 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.600
 begins to really go crazy in the opening 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.730
 when you begin to show how and what 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.020
 sion and the flashes of new characters 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.340
 This is it people, I hope you have 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.790
 liked this mood and reviewed the episode 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:29.240
 629 dress pink arrived people and that's it 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.240
 let's go to the 630
