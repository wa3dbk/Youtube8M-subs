00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
life's going to get a little bit easier

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.659 
life's going to get a little bit easier
because<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.390> this<00:05:14.510> I<00:05:14.890> got<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.010> nine<00:05:16.220> of<00:05:16.430> wands

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
because of this I got the nine of wands

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.590 
because of this I got the nine of wands
the<00:05:16.910> fourth<00:05:17.180> week<00:05:18.640> so<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:20.060> fourth<00:05:20.270> week<00:05:20.450> it's

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
the fourth week so the fourth week it's

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.790 
the fourth week so the fourth week it's
going<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.780> feel<00:05:20.930> like<00:05:20.960> you're<00:05:21.230> not<00:05:21.350> struggling

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
going to feel like you're not struggling

going to feel like you're not struggling
so<00:05:22.310> much<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.850> this<00:05:23.270> could<00:05:23.480> simply<00:05:23.720> be<00:05:24.140> because

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
so much and this could simply be because

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.650 
so much and this could simply be because
you're<00:05:24.680> being<00:05:24.890> more<00:05:25.130> honest<00:05:25.610> open<00:05:26.030> and

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
you're being more honest open and

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.550 
you're being more honest open and
authentic<00:05:27.410> your<00:05:28.160> authentic<00:05:28.850> self<00:05:28.880> and<00:05:29.570> it's

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
authentic your authentic self and it's

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.659 
authentic your authentic self and it's
going<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:30.800> feel<00:05:31.070> after<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:31.640> like<00:05:33.669> like

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
going to feel after that like like

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.830 
difficult for you it's going to feel
more<00:05:41.360> like<00:05:41.540> you<00:05:41.780> can<00:05:42.110> just<00:05:43.450> roll<00:05:44.450> with<00:05:44.690> the

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
more like you can just roll with the

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.830 
more like you can just roll with the
punches<00:05:45.290> so<00:05:45.919> to<00:05:45.979> say<00:05:46.280> the<00:05:47.150> fourth<00:05:47.479> week<00:05:47.660> it's

and like things come to you easier and
um<00:05:57.790> yeah<00:05:58.790> that's<00:05:59.570> what<00:05:59.780> I'm<00:05:59.870> feeling<00:06:00.110> and<00:06:00.460> a

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
um yeah that's what I'm feeling and a

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.010 
um yeah that's what I'm feeling and a
little<00:06:01.790> bit<00:06:01.880> like<00:06:02.060> almost<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.479> more<00:06:02.810> passionate

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
little bit like almost a more passionate

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.510 
little bit like almost a more passionate
about<00:06:03.440> life<00:06:05.200> we<00:06:06.200> draw<00:06:06.470> one<00:06:06.710> more<00:06:06.740> card<00:06:06.919> to<00:06:07.250> see

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
about life we draw one more card to see

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:14.460 
about life we draw one more card to see
what<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:07.760> overall<00:06:08.120> theme<00:06:08.390> of<00:06:08.450> the<00:06:08.780> month<00:06:09.050> is

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.690 

ok<00:06:15.470> one<00:06:15.740> popped<00:06:16.040> out<00:06:18.190> interesting<00:06:19.190> so<00:06:19.520> it's

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
ok one popped out interesting so it's

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.860 
ok one popped out interesting so it's
the<00:06:20.000> four<00:06:20.300> Pentacles<00:06:21.140> and<00:06:21.410> reverse<00:06:22.660> so<00:06:23.660> this

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
the four Pentacles and reverse so this

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.909 
the four Pentacles and reverse so this
is<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.140> only<00:06:24.260> pentacle<00:06:24.890> in<00:06:25.070> the<00:06:25.220> reading<00:06:26.919> but

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
is the only pentacle in the reading but

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.230 
is the only pentacle in the reading but
this<00:06:28.040> is<00:06:28.220> just<00:06:28.250> like<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.669> heads<00:06:28.940> up<00:06:29.210> that

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
this is just like a heads up that

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.180 
this is just like a heads up that
perhaps<00:06:29.780> this<00:06:30.260> month<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:33.590> might<00:06:33.770> feel<00:06:34.010> like

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
perhaps this month you might feel like

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.590 
perhaps this month you might feel like
money<00:06:34.640> is<00:06:34.849> leaving

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
money is leaving

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.330 
money is leaving
like<00:06:36.990> you<00:06:37.110> don't<00:06:37.290> have<00:06:37.380> a<00:06:37.440> good<00:06:37.740> hold<00:06:37.980> on<00:06:38.160> your

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
like you don't have a good hold on your

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.670 
like you don't have a good hold on your
finances<00:06:38.910> you're<00:06:39.060> not<00:06:39.210> maybe<00:06:39.720> saving<00:06:40.200> as<00:06:40.530> much

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
finances you're not maybe saving as much

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.290 
finances you're not maybe saving as much
as<00:06:40.890> you<00:06:41.010> would<00:06:41.130> like<00:06:41.190> but<00:06:42.090> spending<00:06:42.690> more<00:06:42.960> and

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.850 
so that that's just yeah so basically
with<00:06:49.140> this<00:06:49.320> card<00:06:51.200> you're<00:06:52.200> just<00:06:52.410> going<00:06:52.590> to<00:06:52.650> feel

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
with this card you're just going to feel

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.190 
with this card you're just going to feel
like<00:06:53.100> you're<00:06:53.970> not<00:06:54.150> holding<00:06:54.390> on<00:06:54.690> to<00:06:54.870> you<00:06:54.960> and

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
like you're not holding on to you and

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.590 
like you're not holding on to you and
that<00:06:55.920> might<00:06:56.100> be<00:06:56.220> a<00:06:56.250> good<00:06:56.310> thing<00:06:56.700> because

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
that might be a good thing because

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.510 
that might be a good thing because
you're<00:06:57.840> not<00:06:57.960> holding<00:06:58.230> on<00:06:58.590> to<00:06:58.860> what<00:06:59.130> you<00:06:59.250> have

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
you're not holding on to what you have

you're not holding on to what you have
the<00:06:59.790> cash<00:07:00.000> you<00:07:00.240> have<00:07:00.270> perhaps<00:07:00.750> or<00:07:01.620> what<00:07:01.830> you

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
the cash you have perhaps or what you

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.960 
the cash you have perhaps or what you
you<00:07:02.460> present<00:07:03.000> your<00:07:03.150> possessions<00:07:03.780> or<00:07:03.990> whatever

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970 
you present your possessions or whatever

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.430 
you present your possessions or whatever
but<00:07:05.970> you're<00:07:06.150> more<00:07:06.390> free<00:07:06.900> with<00:07:07.710> it<00:07:09.110> you're<00:07:10.110> it

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
but you're more free with it you're it

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.430 
but you're more free with it you're it
seems<00:07:10.950> like<00:07:11.130> I<00:07:11.280> feel<00:07:11.550> like<00:07:11.580> the<00:07:11.790> circuit

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 
seems like I feel like the circuit

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.500 
seems like I feel like the circuit
circulation<00:07:13.440> of<00:07:13.590> energy<00:07:14.240> more<00:07:15.240> like<00:07:15.480> a

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.510 
circulation of energy more like a

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.170 
circulation of energy more like a
circulation<00:07:16.140> of<00:07:16.380> energy<00:07:16.910> instead<00:07:17.910> of

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
circulation of energy instead of

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.500 
circulation of energy instead of
clinging<00:07:18.570> on<00:07:18.900> to<00:07:19.940> cuz<00:07:20.940> sometimes<00:07:21.150> when<00:07:21.390> you

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.510 
clinging on to cuz sometimes when you

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.550 
clinging on to cuz sometimes when you
