00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.710
 we are organizing the biggest here today 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 open air in the bergischen country and the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 we've drake it until summer drake 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.730
 found this quite funny party with tent to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.590
 Connect is known for great open air 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.080
 parties and we said we want 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.640
 the whole a bit more modern 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 build up a bit chunky but then 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
 anyway this open air feeling over 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.640
 let him come 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.600
 New York because so much advertising done 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.130
 was that it was rather not 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.700
 listened and thought times look and 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.360
 because summer break always awesome easy 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.060
 I would like to party a bit 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.650
 I was at the barber and then his can 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.920
 pretty girls being hung up poster 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.080
 and the party is thought about 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.650
 here's just really good 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.440
 good music we have around the 15th 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.060
 until 20 djs here are many newcomers doing the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.170
 we have not started so often yet 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.440
 even those who have been in business for a long time 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.440
 are 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.890
 we want to be very specific to the music 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.930
 complete bandwidth 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.900
 that means we start playing at 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.730
 Starts over house over couple of classics 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.740
 also in the allen in the nineties 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.740
 So there was something for everyone 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.900
 Of course we have a lot here 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.070
 ascended 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.490
 Of course, people should also do something 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.490
 to get 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.400
 the biggest open air party in ours 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.400
