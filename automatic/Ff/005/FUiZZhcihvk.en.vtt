 Good afternoon, how are you? I recorded it today. 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.640
 It will be a very short video I recorded 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:22.000
 brushing my laurel teeth like I 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.090
 I make use of a grain of rice only 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.399
 folder is a little bit I use folder without 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.840
 fluoride was me to pediatric dentist 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.410
 indicated to Laura because we're going 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.270
 to do flower treatments is sporadic 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.670
 so you do not have to use paste with flower 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.219
 but there who to consult the pediatric dentist 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.379
 to know that each case is a case is okay 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.320
 a controversial subject that challenge or not 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.180
 that's why it has to be evaluated 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.350
 because it depends on every mouthful of how 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.680
 such a baby tooth 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.540
 Okay, that 's when the end of the other rule 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.980
 she told me she would not let it brush 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.750
 the top teeth for nothing you will see 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.780
 that at the beginning of the video she complains 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.030
 And then she said forever praising 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.250
 and usually what we do is not 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.799
 people take speech open mouth stay still 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.439
 to keep holding baby under the 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.659
 hand because he gets the baby to stay 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.119
 ansa debating and is pulling our 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.139
 hand and the people there our reaction will speak 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.549
 the bass is quiet and this is worse is the 

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.740
 same thing as food introduction 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.619
 in this people strength 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.649
 op by water down then I am 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.200

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.049
 beautiful button opened the corner mouth 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.880
 music brushing and has given super 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.649
 It's just brushed, she's left. 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.329
 It's getting better, you're opening your mouth. 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.969
 because it opens the mouth always opens the 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.429
 mouth for low scales in a good 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.799
 when I tread on a good but when 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.729
 I get to brush the top ones she gets 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.859
