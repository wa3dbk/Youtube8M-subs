00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
order plugs and tunnels here but i'm

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.429 
order plugs and tunnels here but i'm
going<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.370> show<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.549> which<00:03:14.819> ones<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.299> got<00:03:15.540> so

going to show you which ones I got so

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.280 
going to show you which ones I got so
first<00:03:16.829> of<00:03:17.040> all<00:03:17.129> I<00:03:17.400> have<00:03:17.760> these<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:18.659> really

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
first of all I have these really really

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.100 
first of all I have these really really
nice<00:03:21.230> golden<00:03:22.730> tunnels<00:03:23.730> they're<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.629> rose<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
nice golden tunnels they're like rose a

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.130 
nice golden tunnels they're like rose a
cold<00:03:25.379> so<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:25.829> really<00:03:26.069> pretty<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.909> i<00:03:27.900> really

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
cold so it's really pretty and i really

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.750 
cold so it's really pretty and i really
like<00:03:28.379> these<00:03:28.620> i<00:03:28.890> think<00:03:29.159> things<00:03:29.400> are<00:03:29.549> very

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
like these i think things are very

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.869 
like these i think things are very
pretty<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.379> have<00:03:31.829> some<00:03:32.390> Coast<00:03:33.390> black<00:03:34.260> ones

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
pretty then I have some Coast black ones

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.569 
pretty then I have some Coast black ones
so<00:03:35.879> it<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.329> like<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.989> normal<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:38.459> know

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
so it can be like just a normal you know

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.149 
so it can be like just a normal you know
it's<00:03:38.909> it's<00:03:39.209> shut<00:03:39.510> off<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.859> see

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
it's it's shut off so you can see

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.910 
it's it's shut off so you can see
through<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:42.720> didn't<00:03:43.140> have<00:03:43.290> any<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.739> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
through it and I didn't have any of the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.030 
through it and I didn't have any of the
plain<00:03:44.340> ones<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.940> mean<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:46.319> think<00:03:46.560> those<00:03:46.980> are

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
plain ones I mean and I think those are

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.229 
plain ones I mean and I think those are
just<00:03:47.549> good<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.209> have<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.450> nice<00:03:49.280> then<00:03:50.280> these<00:03:50.879> ones

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
just good to have a nice then these ones

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.569 
just good to have a nice then these ones
are<00:03:51.420> quite<00:03:51.720> well-known<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.500> those<00:03:53.190> are<00:03:53.340> these

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
are quite well-known I those are these

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.520 
are quite well-known I those are these
ones<00:03:54.170> just<00:03:55.170> some<00:03:55.409> black<00:03:55.680> tunnels<00:03:56.639> with

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
ones just some black tunnels with

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.910 
ones just some black tunnels with
diamond<00:03:58.530> starts<00:03:59.040> I'm<00:03:59.879> so<00:04:00.090> clumsy<00:04:00.440> then<00:04:01.440> I<00:04:01.470> have

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
diamond starts I'm so clumsy then I have

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.789 
diamond starts I'm so clumsy then I have
sort<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.549> same<00:04:02.849> ones<00:04:03.239> but<00:04:03.720> then<00:04:04.019> out<00:04:04.379> with

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
sort of the same ones but then out with

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.509 
sort of the same ones but then out with
red<00:04:05.220> stones<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:07.620> difference<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.459> that

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
red stones and the difference is that

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.650 
red stones and the difference is that
these<00:04:08.970> ones<00:04:09.420> are<00:04:09.720> silicon<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.739> I'm<00:04:11.310> like<00:04:11.660> push

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
these ones are silicon so I'm like push

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.159 
these ones are silicon so I'm like push
them<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.139> probably<00:04:13.829> these<00:04:14.190> ones<00:04:14.489> are<00:04:15.169> more

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
them so probably these ones are more

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.939 
them so probably these ones are more
comfortable<00:04:16.620> but<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:18.299> thought<00:04:19.109> they<00:04:19.260> look<00:04:19.680> just

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
comfortable but I thought they look just

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.420 
comfortable but I thought they look just
cool<00:04:20.280> with<00:04:20.489> like<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:20.910> red<00:04:21.560> then<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.889> have<00:04:23.130> some

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
cool with like the red then I have some

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.029 
cool with like the red then I have some
very<00:04:24.919> very<00:04:25.919> special<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:27.180> bright<00:04:27.570> ones<00:04:28.039> like

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
very very special and bright ones like

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.450 
very very special and bright ones like
it<00:04:29.479> looked<00:04:30.479> like<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:31.199> don't<00:04:32.160> know<00:04:32.340> if

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
it looked like this I don't know if

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.629 
it looked like this I don't know if
you're<00:04:32.610> able<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:33.090> tell<00:04:33.330> properly<00:04:34.130> but<00:04:35.130> they

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
you're able to tell properly but they

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.589 
you're able to tell properly but they
are<00:04:35.880> like<00:04:35.910> rainbow<00:04:37.039> colored<00:04:38.039> and<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.820> think

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
are like rainbow colored and I think

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.860 
are like rainbow colored and I think
they<00:04:39.780> look<00:04:39.990> really<00:04:40.500> really<00:04:40.919> really<00:04:41.250> cool<00:04:41.870> they

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
they look really really really cool they

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.020 
they look really really really cool they
have<00:04:43.080> all<00:04:43.320> different<00:04:43.560> kinds<00:04:44.010> of<00:04:44.250> colors<00:04:44.490> and

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
have all different kinds of colors and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.820 
have all different kinds of colors and
they<00:04:45.660> are<00:04:45.720> still<00:04:46.139> see<00:04:46.380> through<00:04:47.990> not<00:04:48.990> yeah<00:04:49.199> but

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
they are still see through not yeah but

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.189 
they are still see through not yeah but
