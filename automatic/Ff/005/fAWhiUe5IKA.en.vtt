00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello and welcome again 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.569
 to a new video our channel 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.370
 today i have something for the retro people 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.800
 among you and two seasons old 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.910
 earphones for your smartphone or laptop 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.289
 or tablet so the things are there 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.010
 meanwhile almost everywhere 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 I 've got that from aldi 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.720
 cost me 96 and is also available in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.760
 different colours 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.900
 I have this in green now in such a 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.539
 market green which also exists in such a way 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.309
 shiny colors 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.230
 they are compatible with older ones too 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.210
 smartphones simply ordered adapters 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.680
 to buy 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.300
 whether designs with this is because I now 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.210
 not that will be in this maxime right now 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.100
 look at the packaging page 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.590
 feels great 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 okay the adapter cables are all there 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.090
 the packaging material away what we here 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.129
 a guide of the telephone receiver 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.570
 You do not have to have that first 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.530
 we various cable the show here 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.579
 I also have something else with you 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.790
 that is what I think now 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.040
 example very convenient with it 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.880
 it is one time for sony 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.130
 ericsson elm did not settle immediately 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.990
 mm jack that is also installed here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.479
 that means you can for example my 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 phone or samsung phones or in the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.619
 Whole smartphones in the common is 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 the normal 3.5 mm jack connection 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.060
 already installed and for those who 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.310
 may use an old Sony Ericsson 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.119
 I still have these adapters with me then 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.369
 So we still have a 3 5 to 2 5 too 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.350
 I also think very mini adapter 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.500
 good at some operates some phones 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.189
 or smartphones or tablets have stopped 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.700
 really only a very small one 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.680
 connection for all the devices and the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.600
 I also find it very useful because of me 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 every single part of the cost of 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.009
 individually buy would also order again 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.090
 the 56 euro and so you have everything up 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.820
 a shock to the ball and you shoot 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.009
 another extension, too 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.310
 useful and here is time for a country 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.429
 a key to hang up 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.960
 because you have the bollywood button so here 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.390
 can change the volume here 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.160
 now also very handy and here you can 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.840
 of course you hang up then if you 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.320
 or accept and accept calls if 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.490
 there somehow so it should be something from 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.140
 the processing for the really very 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.490
 good at 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.140
 The matte color are the shining ones 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.890
 a bit smoother and of course 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.640
 of course they feel too 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.560
 accordingly 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.890
 So I like this matte very far 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.620
 so a piece is soft and that 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.820
 I think for example the very pleasant 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.890
 cable looks really good too 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.360
 is processed from seven Euro 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.020
 really you can not complain 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.640
 it has a bit of stretching and it does 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.050
 close as follows a smartphone 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.270
 and that does me is just the hand 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.700
 take and then just here 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.420
 jack connection in and start already 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.900
 phoning for you is a nice one 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.480
 gimmick and for seven euros you can 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.560
 Do not do much wrong 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.250
 that 's it dear people i hope it has 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.260
 you like it 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.120
 if there are any questions about this 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.020
 or somehow see something else 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.060
 Just want in the comments 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.060
 Write and see you next time
