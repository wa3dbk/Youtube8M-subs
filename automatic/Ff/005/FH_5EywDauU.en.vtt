the same as the ones from here so you

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.300

can forget about all this part also
you've<00:01:12.670> got<00:01:12.910> two<00:01:13.180> strings<00:01:13.539> out<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.899> the<00:01:13.960> same

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
you've got two strings out of the same

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.200 
you've got two strings out of the same
the<00:01:14.560> e<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.130> e<00:01:15.160> so<00:01:15.580> whatever<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:15.940> learn<00:01:16.060> on

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
this string is going to be the same on

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.990 
this string is going to be the same on
this<00:01:17.649> string<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:17.979> that<00:01:18.130> gets<00:01:18.399> rid<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.700> one

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
this string so that gets rid of that one

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.940 
this string so that gets rid of that one

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
on the lower two strings to eat and the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.020 
on the lower two strings to eat and the
a<00:01:23.020> because<00:01:23.950> most<00:01:24.220> of<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.430> chords<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.759> play

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
notes to remember on the E string you

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.090 
notes to remember on the E string you
have<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.790> G<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.030> B<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> string<00:01:38.710> you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
have the C D and E now what I would

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.460 
have the C D and E now what I would
recommend<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:42.220> memorizing<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.869> notes<00:01:44.140> on<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
recommend is memorizing the notes on the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.700 
recommend is memorizing the notes on the
E<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.340> string<00:01:45.759> first<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:47.350> start<00:01:47.619> with

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
E and a string first you can start with

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.530 
E and a string first you can start with
these<00:01:47.829> markers<00:01:48.220> if<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.490> like<00:01:48.670> because<00:01:49.390> this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
these markers if you like because this

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.710 
these markers if you like because this
is<00:01:49.689> where<00:01:49.840> most<00:01:50.170> chords<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:52.030> root<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.420> based

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
is where most chords the root is based

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.350 
is where most chords the root is based
on<00:01:52.960> these<00:01:53.290> strings<00:01:53.560> now<00:01:54.340> for<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.180> next

an octave which is basically skipping a

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.090 
an octave which is basically skipping a
string<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.390> skipping<00:02:01.719> a<00:02:01.810> fret<00:02:02.079> you<00:02:02.890> know<00:02:03.009> if

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
string and skipping a fret you know if

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.660 
string and skipping a fret you know if
you're<00:02:03.219> playing<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.610> power<00:02:03.820> chord<00:02:04.210> like<00:02:04.600> this

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you're playing a power chord like this

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.059 
you're playing a power chord like this
check<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.600> note<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.320> got<00:02:07.500> an<00:02:07.650> Ogden

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
check out that note you got an Ogden

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.639 
check out that note you got an Ogden
which<00:02:08.250> means<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:09.390> these<00:02:09.539> two<00:02:09.810> notes<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
which means that these two notes are the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.940 
which means that these two notes are the
same

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
same

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.309

this<00:02:11.310> one's<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.550> an<00:02:11.760> octave<00:02:12.060> higher<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.170> if

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
this one's just an octave higher so if

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.900 
this one's just an octave higher so if
you<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.920> notes<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.459> E<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
you know what the notes on the E and a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.059 
you know what the notes on the E and a
string<00:02:15.239> are<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.690> you're<00:02:16.470> up<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.830> D<00:02:17.040> string

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
string are and you're up on the D string

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.979 
string are and you're up on the D string
or<00:02:17.489> like<00:02:17.610> what's<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.060> note<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.599> throw<00:02:18.870> an

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
octave down you go like oh that's a B

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.490 
octave down you go like oh that's a B
and<00:02:20.819> then<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.630> same<00:02:21.840> thing<00:02:22.050> on<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> g<00:02:22.470> string

strings now the only one left is the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.110 
strings now the only one left is the
oddball<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.080> B<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.519> I<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.850> do<00:02:33.000> to
