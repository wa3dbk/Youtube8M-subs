00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.010 
you about pressure washing aluminum
siding<00:00:05.400> now<00:00:06.150> when<00:00:06.390> we're<00:00:06.540> pressure<00:00:06.779> washing

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
siding now when we're pressure washing

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.919 
siding now when we're pressure washing
an<00:00:07.259> aluminum<00:00:07.589> siding<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.580> one<00:00:09.269> precaution<00:00:09.840> we

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929

don't<00:00:11.580> use<00:00:12.590> the<00:00:13.590> highest<00:00:13.980> pressure<00:00:14.599> settings

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
don't use the highest pressure settings

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.800 
don't use the highest pressure settings
on<00:00:15.870> our<00:00:16.279> pressure<00:00:17.279> washer<00:00:17.520> because<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.570> can

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
on our pressure washer because you can

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.400 
on our pressure washer because you can
dent<00:00:19.850> you<00:00:20.850> know<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.180> more<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.930> aluminum

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
dent you know or more the aluminum

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.920 
dent you know or more the aluminum
siding<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.460> when<00:00:24.029> we're<00:00:24.180> pressure<00:00:24.420> washing<00:00:24.689> an

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
siding so when we're pressure washing an

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.990 
siding so when we're pressure washing an
aluminum<00:00:25.289> siding<00:00:25.590> you're<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> start

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
aluminum siding you're going to start

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.660 
aluminum siding you're going to start
out<00:00:27.150> with<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.810> low<00:00:28.650> pressure<00:00:28.920> tip<00:00:29.310> which

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
out with this a low pressure tip which

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.250 
out with this a low pressure tip which
will<00:00:29.849> help<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.179> apply<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> cleaning

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
solution and the suds to it and then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.119 
solution and the suds to it and then
we'll<00:00:35.040> either<00:00:35.520> use<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.230> 45<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.739> no<00:00:37.920> more

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
we'll either use a 45 or really no more

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.270 
we'll either use a 45 or really no more
than<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.460> 25<00:00:38.940> degree<00:00:39.500> on<00:00:40.500> your<00:00:40.739> pressure<00:00:40.980> washer

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
than a 25 degree on your pressure washer

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
than a 25 degree on your pressure washer
the<00:00:41.850> lower<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> degree<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> tip<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the lower the degree of the tip the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410 
the lower the degree of the tip the
higher<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.710> pressure<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.850> smaller<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
higher the pressure and the smaller the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
higher the pressure and the smaller the
fan<00:00:45.660> spray<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.090> pressure

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
fan spray so you know for pressure

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
fan spray so you know for pressure
washing<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.870> house<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> wider<00:00:49.590> fan<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.370> to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
okay so again on on aluminum siding you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.059 
okay so again on on aluminum siding you
will<00:02:44.090> make<00:02:44.270> sure<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.780> we<00:02:45.200> use<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.800> lower

will make sure that we use a lower
pressure<00:02:47.260> tip<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.560> our<00:02:48.739> pressure<00:02:49.160> washer<00:02:49.700> so

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
pressure tip on our pressure washer so

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.059 
pressure tip on our pressure washer so
from<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.690> bottom<00:02:50.840> up<00:02:51.200> rinse<00:02:51.590> from<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.890> top
