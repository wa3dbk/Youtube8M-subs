00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 un ex rome today was born badly unfortunately 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.090
 unfortunately great merits to the hellas that 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.030
 they didn't even make a big one anyway 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.670
 game from the point of view of character 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.460
 with a tonic it deserves all this 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.820
 success after this match at hellas 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.170
 and hard to mark it but it was always hard 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.240
 for everyone it will be until she has it 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.519
 therefore want to feel like there is still a lot 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 it becomes difficult looking at it from the field 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.750
 in short, what do you think is its strength? 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.250
 that you found it in front of you today 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.719
 second goal was stratospheric 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 promises if you do it first close e 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.219
 speak for six months but beyond 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.559
 second goal that I think more for the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.390
 game of the Verona that is everything anyway 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.579
 pointed at him and his long shots 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.870
 if he is his strength, why 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 even countering it always becomes 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 difficult for everyone so let's say that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.510
 in the perfect team for him in this 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 moment the pd also psychologically 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.530
 what happened during this match because 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.969
 in short, the truth has not remained in ten 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.260
 But I found this neck then you are 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.910
 managed to equalize it seemed that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.379
 could go more to your side 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.789
 instead it was not the one that did not go 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.189
 on our side because in the end it does not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 we did what we had to do 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.490
 when the teams the opponents remain 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.020
 in ten it is useless to all come anyway 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.360
 meeting must also create something 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.000
 different time on the bands etc. 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.680
 today we were a little static with the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.060
 change of form some absence that 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.159
 however it has upset us a little 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.869
 exit tactical plans this match 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.670
 beyond the character of the hellas 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.259
 I am also going to missiroli what has you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 surprised by verona because in short 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.829
 ten against eleven is not that simple 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.299
 overturning it didn't surprise us we knew 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.729
 that they had a great aggression that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.409
 very much reflects the mentality of the coach 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.850
 so today they proved it to be 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.740
 a team that have character because 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.150
 make a match of the kind of the gods 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.240
 our mistakes, however, is not for everyone 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.110
 remain in 10 from the start of the game 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.579
 console the fact that next year there 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.270
 will be the revenge still in series to for 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.369
 32 st were as long as possible 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.900
 listen to me what you remember of verona in 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.900
 very young summaries when you are 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.470
 arrived here was a vintage 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.170
 dramatic from a sporting point of view 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.290
 note that even today after 15 years in the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.300
 football tells of that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.620
 almost absurd relegation because with i 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.900
 players we had where the team 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.910
 and for what they did after almost 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.370
 everyone seems almost absurd from the 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.450
 processions however 6 explained is no 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.850
 unfortunately not 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 still a mystery today if it had been 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.080
 in today's football maybe they would be 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.840
 even 39 points were sufficient where perhaps 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 even less that football there unfortunately there 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.980
 they wanted so many more and we did n't 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.370
 made however a positive memory 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.230
 of a square and in any case 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.470
 he lives on football but leaves peace on 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.470
 player
