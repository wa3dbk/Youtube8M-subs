AeroBlade roof rack system also works
equally<00:00:41.700> well<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:41.940> Tooley<00:00:42.690> standard<00:00:43.140> load

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
equally well on Tooley standard load

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.479 
equally well on Tooley standard load

it has widely spaced mounting bracket it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.799 
it has widely spaced mounting bracket it
could<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:52.680> work<00:00:52.800> nicely<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.820> most<00:00:54.090> factory

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
