today is provided by the issue of line I
really<00:01:42.500> believe<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.950> sanctity<00:01:43.189> of<00:01:43.520> line

really believe in the sanctity of line
there's<00:01:45.020> two<00:01:45.319> kinds<00:01:45.740> of<00:01:45.799> lying<00:01:46.069> my<00:01:46.459> analysis

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
there's two kinds of lying my analysis

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.869 
there's two kinds of lying my analysis
you<00:01:47.599> have<00:01:47.719> one<00:01:47.959> intuitive<00:01:48.560> line<00:01:48.739> and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:49.789> you

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:49.879 
you have one intuitive line and then you

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:52.660 
you have one intuitive line and then you
have<00:01:49.969> mechanical<00:01:50.920> mechanical<00:01:51.920> line<00:01:52.520> this

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
have mechanical mechanical line this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.800 
have mechanical mechanical line this
line<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:53.119> drawn<00:01:54.099> ok<00:01:55.099> the<00:01:55.280> compass<00:01:55.759> yes<00:01:56.179> how<00:01:56.659> are

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
line is drawn ok the compass yes how are

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.600 
line is drawn ok the compass yes how are
the<00:01:56.959> camera<00:01:58.270> ok<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.479> believe<00:01:59.959> that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.150 

well<00:02:03.610> let<00:02:04.000> me<00:02:04.030> make<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:04.690> example<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.980> could

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
well let me make this example you could

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.810 
well let me make this example you could
ever<00:02:06.310> move<00:02:06.550> full<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:07.000> men<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:07.510> Robert<00:02:08.140> shot

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
ever move full of men with Robert shot

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.090 
ever move full of men with Robert shot
it<00:02:09.820> all<00:02:09.970> at<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.210> same<00:02:10.420> name<00:02:10.720> but<00:02:11.680> at<00:02:11.800> all<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
it all at the same name but at all the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.160 
it all at the same name but at all the
different<00:02:12.280> place<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.330> they'd<00:02:13.810> all<00:02:13.960> have<00:02:14.110> a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
different place and they'd all have a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.590 
different place and they'd all have a
different<00:02:14.530> signature<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.600> really

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
different signature that I really

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.750 
different signature that I really
believe<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:16.900> their<00:02:17.260> signature<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.430> really

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
believe that their signature is really

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.140 
believe that their signature is really
them<00:02:19.120> their<00:02:19.870> mark<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:21.220> represents<00:02:21.940> them

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
them their mark is that represents them

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.750 
them their mark is that represents them
in<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.170> most<00:02:23.350> complete<00:02:23.650> way<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:27.340> sum<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.670> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
in a most complete way so the sum of the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.850 
in a most complete way so the sum of the
point<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.390> really<00:02:28.900> dedicated<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.590> to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
good art it's bad painting or I really

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.590 
good art it's bad painting or I really

don't pay attention to what everybody
else<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.020> -<00:02:50.200> okay<00:02:50.560> good<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.070> takes<00:02:51.250> too<00:02:51.400> much

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
else is - okay good that takes too much

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.140 
else is - okay good that takes too much
time

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
time

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.510 
time
yes<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.410> time<00:02:53.620> consigning<00:02:54.070> if<00:02:54.370> they're

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
yes it is time consigning if they're

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.030 
yes it is time consigning if they're
doing<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.820> mean

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
doing that mean

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.020 
doing that mean
they're<00:02:57.040> doing<00:02:57.340> something<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.819> went

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
they're doing something that I went

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.940 
they're doing something that I went
through<00:02:58.120> 40<00:02:58.569> years<00:02:58.750> ago<00:02:58.989> 41<00:02:59.799> years<00:03:00.010> ago<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:01.329> I

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
through 40 years ago 41 years ago so I

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.140 
through 40 years ago 41 years ago so I
really<00:03:02.950> think<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.250> good<00:03:03.489> food<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.909> where

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
really think that good food is where

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.199 
really think that good food is where
it's<00:03:04.299> at<00:03:04.450> today<00:03:04.659> I<00:03:05.110> think<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:06.129> when<00:03:06.909> I<00:03:06.939> did

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
it's at today I think that when I did

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.080 
it's at today I think that when I did
that<00:03:07.390> painting<00:03:07.689> I<00:03:08.250> after<00:03:09.250> was<00:03:09.400> gone<00:03:09.670> was

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
that painting I after was gone was

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.929 
that painting I after was gone was
understood<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.200> someone<00:03:11.530> successful<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.340> felt

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
understood and someone successful I felt

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:22.710 
understood and someone successful I felt
I<00:03:13.000> had<00:03:13.030> more<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.629> me<00:03:13.810> than<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:21.540> where<00:03:22.540> do<00:03:22.629> you

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
I had more in me than just where do you

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.089 
I had more in me than just where do you
think<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.930> fits<00:03:23.260> in<00:03:23.470> with<00:03:23.500> Kitsch<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.890> bad

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
think that fits in with Kitsch this bad

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.800 
think that fits in with Kitsch this bad
painting<00:03:27.489> in<00:03:27.579> kitchens<00:03:28.000> that's<00:03:28.150> anonymous<00:03:28.659> or

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
painting in kitchens that's anonymous or

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.879 
painting in kitchens that's anonymous or
is<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.409> different<00:03:29.829> thing<00:03:31.889> always

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
is that is that a different thing always

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.050 
is that is that a different thing always
had<00:03:33.040> contact<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.690> kinda<00:03:35.470> keep<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:36.220> content

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
had contact the kinda keep the content

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.979 
had contact the kinda keep the content
of<00:03:37.180> kitsch<00:03:37.650> that's<00:03:38.650> basically<00:03:39.129> superficial

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
of kitsch that's basically superficial

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.300 
of kitsch that's basically superficial
and<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.139> always<00:03:41.439> tried<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.709> avoid<00:03:41.980> the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
and I always tried to avoid the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.280 
and I always tried to avoid the
superficial<00:03:42.819> content<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.840> bad<00:03:44.019> beans

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
superficial content and the bad beans

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.759 
superficial content and the bad beans
that<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.620> do<00:03:45.569> like<00:03:46.569> I<00:03:46.780> say<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.049> was<00:03:47.109> reaction<00:03:47.650> to

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
that I do like I say it was reaction to

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.190 
that I do like I say it was reaction to
photo<00:03:48.010> realism<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.819> formula<00:03:49.780> for<00:03:49.810> photo

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
photo realism and the formula for photo

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.129 
photo realism and the formula for photo
realism<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.889> my<00:03:51.069> analysis<00:03:51.670> was<00:03:51.810> take<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.840> bad

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
realism to my analysis was take a bad

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.610 
realism to my analysis was take a bad
idea<00:03:53.379> and<00:03:54.220> make<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.459> pretty<00:03:55.109> in<00:03:56.109> detailed

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
idea and make it pretty in detailed

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.729 
idea and make it pretty in detailed
photo<00:03:57.159> realism<00:03:57.670> was<00:03:58.420> essentially<00:03:59.079> simply

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
photo realism was essentially simply

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.460 
photo realism was essentially simply
second-generation<00:04:00.340> pop<00:04:00.970> so<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.109> a<00:04:02.199> little

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
second-generation pop so it's a little

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.830 
second-generation pop so it's a little
late<00:04:02.620> on<00:04:02.889> both<00:04:03.190> ends<00:04:03.519> little<00:04:04.480> late<00:04:04.660> on<00:04:04.810> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
late on both ends little late on the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.990 
late on both ends little late on the
philosophy<00:04:05.379> a<00:04:06.099> little<00:04:06.579> late<00:04:06.730> on<00:04:06.910> the

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
philosophy a little late on the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.410 
philosophy a little late on the
technique<00:04:07.449> I<00:04:07.660> think

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
technique I think

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.910 
technique I think
not<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.900> shouldn't<00:04:11.290> try<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.590> achieve

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
not that you shouldn't try to achieve

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.789 
not that you shouldn't try to achieve
perfection<00:04:12.569> it's<00:04:13.569> just<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.930> issue<00:04:14.109> I<00:04:14.530> don't

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
perfection it's just the issue I don't

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.319 
perfection it's just the issue I don't
believe<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.040> should<00:04:15.069> achieve<00:04:15.489> our<00:04:15.670> attempt

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
believe you should achieve our attempt

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.539 
believe you should achieve our attempt
to<00:04:16.419> achieve<00:04:16.479> perfection<00:04:17.130> through<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.220> use<00:04:18.340> of

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
to achieve perfection through the use of

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.310 
to achieve perfection through the use of
machine<00:04:19.199> I'll<00:04:20.199> buy<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.639> so<00:04:22.449> I<00:04:22.479> dedicated

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
machine I'll buy that so so I dedicated

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.420 
machine I'll buy that so so I dedicated
to<00:04:23.500> intuitive<00:04:23.949> line<00:04:27.240> yes<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.449> frames<00:04:28.720> you

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
to intuitive line yes the frames you

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.830 
to intuitive line yes the frames you
know<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.520> have<00:04:30.789> a<00:04:30.820> statement<00:04:31.150> that<00:04:31.419> paintings

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
know I have a statement that paintings

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.260 
know I have a statement that paintings
are<00:04:32.020> sculptured<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:33.000> basically<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.090> means

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
are sculptured and basically that means

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.659 
are sculptured and basically that means
that<00:04:34.690> all<00:04:34.870> paintings<00:04:35.380> exist<00:04:36.370> as

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
that all paintings exist as

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.430 
that all paintings exist as
three-dimensional<00:04:37.060> art<00:04:37.509> as<00:04:37.720> objects<00:04:38.139> yes

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
three-dimensional art as objects yes

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.159 
three-dimensional art as objects yes
they<00:04:38.590> have<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.949> survive<00:04:39.490> sculpturally<00:04:40.449> they

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
they have to survive sculpturally they

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.260 
they have to survive sculpturally they
have<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.440> be<00:04:41.560> successful<00:04:41.979> that's<00:04:42.880> one<00:04:43.090> of<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
have to be successful that's one of the

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.379 
have to be successful that's one of the
reasons<00:04:43.690> I<00:04:43.900> think<00:04:44.130> photos<00:04:45.130> are<00:04:46.090> less

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
reasons I think photos are less

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.200 
reasons I think photos are less
competitive<00:04:47.139> because<00:04:47.979> photos<00:04:48.639> are<00:04:48.940> lousy

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
competitive because photos are lousy

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.550 
competitive because photos are lousy
sculpture<00:04:53.970> was<00:04:54.970> originally<00:04:55.690> designed<00:04:55.870> at<00:04:56.349> the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
sculpture was originally designed at the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.219 
sculpture was originally designed at the
large<00:04:56.800> section<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.729> the<00:04:58.180> bottom<00:04:58.599> and<00:04:59.110> the

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
large section on the bottom and the

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.159 
large section on the bottom and the
smaller<00:04:59.560> section

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
smaller section

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.350 
smaller section
and<00:05:01.800> when<00:05:01.919> I<00:05:01.949> made<00:05:02.189> it<00:05:02.219> I<00:05:02.400> painted<00:05:02.849> it<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.150> had<00:05:03.330> it

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
and when I made it I painted it I had it

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.869 
and when I made it I painted it I had it
laying<00:05:03.659> down<00:05:03.870> on<00:05:04.259> my<00:05:04.319> table<00:05:04.979> saw<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.520> kind<00:05:05.789> of

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
laying down on my table saw it kind of

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.119 
laying down on my table saw it kind of
flat<00:05:06.150> in<00:05:06.330> my<00:05:06.539> studio<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.169> I<00:05:07.620> came<00:05:07.830> in<00:05:07.979> in<00:05:08.099> the

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
flat in my studio and I came in in the

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.019 
flat in my studio and I came in in the
morning<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.759> I<00:05:09.419> went<00:05:09.599> there<00:05:10.699> looks<00:05:11.699> pretty

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.029 
morning and I went there looks pretty

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.589 
morning and I went there looks pretty
good<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.770> said<00:05:14.069> wait<00:05:14.939> a<00:05:14.999> minute

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
good and I said wait a minute

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.719 
good and I said wait a minute
I'm<00:05:15.749> looking<00:05:16.020> at<00:05:16.139> it<00:05:16.169> upside<00:05:16.409> down<00:05:19.580> what<00:05:20.580> it

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
I'm looking at it upside down what it

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.589 
I'm looking at it upside down what it
did<00:05:20.999> look<00:05:21.270> good<00:05:21.539> and<00:05:22.020> so<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:22.379> looked<00:05:22.680> at<00:05:22.860> me

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
did look good and so I looked at me

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.300 
did look good and so I looked at me
analyze<00:05:24.599> this<00:05:25.199> frame<00:05:25.439> here<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:25.800> largest

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
analyze this frame here is largest

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.100 
analyze this frame here is largest
section<00:05:26.699> on<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.389> top<00:05:27.629> and<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:27.930> smaller

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
section on the top and the smaller

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.360 
section on the top and the smaller
section<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.259> still<00:05:31.710> take<00:05:31.889> a<00:05:31.919> look<00:05:32.159> at<00:05:32.279> it

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
section and I still take a look at it

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.219 
section and I still take a look at it
again<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.669> said<00:05:32.849> well<00:05:33.029> you<00:05:33.210> know<00:05:33.330> a<00:05:33.360> nice<00:05:33.960> but

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
again I said well you know a nice but

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.939 
again I said well you know a nice but
good<00:05:34.439> upside<00:05:34.830> down<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:36.210> so<00:05:36.479> I<00:05:36.770> technically<00:05:37.770> at

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
good upside down and so I technically at

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.540 
good upside down and so I technically at
wide<00:05:38.330> experiences<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:40.400> painting<00:05:41.400> is

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
wide experiences this painting is

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.249 
wide experiences this painting is
essentially<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.270> look<00:05:42.419> at<00:05:42.539> you<00:05:42.659> are<00:05:42.750> going<00:05:43.080> to

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
essentially a look at you are going to

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.379 
essentially a look at you are going to
assume<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:44.460> when<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:44.669> look<00:05:44.849> at<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.060> window

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
assume and when you look at the window

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.179 
assume and when you look at the window
architecture<00:05:46.110> that<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:46.319> notice<00:05:46.740> is<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:46.979> long

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
architecture that you notice is a long

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:48.670 
architecture that you notice is a long
time<00:05:47.430> insulin

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
time insulin

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.510 
time insulin
and<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.160> silk<00:05:50.500> really<00:05:51.500> okay<00:05:52.220> I<00:05:52.250> didn't

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
and the silk really okay I didn't

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.480 
and the silk really okay I didn't
realize<00:05:52.820> that<00:05:53.500> that's<00:05:54.500> why<00:05:54.830> when<00:05:55.100> I<00:05:55.160> look<00:05:55.340> at

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
realize that that's why when I look at

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.400 
realize that that's why when I look at
this<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.820> feels<00:05:56.030> confident<00:05:56.870> it<00:05:56.960> feels<00:05:57.199> normal

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
this it feels confident it feels normal

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.469 
this it feels confident it feels normal
because<00:05:57.889> I'm<00:05:58.370> accustomed<00:05:58.580> to<00:05:58.820> see<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.210> larger

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
because I'm accustomed to see the larger

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.870 
because I'm accustomed to see the larger
little<00:05:59.960> bit<00:06:00.110> smaller<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:00.620> well<00:06:01.340> that's<00:06:01.460> also<00:06:01.820> a

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
little bit smaller so well that's also a

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.670 
little bit smaller so well that's also a
very<00:06:01.940> abstract<00:06:02.330> way<00:06:02.840> of<00:06:03.050> looking<00:06:03.440> at<00:06:03.560> it

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
very abstract way of looking at it

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.520 
very abstract way of looking at it
you're<00:06:03.770> looking<00:06:04.100> at<00:06:04.370> two<00:06:04.550> rectangles<00:06:05.180> sort<00:06:05.419> of

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
you're looking at two rectangles sort of

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.749 
you're looking at two rectangles sort of
embedded<00:06:06.530> in<00:06:06.620> each<00:06:06.710> other<00:06:06.979> so<00:06:07.310> that's<00:06:07.550> also

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
embedded in each other so that's also

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.640 
embedded in each other so that's also
kind<00:06:08.150> of<00:06:08.210> an<00:06:08.300> abstract<00:06:08.570> side<00:06:08.990> of<00:06:09.110> it<00:06:10.210> well

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
kind of an abstract side of it well

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.219 
kind of an abstract side of it well
thanks<00:06:12.650> for<00:06:12.740> your<00:06:12.800> explanation<00:06:13.610> and
