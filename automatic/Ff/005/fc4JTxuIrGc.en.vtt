00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
which is what I'm gonna use to make an

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.779 
which is what I'm gonna use to make an
overhanging<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.900> where<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.260> sitting<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:23.550> case

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
overhanging of where I'm sitting in case

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.519 
overhanging of where I'm sitting in case
it<00:00:23.970> starts<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.420> drizzle<00:00:24.630> again<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> did<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
it starts to drizzle again like it did a

moment<00:00:25.710> ago<00:00:26.960> these<00:00:27.960> tarps<00:00:28.349> are<00:00:28.560> extremely

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
moment ago these tarps are extremely

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.110 
moment ago these tarps are extremely
expensive<00:00:29.840> they're<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:31.460> $100<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.759> an<00:00:32.820> 8<00:00:32.940> by

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
expensive they're about $100 for an 8 by

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.360 
expensive they're about $100 for an 8 by
10<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:34.079> brand<00:00:35.090> brand<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:40.370> I

by<00:00:46.170> integral<00:00:46.649> designs<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> Mac<00:00:48.860> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
by integral designs I got an it Mac it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.920 
by integral designs I got an it Mac it's
because<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> their<00:00:50.489> weight<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> they're

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
because of their weight and they're

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.610 
because of their weight and they're
completely<00:00:53.180> impermeable<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.500> it's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
completely impermeable but it's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.170 
completely impermeable but it's
primarily<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.430> weight<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.820> you're<00:00:56.969> paying

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
into another sea2summit

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.100 
into another sea2summit
dry<00:01:15.689> bag<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> what's<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.720> my

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
dry bag and and and what's in here my

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.160 
dry bag and and and what's in here my
sleeping<00:01:19.710> bag<00:01:19.920> which<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
sleeping bag which is up to here it's a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.270 
sleeping bag which is up to here it's a
full<00:01:23.009> down<00:01:23.280> sleeping<00:01:23.640> bag<00:01:24.470> no<00:01:25.470> synthetic<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
full down sleeping bag no synthetic so I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
full down sleeping bag no synthetic so I
compress<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.240> small<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.930> difference

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
compress it really small the difference

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560 
compress it really small the difference
with<00:01:28.579> synthetic<00:01:29.579> sleeping<00:01:29.670> bags<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> down

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
with synthetic sleeping bags and down

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230 
with synthetic sleeping bags and down
sleeping<00:01:31.020> bags<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:32.009> down<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.090> will

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sleeping bags is that a down one will

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.719 
sleeping bags is that a down one will
keep<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.619> significantly<00:01:34.619> warmer<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
keep you significantly warmer but a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.330 
keep you significantly warmer but a
synthetic<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:37.229> dry<00:01:37.470> significantly

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
synthetic one will dry significantly

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.289 
synthetic one will dry significantly
faster<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.210> gets<00:01:39.390> wet<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:40.350> therefore<00:01:41.310> opted

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
faster if it gets wet I therefore opted

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359 
faster if it gets wet I therefore opted
for<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> down<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> simple<00:01:43.619> reason<00:01:43.649> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
for the down for the simple reason that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.319 
for the down for the simple reason that
I<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:46.049> better<00:01:46.229> close<00:01:46.500> my<00:01:46.740> dry<00:01:47.490> bags<00:01:47.729> properly

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
I just better close my dry bags properly

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.600 
I just better close my dry bags properly
but<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> down<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:50.130> dumped<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.579> some

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
but the down if I get dumped in some

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.460 
but the down if I get dumped in some
really<00:01:51.030> cold<00:01:51.270> water<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.810> need<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.110> get<00:01:52.200> warm

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
really cold water and I need to get warm

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
really cold water and I need to get warm
quickly<00:01:52.710> I'll<00:01:53.159> jump<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.759> down<00:01:53.970> sleeping

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
quickly I'll jump into a down sleeping

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.109 
quickly I'll jump into a down sleeping
bag<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.720> sure<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.409> synthetic<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.759> won't

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
bag for sure a synthetic one just won't

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.350 
bag for sure a synthetic one just won't
do<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> trick<00:01:57.450> anymore<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.649> my<00:01:59.180> sleeping<00:02:00.180> bags

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
do the trick anymore so my sleeping bags

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149 
do the trick anymore so my sleeping bags
up<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.290> aware<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.770> pack

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
up to here and I'm aware of that I pack
