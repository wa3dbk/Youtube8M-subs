00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
like I says supercharged so you do kind

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.550 
like I says supercharged so you do kind
of<00:02:04.850> expect<00:02:05.210> less<00:02:05.479> gas<00:02:05.750> mileage<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.380> that's

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
of expect less gas mileage but that's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.460 
of expect less gas mileage but that's
still<00:02:06.710> not<00:02:06.920> bad<00:02:07.130> for<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.610> much<00:02:07.970> power<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.720> of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
still not bad for that much power and of

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.870 
still not bad for that much power and of
course<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.009> better<00:02:10.220> worse<00:02:10.489> depend<00:02:10.820> on

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
course you can do better worse depend on

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.190 
course you can do better worse depend on
how<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.120> drive<00:02:11.330> but<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:11.660> thing's<00:02:11.840> got<00:02:12.050> the

cruising<00:02:17.150> understand<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:17.720> not<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.050> bad

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
cruising understand it's not that bad

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.250

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
but once you step on the gas it really

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.380 
but once you step on the gas it really
does<00:02:21.410> sound<00:02:21.739> good<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.430> hear<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> rumble<00:02:23.150> right
