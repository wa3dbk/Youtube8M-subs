speculate<00:03:19.930> I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
speculate I

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.160 
speculate I
think<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.940> story<00:03:22.239> they<00:03:22.450> may<00:03:22.720> stick<00:03:23.050> with

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
think that the story they may stick with

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.690 
think that the story they may stick with
in<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.349> total<00:03:23.709> speculation<00:03:23.890> i<00:03:24.310> don't<00:03:24.550> know

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
in this total speculation i don't know

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.009 
in this total speculation i don't know
but<00:03:24.790> i<00:03:24.879> think<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.209> book<00:03:25.480> story<00:03:25.780> they<00:03:25.900> may

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
but i think the book story they may

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.199 
but i think the book story they may
stick<00:03:26.230> with<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:26.440> most<00:03:26.680> is<00:03:26.890> aria<00:03:27.549> mm-hmm<00:03:28.090> in

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
stick with the most is aria mm-hmm in

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.539 
stick with the most is aria mm-hmm in
the<00:03:28.599> house<00:03:28.810> well<00:03:29.170> no<00:03:29.290> Cece<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.769> can't<00:03:30.129> do<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.310> I
