00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.859 
have a DSP inside alright with some
special<00:01:12.330> effects<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> compressor

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
special effects we have the compressor

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.930 
special effects we have the compressor
the<00:01:15.900> cue<00:01:16.260> effect<00:01:17.160> inside<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
the cue effect inside and we have the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.080 
the cue effect inside and we have the
SPX

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
SPX

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.900 
SPX
reverb<00:01:21.570> effect<00:01:21.960> inside<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.860> nice<00:01:23.130> but

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
reverb effect inside that's nice but

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.380 
reverb effect inside that's nice but
you're<00:01:24.360> either<00:01:24.690> an<00:01:25.259> EM<00:01:25.740> simulation<00:01:26.310> onboard

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you're either an EM simulation onboard

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.380 
you're either an EM simulation onboard
I'm<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.800> Akita<00:01:29.100> player<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> good<00:01:30.270> or
