which<00:00:40.620> I'm<00:00:40.829> guessing<00:00:41.309> that's<00:00:41.910> part<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.100> it

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
which I'm guessing that's part of the it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.990 
which I'm guessing that's part of the it
being<00:00:44.399> fully<00:00:44.610> under<00:00:44.879> tech<00:00:45.090> table<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
no idea what that is encrypted hashtag

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.020 
no idea what that is encrypted hashtag
values<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> either

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
values I don't know if that is either

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.389
