 We have many partners 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 maybe even as a driver somewhere 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.540
 started and very much today

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.870
 The market pizza delivery has been growing 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.480
 For many years we have been quite successful 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.890
 grow disproportionately in this market 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.360
 that is our companies are the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.360
 strongest sales in this segment 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.820
 this is now market leader because we 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.250
 Of course we are very innovative 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.700
 in the course of our already very long 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.410
 history 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.880
 or very much experience 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.300
 which we also pass on 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.300
 can 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.869
 Of course, we have ourselves for the future 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.299
 we have made some more things 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.829
 By building our market leadership 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.479
 in Germany we are not finished yet 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.289
 want the distance to the competition yet 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.030
 enlarge 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.920
 and of course we will continue to do that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.549
 expand we see there in the next 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.289

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.070
 planned to find and recruit 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.210

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.740
 characterized employee employment that is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.810
 On the one hand , I had security 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.080
 On the other hand, I was also in mine 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.430
 decision leeway inputs a 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.020
 I really liked her super job 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.240

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.920
 knows to ask was independence has 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.269
 Of course, many questions and fears, such as 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.700
 looks out the financial situation 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.850

 Questions clarified and in the end I could 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.239
 say good-naturedly 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.239

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.720

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.280
