00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.259
 it's a stop dream 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.359
 this attack for adele and the beast 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.689

 white 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
 little door this cyclone very very interesting 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.350
 kanaan suffered because the success of the iCo had played three days ago 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.490
 I take the second time we got the upper hand on this team 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.970
 Sochaux 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.740
 and especially the controls that was very important and everyone was 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.830
 felt boosted and then said go get this win associated this is 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.830
 well even if we suffered in the first half 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.760
 it's his boyfriend 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310
 let's note again 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.260
 his daughter 33 points on the clock 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.030
 it's always good to be there on the move 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.400
 other seed point 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.470
 and sudden 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.770
 the match like that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410
 nani at the end 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.410
 often they are much better 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.550
 for French 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.590
 this week 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.690
 this vaccine is a fact on the roof the flyer 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.920
 it deserves filiu 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.880
 I work for that 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 still on its base 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.960
 this show they are afraid 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.960
 antennas during the laying of 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.930
 we see in a real that it was a little but good after that we scored 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.330
 this goal and it is true that after 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.430
 my preference the end of the match after a strong in 2002 socios summer 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.610
 stopped doing everything 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.880
 so this ad went looking for this result because that I 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.010
 think it was 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.820
 sassou even longer 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.100
 the group 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.220
 and then can also 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.090
 orders from the villain the trophy victory because it's more important 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.070
 in football 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.900
 the art market 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.470
 a bit of a pity 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 the same ras 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.999
 Bernard today is 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.599
 if the team 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.799

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.069
 more prosaically months 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.029
 I will not lie 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.219
 club 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.719
 the legality there is nothing less than scorer 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.079
 November 26 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.889
 between tale and colorful for axa 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.499

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:28.559

 scattered it's her wealth is hardly she 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.019
 same observation for the holidays on our time 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.019

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.239
 omnisports company 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.549

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.599
 it was lined with this compound could overflow center strong in front of the cage and 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.090
 at an hour of uncomplicated listening we were sure to learn about the 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.440
 short 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.440
 another away game in this second half of the season to stop 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.849
 hemorrhage as a contract 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.499
 one of the big teams so 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.109
 here on the complicated match there at the park the bench 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.680
 I think our rivals vary from the path to trust so no no that's it 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.419
 important to manage the match and the match of paris 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.549

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.889

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.759
 rome rome 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:31.559
 I put a vehicle my mind of two keys conquest but sometimes we 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:33.079
 know that Paris at home 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.389
 and often intractable sokele to be ready 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.289
 very strong for me have recovered then we will gear head I was 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:41.689
