00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.869
 we sit at the feet of alex super or 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.820
 her stand got really good and now are 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.969
 we here the olli and me the rhine 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.410
 from boss yeah so what I have here now 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.880
 wants to show is the new boss 18 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.830
 many say the thing is a footswitch 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.939
 I tell you this is a footswitch 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 universe 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.499
 yes because that is a loop holder with the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 you almost every effect of course first 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:37.380
 one by one here depends on it so he has 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.110
 yes, for example, the hamann is on it 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.580
 Of course he has the tuner extra 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.450
 Here's a delay down here if you 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.490
 maybe a bit higher 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.040
 Do you still see quite a lot of stuff 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.720
 Here you have up to eight effects 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.790
 hang around and now it is so 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.950
 usually if you have a panel board 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.220
 has the effects in the order 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.750
 always somehow fixed so you have 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.730
 Of course you always do your forwards 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.010
 was commuting then you maybe do 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.200
 your bike racing after that comes something 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.210
 I know something and and now you want 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.680
 but maybe for a sound 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.770
 order change what you normally do 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.900
 in an analog switcher does not work 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.900
 this is an analogue 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.960
 switcher i can digitally the here 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.050
 order the effect paddles change 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 but that means I have to wire once 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.770
 and then I can choose freely like it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 it looks like that and that is for 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.330
 example of one of the main features yes it 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.510
 Of course there are innumerable 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.240
 switch that you can get so 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.740
 but that is only one function we 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.130
 For example, here below you have 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.830
 can per patch you can the tempo of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.700
 to define a song that is if you 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.970
 For example , he had one with him 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.970
 one 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.420
 So regulation provides either speed 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:08.009
 Let's say face shifter arm what I am 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.899
 Speaker simulation which rotates lap 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.739
 that's all here with pro patch 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.260
 adjustable 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.720
 that means passing the time in the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.050
 me from one song to the other song 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.010
 go downstairs and have my time off 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 to change the echoes 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.580
 I can fix anything here 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.489
 Of course, the thing is also capable 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.010
 to switch different amplifiers 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.040
 so that luca and switcher of course 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.010
 all in one part 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.390
 that is so poor has by roland of boston 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.010
 lukas is never really given 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.390
 economic system you have it 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.400
 applications over there now 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.829
 it also from roland they have it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.630
 we did it and we did 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.340
 Of course we looked at each other and we got together 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.450
 always asked what can you do with such a 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.780
 device really improve and it is like that 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.790
 we just say 85 percent now 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.579
 the question someone has something 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.519
 A loop switcher can be used with 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.739
 answer the first eight with yes so it 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.810
 really goes with the thing extremely much 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.880
 I would like to give you the complete one here now 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.489
 features would enumerate this video 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.799
 about a minimum of two and a half hours 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.840
 yes and the nice thing is it is 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.359
 very easy to do so that is 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.489
 Now many say their okay until I do that 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.739
 have programmed ding yes I'm in 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.350
 But pension is not so 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.989
 It's really easy and you have 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.329
 the chance as well prefabricated 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.799
 For example, we simply patches 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:40.769
 switch off or you switch 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.889
 Just go to the manual mode where he is 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.190
 exactly here single effects on 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.500
 or could switch off so you can do that 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.480
 thing either way use wonderful 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.310
 thing and especially like you now 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.349
 For example, here is the switch 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.669
 Although he has so many features 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.940
 relatively small 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:01.910
 So you will never get that much space 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.570
 take the effect board away 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:10.400
 that's the bossard effect switching 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:13.180
 system footswitch universe footswitch 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.180
 universe
