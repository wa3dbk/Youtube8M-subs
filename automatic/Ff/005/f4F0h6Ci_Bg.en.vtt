a<00:03:15.290> little<00:03:15.470> sentiment<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:21.549> like<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.730> when<00:03:22.880> it's

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
a little sentiment I like that when it's

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.910 
a little sentiment I like that when it's
non<00:03:23.180> traditional<00:03:23.420> colors<00:03:24.080> like<00:03:24.320> like<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
non traditional colors like like the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.120 
non traditional colors like like the
orange<00:03:25.760> II<00:03:25.940> coral<00:03:26.510> color<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.110> teal

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.970 

there's<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.220> gingerbread<00:03:31.670> one<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:36.650> one

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
there's the gingerbread one and this one

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.420

so<00:03:38.080> believe<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.200> made<00:03:39.380> 10<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.070> still<00:03:40.310> have

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
so believe I made 10 and I still have

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.400 
so believe I made 10 and I still have
like<00:03:40.549> 10<00:03:40.910> or<00:03:41.060> 12<00:03:41.090> left<00:03:41.830> so<00:03:43.030> I'm<00:03:44.030> probably<00:03:44.410> gonna

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
like 10 or 12 left so I'm probably gonna

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.050 
like 10 or 12 left so I'm probably gonna
see<00:03:45.890> how<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.040> do<00:03:46.190> with<00:03:46.370> these<00:03:46.489> tomorrow<00:03:46.850> and
