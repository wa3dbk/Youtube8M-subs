00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
to keep making seeds keep making

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.080 
to keep making seeds keep making
children<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.320> if<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.590> already<00:02:57.860> has<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> seed<00:02:58.880> it

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
children and if it already has a seed it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.000 
children and if it already has a seed it

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
feeders yes the only caution I would

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.010 
feeders yes the only caution I would

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
have would be to only use it as a top

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.020 
have would be to only use it as a top
dressing<00:03:18.530> when<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.100> weather<00:03:19.250> gets<00:03:19.490> hot<00:03:19.790> and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
dressing when the weather gets hot and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.820 
dressing when the weather gets hot and
it's<00:03:20.120> down<00:03:20.360> in<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.660> hot<00:03:20.959> wet<00:03:21.200> basket

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
it's down in that hot wet basket

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.490 
it's down in that hot wet basket
sometimes<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.489> can<00:03:22.700> explode<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.260> have

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
sometimes it can explode and you have

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.430 
sometimes it can explode and you have
too<00:03:24.769> much<00:03:24.940> nitrogen<00:03:25.940> all<00:03:26.540> at<00:03:26.690> once<00:03:26.900> yeah<00:03:27.200> and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
too much nitrogen all at once yeah and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.259 
too much nitrogen all at once yeah and
that<00:03:27.530> makes<00:03:27.650> perfect<00:03:27.860> sense<00:03:28.070> now<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.150> do
