00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.000
 welcome state that the chapter of 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.100
 cooking with the great aunt so so 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.540
 now the ingredients of our recipe 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:18.540
 secret chocolate brownie with 28 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 vanilla 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.370
 One and a half 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.920
 of culture that is grams of nuts 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.920
 chopped and 75 grams 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:46.649
 then we will proceed to beat 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.930
 the cream with all possible strength to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:58.309
 that is very well very well beaten here 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:02.539
 we have the cocoa flour and roll up 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.539
 previously followed by the 20 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.530
 and that we take out we carry for what 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.520
 so we can see how it now 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 incorporated the sugar and beat with the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 butter it is very well 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.960
 then let's put the eggs 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.960
 full 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.290
 and without shell please take notes of 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.290
 decals and norman the style of the teacher 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.630
 the same one that he saw but very good style does not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.630
 will be beating the mixture another huevito 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.010
 now let's put 3 teaspoons of 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.010
 vanilla the mixture 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.330
 good the teaspoons that say the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.800
 recipe 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.910
 because we are doubling the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.290
 ingredients because for heavier and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.400
 continuation 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.400
 it empties 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.690
 ah 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.170
 and let's beat them again together with 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.170
 the mixture 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.959
 to beat 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.230
 very well 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.970
 as we can already see our mix 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.100
 is taking a lot of much body volume 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.410
 color smell and shape well 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.410
 and now let's incorporate 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.630
 the ground nuts the most explained 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.490
 with a little bit of flour 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.250
 so that they do not stick to the 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.660
 background 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.660
 now yes here we go 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:29.780
 fine surround way we 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.780
 incorporating the nuts into our mix 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.629
 until finally the study does not 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.629
 it's no use 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.760
 now 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.160
 in the fret previously 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.520
 Oiled and floured, you will go 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.160
 putting the mixture as we can see its 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.900
 consistency is quite cycle is like this 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.640
 that you have to be careful when it comes to 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.640
 go putting it on the fret 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.700
 That works 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.960
 is to connect as the time is very 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.870
 complete 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.300
 as you see excellent we have made some 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.560
 castles really clear that if a 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.560
 design creates wonders 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.240
 we have to heat the oven 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.190
 previously at 175 degrees Celsius and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.800
 approximately approximately 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:50.880
 Commission will last about 30 or 35 minutes 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.330
 now with our miserable knife what 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.550
 who want to make the spatula let's go 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.830
 smearing the whole mixture 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.480
 that we had served option in the 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.480
 Teacher's technique shin chan 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:12.380
 new and improved improved of your student 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.380
 with my technique to record 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.879
 very good now since it's fine 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:28.469
 distributed the paste on the mold the 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.469
 let's put it in the oven 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.490
 as you can see drawing as for a 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.490
 true army 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:50.370
 how it feels is cooking all the 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.370
 really clear day 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.040
 40 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.830
 to wait for the key 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:14.879
 the last step is to melt the chocolate 

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:14.879
 with a little butter in a bain- marie 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.940
 and in this way our partner 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:28.440
 start on your side 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.560
 I could take the pawn and let's go 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.240
 then in small crucitas 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:40.900
 already in this final step 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:44.360
 already at nine o'clock at night and even so 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.900
 We also spent algae 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.900
 i
