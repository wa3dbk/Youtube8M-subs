let's go ahead grab screws and we'll

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:47.000 
let's go ahead grab screws and we'll
lock<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.489> down<00:02:45.200> sorry<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.410> tutorial<00:02:46.920> is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
lock it down sorry this tutorial is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.210 
lock it down sorry this tutorial is
probably<00:02:47.370> taking<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> little<00:02:47.849> longer<00:02:48.120> than

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
probably taking a little longer than

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.640 
probably taking a little longer than
what<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.720> would<00:02:51.720> even<00:02:51.840> probably<00:02:52.230> want<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.500> watch

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
what I would even probably want to watch

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.750 
what I would even probably want to watch
on<00:02:52.920> YouTube<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.959> think<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.080> thoroughness

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
on YouTube but I think the thoroughness

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.400 
on YouTube but I think the thoroughness
in<00:02:56.760> ideas<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.390> time<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:58.049> how<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:59.430> do<00:02:59.580> this

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
in ideas just the time on how to do this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.920 
in ideas just the time on how to do this
how<00:03:01.410> little<00:03:01.650> time<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.010> actually<00:03:02.130> takes<00:03:02.930> it's

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
how little time that actually takes it's

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.680 
how little time that actually takes it's
probably<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.319> good<00:03:04.500> thing

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
probably a good thing

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.830 
probably a good thing
okay<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.870> ECU<00:03:07.410> when<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:07.920> put<00:03:08.099> it<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.720> set<00:03:09.720> it

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
okay the ECU when you put it on set it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.740 
okay the ECU when you put it on set it
in<00:03:09.989> drop<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.010> there<00:03:11.390> everything<00:03:12.390> should

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
in drop it in there everything should

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.620 
in drop it in there everything should
line<00:03:12.930> up<00:03:12.989> alright<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:14.730> black<00:03:14.970> plug<00:03:15.239> goes<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
line up alright the black plug goes the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.479 
line up alright the black plug goes the
black<00:03:15.840> plug<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.349> gray<00:03:16.500> plug<00:03:16.830> goes<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.310> gray

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
black plug the gray plug goes the gray

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.089 
black plug the gray plug goes the gray
plug<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.750> can't<00:03:18.959> figure<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.620> out<00:03:19.769> I

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
plug you can't figure that out I

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.660 
plug you can't figure that out I
don't<00:03:20.910> tell<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.360> maybe<00:03:21.630> you<00:03:21.780> just<00:03:21.959> hang<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.290> up

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
don't tell you maybe you just hang it up

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.800 
don't tell you maybe you just hang it up
of<00:03:23.670> course<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> know<00:03:24.239> I'm<00:03:24.329> probably<00:03:24.510> have<00:03:24.750> a

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
of course you know I'm probably have a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.289 
of course you know I'm probably have a
bitchin<00:03:25.140> time<00:03:25.820> talk<00:03:29.090> okay

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
bitchin time talk okay

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.160 
bitchin time talk okay
so<00:03:31.079> when<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.350> get<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.130> them<00:03:32.250> pushed<00:03:32.459> on

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
so when you get you get them pushed on

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.470 
so when you get you get them pushed on
and<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.260> locks<00:03:34.530> itself<00:03:34.769> down<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:36.299> it's

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
and it locks itself down so now it's

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.210 
and it locks itself down so now it's
good<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.720> go<00:03:37.250> put<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> cage<00:03:38.519> on<00:03:38.760> top<00:03:43.010> I'll<00:03:44.010> grab

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
good to go put the cage on top I'll grab

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220 
good to go put the cage on top I'll grab
