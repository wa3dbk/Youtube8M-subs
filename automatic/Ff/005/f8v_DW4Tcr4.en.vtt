I have mine adjusted as you can see the
way<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.279> works<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.910> these<00:00:06.240> are<00:00:06.270> raked<00:00:06.930> in

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
way this works is these are raked in

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.780 
way this works is these are raked in
they<00:00:09.120> tilt<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.769> when<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.099> push<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.550> towards

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
they tilt in so when you push it towards

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.950 
they tilt in so when you push it towards
the<00:00:11.849> fun<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.240> long<00:00:12.360> as<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.540> have<00:00:12.660> your<00:00:12.690> phone

up<00:00:13.290> against<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> back<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.940> traps<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.750> there

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
up against the back it traps it in there

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.560 
up against the back it traps it in there
they're<00:00:17.160> not<00:00:17.310> just<00:00:17.550> they<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:17.910> don't<00:00:18.300> stick

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
they're not just they just don't stick

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.170 
they're not just they just don't stick
straight<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> traps<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.609> back<00:00:20.789> towards

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
