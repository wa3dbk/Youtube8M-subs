00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello together as you can see I have 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.960
 my hair in a beautiful time 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.580
 gradient in many shades of blue tinted 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.110
 and if you are interested in me like that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.880
 have made and we imitate the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.719
 then just have a look 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.549
 video on 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.859
 I have a lot of nice new ones again 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.810
 extension of the coupé passion gets that 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.460
 But the thicker ones I need 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 but not here now 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.740
 elderly and those are the thinner the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.090
 are now 55 cm and I'm white 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.160
 not how much grams do you have on each one 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.579
 case, the thinner ones are 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 Pastor Wißmann is a bit difficult 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.989
 Personally, I find it quite annoying 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.219
 to apply because now with the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.800
 extensions I have this extreme 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 tipped over because that's just stopping with the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.059
 extensions are applied, so to speak 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.010
 becomes extremely annoying and out of time 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.539
 not so easy and it will 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.829
 guaranteed dope pure without giving 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.210
 that's why I'm back as t 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.000
 shirt and everything only times 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.219
 bit of business with newspapers on the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.020
 ground and so on but it does not work 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.690
 Otherwise, that's different if you are 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.859
 now rausholen the separate from then 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.439
 most likely will not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.540
 evenly and that's why it can 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.740
 it is also that now because they are so 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.900
 thick are not in some places 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 then I will accept that 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.000
 later take out again and then the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.189
 put where a little color is missing 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.380
 then follow up again 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 I'll start with lagoon blue on that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.070
 brightest blue to the directions too 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.299
 I have seen there now I see 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.530
 not here because I'm still here 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.810
 a bit after had mixed but 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.000
 I have about one here now 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.759
 three-quarter dose made pure and have 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.600
 then 200 ml bottle rinsing with added 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.680
 Given that it is stretched something 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.270
 then I have the right here again 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.670
 second brightest do mixed together and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.159
 Although the Atlantic blue is the same amount 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.030
 same amount of rinse as lagoon 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.040
 blue mixed 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.079
 I would always color gradients here 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 recommend the top with the lighter tone 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.240
 to start because if you're up now 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 darker it can be natural and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.719
 wise it is very likely that 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.369
 this dark color from above long the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.890
 peaks and the lighter peaks 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.280
 then almost darker with 1 sounds and 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.619
 That's why I would always be up there 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.259
 start brighter color no matter what color 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.550
 you take it because it is just safer 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.290
 and just because I'm still here with 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.540
 Boni will work and agony very much 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.819
 strong says once again blood is the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.860
 risk here especially attractive though 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.630
 now just on the complete top of the head 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.340
 try that as well as possible 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.200
 to make between the extensions and 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.120
 the extensions in the upper part with a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.760
 Title so I just stop afterwards 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.010
 can see exactly where the course begins 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.650
 so that I the back leg extensions well 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.870
 a sound can and that is easy 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.390
 becomes uniform and not so I send 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.220
 But afterwards it just looks like that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.260
 afterwards looks exactly at the extensions 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.360
 where was the transition to your own 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.420
 That's why I paint it that way now 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.250
 reasonably with in the extensions purely 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.319
 and then do it separately later 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.330
 Again , I have the here 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.130
 Extensions rausgeholt can now quasi 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.350
 the places where the extensions straight 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.060
 have sat right again 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.519
 otherwise it would be stained if 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.709
 you do not do that and the extensions 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.600
 verdi go again later separately 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.380
 I am doing my hanging here now 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.420
 about three quarters of my hair length 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.360
 lagoon blue the tips I leave now 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.790
 something is not so bad when the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.950
 also a tinted but that one 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.070
 later just the second color in the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.350
 can make tips 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.000
 then you should pay attention to it 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.040
 Now I give the second color take 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.930
 i mix the atlantic blue in just 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.760
 These tips that I just left out 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.200
 then I have to delete it 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.650
 that would be a little bit more 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.600
 in the other in the other colors with 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.220
 purely so that the course just liquid 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.230
 will be there super afterwards 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.049
 with water for a while 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.570
 then it sprays very easily into the 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.510
 Rub in lengths that the color gradient 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.370
 really very fluent if you want that 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.989
 would not do it then 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.459
 it probably pretty choppy 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.359
 look so small tip so I do 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.100
 it always 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.530
 and yes that was just on now 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.640
 complete everything once in the head 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.109
 give a tip and easily a camp as 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.820
 Next are the extensions on it one man 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.530
 looks up here already clearly where 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.690
 i just applied the lab office 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.810
 just have the second here after now 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.780
 that is, that color 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.549
 because big blue in the middle and stripes 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.919
 then just a little bit in that 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.270
 upper lagoon blue one if that is not so 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.680
 By the way, you could do that evenly 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.280
 above again after tones 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.660
 because now the third color I have 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.270
 have me here now for this 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.800
 decided inanny and midnight blue and 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.660
 have simply mixed together because 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.490
 but never alone would be too dark now 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.050
 and with ner clou who is still mine 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.700
 Helping a little now stretches that 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.200
 Just know this in the tips 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.580
 a little bit and then expels that 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.530
 it really looks like this again 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.700
 already a finished extensions that the 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.310
 Gradient really pretty 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.470
 If necessary, you can, however, be liquid 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.910
 really after washing out again 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.020
 look if it is not quite so fluid 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.510
 is it possible to rework then 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.790
 That can happen, you just have to 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.620
 look but that is actually how it works 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.600
 pretty good, I know that then 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.430
 still a bit, and then 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.169
 That actually fits what I am here now 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.450
 I'm still a bit awake at the end 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.550
 spray water on the extensions because 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.590
 simply water is a carrier 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 straight with the directions then stroking 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.770
 Just a little bit more 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.580
 if necessary, again in one another 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.870
 other colors a bit after that sound 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.070
 Result I hope you realize that 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.479
 now reasonably so here again 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.950
 dark as far as I can tell 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.380
 but you definitely see it 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.729
 here, if and after, darker 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.340
 but will be a few anyway 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.110
 photos think on facebook and i think 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.669
 on my blog too then to the video 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.440
 this because I had the link to the 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.180
 blogpost in the description network is 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.800
 I can not recognize it so well now 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.510
 I have extensions with you quite normal 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.139
 cold water without shampoo or so it 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.610
 washed out then just open 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.780
 curler turned and now I have 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.490
 which just a bit loose I have 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.669
 my own we still a bit with 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.020
 made curly and yes I had now 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.930
 simply times that then is yes leaf 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.889
 also a bit of a run yes that was it 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.539
 actually already I link you 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.000
 Of course, exactly all colors I 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.080
 used where are the extensions 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.479
 I will definitely be guaranteed too 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.860
 asked again long lipstick yes that 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.360
 I just find everything in the video 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.910
 description so all play me 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.250
 part 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.090
 yes that it was actually already so 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.530
 far as her pretty if you this 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.820
 you liked video then you can 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.290
 of course, shared post Daume 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.150
 still have any questions will become 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.340
 forgot to answer something 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.750
 can just ask so that it takes in 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.570
 the comments then I answer that 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.160
 again later and what can I do 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.570
 still say oh so yes you can one 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.580
 like to subscribe to the channel if you generally 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.860
 then you are interested in such videos 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.320
 yes my last two videos are not 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.210
 forgot that was once the video too 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.560
 this red of directions like that 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.960
 washed up and so on 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.940
 I had last time was red because 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.460
 Of course I filmed again and 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.810
 the best the japan-day video my god 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.640
 I have not done videos for ages 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.160
 You can tell that were the last 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.330
 both videos and yes as I said if you 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.770
 if you have any questions just write 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.270
 in the comments and then we'll see each other 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.270
 soon it will be good again
