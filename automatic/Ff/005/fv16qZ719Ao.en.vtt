00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:09.330
 Good day, it's Elena Terekhova today 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.099
 September 30th I dug up flowers 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:19.119
 Mirabilis is their roots that we need 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:24.930
 will correctly trim and put on 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:28.470
 keeping the air temperature at night 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.469
 pretty lowered only 25 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.399
 degrees + don't wait 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:37.960
 frosts so that they do not grab the roots 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.699
 pretty gentle so better 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.429
 dig up 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:47.409
 see them yourself in advance where you are 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:50.799
 live and weather if the children and decide 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.859
 when you better dig but better not 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:56.229
 be late so say better early 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.589
 dig them up like I told you 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.549
 looks like these black carrot flowers have 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:06.580
 i have been acquired last season 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:09.400
 of course they were smaller in two seasons 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.310
 they have grown very well especially in 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.240
 this season have gained strength juicy big 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.630
 become 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.490
 and go to storage means we are pruning 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.650
 The main flowers I already cut the abbot can 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 here left here just to show the most 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.490
 small 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.960
 the main one I have already cut off a 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.340
 now you just cut it shorter 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:40.229
 we take shears 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:47.619
 you cut all all these bores here 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:51.399
 that's about as well so we cut off 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:56.130
 these big ones also prune everything in principle 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:02:02.729
 like dahlia can say cropping goes 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.729
 so here we cut off everything 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:21.480
 then they dry up these tails themselves 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:25.530
 by falling off the right place and that's it 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.640
 cut then lay to dry 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 dry and literally I would say 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.540
 even like gladiolus they can be stored 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.780
 I kept anyway 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.530
 apartment room in the box to 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.360
 cardboard somewhere 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.000
 cozy place short on and children 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.630
 maybe someone dry good 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 basement 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.090
 so you can save in the basement with nothing 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.920
 I didnâ€™t sprinkle anything literally 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.140
 I myself kept for the first time 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:08.580
 we are my experience and have been beautifully preserved 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:14.010
 just cut and dry everything 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:18.030
 and next year in spring in these places 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.590
 small dots of sprouts will appear and 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.190
 when, as I said, the weather will allow 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:30.480
 you are beautiful and you will be planted in the ground 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:36.260
 wait for the flowers 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:40.290
 mirabilis wish you all success 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.730
 now something very blooming here 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.730
 sage lunch is light 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.060
 chard parsley we have here in the garden 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:56.760

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.520
 second time because and a flowers 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.890

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.510

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.810

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:43.020

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:47.260
 we collect dried and the next year 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:51.760
 we sow and it turns out we have excellent 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:57.700
 flowers here they are yellowish and different 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:06.120
 colors and burgundy red all sorts 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:06.120
