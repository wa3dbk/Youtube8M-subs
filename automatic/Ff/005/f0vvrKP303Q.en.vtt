00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.820
 I want to tell you what I need 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.679
 independent expertise and when its better 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.889
 spend 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.599
 mean today exists 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.130
 uniform approved method 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.230
 central bank and according to this method 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.310
 if you conduct an examination in any 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.599
 organizations 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.779
 accordingly which produces 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.690
 must be the same result 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:37.200
 however, our practice shows that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.840
 Unfortunately , I was examined 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.420
 insurance company expertise carried out 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.270
 and in a motoring community 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.370
 may be different at times 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.890
 What does this mean first? 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.559
 primarily due to the quality of inspection 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 car what does it mean often 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.010
 victims to appeal 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 insurance company comes to the branch 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.229
 writes a statement in the same place goes some 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.310
 expert 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.000
 accredited insurance company 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.229
 means and inspects the car as a rule 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 there are always hidden cars 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.460
 damage expert go out examines 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.229
 describe external damage and on this 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.650
 everything ends in a result through 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.689
 month you get about the money which 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.930
 absolutely inadequate to the repair 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.140
 which you have to do secondly 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 Is it reasonable to evaluate your 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.920
 damaged property in the insurance 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.710
 which is directly interested in paying 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.610
 yes that is 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 commercial insurance company 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.600
 organization that's it on this 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.649
 making money naturally we donâ€™t 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.840
 interested in you pay the golden mountains and 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.939
 we are talking about some kind of indirect 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.369
 possible interest of experts 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.890
 who are considered in the offices of insurance 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.530
 companies to be something 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.340
 don't notice miss something in 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.430
 the result is a huge difference 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.460
 third third is low qualification 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.590
 experts 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.840
 can say that those experts in 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.330
 quotes that inspect cars 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.910
 bring their insurance companies you can their 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.260
 conditionally call photographers 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.760
 why because 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.080
 As a rule, these people work in this 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.510
 industry half a year and and has not 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.480
 no special education in this 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.940
 areas so picked up you came out with 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.980
 something clicked on the camera afterwards 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.500
 these documents are received by the billing department 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.860
 as a result you get understated 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.300
 payouts in the fourth is very important 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.830
 instrumental control 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.960
 many knots and details of the car 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.290
 it is impossible to establish their damage 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.450
 business without applying any 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.100
 of some instrumental control that 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.410
 it means this is some kind of diagnosis 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.010
 geometric measurement electronics 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.230
 parameters of the openings of the car this 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.600
 everything can be done only in conditions 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.480
 stations and naturally impossible to do 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.120
 about an hour for an insurance company one of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.560
 important factors that affect 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.500
 the amount of damage calculated is 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.510
 software on which she 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.900
 computed we are official 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.340
 users of the software product 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.980
 which comes directly from 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.480
 manufacturers here on this 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.890
 software we can 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.049
 take into account every little thing every strip 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.450
 every bug of your car which 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.360
 needs to be changed in 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.330
 the result inflicted on your car 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.069
 damage if the company which 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.299
 conducts expertise has no such 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.390
 software 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.010
 she just wonâ€™t take these details into account 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.370
 the result can be pretty 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.230
 still a significant amount of your repairs, I 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.940
 I recommend to conduct independently 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.079
 expertise we have before visiting 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.769
 insurance company since we are the first 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.720
 will spend 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.600
 inspection of your car in terms of 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.199
 we will take into account every little thing 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.940
 objectively evaluate your car 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.680
 damage to your car and you even before 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.860
 Insurance company visits will be 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.370
 know how much money she owes you 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.370
 pay
