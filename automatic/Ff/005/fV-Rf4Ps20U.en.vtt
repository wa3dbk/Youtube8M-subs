elevator now that was a full throttle
loop<00:02:06.540> another<00:02:07.020> way<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.260> do<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.650> once<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> get

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
loop another way to do is once you get

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.660 
loop another way to do is once you get
halfway<00:02:08.399> drop<00:02:09.330> your<00:02:09.539> throttle<00:02:10.370> bring<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.490> back

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
halfway drop your throttle bring it back

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.030 
halfway drop your throttle bring it back

back there we go a little lumpy aircraft

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.750 
back there we go a little lumpy aircraft
and<00:02:26.370> pilots

the next maneuver i'm going to show you
is<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> more<00:03:13.569> difficult<00:03:13.750> one<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.620> inverted

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
is a more difficult one it is inverted

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.990 
is a more difficult one it is inverted
flight<00:03:16.349> you<00:03:17.349> should<00:03:17.620> have<00:03:17.950> all<00:03:18.430> your<00:03:18.640> turns

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
flight you should have all your turns

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.630 
flight you should have all your turns
and<00:03:19.450> normal<00:03:19.930> flight<00:03:20.230> completely<00:03:21.129> mastered

and normal flight completely mastered

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.270 
and normal flight completely mastered
before<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.120> really<00:03:22.360> try<00:03:22.599> to<00:03:22.629> this<00:03:23.280> unless

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
before you really try to this unless

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.979 
before you really try to this unless
you're<00:03:24.489> really<00:03:24.640> high<00:03:24.909> altitude<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.689> doing<00:03:25.900> it

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
you're really high altitude and doing it

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.559 
you're really high altitude and doing it
for<00:03:26.200> short<00:03:26.680> periods<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:27.069> time<00:03:27.220> but<00:03:28.090> I'm<00:03:28.390> going

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
for short periods of time but I'm going

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.470 
for short periods of time but I'm going
to<00:03:28.629> show<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.840> how<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.140> do<00:03:29.349> full<00:03:29.620> inverted<00:03:30.099> plug

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
to show you how to do full inverted plug

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.589 
to show you how to do full inverted plug
we're<00:03:31.480> going<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.659> come<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:36.150> we're<00:03:37.150> going<00:03:37.329> to<00:03:37.390> do

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
we're going to come up we're going to do

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.869 
we're going to come up we're going to do
a<00:03:37.629> half<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.260> better<00:03:38.500> role<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:39.040> invert<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.400> go

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
a half a better role to invert it go

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.839 
a half a better role to invert it go
immediately<00:03:40.239> on<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.109> up<00:03:41.200> elevator<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:42.670> can

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
immediately on the up elevator you can

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.599 
immediately on the up elevator you can
see<00:03:43.090> them<00:03:43.379> staying<00:03:44.379> high<00:03:45.069> on<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.400> elevator

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
see them staying high on the elevator

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.660 
see them staying high on the elevator
and<00:03:45.909> high<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.359> speed<00:03:46.690> because<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:48.489> is

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
and high on speed because this is

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.009 
and high on speed because this is
definitely<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.120> speed<00:03:49.389> maneuver<00:03:49.840> with<00:03:49.989> a

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
definitely a speed maneuver with a

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.740 
definitely a speed maneuver with a
trainer<00:03:50.319> plane<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.940> then<00:03:51.940> other<00:03:52.510> than<00:03:52.540> that

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
trainer plane and then other than that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.270 
trainer plane and then other than that
you're<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.049> trying<00:03:53.349> to<00:03:53.440> keep<00:03:53.590> level<00:03:53.950> links

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
you're just trying to keep level links

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.420 
you're just trying to keep level links
then<00:03:54.879> when<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:55.120> make<00:03:55.299> your<00:03:55.329> turn<00:03:55.689> to<00:03:56.650> roll<00:03:57.010> and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
then when you make your turn to roll and

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.839 
then when you make your turn to roll and
push<00:03:58.150> instead<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.959> roll<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.560> cold<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.639> you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
push instead a roll and cold but you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.770 
push instead a roll and cold but you
would<00:04:01.060> want<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.989> normal<00:04:02.170> turn

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
would want a normal turn

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.050 
would want a normal turn
so<00:04:04.380> you're<00:04:04.590> throwing<00:04:05.010> in<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.430> little<00:04:05.610> bit<00:04:05.940> of

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
so you're throwing in a little bit of

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.380 
so you're throwing in a little bit of
leftover<00:04:06.510> beer<00:04:06.800> lots<00:04:07.800> of<00:04:08.130> up<00:04:08.250> an<00:04:08.430> elevator<00:04:08.790> and

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
leftover beer lots of up an elevator and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.830 
leftover beer lots of up an elevator and
coming<00:04:09.750> around<00:04:10.010> okay<00:04:11.540> that's<00:04:12.540> why<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:12.750> need

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
coming around okay that's why you need

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
coming around okay that's why you need
lots

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.130 

this<00:04:16.860> plays<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> little<00:04:17.820> bit<00:04:18.000> underpowered<00:04:18.330> for

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
this plays a little bit underpowered for

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.390 
this plays a little bit underpowered for
doing<00:04:19.530> real<00:04:20.220> good<00:04:20.730> inverted<00:04:21.510> flight<00:04:22.160> but<00:04:23.160> it

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
doing real good inverted flight but it

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.080 
doing real good inverted flight but it
will<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.060> and<00:04:24.300> if<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:24.990> practice<00:04:26.090> it's

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
will do it and if you practice it's

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.140 
will do it and if you practice it's
really<00:04:27.720> not<00:04:27.870> too<00:04:28.170> difficult<00:04:29.000> one<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.090> my

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
and things that I'm going to be showing

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.059 
and things that I'm going to be showing
you<00:05:19.360> with<00:05:20.020> some<00:05:20.169> of<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.380> other<00:05:20.410> aircraft

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
you with some of the other aircraft

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.570 
you with some of the other aircraft
we're<00:05:21.400> going<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.669> go<00:05:21.789> to<00:05:21.819> another<00:05:22.300> plane<00:05:23.580> all

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
we're going to go to another plane all

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.460 
we're going to go to another plane all
right<00:05:24.699> we<00:05:24.819> got<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:24.970> S<00:05:25.180> plane<00:05:25.449> here<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.080> I'm

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
right we got the S plane here and I'm

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.499 
right we got the S plane here and I'm
going<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.860> teach<00:05:27.160> you<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.400> few<00:05:27.490> maneuvers<00:05:27.970> like

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
for split s turn you just want to get

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.120 
for split s turn you just want to get
playing<00:05:39.350> myself<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:41.320> get<00:05:42.320> up<00:05:42.470> bring<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:42.830> in<00:05:43.010> to

and bring it back to you and that's a

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.230 
and bring it back to you and that's a
slattern

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.300 

alright<00:06:23.990> next<00:06:24.169> I'm<00:06:24.590> going<00:06:24.740> to<00:06:24.800> show<00:06:24.949> you<00:06:25.009> an

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
alright next I'm going to show you an

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.580 
alright next I'm going to show you an
outside<00:06:25.759> loop

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.130 

outside<00:06:29.590> you<00:06:30.060> and<00:06:31.060> just<00:06:31.330> like<00:06:31.510> a<00:06:31.540> normal<00:06:31.780> loop

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
outside you and just like a normal loop

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.960 
outside you and just like a normal loop
and<00:06:32.380> pull<00:06:32.440> straight<00:06:32.770> back<00:06:34.320> but<00:06:35.320> instead<00:06:35.970> we're

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
and pull straight back but instead we're

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.480 
and pull straight back but instead we're
going<00:06:37.000> to<00:06:37.210> push<00:06:37.450> straight<00:06:38.080> forward<00:06:38.560> from

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
going to push straight forward from

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:47.400 
going to push straight forward from
outside<00:06:39.940> the<00:06:43.320> plane<00:06:44.320> goes<00:06:44.530> around<00:06:44.890> and<00:06:46.200> as<00:06:47.200> you

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
outside the plane goes around and as you

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.200 
outside the plane goes around and as you
move<00:06:47.560> back<00:06:47.830> in<00:06:48.040> the<00:06:48.100> level<00:06:48.400> flight<00:06:48.610> come<00:06:49.000> back

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
move back in the level flight come back

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.659 
move back in the level flight come back
around<00:06:49.390> cutting<00:06:49.810> up<00:06:50.050> more<00:06:50.260> times<00:06:51.240> come<00:06:52.240> across

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:06.010 

straight<00:06:57.669> down

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.680 

I<00:07:06.080> suggest<00:07:07.039> having<00:07:07.310> lots<00:07:07.910> and<00:07:08.300> lots<00:07:08.509> of

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
I suggest having lots and lots of

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.260 
I suggest having lots and lots of
altitude<00:07:09.259> with<00:07:09.530> an<00:07:09.680> outside<00:07:10.039> loop<00:07:10.280> look<00:07:10.970> I

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
altitude with an outside loop look I

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.450 
altitude with an outside loop look I
just<00:07:12.139> hit<00:07:12.440> the<00:07:12.560> building<00:07:12.770> I<00:07:13.009> don't<00:07:13.160> think<00:07:13.340> the

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
just hit the building I don't think the

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.029 
just hit the building I don't think the
real<00:07:13.580> plan<00:07:13.819> to<00:07:13.970> do<00:07:14.090> that<00:07:14.560> alright<00:07:15.560> guys<00:07:15.740> that

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 
real plan to do that alright guys that

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.189 
real plan to do that alright guys that
concludes<00:07:16.430> basic<00:07:17.090> flight<00:07:17.300> maneuvers<00:07:17.840> i<00:07:18.050> hope

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 
concludes basic flight maneuvers i hope

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.930 
concludes basic flight maneuvers i hope
this<00:07:18.349> video<00:07:18.530> showed<00:07:18.949> a<00:07:18.979> few<00:07:19.250> you<00:07:19.460> guys<00:07:19.669> how<00:07:19.909> to

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
this video showed a few you guys how to

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.309 
this video showed a few you guys how to
do<00:07:20.150> a<00:07:20.180> few<00:07:20.389> things<00:07:20.479> that<00:07:20.840> you<00:07:20.870> didn't<00:07:21.110> know<00:07:21.199> how

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:21.319 
do a few things that you didn't know how

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:23.499 
do a few things that you didn't know how
to<00:07:21.409> do<00:07:21.620> and<00:07:21.919> then<00:07:22.639> almost<00:07:22.849> you<00:07:23.180> out<00:07:23.330> there

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:23.509 
to do and then almost you out there

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:25.450 
to do and then almost you out there
probably<00:07:23.810> know<00:07:23.960> how<00:07:24.650> to<00:07:24.710> do<00:07:24.949> most<00:07:25.159> of<00:07:25.340> these

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.460 
probably know how to do most of these

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.860 
probably know how to do most of these
maneuvers<00:07:25.849> but<00:07:26.060> I<00:07:26.090> figure<00:07:26.389> it<00:07:26.479> doesn't<00:07:26.780> hurt

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
maneuvers but I figure it doesn't hurt

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.860 
maneuvers but I figure it doesn't hurt
to<00:07:26.930> help<00:07:27.430> those<00:07:28.430> that<00:07:28.460> don't<00:07:28.849> so<00:07:29.180> thanks<00:07:29.750> for
