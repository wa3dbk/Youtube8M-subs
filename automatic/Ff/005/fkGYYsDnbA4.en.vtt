00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to get my edges and a better state now

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.250 
to get my edges and a better state now
there<00:00:41.309> are<00:00:41.430> several<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.390> causes<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
there are several things that causes it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.069 
there are several things that causes it
just<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.040> man<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.670> mean<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.450> front<00:00:45.780> part

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just like man just I mean the front part

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.040 
just like man just I mean the front part
of<00:00:46.140> your<00:00:46.200> hair<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:47.120> around<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.360> temple<00:00:48.780> area

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

areas<00:00:54.239> they're<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:54.809> sensitive<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.590> very

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
areas they're very sensitive and very

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.060 
areas they're very sensitive and very
easy<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.370> break<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.770> didn't

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
easy to break and I really didn't

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.510 
easy to break and I really didn't
realize<00:00:59.550> what<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.390> was<00:01:00.750> doing<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:02.370> was

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
realize what I was doing was what was

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.359 
realize what I was doing was what was
causing<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:03.239> edges<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.840> break<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> very

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
causing my edges to break so the very

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.250 
causing my edges to break so the very

and figuring out exactly what you're
doing<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.290> hair<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.740> cause<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.939> edges
