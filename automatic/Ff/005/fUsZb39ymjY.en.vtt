 some news what has happened in 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.559
 the world of technology during this 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.559
 week we go to the video 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.210
 we go with the first news and it's goal what 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.570
 who has just presented his new camera 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.509
 for extreme sports he checked 46 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.820
 jones this camera differs from the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.000
 others the company checked has a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.949
 different design is a cube shape and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.680
 The specifications are as follows 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.510
 First one will be able to dip 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.820
 This camera up to 10 meters 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.079
 depth and I will eject the liquid 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 once you take out the water in 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.480
 question of a second is also a 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.980
 membrane very similar to the one we 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.989
 we have in our ear that is going to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.899
 protect the parties that can not 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 getting wet has a double microphone that goes 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.910
 to have the ability to identify which 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.600
 is the main sound and the one that is 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.190
 saturated will try to reduce it and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.380
 for example if you are in 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.000
 motorcycle or are talking about a lot 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.830
 wind automatically the camera goes to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.050
 recognize which one is the main one and goes to 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.390
 eliminate noise like for example the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.179
 of the wind and a battery that is not 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.130
 removable is one thousand 30,000 amps is 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.960
 able to record 1080p videos at 60 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.890
 frames per second and going to be able 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.010
 8 megapixel images its weight is of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.220
 74 grams and checked to submit two 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.260
 alternatives of this model it is said that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.990
 bought has announced that they have been 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.050
 working on this new model for more 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.180
 or less three years we go with the second 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.550
 news but this is already a rumor and it is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.330
 something that until now I do not understand and is the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.310
 number of models that samsung takes to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.580
 market for different segments of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990
 true but now I have left and I'm going to 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.090
 leave the link you already know under this video in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:04.170
 the fiction area a also from the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.030
 galaxy s 6 splash so they want to take out 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.860
 a slightly larger design now not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.989
 there is nothing official is true on the part of 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.300
 samsung but possibly already 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.519
 some damage began to come out of this 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.130
 product is because anyway it's going to 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.709
 present something soon may be 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.290
 in the month of September and not even but 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.430
 some images are coming too 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.319
 of is 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.349
 the new product that is expected this 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.819
 new products product for whom 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.420
 will go to markets and that has the 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.189
 galaxy note 4 in the galaxy note 5 the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.370
 galaxy note 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.079
 edge steam for whom it is intended 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.819
 I have an idea, I would like to know what you think 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.450
 you are that samsung launches a new 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.060
 model of the galaxy s 6 and in this case the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.430
 plan we go with the third news and 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.709
 these about op frames unfortunately not 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.450
 it's very positive then to see them has 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.329
 acquired the cell division 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.040
 intelligent nokia has not gone very 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.750
 well that they bagged more or less more 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.680
 of five billion dollars and up 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.829
 the date have not seen any return of 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.489
 that investment have therefore decided 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:14.340
 in this case the desire of microsoft 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.010
 make a layoff of eight thousand people or 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.010
 almost eight thousand people from the division of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.530
 smart phones to be able to 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.370
 least try to balance the situation 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.440
 that at the moment they are 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.970
 find you have entered late certain 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.040
 possibly he has left me wrong his letters 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.480
 and now they are suffering 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.110
 consequences let's hope things 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.580
 improve for microsoft in the division of 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.099
 cellular because in what software 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.980
 we know that they are doing very well with the 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.940
 fourth news and are the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.069

 well equipped and here I give you the 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.319
 specifications we are talking about that 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.110

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.160
 operative android 5.1 lollipop me but to 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.250

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.850
 in the case of seom 1,005 plus the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.320
 specifications would be the following 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:43.620
 a 4-inch 5.7-inch screen with 2.5 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.570
 curved screen on the edges what 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.789
 I have the teacher gorilla glass 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.220
 has a qualcomm snapdragon 820 the 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.770

 12 megapixel front camera something 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.630
 that has not been seen in the filtering but 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.940
 if it's been rumored is that one of 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.800
 these two devices would bring the reader 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.750
 Fingerprint is already being seen 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.150
 a lot in the mobile leaders on 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.740
 all those of low value that come 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.870
 of the Chinese and they are including the reader 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.600
 of fingerprint so it would seem to us 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.570
 a little weird that man did not include 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.639
 this reader in one of these two 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.090

 talking about ceo 25 would be 389 dollars 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.600
 but they're just rumors let's see 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.700
 how much 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.720
 it will cost this cell once 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.850
 go to the market 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.910

 specifications we are talking about that 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.680

 5.1 logical this new model has 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:16.440
 practically the same design of lg g4 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.170
 just that it's going to be a little smaller and 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.480
 with smaller specifications you're going to 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.060
