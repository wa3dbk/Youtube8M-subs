better<00:04:11.519> at<00:04:12.359> least<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.690> this<00:04:12.810> area<00:04:13.109> here<00:04:13.320> in

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
better at least in this area here in

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.180 
better at least in this area here in
this<00:04:13.530> area<00:04:13.799> here

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
this area here

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.460 
this area here
and<00:04:14.519> my<00:04:14.790> Garmin<00:04:15.150> watch<00:04:15.299> my<00:04:15.810> Garmin<00:04:16.199> actually

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
split right here the band came off and I

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.370 
split right here the band came off and I
had<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.410> send<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.680> back<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:19.859> get<00:04:20.070> replaced<00:04:21.380> so

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
had to send it back and get replaced so

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.840 
had to send it back and get replaced so
I'm<00:04:22.530> really<00:04:22.800> excited<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.310> see<00:04:23.490> how<00:04:23.610> well<00:04:23.759> this

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
I'm really excited to see how well this

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.990 
I'm really excited to see how well this
works<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.720> just<00:04:24.750> lock<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.229> up<00:04:25.759> so<00:04:26.759> it's<00:04:26.880> got

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
works and just lock this up so it's got

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.879 
works and just lock this up so it's got
a<00:04:27.030> nicely<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.419> know<00:04:27.479> heavy<00:04:27.720> duty<00:04:28.020> buckle<00:04:28.350> and

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889
