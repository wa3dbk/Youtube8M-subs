00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.880
 hi jose make a chicken 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.880
 It has very good in the pot 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.040
 we have here 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.060
 four worlds 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 A) Yes 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.660
 that's not good 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.460
 for life 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.899
 it's seven 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.899
 but half time 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.460
 and now in the morning I take it out 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.460
 we charge it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.410
 or the potatoes 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:07.280
 all right 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:08.780
 until that oil here could be 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.990
 remove 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.330
 but only to avoid because we need 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.330
 play the part if so 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.759
 and then the plate will be removed 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.040
 the meat feels better when it has 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.010
 eaten as veal cover it on the plate 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.220
 once cooked 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.640
 but the meat is very dry 4 potatoes 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640
 medium 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.890
 already big the short of the works 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.350
 tomatoes to quarters 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 but I think it's very good 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.950
 if we draw 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.930
 that is, those that have those that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.930
 you want and I'll put more procedural 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.239
 where the truth 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.900
 a little concentrated broth 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.890
 without tears 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.760
 to carry in these dreams 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.380
 so that when it reaches the average 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.380
 I have the food ready 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.380
 before 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.270
 and watch time you are watching what 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.270
 it takes 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.700
 one 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.480
 here 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.690
 and now 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.540
 and it's made with the same chicken fat 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.069
 I'm going to release them next to you 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.540
 its juice and then it will cook everything there 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:52.290
 and I tell you, nothing more is missing 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.290
 Well, now 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.540
 We are going to schedule you 4 minutes 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.690
 we close the valve 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.740
 and if it's 7 o'clock 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.810
 and I come 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.810
 the average is six and a half hours 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.910
 then we will take and put 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.500
 at lunchtime here 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.500
 and we leave the video there is gravel 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.260
 true 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.529
 I'm that kind of nature 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.120
 for the hand 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:57.470
 ok there are six and a half then now 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.470
 I want is good chicken 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:03.379
 it's good now we're not going to put it as 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.379
 of a lot of chicken 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.139
 30 minutes if it was one more half or 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.409
 less or if it were support only if 25 but 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.000
 tell you to bring the big potatoes 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:20.129
 then you have to do everything 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.959
 Well, now you have to start discounting 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.330
 and when I arrive I will speak through 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:26.129
 the chick made proof this recipe 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.709
 because the truth is simple and you see 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.039

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:31.039
