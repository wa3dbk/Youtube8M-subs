these rockets this is at the end of the
Big<00:00:19.490> Bang<00:00:19.520> Theory<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.450> last<00:00:20.660> step<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.050> to

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
Big Bang Theory the last step is to

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.920 
Big Bang Theory the last step is to
throw<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.920> gersh<00:00:22.130> device<00:00:22.580> I<00:00:22.939> get<00:00:23.779> that<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
throw the gersh device I get that a

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.900 
throw the gersh device I get that a
little<00:00:24.050> leg<00:00:24.320> or<00:00:24.619> focusing<00:00:25.220> stone<00:00:25.460> or<00:00:25.640> whatever

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
little leg or focusing stone or whatever

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.510 
little leg or focusing stone or whatever
to<00:00:26.090> go<00:00:26.210> up<00:00:26.300> in<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.480> gersh<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.050> that<00:00:28.010> activates

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
to go up in the gersh and that activates

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.750 
to go up in the gersh and that activates
the<00:00:29.000> Rockets<00:00:29.449> well<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.980> Rockets<00:00:31.190> there's
