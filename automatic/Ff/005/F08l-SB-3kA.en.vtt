00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.560
 it is the first time 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.749
 a big message 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.839
 if you ask why 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.009
 those simple questions the answer may not be that simple because it 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.600
 It took me a very long time before I got this one 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.110
 yes being able to make or dare to take decisions, that is a big deal 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.599
 part 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.399
 and it only temporarily yes I have been there in recent months and certainly after mating 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:26.749
 play in london 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.549
 and with lists I started making girls with worthy new challenges 

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:31.749
 what do I want to do now 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.990
 what can still be achieved and finally time is up 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.240
 the list that I made very hard for on the tennis court that is not long 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.829
 enough 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.239
 and so yes as far as I'm concerned it's really a very nice end to a real one 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.770
 crazy can tennis career and 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.120
 yes i feel that around this says beautiful country can won everything 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.250
 what I wanted and I have been everywhere because I have where I wanted to go 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.280
 and this said yes I don't really like it so it was difficult the process 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.620
 with all those doubts about whether or not 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.050
 yes i have a very difficult and and 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.800
 and the first few times that I am against my parents in the north of the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.409
 Rhine 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.270
 I said that I was going to quit I still found it very difficult and now it is 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.370
 it also really matched them 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.150
 audio pen it is very definitive and but it is still very difficult 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.510
 because I do not leave behind and I do not go from a lake on the road there so what 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.810
 trusted choose and what has given me so much confidence and 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.250
 so I now understand something I actually don't know very well and there certainly were 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.280
 not the outcome of the meet 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.450
 and that is just exciting, but ultimately just as well 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.250
 yes very challenging they let sports after being unbeaten for ten years in a row 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.130
 been how city for you 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 yes that is weird today i did rhine and i did have some interviews and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.920
 then the list is recorded with so many people and titles for ten years 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 fired, seven games in a row were won 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.350
 that's weird that's just really crazy that she is on my list and in 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.000
 a third man very proud I think it is very cool and I also think yes 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 is now coming soon and in a few years still very much looking forward to being happy 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.940
 Looking back 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.980
 there is still time to look back now that of course that will happen now 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.839
 to start the best moment for you on the job 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.039
 yes what a nice thing with a job then I will go back to the paralympic 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.639
 play in 2008 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.279
 just when the final played against korie homan the gold medal match 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.279
 and 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.319
 year after year then also long ago undefeated and I really stood there 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.389
 losing that match point against having to compete 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:31.790
 turn to profit and year and everything can be put together there it was 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.419
 tennis game is in itself a technical and tactical part but 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.729
 certainly also the mental part that came with that match and 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.239
 year that stands head and shoulders above the rest 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.739
 all time low 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.290
 have a low point in my career yes 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.060
 he has to think very deeply about all the things that are going to find 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.529
 and 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:55.069
 there have been a number of exciting moments when weeks waal doubt 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.259
 whether I could continue during the important tournaments or not 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.079
 play 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.729
 marijne has been incompetent home years ago contest where the 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:04.359
 tub 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.009
 I think 2 6 0 5 0 was ahead of him and that he was still losing 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.599
 so yes that is a low point you have your tennis career but also a good one 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.269
 ok ok actually just is a profit and the next day the army goes ordinary 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.569
 live again so that is also so in love 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.379
 to leave sports with a lot of cressman titles undefeated for years 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.280
 but otherwise the sport seems further behind how did you develop over time 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:26.829
 that you have played 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.049
 I think it's the development of our job it's not the sport I am into 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.290
 the general and the latter 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.199
 a few years 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:36.979
 and is going really fast and if you like that I look at holly and disk that year 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:37.619
 ago 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.610
 but both not yet integrated in which boundary line is not yet 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.480
 and for example we also have an 8 bit more beautiful at the same time it always 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.579
 past and just tennis 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.869
 and also the prize money the professionalism of the players 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:52.809
 professionalism of the organization 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.919
 yes I think they have also made great strides but also the recognition 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.559
 from the Dutch strong worldwide and ing recognition from in the 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:04.489
 the media has grown enormously and yes, in that respect, I am 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.269
 Breda I am proud that I am still doing my bit 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.219
 that was my next question, are you most proud of it, or especially on you 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.889
 own performance on the job well I think I'm most proud of the fact 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.370
 that I know I can deliver the performance I have so far 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.109
 delivered 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.200
 on the tennis court 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.259
 and incidentally, of course, was me 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.550
 in year one became a figurehead and the stamp got its head and I was allowed to 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.680
 for example, forgive the rider 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.499
 So that is actually a kind of incidental thing that I really do 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.430
 with his yes but to a behave
