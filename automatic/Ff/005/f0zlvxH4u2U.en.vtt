00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.880 
stone-cold killers also since there was
always<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:42.569> much<00:03:42.720> stuff<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:43.290> behind<00:03:43.530> the

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
always so much stuff going on behind the

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.530 
always so much stuff going on behind the
camera<00:03:44.280> one<00:03:44.550> trick<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:44.970> used<00:03:45.270> was<00:03:45.510> to

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
camera one trick that we used was to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.900 
camera one trick that we used was to
dangle<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.200> begging<00:03:46.590> strip<00:03:46.920> serve<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.520> front<00:03:47.819> of

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
dangle a begging strip serve in front of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.790 
dangle a begging strip serve in front of
the<00:03:47.970> dog's<00:03:48.209> nose<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.870> then<00:03:48.959> move<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.410> slowly

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
the dog's nose and then move it slowly

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.380 
the dog's nose and then move it slowly
away<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.580> their<00:03:50.850> attention<00:03:51.240> would<00:03:51.330> be

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
away so that their attention would be

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.660 
away so that their attention would be
focused<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.080> treat<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.370> way<00:03:53.520> we

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
focused on the treat and that way we

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.070 
focused on the treat and that way we
could<00:03:53.790> guide<00:03:54.000> their<00:03:54.209> eye<00:03:54.240> line<00:03:54.569> left<00:03:54.870> and

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
could guide their eye line left and

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.630 
could guide their eye line left and
right<00:03:55.260> by<00:03:55.470> just<00:03:55.500> waving<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.100> tree<00:03:56.310> in<00:03:56.430> front

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
right by just waving the tree in front

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.550 
right by just waving the tree in front
of<00:03:56.700> them<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.420> achieve<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.780> visual<00:03:58.110> gag<00:03:58.350> of

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
of them to achieve the visual gag of

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.020 
of them to achieve the visual gag of
having<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.860> dog<00:03:59.040> hold<00:03:59.340> their<00:03:59.489> weapons<00:03:59.819> we

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
having the dog hold their weapons we

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.000 
having the dog hold their weapons we
used<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.600> trick<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:00.900> was<00:04:01.140> previously<00:04:01.620> used<00:04:01.890> on

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
used a trick that was previously used on

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.979 
used a trick that was previously used on

animals cut off their arms and their fur

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.890 
animals cut off their arms and their fur
and<00:04:08.130> fashion<00:04:08.850> them<00:04:08.970> around<00:04:09.239> dowels<00:04:09.600> and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
and fashion them around dowels and

and fashion them around dowels and
chopsticks<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.650> we<00:04:11.190> use<00:04:11.370> these<00:04:11.580> as<00:04:11.790> finger

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
chopsticks and we use these as finger

chopsticks and we use these as finger
puppets<00:04:12.600> or<00:04:12.780> held<00:04:13.260> them<00:04:13.410> from<00:04:13.560> their<00:04:13.709> bases

puppets or held them from their bases
and<00:04:14.070> it<00:04:14.280> actually<00:04:14.459> worked<00:04:14.760> out<00:04:14.880> really<00:04:14.940> well

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
and it actually worked out really well

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.479 
and it actually worked out really well
true<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.500> jumped<00:04:16.709> into<00:04:16.799> my<00:04:16.950> arms<00:04:17.280> when<00:04:17.459> she

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
essentially stuck it in a trench and

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.240 
essentially stuck it in a trench and
followed<00:04:42.810> along<00:04:43.320> as<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.620> dogs<00:04:43.830> were<00:04:44.070> running

either away or towards him the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.600 
either away or towards him the
difficulty<00:04:46.470> was<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:46.979> dogs<00:04:47.190> had<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.430> hard

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
difficulty was that the dogs had a hard

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
time relaxing once they were in the

time relaxing once they were in the
trench<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.680> couldn't<00:04:50.070> see<00:04:50.280> their<00:04:50.460> owners<00:04:50.940> so

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
trench and couldn't see their owners so

trench and couldn't see their owners so
we<00:04:51.960> actually<00:04:52.200> had<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.590> mess<00:04:52.890> around<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.340> lot

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
Alexa is that it's got a huge dynamic

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.909 
Alexa is that it's got a huge dynamic
range<00:06:06.660> in<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.870> lot<00:06:07.020> of<00:06:07.139> latitude<00:06:07.410> which<00:06:07.710> means

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
range in a lot of latitude which means

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.500 
range in a lot of latitude which means
that<00:06:08.070> if<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.250> shoot<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.760> sky<00:06:09.030> or<00:06:09.240> something

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
that if you shoot the sky or something

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.730 
that if you shoot the sky or something
that's<00:06:09.660> white<00:06:09.840> in<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.080> background<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.590> won't

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
that's white in the background it won't

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.260 
that's white in the background it won't
just<00:06:10.860> be<00:06:11.010> blown<00:06:11.340> out<00:06:11.490> but<00:06:11.700> you<00:06:11.790> get<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:11.970> lot<00:06:12.180> of

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
just be blown out but you get a lot of

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.060 
just be blown out but you get a lot of
levels<00:06:12.540> and<00:06:12.960> layers<00:06:13.110> of<00:06:13.440> that<00:06:13.590> white<00:06:13.860> so<00:06:14.040> you

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
levels and layers of that white so you

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.830 
levels and layers of that white so you
really<00:06:14.430> see<00:06:14.760> a<00:06:14.790> clearer<00:06:15.210> picture<00:06:15.390> of<00:06:15.690> book

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840

dark and bright shooting with the Alexa

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.100 
dark and bright shooting with the Alexa
also<00:06:17.940> means<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.240> have<00:06:18.300> to<00:06:18.450> do<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.570> significant

amount of color correcting because the

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.190 
amount of color correcting because the
camera<00:06:20.640> shoots<00:06:20.910> in<00:06:21.060> a<00:06:21.120> very<00:06:21.300> flat<00:06:21.660> profile
