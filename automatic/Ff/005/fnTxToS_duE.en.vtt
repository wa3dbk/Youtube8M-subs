00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.010
 now we see the gold farming exist 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.820
 various ways to make gold and sea beyond 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
 do n't score a goal 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.820
 obviously there is actually not that you have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.250
 great thing sees 68,000 glues happy with you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.560
 flab because it could survive 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.689
 fine with a dap network of 5,000 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.490
 goal when it comes certainly can not and must 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.510
 face big sudden expenses though 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.980
 however there is nothing but published ones 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.240
 to hurt to hurt to stop for a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.309
 lots of tail-less because I do not like 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.640
 the idea as to me even if they do n't make a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.010
 fucking really hamel getting me bored 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.870
 let's see now the methods to make goals 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.360
 I talked a lot about this farming seas 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 some are not even what the hell is 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.590
 farming and harvesting or at least doing 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 one thing over and over again to get a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.340
 given goal for example the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.110
 farming can be of herbs or minerals 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.020
 with anything else concerning 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.050
 professions that allows you to sell them 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.399
 at the action house and give us money 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.220
 so now let's see the millions 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.170
 to score the first method is to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.299
 sell stuff from vendors 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.860
 it's not a very nice one as it is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 they make very little money though ad 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.880
 example I would be disappointed and it is often 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890
 if for example going to do old 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 istance well who laughs especially now 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 it could enter singles into old ones 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.600
 raid as to take one anyway 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.299
 copious amount of money another is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.159
 precisely the farming of old i 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.750
 contents that give however one 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.939
 amount of money traver one 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 immediate need for money you do not know 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.869
 how to get it you can go anyway 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.530
 to make the curtains are black at the time 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.500
 black temple and take 200 300 goals 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.649
 including the latest stuff you sell 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.670
 then instead we have the trade in 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.170
 xon house is however the koper not trade 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.689
 intend to sell the items you want 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.430
 procure but buy items 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.649
 at auction when they cost little and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.920
 put them back on the auction one more price 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.380
 high for this yield if they would 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.049
 very lucky 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.250
 instead simpler and faster model for 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.340
 make money and professions 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.230
 we see the professions I recommend if 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.530
 you just want to get started 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:25.610
 just a pg to make you and the professions 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:29.209
 collecting ie and air ball ismo con and 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.670
 meaning living an Italian extraction o 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.620
 strippers because 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.260
 will allow to accumulate that is 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.450
 raw materials used then for the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.959
 other professions very quickly that 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.230
 could sell in action houses in the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.480
 house of ste at prices however not 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.610
 considerable but annoying we say that a 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.510
 oretta of farm 22 networks to make one 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.890
 week of granting above all 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.840
 of thirst also re-entered of 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.849
 two thousand goals a week that is not little 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.650
 if from the beginning 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.390
 in addition to this it overlooks instead of the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.209
 production processes that are those 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.769
 professions such as scripts 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:13.010
 shaun who judges then written in the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:16.730
 verbal smm or blacks meeting leder 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.609
 working tailoring enchanting crafting 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.799
 that instead of consuming the test 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.500
 mx objects produced by others 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.940
 professions those of collection and them 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.590
 the flocks instead transform an object 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.660
 that can be useful objects 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.489
 processed items that are used 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.910
 generally to have from everyone 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.470
 players and some can be 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.760
 sold at considerable prices these 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.859
 professions I advise against 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.130
 absolutely on your first pg in 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.600
 how in most cases vi 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.269
 they will really spend a lot of money 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.950
 you will not gain na cippa 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.690
 while already seeing a quantity anyway 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.760
 sufficient raw material 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.130
 you might start thinking about making one 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.900
 of these professions as some 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.720
 items are auctioned off in pieces 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.780
 10,000 20,000 gold are also considerable 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.430
 although now the like has subsided 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.940
 this is above all a method 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.940
 advice begins expansion or beginning 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.430
 armed patches of many but many instead of 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.160
 level if you are not in a hurry training 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.880
 so many materials and how many objects e 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.170
 pc possibi 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.959
 as for the st that period yes 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.720
 they sell to a lot so I arrived at 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.660
 68,000 goals from 0 to 90 before I had to 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.070
 spend several goals for some things 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.690
 for the monk and therefore are 68 thousand but 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.780
 I do so but I have made the money myself 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.770
 make me without fucking 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.630
 picking up the herbs that go into 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.140
 around without even form and giving me 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.090
 made 40,000 gold and selling the king and in 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.280
 offends among facts accessories with 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.010
 inscription this stuff here and secondary 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.480
 I've got this stuff here with these 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.850
 done 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.190
 sixty thousand gold 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.900
 another method the last to score goals e 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.630
 do the quests as in these from 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.270
 about 20 gold at the maximum 90 level 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.880
 level however these pandaria is a 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.850
 slow method in quotation marks to score goals 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.160
 but still calculating that pandaria there 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.930
 will be 500 billion daily west to do 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.360
 you only levels without even a 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.330
 know if you make them all a thousand gold 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.500
 man but also 500 thing a day meditate 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.320
 just from west well I think I said 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.000
 I know everything if I should share this 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.570
 Two-part videos look like the one 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.610
 gold farming to that of the pro then 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:41.990
 but it is too long, the two divide it 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.970
 share and see you at the next video that 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.220
 will be a video probably will be the 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.530
 video on feng the damn the second 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.370
 boss of new shambles that I should 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.190
 load I don't know when I can break down 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.900
 however, after I uploaded this it is 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.400
 here in the week I will definitely charge 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.630
 this video if this week there is 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.160
 I'll do it in that other one 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.770
 so within two weeks then it is 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.690
 loaded well from crazy to bobba e 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.490
 see you all at the next video I hope 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.080
 to have been useful to you 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.950
 this time instead of delirious what it is 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.950
 case to god 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.800
 goodies what the fuck
