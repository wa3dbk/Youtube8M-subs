00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello to you here novel from the star blog 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.490
 oummatv my blog of videos for 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.349
 progress in mathematics 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.500
 I am currently in the United States and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.359
 especially in san francisco en 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.279
 California and in particular you will see 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.240
 behind me the golden gate and famous 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 golden gate 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.099
 I think you've already seen this bridge 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.900
 red in some movies or series 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.340
 so in fact just now in me 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.929
 walking with the two friends with 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.780
 which I came here to visit 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.200
 well I remembered one thing in 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.969
 did when I was younger I had 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 dream of building but also 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.460
 loops 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.379
 maybe you have maybe you too 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 you dreamed one day to be an architect and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.090
 I think it's something that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.190
 makes you dream 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.530
 I was ten years old I was living in 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.670
 the time addresses the end of the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 brittany i think you know this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.789
 city ​​and at the time we were building a 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.199
 new second bridge it was the 3 in fact 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.699
 he was in parallel with the old 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.489
 nancea bridge that still exists 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.140
 Besides, you can go and see this new 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.619
 bridge he was very particular because 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 already the wide and 2d that was actually 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.830
 what's called a cable- stayed bridge in 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.270
 did there was huge cable 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 I jump the effects cable me 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.830
 fascinate actually telling you to know 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.250
 how to lift could hold it was 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 really fascinating actually 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 today so we are in front of the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.770
 golden gate to it's a bridge that is in 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.970
 course just for us these materials 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.439
 construction techniques but he 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.180
 looks a bit like this new bridge 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.830
 of iroise 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:39.090
 so just this point of getting 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.370
 finish in 1937 in the 30s 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.930
 I imagine you understand how much 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.820
 construction techniques and 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.260
 particular mathematical equations that's 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.880
 that there are behind are really 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.890
 different a bit now for 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.420
 built in the thirties and one 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 buyer we will say that's what I 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.640
 am going to share with you it's this 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.020
 fascination for the equations the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 technique behind it because a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.540
 Once the bridge is made, we see it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.080
 more but the engineer who imagined and 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.820
 well he has he wrote his equations he has 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.430
 solved them and that's it it's really 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.080
 interesting and especially to build 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.670
 a bridge we study in particular 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.110
 equations called differential 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.790
 ie equations that are at 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.610
 base of derived functions 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.290
 I think you've heard you 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.260
 already heard of derived functions 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.459
 I know when you write fgx is good 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.560
 banks has that drift is so in 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.090
 as much as x premiums just behind eh 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.370
 well that's the derived functions 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.450
 who are next who are involved 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.330
 what are called equations 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.670
 differentials and when one makes a 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.930
 good and well especially he has equations 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.180
 differentials to study the 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.360
 behavior of the bridge under the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.430
 wind 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 so that's really interesting I 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.430
 find then it's just an example 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.560
 among many others but the equations 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.320
 differentials can be used for saab a 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.610
 studied the camp you I convince him so 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.560
 that's actually I just wanted to 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.780
 show how much mathematics 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.160
 and the physics behind the 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.430
 construction of a particular bridge 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.409
 it's exciting 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.019
 maybe you too when you have when 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.760
 you see will study the derived functions 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.510
 now want to be to know more 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.769
 to know what can be used 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.780
 last but not come from me I was holding 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.769
 the goal is to build bridges 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.310
 and many other things 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.689
 so that's it if you want to come on my blog 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.219
 this term athenaeus to progress in 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.959
 particular about the notion of derivatives me 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.340
 I invite you to come on my blog for 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.870
 discover the videos on the subject 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.389
 returning to my blog you can also 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.950
 download my 26-page guide which 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.030
 is called this trick to progress 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.519
 quickly mathematics 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.349
 so it was Roman rockstar materege 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.349
 tazi to the next in another video
