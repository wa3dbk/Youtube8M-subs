most people are excited about it but

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.150 
most people are excited about it but
it's<00:00:12.480> been<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> little<00:00:12.900> bit<00:00:13.110> difficult<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.860> get

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
it's been a little bit difficult to get

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.870 
it's been a little bit difficult to get
as<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.030> see<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.880> Kershaw

as you can see this is the Kershaw
ashalon<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:20.930> it's<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.500> very<00:00:22.529> expensive

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
ashalon and it's a not very expensive

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.620 
ashalon and it's a not very expensive
knife<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.750> got<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.199> natural<00:00:27.080> jade<00:00:28.250> g10

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
knife and it's got the natural jade g10

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.660 
knife and it's got the natural jade g10
and<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.740> an<00:00:31.949> assisted<00:00:32.910> opener<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:35.340> will

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and it is an assisted opener so you will

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.630 
and it is an assisted opener so you will
flick<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> open<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:37.040> when<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> first<00:00:38.370> saw

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
flick it open like that when I first saw

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
flick it open like that when I first saw
this<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.180> least<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> blade<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.440> bit

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this at least in the blade a little bit

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.729 
this at least in the blade a little bit
in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> handle<00:00:41.129> reminded<00:00:41.610> me<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> baby

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.350 

strider<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.690> SJ<00:00:48.690> 35<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:49.890> something

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
strider was it the SJ 35 or something

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.520 
strider was it the SJ 35 or something
kind<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> looks<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> look<00:00:52.410> at

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
kind of looks like that if you look at

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
kind of looks like that if you look at
the<00:00:52.559> blade<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:54.530> mean<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.920> comparing<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the blade I mean I'm not comparing it to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.000 
the blade I mean I'm not comparing it to
that<00:00:56.789> knife<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.210> any<00:00:57.360> sense<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that knife in any sense but just the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.709 
that knife in any sense but just the
blade<00:00:59.219> shape<00:00:59.550> reminded<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> little

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
blade shape reminded me of it a little

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.420 
blade shape reminded me of it a little
bit<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.690> hollow<00:01:03.690> grind

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
bit as you can see it's a hollow grind

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
bit as you can see it's a hollow grind
definitely<00:01:05.430> comes<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.210> extremely<00:01:06.990> thin

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
definitely comes to an extremely thin

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.880 
definitely comes to an extremely thin
edge<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:08.430> came<00:01:09.409> razor<00:01:10.409> sharp<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:12.740> think<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
edge it came razor sharp i think the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.810 
edge it came razor sharp i think the
steel<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.490> mov<00:01:15.090> let<00:01:15.450> me<00:01:15.540> stay<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.820> just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
steel is like mov let me stay here just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.999 
steel is like mov let me stay here just
read<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.060> real<00:01:18.299> quick<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:21.680> can't<00:01:22.680> tell<00:01:22.860> what

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
read it real quick I can't tell what

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
read it real quick I can't tell what
this<00:01:23.189> deal<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> says<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.170> on

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
this deal is I don't think it says it on

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
this deal is I don't think it says it on
the<00:01:25.290> blade<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.630> mov<00:01:28.549> 13<00:01:30.259> or<00:01:31.259> 14<00:01:34.159> I<00:01:35.270> saw

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the blade it's like mov 13 or 14 I saw

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
the blade it's like mov 13 or 14 I saw
this<00:01:36.390> knife<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.960> saw<00:01:37.170> come<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.250> was

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this knife and I saw come on and it was

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.560 
this knife and I saw come on and it was
available<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.880> thought<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> get

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that I end up buying I never find them

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.700 
that I end up buying I never find them
to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:49.430> kind<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.460> nice<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.880> really<00:01:51.180> like

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
to be kind of nice that I really like

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.260 
to be kind of nice that I really like
just<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.310> know<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.460> kind<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
just a you know I kind of go for a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.270 
just a you know I kind of go for a
slightly<00:01:54.659> higher<00:01:54.840> quality<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.890> comes<00:01:56.130> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
slightly higher quality when it comes to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.020 
slightly higher quality when it comes to
manufactured<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:58.439> blade<00:01:58.979> centering<00:01:59.430> if<00:01:59.880> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
manufactured the blade centering if you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.950 
manufactured the blade centering if you
can<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.219> way

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
can see this see I can get it this way

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.320 
can see this see I can get it this way
on<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:06.229> over<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.940> you're<00:02:08.940> looking<00:02:09.209> at

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
on this is over to the you're looking at

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.220 
on this is over to the you're looking at
now<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.869> right

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
now to the right

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.820 
now to the right
and<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.450> kind<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.750> stiff<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.319> open<00:02:14.680> like

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
and it is kind of stiff to open like

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.500 
and it is kind of stiff to open like
there's<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.069> lot<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.310> resistance<00:02:15.760> with<00:02:16.239> this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
there's a lot of resistance with this

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.789 
there's a lot of resistance with this
torsion<00:02:17.019> bar<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:22.349> have<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.500> say<00:02:23.650> it

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
torsion bar and then I have to say it

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.589 
torsion bar and then I have to say it
grew<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.220> me<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.519> little<00:02:24.730> bit<00:02:24.849> more<00:02:25.239> since<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
grew on me a little bit more since I

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.820 
grew on me a little bit more since I
kind<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.840> put<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.140> away<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.379> didn't<00:02:26.739> do

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
kind of put it away and didn't do

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.199 
kind of put it away and didn't do
anything<00:02:27.040> with<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.980> don't<00:02:30.819> think<00:02:31.030> it's

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
anything with it but I don't think it's

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.449 
anything with it but I don't think it's
all<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.360> it's<00:02:31.930> cracked<00:02:32.019> up<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.470> be<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.310> know

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
all that it's cracked up to be you know

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.210 
all that it's cracked up to be you know
it<00:02:34.180> probably<00:02:34.390> make<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.629> decent<00:02:34.870> EDC<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.890> think

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
it probably make a decent EDC I think

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.009 
it probably make a decent EDC I think
over<00:02:36.489> time<00:02:36.519> it<00:02:36.970> would<00:02:37.120> maybe<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:39.540> take<00:02:40.540> long

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
over time it would maybe not take long

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.650 
over time it would maybe not take long
term<00:02:41.319> use<00:02:41.349> and<00:02:41.799> where<00:02:41.980> as<00:02:42.159> well<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:43.480> that's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
term use and where as well but that's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.440 
term use and where as well but that's
just<00:02:43.840> my<00:02:44.049> opinion<00:02:44.549> time<00:02:45.549> will<00:02:45.730> tell<00:02:45.910> when<00:02:46.360> you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
just my opinion time will tell when you

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.300 
just my opinion time will tell when you
look<00:02:46.629> at<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:47.069> it's<00:02:48.069> got<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:50.379> sorry<00:02:51.069> make

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
look at it it's got the the sorry make

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.140 
look at it it's got the the sorry make
sure<00:02:51.430> that's<00:02:51.519> focused<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:53.319> low<00:02:54.160> ride<00:02:54.430> pocket

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
sure that's focused the low ride pocket

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.289 
sure that's focused the low ride pocket
clip<00:02:55.359> that's<00:02:56.069> reversible<00:02:57.069> for<00:02:57.489> tip<00:02:57.760> up<00:02:57.970> tip

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
clip that's reversible for tip up tip

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.740 
clip that's reversible for tip up tip
down<00:02:58.680> left<00:02:59.680> right<00:02:59.859> or<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.910> can<00:03:01.150> move<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.540> now

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
down left right or you can move it now

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.449 
down left right or you can move it now
you<00:03:01.989> can't<00:03:02.260> yeah<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.500> can<00:03:02.739> have<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.129> tip<00:03:04.319> down

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
you can't yeah you can have it tip down

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.900 
you can't yeah you can have it tip down
for<00:03:06.750> right<00:03:07.750> hand<00:03:08.019> carry<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:08.620> think<00:03:09.549> that's<00:03:09.730> what

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
for right hand carry I think that's what

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.819 
for right hand carry I think that's what
that<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.690> know<00:03:11.579> but<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:13.000> know<00:03:13.090> again<00:03:13.829> I'm

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
that is you know but you know again I'm

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.920 
that is you know but you know again I'm
not<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.579> overly<00:03:16.000> impressed<00:03:16.389> it's<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.690> very

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
not that overly impressed it's a very

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.550 
not that overly impressed it's a very
stiff<00:03:17.500> it's<00:03:18.220> very<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:19.540> retentions<00:03:20.049> very<00:03:20.290> high

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
stiff it's very the retentions very high

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.620 
stiff it's very the retentions very high
as<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.340> see<00:03:21.760> if<00:03:22.000> i<00:03:22.150> push<00:03:22.450> on<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:23.040> and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
as you can see if i push on this and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.289 
as you can see if i push on this and
then<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.780> torsion<00:03:26.609> kicks<00:03:27.609> in<00:03:27.790> about<00:03:28.060> right

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
then the torsion kicks in about right

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.170 
then the torsion kicks in about right
there<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.310> see<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.669> doesn't<00:03:31.000> really

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
there and you can see it doesn't really

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.990 
there and you can see it doesn't really
carry<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.630> plate<00:03:31.959> out<00:03:32.549> when<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.639> release<00:03:33.970> it

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
carry the plate out when you release it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.319 
carry the plate out when you release it
like<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.690> needs<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.019> little<00:03:35.200> bit<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:36.329> push

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
like that it needs a little bit of push

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.300 
like that it needs a little bit of push
and<00:03:37.599> I<00:03:37.900> don't<00:03:38.079> like<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.410> because<00:03:38.500> your<00:03:38.709> thumb

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
and I don't like it because your thumb

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.740 
and I don't like it because your thumb
can<00:03:39.519> kind<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:39.910> behind<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.299> blade<00:03:40.510> you

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
can kind of get behind the blade you

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.390 
can kind of get behind the blade you
have<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.930> kind<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.139> push<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.470> stop<00:03:41.889> but<00:03:42.130> anyway

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
have to kind of push and stop but anyway

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.520 
have to kind of push and stop but anyway
I<00:03:42.579> just<00:03:43.389> thought<00:03:43.630> it'd<00:03:43.840> give<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.079> review<00:03:44.290> of

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
I just thought it'd give a review of

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.870 
I just thought it'd give a review of
this<00:03:44.620> because<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:44.889> know<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.069> few<00:03:45.160> people<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:45.849> a

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
this because I know a few people have a

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.670 
this because I know a few people have a
more<00:03:46.239> I've<00:03:46.419> been<00:03:46.599> looking<00:03:46.989> at<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.319> wanting

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
more I've been looking at it and wanting

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.300 
more I've been looking at it and wanting
them<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.639> I'd<00:03:49.090> say<00:03:49.480> on<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.959> scale<00:03:50.139> of<00:03:50.380> 1<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.280> 5

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
them and I'd say on a scale of 1 to 5

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.089 
them and I'd say on a scale of 1 to 5
i'd<00:03:51.790> give<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.150> thing<00:03:52.389> a<00:03:52.510> 2<00:03:52.889> i'm<00:03:53.889> not

in to worse than I've ever but that's

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.570 
in to worse than I've ever but that's
why<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.630> never<00:05:27.810> seen<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.080> review<00:05:28.440> but<00:05:29.310> anyway

why you never seen a review but anyway

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.960 
why you never seen a review but anyway
because<00:05:29.730> all<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.240> had<00:05:30.960> this<00:05:31.170> for<00:05:31.640> over<00:05:32.640> a

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
because all the had this for over a

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.380 
because all the had this for over a
month<00:05:33.240> maybe<00:05:33.930> two<00:05:34.670> and<00:05:35.670> I<00:05:35.790> didn't<00:05:35.970> review<00:05:36.240> it

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
month maybe two and I didn't review it

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.790 
month maybe two and I didn't review it
because<00:05:36.600> i<00:05:36.660> thought<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.320> know<00:05:37.350> i<00:05:37.440> usually

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800
