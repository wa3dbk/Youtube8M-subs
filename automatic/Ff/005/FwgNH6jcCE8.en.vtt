00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.429
 we are 3 of printup the fair of 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.260
 3d printing which sectors are the most 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.990
 explored and which ones with major 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.480
 potential as we see the fair here i 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.300
 sectors that open 3d printing are 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.119
 certainly those in increasing numbers 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.279
 most interesting at the moment are for 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.900
 example that of health where those 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.930
 polymeric materials for some time yes 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.660
 explores orthodontics and orthopedics then 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.550
 we have the nautical for some details 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.420
 that you start doing that too 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.540
 sector 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.269
 certainly the jewels but you do n't have to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.080
 3d forget that the press is opened 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.790
 polytechnic manner at this time a 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.890
 any sector that is capable of 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.070
 grasp its formal and potentialities 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.379
 customization then the engineering the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.379
 architecture design right now 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.689
 I am at the center of this reflection is 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.060
 for example not only materials 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.890
 polymers then the plastic that to 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.200
 moment is over 90 percent of the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.420
 3d printing production but also ceramics 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.140
 open up to exploration for example 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.240
 in construction 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.890
 3d printing is interesting for 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.789
 architecture for example 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.840
 allows you to reproduce scaled models 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.119
 significant for architecture with 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 levels of detail and color scheme for 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.509
 now unexplored and then fundamental 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.969
 the approach to mechanics as it is 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.759
 now evident that the possibility of 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.640
 get mechanical pieces with non shapes 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.469
 obtainable from other technologies will be one 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.960
 frontier for now explored that 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.280
 plastic in the future also with metals and 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.829
 how can you answer the productive world 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.420
 to this new challenge 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.179
 first opening and allowing the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.979
 digital natives to approach the new 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.889
 way of producing new ways of 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.700
 production that will also be disseminated e 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:02.139
 will allow for example to transfer 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.329
 of files from one side to the other of 

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.399
 world by allowing productions also i 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.979
 unthinkable places among these we mention today 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.890
 the orbiting station that carries on board 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.750
 a 3d printer and when i 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.180
 our astronauts needed a 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.430
 ratchet from nasa have designed it 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.410
 one printed in one piece and have 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.820
 ate the do in space 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.020
 as their samantha cristoforetti have 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.010
 before they could print it 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.010
 quietly
