around<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.869> gives<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> nice<00:01:49.500> grip

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
around it but it gives for a nice grip

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.990 
around it but it gives for a nice grip
especially<00:01:50.310> when<00:01:50.460> you're<00:01:50.579> playing<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
especially when you're playing for a

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.260 
especially when you're playing for a
long<00:01:51.119> period<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.860> um<00:01:52.920> buttons<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
long period of time um buttons the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.819 
long period of time um buttons the
quality<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> buttons<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:55.500> nice

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
quality on the buttons are really nice

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
quality on the buttons are really nice
none<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.759> stick<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.390> they<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.600> are

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
none of them stick and they all are

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.319 
none of them stick and they all are
really<00:01:58.020> responsive<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.610> triggers<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.119> well

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
really responsive the triggers as well

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.350 
really responsive the triggers as well
and<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.020> triggers<00:02:01.409> I'll<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.710> into<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.360> love

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and the triggers I'll get into I love

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.660 
and the triggers I'll get into I love
the<00:02:03.479> triggers<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.079> triggers<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.740> concave

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the triggers the triggers are concave

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.550 
the triggers the triggers are concave
like<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> Xbox<00:02:06.689> but<00:02:06.960> they're<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.290> bit

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
like the Xbox but they're a little bit

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.169 
like the Xbox but they're a little bit
they<00:02:08.039> have<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.489> bit<00:02:08.610> more<00:02:08.789> width<00:02:08.970> on

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
they have a little bit more width on

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.210 
they have a little bit more width on
them<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> PlayStation<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.739> they're<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
them like the PlayStation so they're a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.390 
them like the PlayStation so they're a
little<00:02:11.400> bit<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.000> mix<00:02:12.209> of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
little bit of a mix of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.600 
little bit of a mix of
both<00:02:13.290> yeah<00:02:14.290> all<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.739> buttons<00:02:15.069> are<00:02:15.190> great<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
both yeah all the buttons are great the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.399 
both yeah all the buttons are great the
d-pad<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.659> bit<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.930> mix<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.319> the

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
d-pad is a little bit of a mix of the

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.470 
d-pad is a little bit of a mix of the
Xbox<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.220> PlayStation<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.360> it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
Xbox and the PlayStation but I think it

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.149 
Xbox and the PlayStation but I think it
works<00:02:19.659> quite<00:02:20.049> well<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.709> just<00:02:20.799> as

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
works quite well and it's just as

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.190 
works quite well and it's just as
sensitive<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.790> responsive<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.480> accurate<00:02:22.750> as

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
sensitive and responsive and accurate as

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.009 
sensitive and responsive and accurate as
the<00:02:23.620> PlayStation<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.879> PlayStation<00:02:25.450> d-pad<00:02:25.780> I

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
the PlayStation the PlayStation d-pad I

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.619 
the PlayStation the PlayStation d-pad I
really<00:02:26.739> do<00:02:26.950> feel<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.489> it's<00:02:27.730> an<00:02:28.239> outstanding

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
really do feel like it's an outstanding

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.479 
really do feel like it's an outstanding
B<00:02:29.110> pad<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.709> really<00:02:29.920> accurate<00:02:30.129> when

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
B pad and it's really accurate when

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.680 
B pad and it's really accurate when
you're<00:02:30.579> trying<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.909> type<00:02:31.090> text<00:02:31.269> or<00:02:31.540> anything

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
like that the wireless connection seems

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.110 
like that the wireless connection seems
great<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.530> doesn't<00:02:35.769> seem<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.159> lag<00:02:36.370> at<00:02:36.579> all<00:02:36.700> the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
topic of how sensitive it is they seem

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.930 
topic of how sensitive it is they seem
great<00:02:50.200> they<00:02:50.859> seem<00:02:51.129> kind<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.400> like<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.609> mix

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
great they seem kind of like a mix

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.509 
great they seem kind of like a mix
between<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.450> PlayStation<00:02:53.140> controller<00:02:53.650> which

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
between the PlayStation controller which

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.099 
between the PlayStation controller which
is<00:02:54.730> here<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:57.280> Xbox<00:02:58.150> controller<00:02:58.690> which<00:02:59.079> is

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
is here and the Xbox controller which is

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.670 
is here and the Xbox controller which is
well<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.069> don't<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.549> one<00:03:00.790> but<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.900> mean<00:03:02.530> they

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
well I don't have one but I mean they

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.500 
well I don't have one but I mean they
seem<00:03:02.920> great<00:03:02.950> they<00:03:03.430> seem<00:03:03.670> pretty<00:03:03.849> sensitive

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
seem great they seem pretty sensitive

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.910 
seem great they seem pretty sensitive
and<00:03:05.700> pretty<00:03:06.700> nice<00:03:06.909> to<00:03:07.120> use<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.440> joysticks

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
and pretty nice to use the the joysticks

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.860 
and pretty nice to use the the joysticks
as<00:03:09.099> you<00:03:09.220> can<00:03:09.400> see<00:03:09.519> are<00:03:09.640> also<00:03:09.819> concave<00:03:10.540> as<00:03:10.720> well

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
as you can see are also concave as well

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.500 
as you can see are also concave as well
as<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.079> triggers<00:03:11.609> unlike<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.790> PlayStation

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
as the triggers unlike the PlayStation

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.909 
as the triggers unlike the PlayStation
which<00:03:13.780> have<00:03:14.190> convex<00:03:16.079> convex<00:03:17.079> joysticks<00:03:17.769> and

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
which have convex convex joysticks and

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.979 
which have convex convex joysticks and
convex<00:03:18.579> triggers<00:03:18.940> now<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.209> only<00:03:19.660> problem<00:03:19.959> I

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
convex triggers now the only problem I

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.990 
convex triggers now the only problem I
had<00:03:20.169> with<00:03:20.349> that<00:03:20.410> was<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.069> convex<00:03:21.430> triggers<00:03:21.819> on

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
had with that was the convex triggers on

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.740 
had with that was the convex triggers on
the<00:03:22.480> normal<00:03:22.810> one<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.980> also<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:25.239> size<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.660> it

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
the normal one and also the size of it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.170 
the normal one and also the size of it
and<00:03:25.780> that's<00:03:26.049> why<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.260> liked<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.130> idea<00:03:28.090> of

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
and that's why I liked the the idea of

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.809 
and that's why I liked the the idea of
the<00:03:28.419> power<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.870> pro<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.709> because<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.370> an<00:03:30.579> Xbox

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
the power I pro is because it's an Xbox

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.990 
the power I pro is because it's an Xbox
controller<00:03:31.359> for<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.109> PlayStation<00:03:32.760> all<00:03:33.760> right

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
controller for the PlayStation all right

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.059 
controller for the PlayStation all right
so<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.690> already<00:03:34.989> mentioned<00:03:35.139> that<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.739> does<00:03:35.889> take

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
so I already mentioned that it does take

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.159 
so I already mentioned that it does take
triple-a<00:03:36.489> batteries<00:03:36.970> but<00:03:37.269> they<00:03:37.569> seem<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.840> last

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
triple-a batteries but they seem to last

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.360 
triple-a batteries but they seem to last
for<00:03:38.410> quite<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.650> while<00:03:38.889> on<00:03:38.919> the<00:03:39.160> wireless

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
for quite a while on the wireless

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.339 
for quite a while on the wireless
connection<00:03:39.730> is<00:03:40.000> great<00:03:40.269> um<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:41.139> only<00:03:41.260> thing

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
connection is great um the only thing

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.839 
connection is great um the only thing
I've<00:03:41.680> noticed<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:42.099> with<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> current

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
I've noticed is with the current

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.740 
I've noticed is with the current
firmware<00:03:43.150> update<00:03:43.780> for<00:03:44.379> PlayStation<00:03:45.099> the<00:03:45.750> one

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
firmware update for PlayStation the one

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.979 
firmware update for PlayStation the one
two<00:03:47.109> and<00:03:47.440> three<00:03:47.889> player<00:03:48.280> lights<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:49.750> are

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
two and three player lights that are

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.330 
two and three player lights that are
supposed<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.379> light<00:03:50.590> up<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.889> tell<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.160> which

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
supposed to light up to tell you which

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.430 
supposed to light up to tell you which
player<00:03:51.639> you<00:03:51.669> are<00:03:51.910> when<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.690> play<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:52.959> any<00:03:53.169> sort

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
player you are when you play in any sort

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.309 
player you are when you play in any sort
of<00:03:53.530> game<00:03:53.739> don't<00:03:54.069> work<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:55.090> just<00:03:55.389> lights<00:03:55.930> up<00:03:56.139> the

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
of game don't work it just lights up the

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.530 
of game don't work it just lights up the
entire<00:03:56.620> circle<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.609> you<00:03:57.699> can't<00:03:57.970> tell<00:03:58.209> but

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
entire circle and you can't tell but

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.449 
entire circle and you can't tell but
that's<00:03:58.840> not<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.079> huge<00:03:59.379> deal<00:03:59.620> obviously<00:04:00.370> if

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
that's not a huge deal obviously if

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.890 
that's not a huge deal obviously if
you're<00:04:00.579> playing<00:04:00.790> by<00:04:00.940> yourself<00:04:01.030> it's<00:04:01.480> fine<00:04:01.690> and

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
you're playing by yourself it's fine and

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.939 
you're playing by yourself it's fine and
if<00:04:01.989> you're<00:04:02.139> playing<00:04:02.319> with<00:04:02.500> friends<00:04:02.650> it's

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
if you're playing with friends it's

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.430 
if you're playing with friends it's
pretty<00:04:03.160> easy<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.609> figure<00:04:03.819> out<00:04:04.199> what<00:04:05.199> player

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
pretty easy to figure out what player

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.770 
pretty easy to figure out what player
you<00:04:05.680> are<00:04:05.709> so<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.699> haven't<00:04:07.209> really<00:04:07.480> had<00:04:07.720> any

that<00:04:29.800> likes<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.400> idea<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.060> Xbox<00:04:31.479> control

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
that likes the idea of the Xbox control

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.230 
that likes the idea of the Xbox control
in<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> ergonomics<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.919> Xbox<00:04:33.580> controller

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
in the ergonomics of the Xbox controller

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.689 
in the ergonomics of the Xbox controller
but<00:04:34.510> they<00:04:34.750> want<00:04:35.199> to<00:04:35.260> stick<00:04:35.440> with<00:04:35.560> their<00:04:35.740> ps3<00:04:36.250> so

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.450 
but they want to stick with their ps3 so
great<00:04:37.600> option<00:04:38.260> if<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.800> don't<00:04:39.040> want<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.250> go<00:04:39.340> out

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
great option if you don't want to go out

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.909

and<00:04:39.699> buy<00:04:39.960> triple-a<00:04:40.960> batteries<00:04:41.440> then<00:04:41.740> I<00:04:41.860> do

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
and buy triple-a batteries then I do

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.770 
and buy triple-a batteries then I do
suggest<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.639> get<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.970> power<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.330> Pro

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
suggest that you get the power a Pro

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.780 
suggest that you get the power a Pro
Elite<00:04:44.020> which<00:04:44.290> I<00:04:44.470> might<00:04:44.680> be<00:04:44.800> doing<00:04:45.040> soon<00:04:45.370> anyway

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
Elite which I might be doing soon anyway

but<00:04:46.600> for<00:04:47.020> now<00:04:47.169> this<00:04:47.470> will<00:04:47.650> work<00:04:47.680> great<00:04:47.860> and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
but for now this will work great and

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.060 
but for now this will work great and
it's<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.820> it's<00:04:49.330> a<00:04:49.510> nice<00:04:49.720> cheap<00:04:50.290> alternative<00:04:51.040> to
