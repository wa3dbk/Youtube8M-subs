00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.720
We still going? 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.769
It's gonna get dark soon.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:13.761
It's gonna be too late.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.120
You should both stay.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.280
I don't plan on keeping him out there that long.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.160
We got him didn't we?

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.360
Just stay where you're at.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.560
Is that Mr. Mitchell?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.640
We can't say anything to anybody.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.600
Why?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.829
Because he's dead on my land. That's why.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.270
Now I got to go finish it.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.670
If you ain't gonna tell...

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.200
...why don't you just go dump Mr. Marion in
the river?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.320
I told you you shouldn't take him with you.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.860
We're gonna be fine...

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.200
...we'll be JUST fine.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.720
There's a time to keep you mouth shut...

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.360
...this'd be one of them times.
