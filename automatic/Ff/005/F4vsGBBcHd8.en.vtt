temperature<00:00:11.389> 43<00:00:12.459> f50<00:00:18.310> as<00:00:19.310> you<00:00:19.520> heard<00:00:19.759> on<00:00:20.029> the

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
temperature 43 f50 as you heard on the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.030 
temperature 43 f50 as you heard on the
sound<00:00:20.960> system<00:00:21.200> in<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.590> house<00:00:21.770> the

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
sound system in the house the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.029 
sound system in the house the
temperature<00:00:22.490> is<00:00:22.610> 43<00:00:23.090> degrees<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.830> we're<00:00:24.949> going

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
temperature is 43 degrees so we're going

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.060 
temperature is 43 degrees so we're going
to<00:00:25.100> do<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.279> cold<00:00:25.730> starting<00:00:26.300> video<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.070> 1978

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070

Mercury<00:00:28.519> Grand<00:00:28.609> Marquis

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.639 

the<00:00:47.969> only<00:00:48.149> thing<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.540> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.140> I've<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the only thing about this is I've got to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.400 
the only thing about this is I've got to
keep<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.980> foot<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> accelerator<00:00:51.410> because

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
keep my foot on the accelerator because

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.060 
keep my foot on the accelerator because
the<00:00:53.040> I<00:00:53.540> don't<00:00:54.540> think<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> automatic<00:00:55.440> choke<00:00:55.769> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the I don't think the automatic choke is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.780 
the I don't think the automatic choke is
really<00:00:56.489> working<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:58.220> you<00:00:59.220> can<00:00:59.370> hear<00:00:59.610> it's

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
really working on this you can hear it's

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:11.460 
really working on this you can hear it's
not<00:01:00.000> running<00:01:00.720> very<00:01:00.930> smoothly

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.470 

I'd<00:01:12.040> really<00:01:12.280> like<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.580> convert<00:01:13.030> over<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.330> a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
I'd really like to convert over to a

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.930 
I'd really like to convert over to a
manual<00:01:14.020> choke<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:14.800> have<00:01:15.010> better<00:01:15.280> control<00:01:15.910> of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
manual choke so I have better control of

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.270 
manual choke so I have better control of
the<00:01:16.390> fuel-to-air<00:01:16.810> mixture

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 

because<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.270> let<00:01:21.510> off<00:01:21.690> but<00:01:21.930> let<00:01:22.350> off

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
because if I just let off but let off

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.010 
because if I just let off but let off
the<00:01:22.650> gas<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.670> probably<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.360> stall<00:01:24.660> out<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the gas it probably will stall out and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.380 
the gas it probably will stall out and
it's<00:01:25.530> real<00:01:25.740> difficult<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> get<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.730> restarted

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it's real difficult to get it restarted

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.790 
it's real difficult to get it restarted
almost<00:01:28.110> acts<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.770> flooded<00:01:30.590> when<00:01:31.590> that

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
almost acts like it's flooded when that

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.690 
almost acts like it's flooded when that
happens<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:33.390> I've<00:01:33.600> I've<00:01:34.440> got<00:01:34.560> places<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.160> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
happens so I've I've got places to be so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.180 
happens so I've I've got places to be so
I<00:01:35.729> gotta<00:01:36.000> let<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.770> I'm<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
I gotta let it I'm not going to

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.190 
I gotta let it I'm not going to
demonstrate<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:39.150> happens<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.810> let<00:01:39.990> off<00:01:40.170> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
demonstrate what happens if I let off of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.730 
demonstrate what happens if I let off of
the<00:01:40.650> accelerator<00:01:42.020> I'm<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> let<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.470> warm

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the accelerator I'm going to let it warm

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.790 
the accelerator I'm going to let it warm
up<00:01:44.479> until<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> temperature<00:01:46.080> gets<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.530> at

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
up until the temperature gets to at

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800 
up until the temperature gets to at
least<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.190> hundred<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.580> sixty<00:01:47.940> degrees<00:01:48.300> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
least a hundred and sixty degrees I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.750 
least a hundred and sixty degrees I
think<00:01:49.380> once<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.040> gets<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
think once it gets up to that

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.560 
think once it gets up to that
temperature<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:52.460> heat<00:01:53.460> from<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> engine

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
temperature the heat from the engine

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.380 
temperature the heat from the engine
around<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.470> carburetor<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.790> enough<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
around the carburetor is enough to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.859 
around the carburetor is enough to
vaporize<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:58.200> fuel<00:01:58.530> more<00:01:59.119> and<00:02:00.119> let<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.660> run

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
vaporize the fuel more and let it run

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
vaporize the fuel more and let it run
smoothly<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.220> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.580> summer<00:02:02.759> time

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
smoothly I know in the summer time

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.420 
smoothly I know in the summer time
starting<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.750> no<00:02:03.899> problem<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.160> I<00:02:05.190> think<00:02:05.369> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
starting is no problem so I think you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
starting is no problem so I think you
just<00:02:05.580> got<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.789> lot<00:02:06.030> better<00:02:06.210> gasoline

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
just got a lot better gasoline

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.060 
just got a lot better gasoline
vaporization<00:02:08.119> but<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> cold<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
vaporization but in the cold and the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.630 
vaporization but in the cold and the
cold<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.209> needs<00:02:12.450> some<00:02:12.600> extra<00:02:13.280> care<00:02:14.280> and

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
cold it just needs some extra care and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.570 
cold it just needs some extra care and
getting<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.030> started<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.660> keeping<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.110> Ronnie

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.760 

ah<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.470> thermostat<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.460> started<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.000> open<00:02:22.770> so

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
ah the thermostat is started to open so

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.580 
ah the thermostat is started to open so
it's<00:02:23.890> beginning<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.340> warm<00:02:24.670> up<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:26.290> want<00:02:26.470> to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
it's beginning to warm up really want to

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.860 
it's beginning to warm up really want to
let<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.740> get<00:02:26.950> up<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.250> 160<00:02:28.210> before<00:02:28.600> flipping

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
let it get up to 160 before flipping

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.320 
let it get up to 160 before flipping
gear<00:02:31.590> okay<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:32.770> now<00:02:32.920> at<00:02:33.100> 160<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.210> gonna

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
gear okay it's now at 160 so I'm gonna

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.900 
gear okay it's now at 160 so I'm gonna
let<00:02:34.600> up<00:02:34.750> off<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.140> gas<00:02:38.280> okay<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:39.700> still

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
let up off the gas okay it's still

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.840 
let up off the gas okay it's still
running<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.710> parting<00:02:42.100> gear<00:02:42.370> we'll<00:02:42.520> see<00:02:42.730> if

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
running and a parting gear we'll see if

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.000 
running and a parting gear we'll see if
it<00:02:44.400> okay<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.720> still<00:02:46.990> going<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.710> that's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
it okay and it's still going so that's

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.390 
it okay and it's still going so that's
good<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.990> think<00:02:49.990> if<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.380> didn't<00:02:50.650> let<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:50.830> warm<00:02:51.130> up

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
good I think if I didn't let it warm up

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.340 
good I think if I didn't let it warm up
like<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.270> though<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.690> wouldn't<00:02:52.930> still<00:02:53.320> be

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
like that though it wouldn't still be

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.430 
like that though it wouldn't still be
running<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.810> because<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
running just because of the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.660 
running just because of the
peculiarities<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.490> this<00:02:58.000> carburetor<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.640> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
peculiarities of this carburetor so I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.300 
peculiarities of this carburetor so I
think<00:03:00.780> once<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.930> adjust<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.440> for<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.770> a<00:03:03.010> good

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
think once you adjust it for a a good
