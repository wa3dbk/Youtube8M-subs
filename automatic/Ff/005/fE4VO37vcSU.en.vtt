now<00:02:10.030> let's<00:02:10.240> go<00:02:10.810> over<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.290> actual<00:02:11.590> beads<00:02:11.800> to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
now let's go over to the actual beads to

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.610 
now let's go over to the actual beads to
see<00:02:12.070> how<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.250> compares<00:02:12.610> um<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.930> would<00:02:14.200> say<00:02:14.230> it's

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
see how it compares um I would say it's

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.370 
see how it compares um I would say it's
pretty<00:02:15.040> close<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.670> only<00:02:16.030> thing<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:17.110> kind<00:02:17.320> of

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
pretty close the only thing that kind of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.260 
pretty close the only thing that kind of
bothers<00:02:17.710> me<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> little<00:02:18.040> bit<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.520> if<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> take<00:02:19.240> a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
bothers me a little bit is if you take a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.230 
bothers me a little bit is if you take a
line<00:02:19.570> almost<00:02:19.870> divide<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> pizza<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.860> half

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
line almost divide the pizza in half

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.449 
line almost divide the pizza in half
there<00:02:22.240> are<00:02:22.330> very<00:02:22.540> few<00:02:22.990> onions<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.160> see

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
there are very few onions as you can see

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.480 
there are very few onions as you can see
on<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.820> side<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.959> pizza<00:02:26.230> really<00:02:26.590> at<00:02:26.920> all

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
on that side of the pizza really at all

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.940 
on that side of the pizza really at all
so<00:02:28.030> could<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:28.930> use<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.140> little<00:02:29.440> better<00:02:29.560> topping

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
so could it use a little better topping

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.940 
so could it use a little better topping

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
little bit too much crust throughout

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.490 
little bit too much crust throughout
throughout<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.000> whole<00:03:40.150> thing<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:41.019> kind<00:03:41.470> of

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
throughout the whole thing and I kind of

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.780 
throughout the whole thing and I kind of
watered<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:41.829> all<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.129> just<00:03:42.280> my<00:03:42.400> head<00:03:42.609> would

watered you all is it just my head would

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.539 
watered you all is it just my head would
not<00:03:42.940> but<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.660> more<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.900> checked<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:44.379> out<00:03:44.549> right

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
not but the more I checked it out right

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.400 
not but the more I checked it out right
here<00:03:45.760> on<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.180> front<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.420> box<00:03:46.569> it<00:03:46.959> says<00:03:47.170> our

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
here on the front of box it says our

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.710 
here on the front of box it says our
original<00:03:47.890> restaurant<00:03:48.280> style<00:03:48.640> crust<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.690> I

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
original restaurant style crust so I

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.780 
original restaurant style crust so I
think<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.319> other<00:03:50.530> one<00:03:50.799> was<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.040> thin<00:03:51.310> crust<00:03:51.549> and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
think the other one was a thin crust and

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.849 
think the other one was a thin crust and
this<00:03:51.879> is<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.750> more<00:03:52.959> hand-tossed<00:03:53.440> crust

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
this is the the more hand-tossed crust

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.250 
this is the the more hand-tossed crust
so<00:03:54.489> that<00:03:54.940> was<00:03:55.150> really<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.750> only<00:03:56.079> major

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
so that was really the only major

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.589 
so that was really the only major
observation<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.310> had<00:03:57.549> toppings<00:03:58.420> were

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
observation that I had toppings were

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.330 
observation that I had toppings were
