00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.870
 at 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.819
 Yes 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.580
 no 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.750
 1 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.450
 so I ask it's yesterday and 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.400
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.410
 new video we will see how 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.020
 install cute minecraft mode 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.380
 so the first thing we will do if 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.140
 we will leave with a clean minecraft 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.150
 without anything if you ever do not want 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.739
 leave with an anchor harp dress I 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.989
 assume that you know what 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.550
 you do if you know if the modes 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.129
 are compatible and so it's in 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.500
 principle of shares in this video 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.870
 so I'm going to assume that 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.340
 I install the mode any minitel at the same 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.850
 minecraft mini theme time 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.370
 millions and small fans 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.360
 so we wait if you do not know 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.130
 small fine you 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 if you put a hd textures pack there 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.790
 would you spend with sl patch 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.370
 for the patch and where so first time 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.340
 3rd 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.740
 take back 1.1 kraft clean so we do 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.350
 start running here if you do not have it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.820
 not you make the key windows r so 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.480
 the windows key that's what sets 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.370
 between control halt left if ever 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.570
 you have a notebook usually 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.940
 it's between fn and stop so here you type 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.230
 to deal with it data % makes you ok there 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.340
 will bring you back to that folder that has 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.220
 a folder to hide so that's why 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.140
 that we typed it for his grandpa data % you 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.280
 can also go very well here if 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.150
 you never have the bar at the top for 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.160
 type text 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.120
 finally the path you type% to 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.310
 grandpa data had paid data% and that makes 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.530
 the same thing 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.300
 then validating pending files 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.240
 kraft is normally here you go 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.010
 have a lot of stuff you delete all 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.010
 at least that's how we go back with 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.650
 a clean stuff then we'll go 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.560
 launch the minecraft was doing so that 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:05.150
 download from the minecraft website 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.940
 we connect well after that it's 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.600
 your thing do not bother copying up 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.800
 and we'll wait for him to finish 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.300
 download all the stuff how do 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.040
 found with a minecraft that is 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.790
 totally clean pure what you 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.980
 want and at least there will be no 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.980
 conflict between modes so here it is 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.530
 finished us what will interest us for 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.760
 moment these folders become so here 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.620
 we do not bring kraft - kind you open 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.870
 with winrar oussadit since you want 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.580
 is in we're going to put the modes so 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.570
 first thing to do we remove the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.220
 meta a pouf sees the second thing for 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.910
 this mode we need minecraft forges 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.560
 so we will go to the forge site 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.970
 so frozen by here picketing technique 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.410
 so here it is here micra forge 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.660
 point of being slash forum annexing you 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.470
 do as you normally want 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.110
 you just have east on minecraft 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.680
 ci.net slash forum an internship forum i 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.680
 think it should be enough 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.230
 so here is the dance and henri 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.930
 live here and so you take this for 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.910
 the version that a 2 5 1 3 of 1.4 of 1 4 to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.390
 4.5 so I 'm a 4/6 so I 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.400
 take the 6.5 zero point here we are here 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.880
 request universal source or javadoc so 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.910
 you as a customer you take 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.910
 universal are it's for for those who 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 knows for those who do modding and 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.540
 javadoc is the documentation so we 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.480
 we take universal so the best is 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.040
 take it to others it's a little bit 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.380

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.010

 before small fine but not because the 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.910
 million mode does not put itself in a 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.500
 crush point there yes so if we ever 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.020
 go on the page but kraft million who 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.970
 is the official topic at the same time for 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.289
 those who ask me every time 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.240
 how do you install you go down a 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:33.039
 little and each time there is some 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:36.070
 installations instruction prerequisites 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.650
 to install so that's gone new 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.460
 version there is need of just forges 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.800
 folders in your purposes in the form 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.510
 and downloaded are the belem on it 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.099
 melun wank and he tells you that it's 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.330
 here to go nova download and you 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.520
 just say we need forge for 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.240
 then install his share of the 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.440
 principle you know a threshold 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.500
 usually times there is even a trick 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.210
 in the arctic or download so that has 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.190
 been moved here downloads tells us 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.120
 so that's minecraft million 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.669
 we take it in the iss which alas 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.560
 millions here and here we have a trick of 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:12.340
 naudin 4,6 so this is for us the art and 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.530
 4 6 2 do not harm dropbox because it's ok 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.490
 to be faster 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.699
 good I prefer you do like you 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.530
 want after and with this million mode 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.159
 that we downloaded is all that 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.949
 we have to do 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:29.380
 we install but we install how 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.940
 it's simple you have something where his 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:36.230
 marks and what were so 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.570
 what or where is it going the content of this 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.750
 folder must go in your point of a 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.670
 hour graph for lan mode clients 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.440
 so assures you a server it is necessary that 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.910
 it goes into the thing there is only one 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.020
 fashion file so there is a trick 7up 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.370
 you take all the files that there are 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.010
 in and you move them in the 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.140
 point folder minecraft hop you the 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.250
 put in you do merge the 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.620
 records because they already have and 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.720
 this is your coming install so 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.110
 now you just have to throw 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:11.120

 I can put textures pack hd 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:21.440
 since I have that I did with 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.540
 to small fine if that's so if we 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.970
 go in the mode we can see that we have the 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.330
 fashion technical team the cute fashion that 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.100
