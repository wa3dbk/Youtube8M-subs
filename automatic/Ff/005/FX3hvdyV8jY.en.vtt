00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.250 

I<00:03:56.950> expect<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.970> mega<00:03:58.270> knees<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> straight-shooter

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
I expect a mega knees a straight-shooter

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:09.420 
I expect a mega knees a straight-shooter
just<00:03:59.890> look<00:04:00.010> at<00:04:00.160> them<00:04:00.310> young<00:04:00.520> eyes

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.710 

till<00:04:10.430> we<00:04:10.550> cut<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.990> now<00:04:12.160> can<00:04:13.160> go<00:04:13.940> long<00:04:14.120> see<00:04:14.480> that

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
till we cut it now can go long see that

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.199 
till we cut it now can go long see that
blue<00:04:15.050> if<00:04:15.980> he<00:04:16.160> can<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.750> rack<00:04:17.989> is<00:04:19.060> shaping<00:04:20.060> up

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
blue if he can this rack is shaping up

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.940 
blue if he can this rack is shaping up
very<00:04:20.450> nicely<00:04:20.660> for<00:04:21.019> him<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:21.500> think<00:04:21.560> there

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
very nicely for him and I think there

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.070 
very nicely for him and I think there
might<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:22.160> be<00:04:22.700> enough<00:04:22.910> we'd<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.360> get

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
might just be enough we'd have to get

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.860 
might just be enough we'd have to get
the<00:04:24.230> right<00:04:24.380> camera<00:04:24.680> angle<00:04:25.100> but<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:26.600> doesn't

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
the right camera angle but that doesn't

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.330 
the right camera angle but that doesn't
look<00:04:26.960> too<00:04:27.110> clever

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.040 

so<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.370> chance<00:04:35.730> here<00:04:36.060> for<00:04:36.270> Lou<00:04:36.840> Wong<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.900> get

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
so a chance here for Lou Wong to get

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.380 
so a chance here for Lou Wong to get
back<00:04:40.230> in<00:04:40.380> control<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.890> table<00:04:41.390> camera

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
back in control of the table camera

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.850 
back in control of the table camera
which<00:04:42.690> shows<00:04:42.900> us<00:04:43.080> everything<00:04:43.470> we<00:04:43.560> needed<00:04:43.740> to

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
which shows us everything we needed to

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.950 
which shows us everything we needed to
see<00:04:45.740> well<00:04:46.740> even<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.370> Jeff<00:04:48.030> loses<00:04:48.540> this<00:04:48.660> rack

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
see well even if Jeff loses this rack

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.120 
see well even if Jeff loses this rack
it's<00:04:49.170> not<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.470> end<00:04:49.590> of<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.740> world<00:04:49.890> because

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
it's not the end of the world because

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.330 
it's not the end of the world because
the<00:04:50.670> long<00:04:50.960> broke<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.440> he<00:04:52.470> probably<00:04:53.070> should

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
the long broke so he probably should

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.180 
the long broke so he probably should
have<00:04:53.370> ran<00:04:53.580> out<00:04:53.610> anyway<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.450> it's<00:04:55.170> not<00:04:55.350> that<00:04:55.410> big

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
have ran out anyway so it's not that big

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.020 
have ran out anyway so it's not that big
of<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.370> swing<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:59.310> he's<00:04:59.460> still<00:04:59.640> early<00:04:59.790> in<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
of a swing and he's still early in the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.760 
of a swing and he's still early in the
match<00:05:00.150> as<00:05:00.360> well<00:05:00.480> Jeff<00:05:00.810> by<00:05:01.530> these<00:05:01.770> time<00:05:06.770> having
