 while here it is very good if in addition 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.800
 is the control which looks pretty 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.800

 the projects since you enter this one 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.660
 a severe penalty to be 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.150

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.940
