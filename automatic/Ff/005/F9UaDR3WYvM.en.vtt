00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.250

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.999
 rat the man of time 5 is us 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.150
 spending the day in pance atom and 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:20.800
 Pennsylvania 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.419
 nor scratch sound the navel trick 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.369

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.189
 but faithful is about to discover that 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.599
 not only is he trapped in atom pance for 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.100
 leave today sir with the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.170

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.250
 distressed 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.340
 the probabilities of splitting are 80% 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.640
 but now we could do what 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.740

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 living life as if there were no 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.530
