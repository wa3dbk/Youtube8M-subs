00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
now just like the regular 360 flip this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.680 
now just like the regular 360 flip this
trick<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.890> basically<00:00:56.460> all<00:00:56.730> done<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.539> this

it's not even that drastic it's more of
just<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.240> slight<00:01:12.810> motion<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> give

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
just a slight motion up just to give

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.740 
just a slight motion up just to give
your<00:01:14.970> board<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.590> scoop<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> when

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
your board a little bit of scoop so when

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it does the 360 it also flips so while

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.859 
it does the 360 it also flips so while
riding<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> fakie<00:01:23.790> position<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.659> your

important step so with that scoop and
your<00:01:35.939> board<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.840> rotation

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
your board is going to do that rotation

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.580 
your board is going to do that rotation
you're<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.000> catch<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.540> again<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you're going to catch it again with this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.780 
you're going to catch it again with this
foot<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.579> bring<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.090> foot<00:01:42.360> down<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.790> put

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
direction I know that seems like a lot

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.220 
direction I know that seems like a lot
can<00:02:37.560> go<00:02:37.590> wrong<00:02:37.739> but<00:02:38.370> honestly<00:02:38.840> once<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.989> have

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
