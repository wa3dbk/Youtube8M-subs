00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.389 
side that people don't normally get to
see<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.270> raw<00:00:45.480> side<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.190> authentic<00:00:47.190> side

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
see a more raw side and authentic side

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.279 
see a more raw side and authentic side
and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> guess<00:00:47.969> coming<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> album

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and I guess coming out with this album

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.290 
and I guess coming out with this album
I'm<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:50.399> wanting<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.820> make<00:00:50.969> sure<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.180> do

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I'm really wanting to make sure I do

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.209 
I'm really wanting to make sure I do
that<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.809> an<00:00:52.079> artist<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.410> people<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> know

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
that as an artist so people get to know

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.340 
that as an artist so people get to know
me<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:54.600> they<00:00:54.690> hear<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.110> song

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
me so I think when they hear this song

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
me so I think when they hear this song
they'll<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.980> me<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.699> think<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
they'll get to know me more I think I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.939 
they'll get to know me more I think I
recorded<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.809> three<00:00:58.109> takes<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
recorded it in three takes and if you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.729 
recorded it in three takes and if you
really<00:00:59.550> listen<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> album<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.590> can

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
really listen to the album you can

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.939 
really listen to the album you can
probably<00:01:02.190> hear<00:01:02.789> my<00:01:03.030> snot<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:04.439> voice<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.920> a

probably hear my snot and my voice is a
bit<00:01:05.369> more<00:01:05.610> nasally<00:01:06.119> than<00:01:06.299> usual<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
bit more nasally than usual because I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.160

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
too much about it I just wanted it to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.850 
too much about it I just wanted it to
come<00:01:22.590> from<00:01:22.850> my<00:01:23.850> heart<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.180> soul<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.140> gut

I<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.640> shot<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> video<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.330> London

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I actually just shot the video in London

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.460 
I actually just shot the video in London
last<00:01:28.049> week<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:30.360> probably<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:31.320> what

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
last week and it's probably not what

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
last week and it's probably not what
people<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> expect<00:01:32.280> as<00:01:32.520> well<00:01:33.090> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
people are going to expect as well I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
people are going to expect as well I
wanted<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.380> rip<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.770> all<00:01:34.890> back<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
wanted to just rip it all back and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.539 
wanted to just rip it all back and
basically<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.479> one<00:01:36.900> take<00:01:37.250> one<00:01:38.250> shot

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
basically it's a one take one shot

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.310 
basically it's a one take one shot
performance<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.509> might<00:01:39.659> even<00:01:39.689> be<00:01:40.079> live

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
performance and it might even be live

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960 
performance and it might even be live
because<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.770> did<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.130> live<00:01:41.340> takes<00:01:41.670> where<00:01:41.880> I'm

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

decided to title the album big fat lie
because<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.260> number<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.590> reasons<00:02:44.709> it's<00:02:45.400> got

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
because for a number of reasons it's got

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.120 
because for a number of reasons it's got
many<00:02:45.790> meanings<00:02:46.269> first<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.989> all<00:02:47.140> there's<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.950> lot

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
many meanings first of all there's a lot

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.120 
many meanings first of all there's a lot
of<00:02:48.220> misconceptions<00:02:49.000> about<00:02:49.150> me<00:02:49.540> out<00:02:49.690> there<00:02:50.130> for

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
of misconceptions about me out there for

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.650 
of misconceptions about me out there for
other<00:02:51.340> people<00:02:51.430> things<00:02:52.060> aren't<00:02:52.239> always<00:02:52.450> what

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
other people things aren't always what

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.589 
other people things aren't always what
they<00:02:52.870> appear<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.769> or<00:02:54.069> what<00:02:54.489> always<00:02:54.700> things

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
they appear to be or what always things

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.240 
they appear to be or what always things
aren't<00:02:55.810> always<00:02:55.959> what<00:02:56.110> they<00:02:56.230> seem<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.650> be<00:02:56.890> right

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
aren't always what they seem to be right

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.440 
aren't always what they seem to be right
and<00:02:58.709> another<00:02:59.709> reason<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.700> big<00:03:00.880> fat<00:03:01.060> lies<00:03:01.269> I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
and another reason is the big fat lies I

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.259
