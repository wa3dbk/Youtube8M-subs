00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.330
 first pretty nice jump with a 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:38.239
 little point in the air yes it's a 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:43.190
 perfect smooth landing perfect 

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:43.190
 to my good old daughter had missed 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.160
 we will accelerate another small solal 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.970
 very nice going between 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.970
 two bridges it's original 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.470
 perfect wise terry and our heritage 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.520
 like a shit 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.200
 obviously just before I tested the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.190
 race before you do it on video 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.270
 obviously I made jumps 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.220
 beautiful etc 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.090
 and here I film I make seals 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.090
 shit and I apologize 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:21.150
 we will try to redo it and without this 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:23.400
 yolo shit not short we will continue on 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.460
 not going to dwell on a defeat like 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.210
 that's still there is still a small 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.210
 jump over a point 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.280
 no remark on this soil and teigneux 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.280
 do not look any further 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.760
 completely normal backcountry highway 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.830
 it shocks nobody 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.090
 but in a little bit wrong the summit 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.680
 thankfully the person did not think about 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.760
 put a little good springboard two 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.760
 once it starts to fear 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.440
 why here we are but we are not discouraged 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.440
 we leave 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:21.689
 it is good again perfect perfect 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.689
 perfect perfect except that no 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.500
 here for now it's just two 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.870
 three jumps here's a little bit good 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.340
 placed but otherwise there's not much 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.620
 thing I was expecting maybe more than 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.670
 his goal the name of the race but that's it 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:45.100
 I'm not going I'm not going to complain 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.660
 Come on, I'll miss you 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.000
 to say a little bit of spice makes it a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.000
 little originality in the race 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.530
 what is she want she 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.300
 why not go on we continue our 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.300
 fired in a los santos 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.000
 ah, here's all originality we're going 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.860
 pass over on the roof of a 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.110
 message by philippe no no no no no 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.110
 no no yeah it could have been better 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.840
 a little bit that I will try to 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.840
 do something hu 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.470
 yeah I smashed the back found that 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.130
 the right it's really weird to 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.930
 the back so we come to the line 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:49.610
 just arrived shortly after 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:49.610
 this little jump to the French pole 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.720
 so here I hope that this little 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.430
 test activity video will have pleased you even 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.930
 if I did a little bit of shit 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.650
 but it's not big deal 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.880

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.139

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.699
