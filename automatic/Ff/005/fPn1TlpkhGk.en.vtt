00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
I mean it's not a big deal I suppose I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.620 
I mean it's not a big deal I suppose I
can<00:00:19.949> see<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> box<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.670> just<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.970> box<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:21.510> not

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
really poking through the keys I
