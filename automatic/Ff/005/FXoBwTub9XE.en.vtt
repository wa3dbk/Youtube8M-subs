that<00:01:56.900> I<00:01:56.930> had<00:01:57.229> about<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.560> half<00:01:57.860> inch<00:01:58.159> more<00:01:58.549> of<00:01:58.840> new

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
that I had about a half inch more of new

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.990 
that I had about a half inch more of new
growth<00:02:00.170> than<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.530> did<00:02:00.799> on<00:02:01.220> this<00:02:01.549> side<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:01.880> this

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
growth than I did on this side and this

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.749 
growth than I did on this side and this
typically<00:02:02.750> grows<00:02:03.140> faster<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.189> as<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.430> already

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
typically grows faster and as I already

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.969 
typically grows faster and as I already
always<00:02:05.090> been<00:02:05.360> thicker<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:06.409> was<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.680> wow

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
always been thicker and I was like wow

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.089 
always been thicker and I was like wow
this<00:02:07.460> stuff<00:02:07.820> really<00:02:08.269> does<00:02:08.599> work<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.619> once<00:02:09.920> my

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
this stuff really does work so once my

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.530 
this stuff really does work so once my
edges<00:02:10.489> grew<00:02:10.640> back<00:02:10.789> in<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.180> can't<00:02:11.390> even

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
edges grew back in and you can't even

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.830 
edges grew back in and you can't even
really<00:02:11.689> tell<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.530> know<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.680> year<00:02:12.950> ago<00:02:13.159> I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
really tell that you know a year ago I

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.269 
really tell that you know a year ago I
had<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.109> know<00:02:15.230> thinness<00:02:15.620> right<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:16.159> mean

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:16.279 
had you know thinness right here mean

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.140 
had you know thinness right here mean
you<00:02:16.370> can't<00:02:16.579> even<00:02:16.669> see

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
you can't even see

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.000 
you can't even see
I<00:02:17.180> would<00:02:17.659> part<00:02:18.019> like<00:02:18.469> my<00:02:18.650> hair

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
I would part like my hair

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.740 
I would part like my hair
like<00:02:19.220> right<00:02:19.400> here<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.819> there<00:02:20.239> be<00:02:20.390> like<00:02:20.569> these

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
like right here and there be like these

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.030 
like right here and there be like these
big<00:02:21.140> gaps<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:22.129> was<00:02:22.340> crazy<00:02:22.640> but<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.659> use<00:02:24.079> this<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
big gaps it was crazy but I use this and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.710 
big gaps it was crazy but I use this and
then<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:25.250> course<00:02:25.519> it's<00:02:25.849> been<00:02:26.060> 11<00:02:26.420> months<00:02:26.569> since

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
then of course it's been 11 months since

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.780 
then of course it's been 11 months since
my<00:02:26.989> last<00:02:27.170> relaxer<00:02:27.799> now<00:02:28.010> I've<00:02:28.310> been

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
my last relaxer now I've been

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.910 
my last relaxer now I've been
texturizing<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:30.079> that<00:02:30.290> has<00:02:30.439> helped<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.890> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
texturizing so that has helped to I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.059 
texturizing so that has helped to I
haven't<00:02:31.189> had<00:02:31.430> strong<00:02:31.760> chemicals<00:02:32.299> on<00:02:32.540> my<00:02:32.569> hair

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
haven't had strong chemicals on my hair

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.110 
haven't had strong chemicals on my hair
but<00:02:34.069> watch<00:02:34.250> if<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.700> were<00:02:34.790> wondering<00:02:34.939> about

but watch if you were wondering about

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.789 
but watch if you were wondering about
the<00:02:35.329> texturizer<00:02:35.690> watch<00:02:36.049> my<00:02:36.230> first<00:02:36.409> video<00:02:36.620> on

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
the texturizer watch my first video on

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.259 
the texturizer watch my first video on
this<00:02:36.980> channel<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.430> you'll<00:02:37.579> understand<00:02:38.060> what

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
this channel and you'll understand what

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.289 
this channel and you'll understand what
I<00:02:38.299> meant<00:02:38.420> by<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.230> why<00:02:39.379> I<00:02:39.409> was<00:02:39.739> doing<00:02:39.920> that

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
I meant by that and why I was doing that

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.809 
I meant by that and why I was doing that
but<00:02:41.299> I'm<00:02:41.870> transitioning<00:02:42.409> with<00:02:43.190> no<00:02:43.340> chemical

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
but I'm transitioning with no chemical

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.520 
but I'm transitioning with no chemical
right<00:02:43.970> now<00:02:44.150> I'm<00:02:44.360> about<00:02:44.540> ten<00:02:44.870> nine<00:02:45.140> ten<00:02:45.379> weeks

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
right now I'm about ten nine ten weeks

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.349 
right now I'm about ten nine ten weeks
out<00:02:45.769> since<00:02:46.640> my<00:02:46.760> last<00:02:46.940> process<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:49.519> I've<00:02:50.120> been

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
out since my last process so I've been

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.899 
out since my last process so I've been
using<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:50.840> again<00:02:51.290> because<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.220> want<00:02:52.640> my<00:02:52.760> hair

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
using this again because I want my hair

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.740 
using this again because I want my hair
to<00:02:53.030> grow<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.540> want<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:54.879> big<00:02:55.879> shot<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.329> happen

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
to grow I want that big shot to happen

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.629 
to grow I want that big shot to happen
this<00:02:56.989> transition<00:02:57.560> process<00:02:57.799> I'm<00:02:58.250> already

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
this transition process I'm already

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.339 
this transition process I'm already
getting<00:02:59.000> antsy<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.629> I<00:02:59.690> see<00:02:59.989> what<00:03:00.230> people<00:03:01.299> shop

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
getting antsy and I see what people shop

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.530 
getting antsy and I see what people shop
earlier<00:03:03.349> than<00:03:03.590> they<00:03:03.709> intend<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:05.150> you

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
earlier than they intend to because you

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.319 
earlier than they intend to because you
just<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.349> it's<00:03:06.739> rough<00:03:06.950> managing<00:03:07.579> the<00:03:08.120> two

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
just it is it's rough managing the two

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.759 
just it is it's rough managing the two
textures<00:03:08.720> that's<00:03:09.049> why<00:03:09.200> I'm<00:03:09.260> doing<00:03:09.530> another

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
textures that's why I'm doing another

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.180 
textures that's why I'm doing another
updo<00:03:10.280> because<00:03:11.269> it's<00:03:11.420> just<00:03:11.569> easier<00:03:12.040> easier<00:03:13.040> for

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
updo because it's just easier easier for

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.770 
updo because it's just easier easier for
me<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.310> manage<00:03:13.639> but<00:03:13.790> when<00:03:14.209> you're<00:03:14.329> using<00:03:14.480> this

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.470 
typically do is just like spray just a
couple<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:45.019> pumps<00:03:45.530> do<00:03:46.160> this<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.760> then<00:03:47.299> like

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
couple of pumps do this and then like

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.259 
couple of pumps do this and then like
get<00:03:47.750> my<00:03:47.959> edges<00:03:48.590> especially<00:03:49.069> because<00:03:50.000> that's

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
get my edges especially because that's

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.909 
get my edges especially because that's
where<00:03:50.449> my<00:03:50.569> hair<00:03:50.780> even<00:03:50.989> though<00:03:51.349> it's<00:03:51.560> growing

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
where my hair even though it's growing

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.559 
where my hair even though it's growing
back<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.190> lot<00:03:52.489> that's<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.940> most<00:03:53.060> delicate<00:03:53.419> area

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
back a lot that's the most delicate area

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.259 
back a lot that's the most delicate area
because<00:03:54.349> this<00:03:54.470> also<00:03:55.030> protects<00:03:56.030> your<00:03:56.120> hair

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
because this also protects your hair

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.150 
because this also protects your hair
from<00:03:56.299> protection<00:03:56.840> or<00:03:56.930> from<00:03:57.049> shedding<00:03:57.319> as<00:03:57.859> well

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
from protection or from shedding as well

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.559 
from protection or from shedding as well
and<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.370> did<00:03:58.579> notice<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:59.000> little<00:03:59.150> bit<00:03:59.299> less

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
and I did notice a little bit less

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.150 
and I did notice a little bit less
shedding<00:03:59.870> as<00:04:00.139> well<00:04:00.379> especially<00:04:00.859> when<00:04:01.040> you're

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
shedding as well especially when you're

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.369 
shedding as well especially when you're
getting<00:04:01.549> when<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.090> was<00:04:02.299> relaxing<00:04:02.810> when<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.260> get

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
getting when I was relaxing when you get

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.140 
getting when I was relaxing when you get
closer<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.799> closer<00:04:03.949> to<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.250> relaxed<00:04:04.909> date

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
closer and closer to that relaxed date

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.550 
closer and closer to that relaxed date
you<00:04:05.629> know<00:04:05.720> how<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.900> have<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.109> little<00:04:06.349> bit<00:04:06.440> more

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
you know how you have a little bit more

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.409 
you know how you have a little bit more
shedding<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.099> so<00:04:07.280> since<00:04:07.849> I'm<00:04:08.030> transitioning

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
shedding and so since I'm transitioning

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.320 
shedding and so since I'm transitioning
now

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
now

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.820 
now
have<00:04:09.480> even<00:04:09.780> more<00:04:09.960> shedding<00:04:10.380> because<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.770> the

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
have even more shedding because of the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.910 
have even more shedding because of the
demarcation<00:04:11.250> line<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:13.260> would<00:04:13.830> definitely

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
demarcation line so I would definitely

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.280 
demarcation line so I would definitely
be<00:04:14.370> using<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.820> more<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.360> don't<00:04:15.900> like<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.260> use

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
be using this more I don't like to use

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.110 
be using this more I don't like to use
it<00:04:16.530> every<00:04:16.650> day<00:04:16.769> because<00:04:17.489> as<00:04:17.610> I<00:04:17.730> said<00:04:17.910> it's<00:04:18.090> very

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
it every day because as I said it's very

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.660 
it every day because as I said it's very
oily<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.810> don't<00:04:18.959> want<00:04:19.140> my<00:04:19.230> hair<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:20.250> get

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
heavy and way down because if you spray

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.010 
heavy and way down because if you spray

I'll use this maybe every other day and
I've<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.180> used<00:04:30.450> just<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.930> little<00:04:31.170> bit<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.470> it

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
I've just used just a little bit of it
