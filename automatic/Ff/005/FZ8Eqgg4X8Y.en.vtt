00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.580
 yes people left Daraa again 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.740
 it's about 10 market today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.169
 this is relatively important for me and indeed clear 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.939
 in Dölln spend my time at the computer 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.880
 and need a new keyboard quickly 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.650
 Eric Cantor, when I look at my old keyboard, I already have it 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.759
 a few years 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.409
 that's 15 of Logitech, of course 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.060
 and bruises 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.909
 Dr thereby that I just now from the SID accordingly 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:31.960
 you know for sure 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.130
 is he really around 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.220
 Switzerland produces something special that 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.000
 After a while, the keyboard is not quite as appetizing as one 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.310
 and promptly 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.010
 courageous 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 Now you just need the percent again a new keyboard 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.210
 I also chose Pastor there 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.090
 and that is the 110 of 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.050
 the logic is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 if the percent just the mixer how should I had the whole in the bio 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.830
 Description Honor link 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.140
 that yes, I think it is questionable whether a speaker 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.720
 and percentages 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.300
 Gerhard the Sacher why I'm there the percent 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.230
 who is doing here now is over 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.750
 I would really like to know what kind of four if you have 110 throat 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.740
 Trial 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.830
 You are satisfied with the keyboard 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.830
 are you not satisfied here is not satisfied why are you not 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.830
 satisfied 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 than those of other keyboard have 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.840
 Kö also like to say what she has from the keyboard and what he does 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
 Of that, kobinet holds that may even recommend 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.150
 and 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.040
 Yes 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.160
 I would be happy about comments 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.680
 So write diligently what he thinks of the keyboard 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.680
 Percent more fat also in other keyboard from maybe yours 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.000
 Keyboard in front 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.460
 yes 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.310
 I find that «process a sensible keyboard Rheine 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.639
 he has been fighting her computer plays 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.060
 but that's just important 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.060
 and matter since really have the keyboard 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.870
 a next to the once expanded he offered 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.619
 Dr 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.129
 because you are still pretty happy since August is not a new year 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.810
 maybe sometime on the 19th 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.359
 start exactly beat there 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.810
 So as I said instead of the comments what you say to go under 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.799
 scenes 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.799
 maybe add me another keyboard and 4 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:40.319
 Actually, that was it 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.439
 Until next time
