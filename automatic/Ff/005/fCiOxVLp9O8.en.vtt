I think that's because I'm randomed
if<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> random<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.040> hero<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.700> pick<00:01:11.939> which

if you random a hero in all pick which

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
if you random a hero in all pick which
is<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> mobile<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.799> pick<00:01:13.920> any

skill stifling dagger this is a really
good<00:02:09.959> example<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.349> how<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.860> all<00:02:10.890> skills<00:02:11.340> are

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
good example of how not all skills are

good example of how not all skills are
meant<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.760> used<00:02:11.879> against<00:02:12.090> enemy<00:02:12.330> here

a<00:02:12.760> dagger<00:02:13.660> skill<00:02:14.020> uses<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.620> very<00:02:15.010> small<00:02:15.340> amount

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
a dagger skill uses a very small amount

a dagger skill uses a very small amount
of<00:02:15.580> mana<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:15.970> basically<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.540> means<00:02:16.720> she<00:02:16.900> can

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
of mana and basically it means she can

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.690 
of mana and basically it means she can
last<00:02:17.260> hit<00:02:17.440> stuff<00:02:17.680> from<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.099> distance<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.640> you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
last hit stuff from a distance so if you

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.460 
last hit stuff from a distance so if you
having<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.910> really<00:02:19.120> rough<00:02:19.300> Lane<00:02:19.599> she<00:02:20.200> can<00:02:20.349> just

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
having a really rough Lane she can just

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.890 
having a really rough Lane she can just
hang<00:02:20.620> back<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:21.190> not<00:02:21.970> go<00:02:22.090> near<00:02:22.239> conquer<00:02:22.690> and

hang back and not go near conquer and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.199 
hang back and not go near conquer and

dagger getting into the flow blast

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.500 
dagger getting into the flow blast
hitting<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.430> actually<00:02:27.819> quite<00:02:28.000> difficult<00:02:28.209> and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
hitting is actually quite difficult and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
there are a couple of things that you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.710 
there are a couple of things that you
can<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.550> practice<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:31.060> one<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.420> playing

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
can do to practice that one is playing

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.270 
can do to practice that one is playing
in<00:02:31.870> games<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.230> your<00:02:32.349> own<00:02:32.590> without<00:02:32.890> any

in games on your own without any

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.890 
in games on your own without any
interference<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:34.239> switch<00:02:34.510> all<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.720> bots

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
interference just switch all the bots

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.870 
interference just switch all the bots
off<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.470> practice<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.069> you'll<00:02:36.730> get<00:02:36.819> a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
off and just practice and you'll get a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.970 
off and just practice and you'll get a
good<00:02:37.030> flow<00:02:37.239> for<00:02:37.420> how<00:02:37.540> quickly<00:02:37.810> creeps<00:02:38.680> health

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
good flow for how quickly creeps health

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.979 
good flow for how quickly creeps health
goes<00:02:39.250> down<00:02:39.280> based<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.330> how<00:02:40.480> many<00:02:40.660> creeps<00:02:40.840> are

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
goes down based on how many creeps are

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.509 
goes down based on how many creeps are
attacking<00:02:41.349> them<00:02:41.410> there's<00:02:42.010> not<00:02:42.280> really

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
attacking them there's not really

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.440 
attacking them there's not really
anything<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.879> can<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.150> other<00:02:43.269> than<00:02:43.330> just

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
anything you can do other than just

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.270 
anything you can do other than just

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
practice to get those on this but there

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.800 
practice to get those on this but there
are<00:02:45.400> some<00:02:45.580> things<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.360> should<00:02:46.390> know

are some things that you should know
that<00:02:47.019> are<00:02:47.080> quite<00:02:47.290> useful

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
that are quite useful

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.350 
that are quite useful

be doing that for example if I was in a

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.220 
be doing that for example if I was in a
lane<00:03:57.280> now<00:03:57.459> with<00:03:57.609> somebody<00:03:57.910> else<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.959> they

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
get all the last hit that would be a

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.180 
get all the last hit that would be a
nightmare<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.380> would<00:04:02.650> be<00:04:02.799> really

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
nightmare that would be really

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.009 
nightmare that would be really
unpleasant<00:04:03.370> because<00:04:03.700> phantom<00:04:04.450> assassin<00:04:04.540> is<00:04:04.989> a

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
unpleasant because phantom assassin is a

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.599 
unpleasant because phantom assassin is a
character<00:04:05.349> that<00:04:05.380> really<00:04:05.829> really<00:04:06.190> really

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
character that really really really

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.400

needs<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.060> farm<00:04:07.299> car<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.720> if<00:04:08.139> she<00:04:08.260> doesn't

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
needs the farm car and if she doesn't

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.339 
needs the farm car and if she doesn't

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
get it she just is useless so you have

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.180 
get it she just is useless so you have
to<00:04:11.470> make<00:04:11.590> sure<00:04:11.739> that<00:04:11.769> you're<00:04:12.099> actually

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.969 
sort of character who shouldn't be
getting<00:04:16.539> all<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:16.780> gold<00:04:16.989> maybe<00:04:17.590> if<00:04:17.799> you're<00:04:17.950> a

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
getting all the gold maybe if you're a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.620 
getting all the gold maybe if you're a
support<00:04:18.549> character<00:04:19.000> or<00:04:19.239> somebody<00:04:19.510> who<00:04:19.599> just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
support character or somebody who just

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.699 
support character or somebody who just
doesn't<00:04:19.780> leave<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.079> farm<00:04:20.260> as<00:04:20.380> much<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:20.650> a

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
doesn't leave the farm as much as a

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.569 
doesn't leave the farm as much as a
person<00:04:20.829> that<00:04:21.010> you're<00:04:21.220> with

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
person that you're with

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.490 
person that you're with
then<00:04:21.940> it's<00:04:22.240> more<00:04:22.390> important<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.960> focus<00:04:23.260> on

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
then it's more important to focus on

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.400 
then it's more important to focus on
denying<00:04:23.950> now<00:04:24.250> denying<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.940> basically<00:04:25.780> the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
denying now denying is basically the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.990 
denying now denying is basically the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
it's getting less hits on your own

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.490 
it's getting less hits on your own
creeps<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:28.810> might<00:04:28.930> seen<00:04:29.140> there<00:04:29.290> there's<00:04:29.440> a

exclamation marks popping up it means
every<00:04:43.780> time<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:43.990> do<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.140> they<00:04:44.950> get<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.190> highly

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
every time I do that they get a highly

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.030 
every time I do that they get a highly
reduced<00:04:46.270> amount<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.630> experience<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.890> means

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
reduced amount of experience so it means

reduced amount of experience so it means
I'm<00:04:48.250> actually<00:04:48.460> stopping<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.450> other<00:04:49.570> team

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
I'm actually stopping the other team

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.900 
I'm actually stopping the other team
from<00:04:49.930> getting<00:04:50.080> as<00:04:50.320> much<00:04:50.410> experience<00:04:50.800> from<00:04:51.760> the

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
from getting as much experience from the

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.670 
from getting as much experience from the
monsters<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.270> are<00:04:52.720> dying<00:04:53.020> near<00:04:53.380> them

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
the photo dying yeah basically denying

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.160 
the photo dying yeah basically denying
creeps<00:04:58.120> is<00:04:58.270> really<00:04:58.510> important<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:58.930> if<00:04:59.050> you

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
creeps is really important and if you

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.540 
creeps is really important and if you
are<00:04:59.350> for<00:04:59.680> example<00:04:59.950> if<00:05:00.040> I<00:05:00.100> was<00:05:00.190> playing<00:05:00.430> as

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
are for example if I was playing as

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.800 
are for example if I was playing as
dazzle<00:05:00.850> here<00:05:01.000> then<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.240> would<00:05:01.390> be<00:05:01.450> spending<00:05:01.600> a

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
dazzle here then I would be spending a

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.660 
dazzle here then I would be spending a
lot<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.050> game<00:05:02.200> just<00:05:02.560> denying<00:05:03.070> by<00:05:03.400> doing

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
lot of the game just denying by doing

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.880 
lot of the game just denying by doing
that<00:05:03.810> we'd<00:05:04.810> make<00:05:04.990> sure<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.650> wave

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
that we'd make sure that this wave

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.100 
that we'd make sure that this wave
continues<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:06.970> fight<00:05:07.150> close<00:05:07.420> to<00:05:07.540> our<00:05:07.630> town<00:05:07.840> now

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
continues to fight close to our town now

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.600 
continues to fight close to our town now
when<00:05:08.290> it's<00:05:08.500> closed<00:05:08.680> or<00:05:08.830> tower<00:05:09.040> it<00:05:09.250> does<00:05:09.430> make

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
when it's closed or tower it does make

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.950 
when it's closed or tower it does make
it<00:05:09.640> more<00:05:09.790> difficult<00:05:09.970> less<00:05:10.510> it<00:05:10.690> because<00:05:10.900> you

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
it more difficult less it because you

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.870 
it more difficult less it because you
can<00:05:11.050> see<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.410> tower<00:05:11.590> does<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:11.920> much<00:05:12.010> damage<00:05:12.370> it

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
can see the tower does so much damage it

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.370 
can see the tower does so much damage it
is<00:05:13.090> harder<00:05:13.510> to<00:05:13.630> get<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.810> timing<00:05:14.050> right<00:05:14.320> for

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
is harder to get the timing right for

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.380 
is harder to get the timing right for
lacet<00:05:14.830> but<00:05:15.400> generally<00:05:15.670> speaking<00:05:15.730> fighting

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
lacet but generally speaking fighting

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.780 
lacet but generally speaking fighting
close<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.840> your<00:05:16.930> tower<00:05:17.080> maybe<00:05:18.010> not<00:05:18.220> this<00:05:18.460> close

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
close to your tower maybe not this close

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.330 
close to your tower maybe not this close
but<00:05:19.420> close<00:05:19.570> it's<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.590> real<00:05:20.740> advantage<00:05:20.920> because

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
but close it's a real advantage because

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.920 
but close it's a real advantage because
if<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:21.460> get<00:05:21.580> this<00:05:21.640> trouble<00:05:22.030> like<00:05:22.270> me<00:05:22.420> super

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
if you get this trouble like me super

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.840 
if you get this trouble like me super
low<00:05:23.020> health<00:05:23.200> I<00:05:23.410> can<00:05:23.860> just<00:05:24.010> pull<00:05:24.160> back<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:24.670> make

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
low health I can just pull back and make

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.670 
low health I can just pull back and make
sure<00:05:25.000> I'm<00:05:25.060> safe<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:26.140> only<00:05:26.200> other<00:05:26.440> thing<00:05:26.590> you

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
sure I'm safe the only other thing you

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.780 
sure I'm safe the only other thing you
really<00:05:26.830> need<00:05:26.920> to<00:05:27.070> know<00:05:27.130> about<00:05:27.190> denying<00:05:27.580> is

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
really need to know about denying is

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.250 
really need to know about denying is
that<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:28.000> cannot<00:05:28.270> start<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.780> night<00:05:28.930> creep

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
that you cannot start the night creep

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.870 
that you cannot start the night creep
until<00:05:29.590> they<00:05:29.710> are<00:05:29.830> on<00:05:29.860> less<00:05:30.220> than<00:05:30.430> half<00:05:30.610> health

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
until they are on less than half health

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.520 
until they are on less than half health
so<00:05:31.390> you<00:05:31.480> see<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.810> as<00:05:32.020> soon<00:05:32.170> as<00:05:32.200> it's<00:05:32.380> under

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
so you see it as soon as it's under

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.110 
so you see it as soon as it's under
health<00:05:32.680> you<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.310> start<00:05:33.520> attacking<00:05:33.760> and

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
health you can start attacking and

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.630 
health you can start attacking and
chipping<00:05:34.930> away<00:05:35.020> in<00:05:35.290> and<00:05:35.500> that's<00:05:36.190> pretty<00:05:36.400> much

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
chipping away in and that's pretty much

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.460 
chipping away in and that's pretty much
last<00:05:36.970> hitting<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.510> denying<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:38.320> that's

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
last hitting and denying and that's

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.990 
last hitting and denying and that's
pretty<00:05:38.620> much<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:38.950> for<00:05:39.130> last<00:05:39.400> hitting<00:05:39.640> ends<00:05:39.850> and

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
pretty much it for last hitting ends and
