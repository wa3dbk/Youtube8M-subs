talking to her and her working on the
bike<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.160> saw<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.820> she<00:00:14.969> was<00:00:15.059> very<00:00:15.120> interested

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
bike I saw this she was very interested

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.750 
bike I saw this she was very interested
in<00:00:15.990> really<00:00:16.230> learning<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:17.279> grabbing<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
in really learning we're grabbing the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 
in really learning we're grabbing the
motor<00:00:17.940> here<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.080> grabbing<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.529> ends

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
motor here and we're grabbing the ends

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740 
motor here and we're grabbing the ends
in<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.880> technically<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
in here so technically this is the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.570 
in here so technically this is the
strongest<00:00:22.260> area<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.890> tube<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.400> have

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
strongest area of this tube that we have

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.460 
strongest area of this tube that we have
what<00:00:24.330> we're<00:00:24.480> doing<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.080> spreading

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
what we're doing now is just spreading

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.040 
what we're doing now is just spreading
the<00:00:25.560> load<00:00:25.800> up<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.119> know<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.570> when

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the load up it you know so that when

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.960 
the load up it you know so that when
this<00:00:28.170> hits<00:00:28.439> if<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.680> takes<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.980> big<00:00:29.490> jolt<00:00:29.760> or

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this hits if it takes a big jolt or

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.220 
this hits if it takes a big jolt or
something<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> we're<00:00:30.840> spreading<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
something like that we're spreading the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
something like that we're spreading the
load<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> tube<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.250> like<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> background

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
load up the tube I like the background

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.200 
load up the tube I like the background
stuff<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.989> makes<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.410> worth<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.950> end-result<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
stuff it makes it worth the end-result a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
stuff it makes it worth the end-result a
bit<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.840> think<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.500> appreciate

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
bit more I think and you appreciate

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.979 
bit more I think and you appreciate
things<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.450> fascinates<00:00:39.930> me

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
things more so that really fascinates me

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
things more so that really fascinates me
and<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:40.620> we'll<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> gusset<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.370> comes

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and then we'll have a gusset that comes

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670 
and then we'll have a gusset that comes
down<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.149> here<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.510> well<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.469> helps

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
down in here as well that just helps

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.840 
down in here as well that just helps
spread<00:00:43.800> load<00:00:44.040> yep

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
spread load yep

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
spread load yep
and<00:00:44.940> holds<00:00:45.750> our<00:00:45.899> piece<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.739> our

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and holds our piece there with our

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.170 
and holds our piece there with our
bearings<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.520> we'll<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:47.789> side

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
bearings and then we'll have some side

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
bearings and then we'll have some side
stuff<00:00:48.480> coming<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.530> should<00:00:49.680> be

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
stuff coming up to it so it should be

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.330 
stuff coming up to it so it should be
pretty<00:00:49.920> cool

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
pretty cool

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.610 
pretty cool
you<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.629> didn't<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.440> gonna

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you know we didn't know I was just gonna

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
you know we didn't know I was just gonna
put<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> single<00:00:53.219> piece<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.000> we

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
put a single piece there and then we

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.520 
put a single piece there and then we
found<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> nice<00:00:54.629> little<00:00:54.660> piece<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.199> chromoly

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
found a nice little piece of chromoly

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.490 
found a nice little piece of chromoly
one<00:00:56.309> by<00:00:56.460> two<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> might<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.960> cooler<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> have

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
one by two but I might be cooler to have

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
one by two but I might be cooler to have
two<00:00:58.680> pieces<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.370> welded<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
