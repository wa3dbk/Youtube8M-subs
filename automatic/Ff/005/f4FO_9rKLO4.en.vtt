00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
think about the public space in

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.740 
think about the public space in
Portland's<00:02:54.459> residential<00:02:55.090> neighborhoods<00:02:55.540> as

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750

what we love riding we live really close
to<00:03:03.209> school<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.660> we're<00:03:03.840> either<00:03:03.990> biking<00:03:04.560> or

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430

walking the bike trains become sort of a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.650 
walking the bike trains become sort of a
tradition<00:03:08.040> at<00:03:08.190> saven<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:09.000> was<00:03:09.209> handed<00:03:09.569> off
