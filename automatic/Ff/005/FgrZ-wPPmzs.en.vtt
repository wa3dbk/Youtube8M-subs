00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:06.460
 the authoritarianism of the president of the 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.920
 rural society called fascist scioli 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.360
 for thinking different I was listening 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.429
 carefully living also the 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.170
 repercussions of what you said does 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.660
 a while when he is told about a step 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.240
 back is a very bad news I feel 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.040
 the error with responsibility 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.360
 carlos angel and with all 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.670
 leaders accompany me and 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.860
 fundamentally what I feel in the 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.020
 most of the Argentine people who do not 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.570
 wants not a step back and it 's to the 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.510
 true victory we do not want to sell a 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.030
 step back we believe in governments that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.200
 can reflect on governments that 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.600
 can review their policies are 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.240
 inside oficialismo is on time the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.090
 official candidate is on time and 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.460
 I thought it's a way too little 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.739
 diplomatic to invite a candidate to 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.320
 talk and talk good but it's the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.960
 actually to hear that a candidate in 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.630
 a democratic country say not a step 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.470
 back it does not seem at all 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.940
 democratic seems to us even 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.880
 authoritarian that someone says not a step 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.280
 is one of your fascist comments is 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.060
 one of your comments ease 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.610
 interviewed by 678 and cool do not you 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.230
 encouraged to explain their ideology the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.300
 last 12 years were not good for the 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.190
 field were not good and not in mind 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.410
 that in the 90s, Carlos applauded himself 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.000
 less in the 80s Alfonsin was whistled and in 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.800
 the 70's had put the minister 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.680
 of economy Martin and two which were 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.060
 the best years of the field for you 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.640
 we would have much better years the field 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.080
 if we could take the opportunity 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.910
 what the good world gives us were the 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.190
 economic policies that served the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.650
 field in these in recent years the last 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.870
 30 years in these and in this government that 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.580
 Iniesta to none have all given everything 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.710
 what they did they did wrong and in the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.810
 previous years everything that worked 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.640
 they destroyed it and did not propose anything 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 efficient in return I do not understand what kind 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.930
 of revolution is this that they do not propose 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.130
 nothing has not answered me during the 30 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.130
 previous years that cool 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.360
 the 678 file will then display what 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.090
 that cool did not dare to tell 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.760
 work in freedom without the nefarious 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.150
 intervention to fashion markets the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.079
 return 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.030
 a sheet of interventionism 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.880
 statizing and oppressive 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.220
 the economic activity or the economy 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.190
 it should work as freely as 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.590
 possible and with the least regulation 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.319
 I need to sleep with 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.020
 entrepreneurs who do not live subsidized or 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.610
 bothered by an ineffective state and 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.610
 invader that recovers this right 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.900
 a speech similar to that of martínez 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.900
 martínez 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.820
 does not find similarities with politics 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.820
 martínez I liked the speech very much 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.420
 freedom under intervention to the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.420
 markets 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.640
 one 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.640
