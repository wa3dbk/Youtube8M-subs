00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
me some mw3 and i was like I was like oh

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
me some mw3 and i was like I was like oh
what<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> heck<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.140> doesn't<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.469> any

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
what the heck that doesn't make any

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.389 
what the heck that doesn't make any
sense<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.850> message<00:00:39.180> says<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.950> know<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
sense so the message says I know it's a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
sense so the message says I know it's a
bit<00:00:41.550> random<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:41.969> PSN<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.899> due<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
bit random but PSN is down due to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.799 
bit random but PSN is down due to
maintenance<00:00:43.590> tomorrow<00:00:43.980> at<00:00:44.480> wherever<00:00:45.480> he

maintenance tomorrow at wherever he

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.860 
maintenance tomorrow at wherever he
lives<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.170> guess<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.680> 16<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.539> doesn't

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
lives I guess it's 16 so that doesn't

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.540 
lives I guess it's 16 so that doesn't
really<00:00:48.899> make<00:00:49.170> any<00:00:49.230> sense<00:00:49.710> I'll<00:00:49.950> try<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.370> my

saying anything so I'm going to go to

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.760 
saying anything so I'm going to go to
playstation<00:01:55.630> 3<00:01:55.900> and<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.930> they<00:01:59.470> don't<00:01:59.650> even

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
playstation 3 and then they don't even

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.499 
playstation 3 and then they don't even
say<00:02:00.040> anything<00:02:00.250> about<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.850> going<00:02:01.090> down<00:02:01.210> so<00:02:01.450> i

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
say anything about it going down so i

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.960 
say anything about it going down so i
guess<00:02:01.750> it's<00:02:01.960> pulling<00:02:02.320> back<00:02:02.440> up<00:02:02.590> tomorrow<00:02:03.009> well

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
guess it's pulling back up tomorrow well

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.080 
guess it's pulling back up tomorrow well
sure<00:02:04.979> i'm<00:02:05.979> not<00:02:06.220> gonna<00:02:06.310> promise<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:06.820> anything

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.270 
sure i'm not gonna promise you anything
but<00:02:09.420> i<00:02:10.420> guess<00:02:13.200> i'm<00:02:14.200> guessing<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:14.860> gonna<00:02:15.070> be

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
but i guess i'm guessing it's gonna be

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.000 
but i guess i'm guessing it's gonna be
up<00:02:15.430> tomorrow<00:02:15.610> because<00:02:16.320> otherwise<00:02:17.320> they<00:02:17.830> would

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
up tomorrow because otherwise they would

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.980 
up tomorrow because otherwise they would
probably<00:02:18.370> say<00:02:18.730> something<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:20.110> I

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.050 

you
