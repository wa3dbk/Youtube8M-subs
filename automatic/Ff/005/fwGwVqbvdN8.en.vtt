00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
other part unflavored okay so what we've

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.120 
other part unflavored okay so what we've
started<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.599> our<00:00:30.840> injection<00:00:31.410> we've<00:00:31.949> got

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
started with is our injection we've got

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
started with is our injection we've got
some<00:00:32.279> apple<00:00:32.579> juice<00:00:32.610> heating<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.450> once<00:00:34.200> that's

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
some apple juice heating up once that's

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.869 
some apple juice heating up once that's
heated<00:00:35.010> we're<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.090> put<00:00:36.390> some<00:00:36.750> honey<00:00:37.260> great

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
heated we're gonna put some honey great

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.510 
heated we're gonna put some honey great
and<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:39.989> probably<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.739> main<00:00:40.950> ingredient

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and this is probably the main ingredient

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.139 
and this is probably the main ingredient
so<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.090> turkey<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.200> sweet

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
so the turkey will be a little bit sweet

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.790 
so the turkey will be a little bit sweet
and<00:00:45.149> I'll<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> stir<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.739> up

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and I'll just get you to stir that up

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.150 
and I'll just get you to stir that up
yeah<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.600> want<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> honey<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.649> be

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
yeah and so we just want the honey to be

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.330 
yeah and so we just want the honey to be
stirred<00:00:50.489> until<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.719> nice<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.350> smooth<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
stirred until it's nice and smooth a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.580 
stirred until it's nice and smooth a
little<00:00:53.610> bit<00:00:53.760> runny<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:55.050> we're<00:00:55.440> putting

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
little bit runny because we're putting

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.670 
little bit runny because we're putting
it<00:00:55.860> into<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.640> needle<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.930> needs<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> little

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it into a needle it needs to be a little

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
it into a needle it needs to be a little
bit<00:00:58.859> runny<00:00:59.039> otherwise<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.820> will<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.090> all

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
bit runny otherwise it will get all

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.520 
bit runny otherwise it will get all
clogged<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.170> there

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
clogged up in there

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.189 
clogged up in there
apple<00:01:02.010> juice<00:01:02.219> honey<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.539> well

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
apple juice honey and then what well

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.100 
apple juice honey and then what well
we've<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.189> dark<00:01:05.489> ale<00:01:05.880> Fort<00:01:06.659> Garry<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
we've got the dark ale Fort Garry you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.870 
we've got the dark ale Fort Garry you
can<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.409> any<00:01:07.650> beer<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.040> want<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> thought

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
can use any beer you want but I thought

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.969 
can use any beer you want but I thought
maybe<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.630> dark<00:01:10.080> beer<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.590> give<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> little

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
maybe a dark beer would give a little

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
maybe a dark beer would give a little
bit<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.340> flavor<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.000> we've<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.170> some

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
bit more flavor to it we've got some

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
bit more flavor to it we've got some
Cajun<00:01:13.860> seasoning<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.180> some<00:01:15.479> salt

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and pepper okay and that's all that goes

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.630 
and pepper okay and that's all that goes
into<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.600> injection<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> looks<00:01:20.520> pretty

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
into the injection so that looks pretty

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.850

drumsticks if you want and let go when

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.120 
drumsticks if you want and let go when
it<00:02:43.970> gets<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:45.260> goes<00:02:45.440> right<00:02:45.740> into<00:02:45.920> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
it gets in it it goes right into the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.970 
it gets in it it goes right into the
meat<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.580> we're<00:02:46.760> going<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.000> just<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.870> guess<00:02:48.770> that

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
meat so we're going to just I guess that

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.780 
meat so we're going to just I guess that
would<00:02:49.100> be<00:02:50.200> we're<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.860> push<00:02:52.280> down<00:02:52.490> on<00:02:52.520> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
would be we're going to push down on the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.150 
would be we're going to push down on the
plunger<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.209> little<00:02:53.450> bit<00:02:53.600> do<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.350> start<00:02:54.740> to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
plunger a little bit do it start to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.980 
plunger a little bit do it start to
bring<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.790> out<00:02:55.940> now<00:02:56.209> you<00:02:56.270> don't<00:02:56.540> want<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.780> push

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
bring it out now you don't want to push

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.050 
bring it out now you don't want to push
it<00:02:57.170> all<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.380> way<00:02:57.680> out<00:02:57.800> because<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.880> more

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
it all the way out because the more

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.810 
it all the way out because the more
holes<00:02:59.330> in<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.750> skin<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.500> more<00:03:01.340> moisture

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
holes in the skin the more moisture

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.449 
holes in the skin the more moisture
that's<00:03:02.000> released<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.020> after<00:03:03.470> almost<00:03:04.130> out

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
that's released so after almost out

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.680 
that's released so after almost out
we're<00:03:04.670> going<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:04.940> push<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.270> into<00:03:05.450> another

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
we're going to push it into another

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.820 
we're going to push it into another
direction

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
direction

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.420 
direction
I<00:03:06.980> see<00:03:07.490> and<00:03:08.380> slowly<00:03:09.380> bring<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.830> out<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.250> push

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430
