00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.729
 Today I tell you love and come from van Halen 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.489
 playing on the piano 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.800
 I show only the refrain in which is also the best known 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 I can not do it in the middle section yet 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.300
 and he is also much heavier 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.950
 to become as Dr 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.460
 the english newspaper 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.740
 you need both countries 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.110
 and you only need the white keys 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.649
 «The whole Mediterranean Siegburg dwo nail played 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.270
 So there are different grips that understand 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.060
 with the right hand and with the left hand play here if you only one tone 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.660
 that I always repeat 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.039
 this is a constant 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.120
 Start with your right hand first 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 the first Christian is 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.890
 and G 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.009
 whole garden with 1 3 and 5 so build in the middle and 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.009
 small fingers 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.340
 After that, ears simply made both hands one class further to the right 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.710
 on c and b 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
 Beginners lie to me 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.370
 such a second goal 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.700
 Now we are just at the beginning 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 just about the ownership of other twins so 11 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 AR 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.350
 So again the 3 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 Hor and d 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
 and woe 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.080
 and at 11 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 and 10 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.509
 should that be already the upper powerful ones still the rounds these 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.469
 meant very easily 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.679
 Stöhr 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:14.379
 play all 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.969
 with that on it 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.079
 and the Open Marie Vell with your fingers 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.079
 until 14 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.799
 from 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.110
 Among the applicants have passed a tour on the left 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.380
 the terrain was made with two and four or we just take the 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.380
 Both fingers are the bet left 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.809
 so it is 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.309
 2 no 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.509
 and al and that although with the second 4 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.659
 10 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.659
 and G 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.669
 and therefore a chair in the squares and that is easy with the 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.959
 two fingers so with the middle finger of DM on 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.959
 Dr and the rest can be seen 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 should times all forces in a rush 

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:18.429
 and 10 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.489
 and marriage 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.049
 and 10 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.369
 ac at 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:36.659
 and 8 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.789
 counting 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:40.789
 b and Dr 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.369
 and 10 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.819
 and go 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.939
 otherwise obviously wants the first part 4 of the children moved 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.060
 the first home game is supposed to win twice in a row 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.540
 and then comes the day of rest 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.009
 the accident 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.719
 consists of the handle and down here already St so you have times he had talk 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:13.589
 pa and 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:15.159
 Dr-ing 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.659
 to the left of this effect 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.129
 Maren count 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.640
 and I just want a rejection so who the thumb 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.240
 next to her on top of the stealth 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.909
 from the playful 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.710
 that's it then 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.249
 there Dr 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 almost to act and sing 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.449
 you take that way 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.080
 and then you just play the bottom breath 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.860
 would 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.550
 and then comes the appeal 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.539
 and one stands also simply ripe cathedral the country stand 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.699
 b and give 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.050
 So we need the WWF 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.600
 in the cd player and on the back 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.189
 Dr 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.029
 important, however, is the whole case before 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:03.029
 and the Kerner how it goes on 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.159
 Sir 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.060
 so far as some other country one stands 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.400
 the first part twice in a row then you stand the praise point 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.139
 the top part of the episode so 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.129
 Dr 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.129
 Examples like the region 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:57.529
 twice Iran 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.719
 then go once 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.499
 and finally, him again 

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:30.589
 so sage has to see then what I now part of the country is coming 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:31.159
 Songs too
