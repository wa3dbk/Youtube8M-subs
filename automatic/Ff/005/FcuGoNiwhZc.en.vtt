 to ask javier to commit

 rather than talk about the future of Madrid 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.630
 that if it were not in Madrid because 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.210

 represent our country in two 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.409
 parties respond to the confidence that 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.440
 pretty to enjoy it right now I'm a 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.449
 player of the selection what is in the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.120
 life is that each person has got their 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.920
 point of view you have to respect that 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.059
 nobody is the owner of the truth and what 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.320
 good that the beauty of football is that 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.670
 good look fat I'm here with the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.100
 Mexican team will work 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.390
 looking to be the best every that 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.149
 come here to select me from the same 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.470
 way not everyone looking to surrender 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.679
 day with day training after 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.020
 good training and what happens in 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.700
 the environment because there is not what 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.229
 important what we come to 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.270
 do here to selection that is always 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.069
 look to be at the best level for 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.259
 deliver some accounts you have us without 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.360
 Careful we laugh that in the morning 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.310
 we woke up and we laughed not at that 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.770
 way we have always carried a good 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.319
 off-court relationship of respect 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.479
 of friendship we do not estimate much and good 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.429
 that the truth does not care 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.710
 we just laugh at what they say 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.259
 we know what very important matches 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 for each of us in search of 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.659
 take a place 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.250
 in selection in summer the opportunity 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.320
 that is presented by having two tournaments 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.720
 because it opens the door to very many 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.720
 players and that's going to be important in 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.280
 the competition is going to be there I think that 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.289
 a very very important dispute in each 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.149
 put and let's hope that that that's 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.570
 something positive you have to justify your 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.570
 called 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.709
 no but I do not really justify it 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.599
 yes no no no but I like it 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.450
 talk with you said the one who 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.920
 I want to look for some justification I 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.860
 I am a very open person I like 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.989
 talk ex I listen to the views 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.030
 of you and and I expose mine and the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.069
 final I think that everyone has a 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.920
 way of seeing things and there is no there 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.480
 why take it wrong neither me nor you 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.130
 we also talk with doctor Gerardo 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.500
 Gerardo Aguilar and confirmed that the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.269
 Brown doctor was just a fingernail 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.310
 buried and you can play the next 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.440

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.690
