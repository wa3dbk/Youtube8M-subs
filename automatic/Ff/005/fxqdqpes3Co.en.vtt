is a wet application and what is a tri
application<00:03:15.700> depending<00:03:16.630> on<00:03:16.780> how<00:03:16.960> gutsy<00:03:17.290> you

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
application depending on how gutsy you

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.880 
application depending on how gutsy you
are<00:03:18.600> what<00:03:19.600> application<00:03:20.200> basically<00:03:20.620> all<00:03:20.770> you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
are what application basically all you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.530 
are what application basically all you
do<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.400> take<00:03:21.730> some<00:03:21.970> kind<00:03:22.120> of<00:03:22.210> soapy

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
do is you take some kind of soapy

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.290 
do is you take some kind of soapy
solution<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:24.190> know<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.670> even<00:03:24.880> go<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.120> for

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
solution you know you can even go in for

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.760 
solution you know you can even go in for
it's<00:03:25.450> just<00:03:25.510> use<00:03:25.810> Windex<00:03:26.170> straight<00:03:26.470> out<00:03:26.620> of<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
it's just use Windex straight out of the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.830 
it's just use Windex straight out of the
bottle<00:03:26.950> fill<00:03:27.790> anything<00:03:27.970> with<00:03:28.180> Windex<00:03:28.510> you'll

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
bottle fill anything with Windex you'll

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.240 
bottle fill anything with Windex you'll
have<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.260> make<00:03:29.470> sure<00:03:29.620> you're<00:03:29.770> not<00:03:29.830> driving

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
have to make sure you're not driving

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.800 
have to make sure you're not driving
anywhere<00:03:30.550> for<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.060> know<00:03:31.150> an<00:03:31.300> hour<00:03:31.420> or<00:03:31.660> two

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
anywhere for you know an hour or two

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.390 
anywhere for you know an hour or two
because<00:03:32.200> they'll<00:03:32.800> take<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> little<00:03:33.250> while

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
because they'll take a little while

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
because they'll take a little while
before<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.880> sticks<00:03:34.420> there's<00:03:34.990> a<00:03:35.050> Windex<00:03:35.410> will

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
before it sticks there's a Windex will

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.380 
before it sticks there's a Windex will
create<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.980> slippery<00:03:36.520> barrier<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.090> allows

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
create a slippery barrier that allows

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.000 
create a slippery barrier that allows
you<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.660> slide<00:03:37.990> it<00:03:38.140> around<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.470> reposition<00:03:38.590> it

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
you to slide it around and reposition it

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.280 
you to slide it around and reposition it
usually<00:03:39.880> while<00:03:40.030> we<00:03:40.120> just<00:03:40.150> use<00:03:40.420> some<00:03:40.780> soapy

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
usually while we just use some soapy

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.380 
usually while we just use some soapy
water<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.710> bottle<00:03:42.060> basically<00:03:43.060> at<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.240> point

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
water and bottle basically at that point

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.510 
water and bottle basically at that point
I<00:03:43.930> only<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.470> one<00:03:44.650> decal<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.190> I'm<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.400> going

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
I only have one decal so I'm just going

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.010 
I only have one decal so I'm just going
to<00:03:45.580> walk

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
to walk

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.330 
to walk
and<00:03:48.020> I'll<00:03:48.230> show<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.560> more<00:03:48.740> difficult<00:03:48.920> but

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
and I'll show you the more difficult but

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.300 
and I'll show you the more difficult but
dry<00:03:49.700> installation<00:03:50.770> with<00:03:51.770> that<00:03:51.950> installation

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
dry installation with that installation

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.310 
dry installation with that installation
based<00:03:52.790> on<00:03:52.970> what<00:03:53.120> we<00:03:53.240> have<00:03:53.420> we<00:03:53.630> have<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.900> decals

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
based on what we have we have the decals

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.390 
based on what we have we have the decals
here<00:03:54.500> on<00:03:55.430> backing<00:03:55.850> paper<00:03:56.830> with<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.980> tape<00:03:58.190> that

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
here on backing paper with the tape that

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.710 
here on backing paper with the tape that
holds<00:03:58.580> them<00:03:58.850> all<00:03:58.970> together<00:03:59.120> can<00:03:59.570> throw

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
holds them all together can throw

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.170 
holds them all together can throw
individual<00:04:00.320> little<00:04:00.530> letters<00:04:00.830> so<00:04:01.790> basically

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
individual little letters so basically

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.430 
individual little letters so basically
all<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.510> have<00:04:02.630> to<00:04:02.780> do<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:03.110> peel<00:04:03.350> the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
all you have to do is you peel the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.370 
all you have to do is you peel the
backing<00:04:03.650> paper<00:04:03.950> off<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:05.270> once<00:04:05.510> it's<00:04:05.690> all<00:04:05.870> gone

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
backing paper off and once it's all gone

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.230 
backing paper off and once it's all gone
you<00:04:06.770> spritz<00:04:07.100> it<00:04:07.220> down<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.460> back<00:04:07.640> of<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.850> decal

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
you spritz it down the back of the decal

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.390 
you spritz it down the back of the decal
making<00:04:08.630> sure<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:08.930> cover<00:04:09.140> but<00:04:09.380> not<00:04:09.560> saturated

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
making sure it's cover but not saturated

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.760 
making sure it's cover but not saturated
and<00:04:10.610> then<00:04:11.360> with<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.960> backing<00:04:12.290> paper<00:04:12.410> gone

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
and then with the backing paper gone

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.310 
and then with the backing paper gone
basically<00:04:13.490> just<00:04:13.850> put<00:04:14.060> me<00:04:14.270> down<00:04:14.300> on<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:15.080> truck

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
basically just put me down on the truck

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.550 
basically just put me down on the truck
and<00:04:15.530> now<00:04:15.680> with

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
and now with

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.990 
and now with
the<00:04:16.620> slippery<00:04:17.040> solution<00:04:17.250> you'll<00:04:17.670> be<00:04:17.760> able<00:04:17.850> to

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the slippery solution you'll be able to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.270 
the slippery solution you'll be able to
slide<00:04:18.239> around<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.750> position<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.859> really

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
slide around and position it and really

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.340 
slide around and position it and really
because<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.850> all<00:04:21.090> these<00:04:21.299> body<00:04:21.570> lines<00:04:21.930> and

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
because of all these body lines and

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.200 
because of all these body lines and
everything<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:23.040> lot<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.550> times<00:04:23.730> you<00:04:23.940> can't

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
everything a lot of times you can't

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.629 
everything a lot of times you can't
measure<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.900> can<00:04:25.110> make<00:04:25.380> it<00:04:25.530> identical<00:04:26.100> body

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
measure you can make it identical body

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.740 
measure you can make it identical body
lines<00:04:26.940> aren't<00:04:27.290> level<00:04:28.290> with<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.530> earth<00:04:29.750> this

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
lines aren't level with the earth this

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.450 
lines aren't level with the earth this
and<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.169> line<00:04:31.440> are<00:04:31.710> not<00:04:31.830> level<00:04:32.220> with<00:04:32.340> each

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
and this line are not level with each

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.980 
and this line are not level with each
other<00:04:32.730> so<00:04:33.030> usually<00:04:33.480> it's<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.690> matter<00:04:33.900> of

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
other so usually it's a matter of

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.900 
other so usually it's a matter of
putting<00:04:34.230> it<00:04:34.410> on<00:04:34.560> here<00:04:34.800> stepping<00:04:35.370> back<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.669> few

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
putting it on here stepping back a few

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.700 
putting it on here stepping back a few
feet<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.389> kind<00:04:36.630> of<00:04:36.720> looking<00:04:37.050> at<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.380> make<00:04:37.410> it

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
feet of kind of looking at to make it

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.670 
feet of kind of looking at to make it
make<00:04:37.919> sure<00:04:37.950> it's<00:04:38.220> visually<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:40.050> know<00:04:40.080> as<00:04:40.500> good

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
make sure it's visually you know as good

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.610 
make sure it's visually you know as good
as<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.889> can<00:04:40.980> be<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.940> human<00:04:42.180> eye<00:04:42.470> you<00:04:43.470> know

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
as it can be to the human eye you know

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.050 
as it can be to the human eye you know
for<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:43.980> particular<00:04:44.250> vehicle<00:04:44.940> you're

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
for the particular vehicle you're

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.659 
for the particular vehicle you're
working<00:04:45.450> with<00:04:45.600> so<00:04:46.380> at<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.889> point<00:04:47.220> once<00:04:47.520> you

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
working with so at that point once you

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.730 
working with so at that point once you
once<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.240> put<00:04:48.630> this<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:48.960> here<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.410> it's<00:04:49.530> wet

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
once you put this on here and it's wet

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.290 
once you put this on here and it's wet
they<00:04:50.130> don't<00:04:50.340> take<00:04:50.520> too<00:04:50.700> long<00:04:50.730> because<00:04:51.030> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
they don't take too long because the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.940 
they don't take too long because the
solution<00:04:51.840> starts<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.169> dry<00:04:52.410> up<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.770> then<00:04:52.860> it

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
solution starts to dry up and then it

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.920 
solution starts to dry up and then it
starts<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.280> stick<00:04:53.580> but<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.360> step<00:04:54.600> down<00:04:54.630> and

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
starts to stick but you step down and

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.300 
starts to stick but you step down and
kind<00:04:55.140> of<00:04:55.200> look<00:04:55.380> at<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.800> know<00:04:55.890> maybe<00:04:56.070> get<00:04:56.280> a

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
kind of look at and you know maybe get a

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.890 
kind of look at and you know maybe get a
second<00:04:56.640> opinion<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:57.210> whatever<00:04:57.600> happens<00:04:57.840> to

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
second opinion the whatever happens to

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.090 
second opinion the whatever happens to
be<00:04:57.990> around<00:04:58.230> does<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.500> look<00:04:58.650> straight<00:04:58.770> what

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
be around does that look straight what

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.950 
be around does that look straight what
do<00:04:59.160> you<00:04:59.250> think<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.940> then<00:05:00.090> fit<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.360> positioning

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
do you think and then fit it positioning

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.480 
do you think and then fit it positioning
it<00:05:01.050> wherever<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.470> can<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.980> basically

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
it wherever you can and basically

now<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.890> only<00:05:45.040> thing<00:05:45.130> we<00:05:45.310> really<00:05:45.340> need<00:05:45.730> for

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
now the only thing we really need for

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.600 
now the only thing we really need for
the<00:05:46.390> dry<00:05:46.600> installation<00:05:47.260> method<00:05:47.620> is<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:48.010> little

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
the dry installation method is a little

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.880 
the dry installation method is a little
bit<00:05:48.760> of<00:05:48.820> masking<00:05:49.150> tape<00:05:49.210> you<00:05:49.600> can<00:05:49.720> use<00:05:49.890> scotch

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
bit of masking tape you can use scotch

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.749 
bit of masking tape you can use scotch
tape<00:05:51.010> Minh<00:05:51.400> it<00:05:51.610> really

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
tape Minh it really

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.369 
tape Minh it really
can<00:05:53.659> we<00:05:53.719> take<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.289> little<00:05:55.129> tiny<00:05:55.309> bit<00:05:55.550> of<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
can we take a little tiny bit of the

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.950 
can we take a little tiny bit of the
masking<00:05:57.379> tape<00:05:58.150> we<00:05:59.150> just<00:05:59.360> kind<00:05:59.569> of<00:05:59.659> stick<00:05:59.930> it

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
masking tape we just kind of stick it

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.760 
masking tape we just kind of stick it
onto<00:06:00.199> each<00:06:00.949> corner

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.610 

and<00:06:04.160> then<00:06:04.340> we<00:06:05.060> tack<00:06:05.330> it<00:06:05.509> up<00:06:05.569> here<00:06:05.840> on<00:06:06.080> to<00:06:06.590> the

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
and then we tack it up here on to the

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.270 
and then we tack it up here on to the
door<00:06:07.660> momentarily<00:06:08.660> so<00:06:09.349> we<00:06:09.470> can<00:06:09.590> step<00:06:09.770> back<00:06:09.830> and

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
door momentarily so we can step back and

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.460 
door momentarily so we can step back and
kind<00:06:10.699> of<00:06:10.789> look<00:06:10.970> and<00:06:11.210> again<00:06:11.569> visually<00:06:12.080> see<00:06:12.319> it

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
kind of look and again visually see it

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.920 
kind of look and again visually see it
this<00:06:12.710> correction<00:06:13.130> after<00:06:13.940> looking<00:06:14.360> at<00:06:14.449> this<00:06:14.630> I

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
this correction after looking at this I

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.990 
this correction after looking at this I
think<00:06:15.319> maybe<00:06:15.530> the<00:06:15.740> front<00:06:16.039> comes<00:06:16.699> down<00:06:16.970> a

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
think maybe the front comes down a

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.059 
think maybe the front comes down a
little<00:06:17.270> bit<00:06:17.509> please<00:06:18.020> got<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.410> whole<00:06:18.590> new<00:06:18.770> place

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.069 
little bit please got a whole new place

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:26.330 
little bit please got a whole new place
I'm<00:06:19.310> feeling<00:06:19.699> I'm<00:06:19.880> barely<00:06:20.090> slide<00:06:20.449> it<00:06:20.630> out

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.280 

and<00:06:27.000> then<00:06:27.150> okay<00:06:27.450> I<00:06:27.480> think<00:06:27.630> that<00:06:27.840> looks<00:06:27.930> good

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
and then okay I think that looks good

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.550 
and then okay I think that looks good
you<00:06:28.590> know<00:06:29.130> what<00:06:29.220> I'm<00:06:29.310> gonna<00:06:29.400> do<00:06:29.610> at<00:06:29.730> this<00:06:29.850> point

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560

I'm just simply gonna run up these big

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.450 
I'm just simply gonna run up these big
walls<00:06:33.420> on<00:06:33.630> top<00:06:33.810> we're<00:06:34.770> gonna<00:06:34.890> fall<00:06:35.160> it's<00:06:35.370> a

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
walls on top we're gonna fall it's a

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.580 
walls on top we're gonna fall it's a
hinge

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
hinge

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
now with this hedge

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.140 
now with this hedge
let's<00:06:39.930> take<00:06:40.110> our<00:06:40.260> credit<00:06:40.530> card<00:06:40.710> back<00:06:40.890> out<00:06:41.150> the

let's take our credit card back out the
only<00:06:42.300> thing<00:06:42.420> we're<00:06:42.540> gonna<00:06:42.630> do<00:06:42.840> is<00:06:42.870> flip<00:06:43.440> this

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
only thing we're gonna do is flip this

up I'm gonna start peeling back our

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.770 
up I'm gonna start peeling back our
backing<00:06:45.990> paper<00:06:47.030> I'm<00:06:48.030> going<00:06:48.180> to<00:06:48.270> start<00:06:48.510> kind<00:06:48.690> of

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.530 
backing paper I'm going to start kind of
squeezing<00:06:49.260> this<00:06:49.440> down<00:06:49.710> as<00:06:49.950> we<00:06:50.130> go<00:06:50.450> with<00:06:51.450> the

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
squeezing this down as we go with the

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.290 
squeezing this down as we go with the
credit<00:06:51.870> card

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.360 

they<00:06:56.629> kind<00:06:56.900> of<00:06:56.990> asked<00:06:57.169> to<00:06:57.289> go<00:06:57.470> and<00:06:57.800> we<00:06:58.069> get<00:06:58.190> to<00:06:58.340> a

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
they kind of asked to go and we get to a

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.640 
they kind of asked to go and we get to a
point<00:06:58.610> where<00:06:58.909> I<00:06:59.270> don't<00:07:00.169> want<00:07:00.319> to<00:07:00.379> pull<00:07:00.530> this

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
point where I don't want to pull this

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:13.219 
point where I don't want to pull this
back<00:07:00.710> and<00:07:01.099> paper<00:07:01.280> off

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:14.879 

sometimes<00:07:14.229> a<00:07:14.349> little<00:07:14.439> piece<00:07:14.710> of<00:07:14.740> the

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
sometimes a little piece of the

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.649 
sometimes a little piece of the
backpaper<00:07:15.310> stick<00:07:15.789> with<00:07:15.969> it<00:07:16.090> is<00:07:16.240> one<00:07:16.419> make<00:07:16.629> sure

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:16.659 
backpaper stick with it is one make sure

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:21.590 
backpaper stick with it is one make sure
you

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:32.010 

down<00:07:24.240> gentle<00:07:25.470> take<00:07:26.470> much<00:07:28.290> time<00:07:30.690> this<00:07:31.690> is<00:07:31.870> now<00:07:31.990> a

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
down gentle take much time this is now a

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.110 
down gentle take much time this is now a
dry<00:07:32.440> installation<00:07:33.220> that<00:07:33.760> you<00:07:33.970> can

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
dry installation that you can

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.050 
dry installation that you can
immediately<00:07:35.070> pull<00:07:36.070> this<00:07:36.430> transfer<00:07:36.850> tape

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.060 
immediately pull this transfer tape

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.360 
immediately pull this transfer tape
masking<00:07:37.450> tape<00:07:37.810> with<00:07:37.960> everything<00:07:38.290> off<00:07:38.440> and<00:07:39.160> you

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.370 
masking tape with everything off and you

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:42.330 
masking tape with everything off and you
should<00:07:39.640> be<00:07:39.850> done<00:07:40.330> and<00:07:41.260> out<00:07:41.650> of<00:07:41.830> there<00:07:41.980> as<00:07:42.190> you

should be done and out of there as you

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.280 
should be done and out of there as you
can<00:07:42.400> see<00:07:42.520> probably<00:07:43.030> in<00:07:43.450> the<00:07:43.570> equivalent<00:07:43.840> of

it dry asleep

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.040 
it dry asleep
is<00:07:56.979> a<00:07:57.160> little<00:07:57.310> easier<00:07:57.729> to<00:07:57.789> to<00:07:58.360> messed<00:07:58.600> up<00:07:58.810> if

00:07:59.040 --> 00:07:59.050 
is a little easier to to messed up if

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.480 
is a little easier to to messed up if
you<00:07:59.139> half<00:07:59.320> the<00:07:59.380> time<00:07:59.470> you<00:07:59.830> might<00:07:59.979> want<00:08:00.009> to<00:08:00.310> do

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.490 
you half the time you might want to do

the peels back Sprint's and stick it on
and<00:08:02.590> you<00:08:03.100> know<00:08:03.220> let<00:08:03.490> it<00:08:03.610> sit<00:08:03.789> for<00:08:03.820> an<00:08:04.000> hour<00:08:04.320> but

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320 
and you know let it sit for an hour but

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.409

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:09.669 
basically that's the installation but

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:11.159 
basically that's the installation but
your<00:08:09.820> credit<00:08:09.910> card<00:08:10.240> away<00:08:10.330> shouldn't<00:08:11.050> have
