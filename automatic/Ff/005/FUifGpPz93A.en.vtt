00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.590 

hi<00:00:07.210> this<00:00:07.270> is<00:00:07.540> julie<00:00:07.990> with<00:00:08.230> beadaholique.com

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.190 

and<00:00:13.600> i<00:00:14.430> made<00:00:15.430> out<00:00:15.580> of<00:00:15.730> wire<00:00:15.969> and<00:00:16.050> i've<00:00:17.050> actually

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
and i made out of wire and i've actually

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.310 
and i made out of wire and i've actually
done<00:00:17.410> two<00:00:17.830> here<00:00:18.160> one<00:00:18.730> is<00:00:18.850> using<00:00:19.060> using<00:00:19.720> 24

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
done two here one is using using 24

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.340 
done two here one is using using 24
gauge<00:00:20.590> wire<00:00:20.619> it's<00:00:21.490> pretty<00:00:22.060> flimsy<00:00:22.540> the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
gauge wire it's pretty flimsy the

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.680 
gauge wire it's pretty flimsy the
advantage<00:00:23.980> is<00:00:24.220> it's<00:00:24.460> a<00:00:24.580> lot<00:00:24.790> easier<00:00:25.090> to<00:00:25.510> make

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
advantage is it's a lot easier to make

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.740 
advantage is it's a lot easier to make
than<00:00:26.020> using<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.440> 22<00:00:26.920> gauge<00:00:27.220> but<00:00:28.180> the<00:00:28.300> Toni<00:00:28.510> to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
than using the 22 gauge but the Toni to

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.670 
than using the 22 gauge but the Toni to
gauge<00:00:28.990> is<00:00:29.230> more<00:00:29.890> solid<00:00:30.370> and<00:00:30.870> it's<00:00:31.870> doable<00:00:32.410> it

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
gauge is more solid and it's doable it

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.990 
gauge is more solid and it's doable it
just<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:33.010> a<00:00:33.040> little<00:00:33.309> trickier<00:00:33.670> so<00:00:33.820> you<00:00:33.879> might

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
just is a little trickier so you might

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.280 
just is a little trickier so you might
have<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.120> practice<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.629> little<00:00:34.719> bit<00:00:34.930> more<00:00:35.140> with

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
have to practice a little bit more with

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.950 
have to practice a little bit more with
it<00:00:35.469> but<00:00:36.219> this<00:00:36.340> is<00:00:36.550> the<00:00:36.730> final<00:00:37.149> project<00:00:37.360> and<00:00:37.839> I'm

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
it but this is the final project and I'm

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.630

is the one that's going to work for our

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.039 
is the one that's going to work for our
tree<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.250> then<00:01:22.090> it's<00:01:22.240> got<00:01:22.360> these<00:01:22.539> little<00:01:22.659> pegs

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
tree and then it's got these little pegs

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.830 
tree and then it's got these little pegs
that<00:01:23.770> just<00:01:24.009> go<00:01:24.189> into<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.640> holes<00:01:25.090> wherever<00:01:25.570> you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
that just go into the holes wherever you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.800 
that just go into the holes wherever you
want<00:01:26.079> them<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:27.159> I've<00:01:27.340> lined<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:28.210> up<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.659> almost

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
want them so I've lined it up and almost

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.410 
want them so I've lined it up and almost
like<00:01:29.020> an<00:01:29.170> arrow<00:01:29.469> formation<00:01:29.890> my<00:01:30.820> pegs<00:01:31.149> and

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
like an arrow formation my pegs and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.709 
like an arrow formation my pegs and
you'll<00:01:31.539> see<00:01:31.719> that<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:31.960> have<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.649> total<00:01:33.549> of<00:01:33.880> five

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
you'll see that I have a total of five

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.149 
you'll see that I have a total of five
on<00:01:35.140> each<00:01:35.500> side

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
on each side

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.940 
on each side
coming<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:36.759> sixth<00:01:37.329> one<00:01:37.539> in<00:01:37.719> the<00:01:37.899> center<00:01:38.380> so

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
coming to a sixth one in the center so

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.580 
coming to a sixth one in the center so
there's<00:01:39.130> 11<00:01:39.789> along<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.420> outside<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:41.020> one<00:01:41.409> in

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
there's 11 along the outside and one in

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.719 
there's 11 along the outside and one in
the<00:01:41.680> middle<00:01:41.950> which<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.250> going<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.399> help<00:01:42.549> to

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
the middle which is going to help to

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.359 
the middle which is going to help to
anchor<00:01:43.119> our<00:01:43.299> wire<00:01:43.509> where<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.899> begin<00:01:44.200> with<00:01:44.439> and

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
anchor our wire where we begin with and

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.399 
anchor our wire where we begin with and
also<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:46.240> give<00:01:46.390> us<00:01:46.539> the<00:01:46.869> little<00:01:47.079> loop<00:01:47.380> that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
also to give us the little loop that

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.749 
also to give us the little loop that
were<00:01:47.619> going<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.799> be<00:01:47.859> able<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.070> attach<00:01:48.460> our

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
were going to be able to attach our

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.620 
were going to be able to attach our
bicone<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:49.840> to<00:01:49.899> begin<00:01:51.450> we're<00:01:52.450> going<00:01:52.479> to

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
bicone to so to begin we're going to

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.080 
bicone to so to begin we're going to
measure<00:01:52.869> 12<00:01:53.439> inches<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:56.039> wire

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.360 

and<00:02:01.090> we're<00:02:01.450> gonna<00:02:01.540> start<00:02:01.870> by<00:02:02.110> making<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:03.160> little

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
and we're gonna start by making a little

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.090 
and we're gonna start by making a little
loop<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.600> we're<00:02:04.690> going<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.840> grasp<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.500> tip<00:02:05.740> of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
loop so we're going to grasp the tip of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.990 
loop so we're going to grasp the tip of
our<00:02:06.190> wire<00:02:06.460> with<00:02:06.790> our<00:02:06.970> round<00:02:07.180> nose<00:02:07.360> pliers<00:02:09.000> bend

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
our wire with our round nose pliers bend

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.410 
our wire with our round nose pliers bend
it<00:02:10.240> just<00:02:10.450> into<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.320> nice<00:02:11.530> little<00:02:11.710> loop<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.420> then

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
it just into a nice little loop and then

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.410 
it just into a nice little loop and then
bend<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.990> back<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.940> what<00:02:16.120> we've<00:02:16.240> got<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
bend it back that's what we've got to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.560 
bend it back that's what we've got to
start<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:18.400> we're<00:02:18.520> going<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.700> place<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.270> loop

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
start so we're going to place this loop

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.920 
start so we're going to place this loop
onto<00:02:19.959> our<00:02:20.800> first<00:02:21.100> peg<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.720> going<00:02:22.870> to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
onto our first peg and this is going to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.330 
onto our first peg and this is going to
anchor<00:02:23.140> our<00:02:23.290> wire<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.830> going<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.040> give<00:02:24.160> us<00:02:24.190> a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
anchor our wire it's going to give us a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.120 
anchor our wire it's going to give us a
place<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.580> start<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.530> now<00:02:26.830> we're<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.070> to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
place to start and now we're going to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.590 
place to start and now we're going to
hold<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:28.020> as<00:02:29.020> best<00:02:29.290> we<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.670> go<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.360> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
hold it as best we can and go to the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.699 
hold it as best we can and go to the
first<00:02:31.959> peg<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:34.090> now<00:02:34.390> you're<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.470> what

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
first peg and now you're going to what

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.820 
first peg and now you're going to what
you're<00:02:35.739> going<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.430> you're<00:02:36.970> going<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.340 
you're going to do is you're going to
press<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.860> wire<00:02:39.340> down<00:02:39.700> as<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.270> work<00:02:40.480> hold<00:02:41.200> it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
press the wire down as you work hold it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.100 
press the wire down as you work hold it
in<00:02:41.470> place<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.220> twist<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.390> around<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.870> pegs

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
in place and twist it around the pegs

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.990 
in place and twist it around the pegs
and<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:44.950> thing<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.280> found<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.700> works<00:02:45.910> really

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
and one thing I found that works really

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240 
and one thing I found that works really
well<00:02:46.209> for<00:02:46.480> me<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.260> move<00:02:47.470> my<00:02:47.709> wig<00:02:48.010> jig

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
well for me is I like to move my wig jig

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.300 
well for me is I like to move my wig jig
as<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.760> work<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.270> just<00:02:49.720> find<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.140> lot<00:02:50.260> easier<00:02:50.320> so

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
as I work I just find it a lot easier so

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.890 
as I work I just find it a lot easier so
now<00:02:51.459> I'm<00:02:51.550> going<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.760> hold<00:02:52.000> where<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.660> just

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
now I'm going to hold where it just

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.030 
now I'm going to hold where it just
curved<00:02:53.290> go<00:02:54.220> around<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.940> peg<00:02:55.800> almost<00:02:56.800> like<00:02:56.920> in

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
curved go around that peg almost like in

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.370 
curved go around that peg almost like in
a<00:02:57.100> figure<00:02:57.430> eight<00:02:57.580> pattern<00:02:57.610> back<00:02:58.600> under<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
a figure eight pattern back under the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.190 
a figure eight pattern back under the
peg<00:02:59.620> opposite<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.510> now<00:03:01.720> I'm<00:03:01.840> going<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.049> hold

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
peg opposite and now I'm going to hold

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.300 
peg opposite and now I'm going to hold
this<00:03:02.470> wire<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.070> really<00:03:03.370> press<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.790> down<00:03:04.980> go<00:03:05.980> up

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
this wire and really press it down go up

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.490 
this wire and really press it down go up
through<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.209> peg<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.780> I'm<00:03:07.930> just<00:03:08.140> going<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.320> do

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
through the peg and I'm just going to do

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.770 
through the peg and I'm just going to do
this<00:03:08.650> figure<00:03:09.130> eight<00:03:09.280> pattern<00:03:09.450> I'm<00:03:10.450> going

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
this figure eight pattern I'm going

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.910 
this figure eight pattern I'm going
under<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> other<00:03:11.380> peg<00:03:11.709> opposite<00:03:13.830> curving<00:03:14.830> it

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
under the other peg opposite curving it

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.860 
under the other peg opposite curving it
around<00:03:15.510> holding<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.720> place<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.690> other

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
around holding it in place to the other

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.680 
around holding it in place to the other
side<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.720> want<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.019> pull<00:03:23.260> pretty<00:03:23.769> snug

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
side and you want to pull pretty snug

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.850 
side and you want to pull pretty snug
because<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.930> don't<00:03:26.110> want<00:03:26.260> your<00:03:26.380> fire<00:03:26.620> your

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
because you don't want your fire your

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.800 
because you don't want your fire your
wires<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.489> be<00:03:27.519> loose<00:03:27.820> in<00:03:28.030> there<00:03:30.600> I'm<00:03:31.600> just

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
wires to be loose in there I'm just

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.979 
wires to be loose in there I'm just
going<00:03:32.079> back<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.410> forth<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:34.269> pressing<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.900> you

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
going back and forth and pressing it you

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.680 
going back and forth and pressing it you
can<00:03:35.140> even<00:03:35.200> reach<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.709> there<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:37.120> not<00:03:37.329> remove

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
can even reach in there do not remove

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.690 
can even reach in there do not remove
this<00:03:37.930> middle<00:03:38.530> peg<00:03:38.769> though<00:03:39.010> because<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.430> is

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
this middle peg though because that is

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.089 
this middle peg though because that is
still<00:03:39.850> anchoring<00:03:40.600> your<00:03:40.750> wire<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.140> place

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.350 

and<00:03:47.099> this<00:03:47.250> does<00:03:47.489> take<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.790> little<00:03:48.060> bit<00:03:48.270> of

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
and this does take a little bit of

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.880 
and this does take a little bit of
strength<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.930> get<00:03:49.080> these<00:03:49.230> straight<00:03:49.650> that's

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
strength to get these straight that's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.479 
strength to get these straight that's
why<00:03:50.069> I<00:03:50.099> mentioned<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.330> can<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:52.050> it<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.489> 24

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
why I mentioned that you can do it in 24

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.839 
why I mentioned that you can do it in 24
gauge<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.690> not<00:03:54.989> going<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.380> be<00:03:55.500> quite<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:56.040> solid

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
gauge it's not going to be quite a solid

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.860 
gauge it's not going to be quite a solid
and<00:03:57.060> sturdy<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:58.200> will<00:03:58.440> work<00:03:59.239> but<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.540> lot

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
and sturdy it will work but it is a lot

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.589 
and sturdy it will work but it is a lot
easier<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:08.030> we're<00:04:09.030> just<00:04:09.180> going<00:04:09.390> back<00:04:09.540> and

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
easier and we're just going back and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.849 
easier and we're just going back and
forth<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.110> same<00:04:10.380> pattern<00:04:15.560> okay<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.799> I'm

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
forth the same pattern okay and I'm

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.349 
forth the same pattern okay and I'm
pressing<00:04:17.190> it<00:04:17.430> down<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.970> want<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.209> make<00:04:18.329> sure

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
pressing it down I want to make sure

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.920 
pressing it down I want to make sure
it's<00:04:18.600> nice<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.320> even<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.919> flat<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:21.570> now<00:04:21.750> I'm

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
it's nice and even and flat and now I'm

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.350 
it's nice and even and flat and now I'm
coming<00:04:22.380> up<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.620> my<00:04:22.800> last<00:04:23.040> peg<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:24.120> I'm<00:04:24.210> just

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
coming up to my last peg so I'm just

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.870 
coming up to my last peg so I'm just
gonna<00:04:24.479> go<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:26.130> as<00:04:26.280> if<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.610> another

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
gonna go just as if it was another

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.570 
gonna go just as if it was another
regular<00:04:27.360> one<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.720> loop<00:04:28.470> it<00:04:28.620> around<00:04:28.710> now<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.400> I

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
regular one and loop it around now so I

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.640 
regular one and loop it around now so I
want<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.820> move<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.630> all<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.080> way<00:04:31.200> around<00:04:31.320> that

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
want to move it all the way around that

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.870 
want to move it all the way around that
top<00:04:31.979> peg<00:04:32.760> to<00:04:33.240> make<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.660> loop<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.580> cross<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.790> over

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
top peg to make a loop and cross it over

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.850 
top peg to make a loop and cross it over
and<00:04:36.240> I'm<00:04:36.750> going<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.990> trim<00:04:37.229> that<00:04:37.260> when<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.620> remove

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
and I'm going to trim that when I remove

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.969 
and I'm going to trim that when I remove
it<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.750> this<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.110> what<00:04:40.260> we've<00:04:40.380> got<00:04:40.410> for<00:04:40.889> our

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
it so this is what we've got for our

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.379 
it so this is what we've got for our
tree<00:04:41.990> now<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.050> remove<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:43.970> some<00:04:44.970> people<00:04:45.270> like

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
tree now to remove it some people like

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.420 
tree now to remove it some people like
to<00:04:45.419> remove<00:04:45.810> all<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.200> pegs<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.680> actually<00:04:47.100> like

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
to remove all the pegs I actually like

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.370 
to remove all the pegs I actually like
to<00:04:47.460> just<00:04:47.850> very<00:04:48.300> carefully<00:04:50.240> scoot<00:04:51.240> my<00:04:51.450> wire<00:04:51.690> up

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
to just very carefully scoot my wire up

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.580 
to just very carefully scoot my wire up
along<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.250> pegs<00:04:53.520> if<00:04:54.360> they<00:04:54.510> come<00:04:54.720> out<00:04:54.750> great<00:04:55.320> if

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
along the pegs if they come out great if

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.860 
along the pegs if they come out great if
they<00:04:55.919> don't<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.520> doesn't<00:04:56.640> matter<00:04:57.000> do<00:04:57.840> not

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
they don't it doesn't matter do not

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.630 
they don't it doesn't matter do not
force<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.830> just<00:04:59.310> go<00:04:59.520> nice<00:04:59.789> and<00:05:00.530> slow<00:05:01.640> scooting

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
force it just go nice and slow scooting

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.520 
force it just go nice and slow scooting
it<00:05:02.760> up<00:05:02.880> along<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.750> make<00:05:03.930> sure<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.229> tries<00:05:04.500> to

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
it up along it make sure it tries to

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.070 
it up along it make sure it tries to
make<00:05:04.860> sure<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.130> comes<00:05:05.310> all<00:05:05.610> together<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.930> that

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
make sure it comes all together so that

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.990 
make sure it comes all together so that
you're<00:05:07.200> not<00:05:07.350> having<00:05:08.070> one<00:05:08.220> part<00:05:08.760> of<00:05:08.880> it

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
you're not having one part of it

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.330 
you're not having one part of it
completely<00:05:09.570> undone<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.680> one<00:05:10.800> part<00:05:11.070> still

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
completely undone and one part still

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.570 
completely undone and one part still
back<00:05:11.640> down<00:05:11.669> here<00:05:14.810> there<00:05:15.810> we<00:05:15.990> go

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
back down here there we go

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.750 
back down here there we go
so<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.669> just<00:05:17.850> popped<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.330> off<00:05:19.550> now<00:05:20.550> we're<00:05:20.669> going

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
so it just popped it off now we're going

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.010 
so it just popped it off now we're going
to<00:05:20.820> trim<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.360> top

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.920 

like<00:05:25.920> so<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.970> notice<00:05:27.210> we<00:05:27.300> had<00:05:27.450> some<00:05:27.630> extra

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
like so you notice we had some extra

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.840 
like so you notice we had some extra
wire<00:05:28.080> you<00:05:28.500> want<00:05:28.710> that<00:05:28.890> extra<00:05:29.190> wire<00:05:29.370> otherwise

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
wire you want that extra wire otherwise

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.670 
wire you want that extra wire otherwise
it's<00:05:30.030> going<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.180> be<00:05:30.240> too<00:05:30.480> hard<00:05:30.750> when<00:05:31.410> you<00:05:31.500> get

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
it's going to be too hard when you get

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.030 
it's going to be too hard when you get
up<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:32.100> top<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.550> make<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:33.030> final<00:05:33.270> loop<00:05:34.040> so

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
up to the top to make that final loop so

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.620 
up to the top to make that final loop so
now<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.520> beauty<00:05:35.790> of<00:05:35.820> this<00:05:36.000> is<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.480> it<00:05:36.600> is

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
now the beauty of this is that it is

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.120 
now the beauty of this is that it is
wire<00:05:37.140> so<00:05:37.920> just<00:05:38.220> go<00:05:38.400> ahead<00:05:38.450> and<00:05:39.450> bend<00:05:40.380> it<00:05:40.590> if<00:05:40.890> it

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
wire so just go ahead and bend it if it

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.570 
wire so just go ahead and bend it if it
came<00:05:41.730> out<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:42.000> shape<00:05:42.210> at<00:05:42.360> all<00:05:43.220> bend<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.400> into

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
came out of shape at all bend it into

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.800 
came out of shape at all bend it into
shape<00:05:44.970> how<00:05:45.180> you<00:05:45.240> want<00:05:45.570> it<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:51.270> can<00:05:51.570> try

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
shape how you want it you can try

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.940 
shape how you want it you can try
hammering<00:05:52.410> this<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:52.860> don't<00:05:53.430> necessarily

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
hammering this I don't necessarily

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.500 
hammering this I don't necessarily
recommend<00:05:55.950> it<00:05:56.550> unless<00:05:56.760> you<00:05:56.940> have<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.150> nice

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
recommend it unless you have a nice

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.830 
recommend it unless you have a nice
nylon<00:05:57.960> mallet<00:05:58.890> otherwise<00:05:59.310> it<00:05:59.550> will<00:05:59.700> Mar<00:06:00.030> the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
nylon mallet otherwise it will Mar the

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.540 
nylon mallet otherwise it will Mar the
finish<00:06:00.870> on<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.590> green<00:06:01.800> wire<00:06:02.040> and<00:06:02.070> it<00:06:02.400> will

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
finish on the green wire and it will

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.050 
finish on the green wire and it will
ding<00:06:02.790> so<00:06:03.210> if<00:06:03.750> you<00:06:04.050> do<00:06:04.230> have<00:06:04.440> a<00:06:04.710> nylon<00:06:05.160> hammer<00:06:05.580> go

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
ding so if you do have a nylon hammer go

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.090 
ding so if you do have a nylon hammer go
ahead<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.570> you<00:06:06.900> can<00:06:06.930> hammer<00:06:07.320> it<00:06:07.440> gently<00:06:07.950> on<00:06:08.070> a

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
ahead and you can hammer it gently on a

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.280 
ahead and you can hammer it gently on a
bench<00:06:08.340> block<00:06:08.580> otherwise<00:06:09.540> just<00:06:09.960> use<00:06:10.050> your

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
bench block otherwise just use your

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.770 
bench block otherwise just use your
fingers<00:06:10.790> so<00:06:11.790> now<00:06:11.910> we<00:06:11.970> just<00:06:12.210> need<00:06:12.360> to<00:06:12.450> complete

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
fingers so now we just need to complete

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.860 
fingers so now we just need to complete
our<00:06:12.810> earring<00:06:13.200> we<00:06:13.500> have<00:06:13.650> our<00:06:13.800> shape<00:06:14.540> to<00:06:15.540> do<00:06:15.690> that

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
our earring we have our shape to do that

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.150 
our earring we have our shape to do that
we're<00:06:16.050> going<00:06:16.170> to<00:06:16.230> take<00:06:16.440> one<00:06:16.680> of<00:06:16.710> these<00:06:16.830> head

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
we're going to take one of these head

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.050 
we're going to take one of these head
pins<00:06:17.540> put<00:06:18.540> the<00:06:18.690> little<00:06:18.870> bicone<00:06:19.320> on<00:06:19.470> it<00:06:19.970> and<00:06:20.970> I'm

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
pins put the little bicone on it and I'm

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:29.390 
pins put the little bicone on it and I'm
just<00:06:21.240> going<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.420> make<00:06:21.600> a<00:06:21.750> simple<00:06:22.230> wire<00:06:22.260> loop

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.710 

there<00:06:30.400> we<00:06:30.520> go

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.749 

trim<00:06:36.720> it<00:06:36.840> I'm<00:06:37.530> going<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.740> open<00:06:38.100> it<00:06:38.220> up<00:06:38.310> the<00:06:38.520> same

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
trim it I'm going to open it up the same

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:41.990 
trim it I'm going to open it up the same
way<00:06:38.910> I'd<00:06:39.030> open<00:06:39.300> up<00:06:39.360> a<00:06:39.449> jump<00:06:39.660> ring<00:06:40.820> connect<00:06:41.820> it

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
way I'd open up a jump ring connect it

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.830 
way I'd open up a jump ring connect it
onto<00:06:42.509> that<00:06:42.540> bottom<00:06:42.960> loop<00:06:46.220> owes<00:06:47.220> it<00:06:47.490> to<00:06:47.780> see<00:06:48.780> if

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
onto that bottom loop owes it to see if

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.529 
onto that bottom loop owes it to see if
you<00:06:48.930> need<00:06:49.080> to<00:06:49.169> close<00:06:49.350> this<00:06:49.530> loop<00:06:49.800> at<00:06:49.919> all<00:06:50.009> -

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
you need to close this loop at all -

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.189 
you need to close this loop at all -
there<00:06:51.539> we<00:06:51.720> go

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
there we go

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.749 
there we go
and<00:06:52.889> now<00:06:53.039> just<00:06:53.250> the<00:06:53.400> top<00:06:53.550> part<00:06:55.370> open<00:06:56.370> the<00:06:56.490> loop

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
and now just the top part open the loop

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.330 
and now just the top part open the loop
at<00:06:56.970> the<00:06:57.060> base<00:06:57.240> of<00:06:57.270> the<00:06:57.509> earring<00:06:57.720> hook<00:06:58.220> and<00:06:59.220> then

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
at the base of the earring hook and then

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.760 
at the base of the earring hook and then
let<00:06:59.520> me<00:06:59.550> see<00:06:59.789> my<00:07:00.000> loop<00:07:00.660> is<00:07:00.870> open<00:07:01.350> at<00:07:01.470> the<00:07:01.560> back

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
let me see my loop is open at the back

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.740 
let me see my loop is open at the back
so<00:07:02.190> I<00:07:02.250> want<00:07:02.430> my<00:07:02.520> loop<00:07:02.669> to<00:07:02.880> be<00:07:02.970> open<00:07:03.330> at<00:07:03.449> the<00:07:03.570> back

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.750 
so I want my loop to be open at the back

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:12.140 
so I want my loop to be open at the back
here<00:07:08.840> and<00:07:09.949> there<00:07:10.949> we<00:07:11.100> go<00:07:11.220> we<00:07:11.669> have<00:07:11.820> a<00:07:11.850> really

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
here and there we go we have a really

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.080 
here and there we go we have a really
fun<00:07:12.270> modern<00:07:13.110> Christmas<00:07:13.710> tree<00:07:13.919> earring<00:07:14.130> made
