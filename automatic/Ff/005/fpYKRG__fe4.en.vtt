gigabyte<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.819> RAM<00:03:47.200> computer<00:03:48.200> then<00:03:48.920> I'm

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
gigabyte of RAM computer then I'm

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.120 
gigabyte of RAM computer then I'm
docking<00:03:49.370> here

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
docking here

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.030
