 hello everyone in this video we see how to use wire terminals 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.899
 harmonic 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.809
 is a question that I received today nn has left a comment the tip of the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.730
 refined feet how to use these ebay components of this video now 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.039
 I will show you hiraishin rampant in Galilee and similarly reproposes i 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.369
 Philharmonic sparrows 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.279
 irons to glue these terminals 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.990
 to the philharmonic it is necessary to indicate a ball in this case the barbie 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.250
 trinkets that you will always find on the teletext site 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.470
 msn sciatica residential enough. found glue on the terminal or on 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.470
 philharmonic even if both and then 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.990
 metal philharmonic guitarists inside the post on the terminal done 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.900
 on page 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.830
 the philharmonic terminals final data proponents still hope 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.910
 saaalve different sizes 3-5 little girl forgotten different colors 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.400
 controlled silver 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.660
 read all this is the philharmonic I also told friends on facebook 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.580
 proud of very very stiff metal this fucking beppe presents itself 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.230
 so spring 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.220
 and then to get updates on TV you don't know how to laugh about creating 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.870
 free in mind 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.180
 on the harmonic wire to insert all the series d series or you can use 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.250
 the harmonious son with the soul 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.050
 for a softer processing maybe made in weaving the terminals like 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.500
 he said 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.240
 they are two different sizes and in two different colors 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.880
 here we have the terminals epi mm very close here we have instead i 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.830
 5mm terminals a little bigger this is the silver color e 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.869
 then we reached a lasting color 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.330
 to apply these terminals it was necessary to use glue 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.420
 in this case the anger of belinelli is showing me proposes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.760
 which among other things very practical above all because as you see that also 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.210
 in dyeing it is provided with a small precision hook 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.549
 applicator 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.439
 very thin that will allow you to put the glue for those where 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.969
 necessary without wasting the water and making sure that the ball will be made 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.969
 depositories where we don't want 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.949
 therefore rh 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:37.219
 guitar let's say these criminals on the harmonic wire you simply need 3-1 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:38.770
 determined 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.139
 and it is immediately close all evening because 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.179
 they are sudden terminals xd 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.179
 hole only 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:50.459
 on one side 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.959
 a completely different part of hope 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.899
 proud of you 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:57.420
 he would do me without much on one side 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.519
 and to apply tonight 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.569
 simply put a little glue with the applicator inside the 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.499
 hole in the terminal or otherwise you could also choose to and meter 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.480
 panic at the end purchase 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.500
 direct philharmonic 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.020
 this file has been stressed depending on how you are best in 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.650
 position of 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.989
 d make real experiences for your favorites 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.069
 once applied to the glue 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.329
 on one of the two components or even on both 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.479
 I recommend nuntita too much to mention every 5 hours on TV 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.889
 the terminal masterpieces nothing comes out absolutely unsightly 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.670
 he tells me once installed to just insert 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.809
 the end 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.569
 of your philharmonic 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.569
 inside the terminal this way 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.409
 and so aperitifs finished your creation the same thing you can do with 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.169
 the smaller terminals 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.169
 coppi or smaller terminal prison 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:02.359
 here it is present in the hole and I go to insert the end of the 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.320
 - Philharmonic within the hope 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.370
 of course, first remember to put some glue or on the terminal 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.270
 I have on the final part and harmony potpourri if both and the two components 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.380
 I recommend as far as using rapolla is absolutely not advisable 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:25.490
 to use the crack by accident if you want to find files with different ones because my 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.199
 mind the attacker regarding my experience is absolutely not a 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.250
 bubble indicated for the works of di chieti via as very often variation 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.039
 with the various metal components ikea 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.159
 pokora somehow the inter color hanging is made to feel 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.240
 these metal components how many spoil the colors of some series 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.120
 so surely I advise you to use the glue of chieti via hope 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.419
 always to have been clear ash that has explained to you clearly to clarify all 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.590
 doubts livarno to these terminals philharmonic signaling on video sal√≤
