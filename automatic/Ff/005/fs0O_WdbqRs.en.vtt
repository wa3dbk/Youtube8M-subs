00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.670
 but vechta fought back many 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.860
 Foulpfiffe and possibilities brought 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.530
 Out of rhythm and staggered 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.049
 ski coco with the blog and mathis

 half time again exclamation point 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.130
 also thanks to the acrobatics and 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.230
 Body control by Andrew Rowuditz was 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.040
 the game at halftime at the booth of

 whatever henrik rödl his boys 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.670
 In the cabin it seemed trier 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.010
 now much more consistent in the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.760
 defense and with good options in the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.310
 offensive 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.959
 after the three used by tv news 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.830
 mathis mönninghoff the offering 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.489
 place to the 43 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.980
 36 followed by a small three festival 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.989
 Mathrich proves that he is still one 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.910
 remarkably soft new hands 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.270
 Developments have routinier scores 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.030
 a total of 16 points and bmw 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.130
 richie williams put trier of yet 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.769
 she still has jimmy carter and the 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.110
 played again big after the 8 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.660
 points and showed his whole class 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.090
 Here the considered sidestep to the safe 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.060
 middle distance hit the best animal 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.450
 then the first two-digit leadership 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.700
 59 to 48 middle of the third quarter, the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.560
 tbb so s.presser and wenninghoff 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.830
 again with the three after the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.970
 acrobatic assists contribute 63 54 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.620
 but the raster men settled 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.380
 just do not shake off 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.560
 dirksen strong in one-on-one to 54 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.590
 to 60 also granted trier vechta 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.930
 far too many second chances of throwing up 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.960
 altogether 22 offensively as with us for 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.169
 the enemy is just too much 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.320
 the score after the third quarter 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.500
 64 to 59 for trier bears the showdown 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.500
 start purely in a crazy last 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.539
 Quarter of the state wants that captain 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.570
 Flavio Stückemann cloud up the ball 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.090
 and shortens to 64 66 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.270
 the tbb counters with its strongest 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.000
 phase a 13 2-run jermaine anderson 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.250
 sunk his first threesome and the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.660
 Strong mathis mönninghoff cares 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.700
 five minutes before the end for the 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.160
 supposed preselection 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.410
 second three in a row is for us that 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.240
 play off the day a beautiful 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.530
 The perfect team play 79 to 66 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.710
 the fans in ecstasy 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.020
 the tbb is the winner because of it 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.030
 many foul whigs again destroy the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.639
 trierer rhythmus mdrrich brings his 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:23.729
 Team with safe distance throw to the 69 too 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:25.499
 80 and fighting spirit per tip-in ran again 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.539
 here goes now because of the thin 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.379
 staff blanket watching on the 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.009
 gums 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:34.439
 jenni meets from the distance to 80 284 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.169
 News and Seifert have five fouls 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:39.839
 on the bank nerves flutter begins 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.979
 first messed up on both sides 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:45.479
 dirksen both free throws dungey coco the 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.139
 Zimbabwean man becomes tragic 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:52.499
 figure this blackout at 3 against 1 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.900
 break is the triter mcgregor kelly 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:57.659
 says Thank you sunk for three only 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.569
 a residue for vechta the 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:03.389
 coco doubles the ball again and 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.909
 sparrow becomes hero only where 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.539
 he introduces the ball 52 seconds ago 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:12.120
 close to 85 to 84 then he blocks 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.819
 the last despair of bugner 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.669
 The acclaimed first Bundesliga victory for 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.740
 rasta vechta is perfect with these fans 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.240
 in the back is the climber absolutely 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.969
 an enrichment for the beko 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.909
 basketball league pet si 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.919
 that's what i have as you said 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:32.999
 many players lived my life the game 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.409
 as a coach and yes and that belongs 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:37.110
 to 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:39.599
 these are those tingling and the game is 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.389
 not over there and we were at 13 14 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.649
 points behind and the team that 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.599
 because had turned 

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:47.550
 I'm really proud of the guys 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.719

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.330
 matthias bettinger

 I think basketball is like that 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.889
 always open no matter how much you lead 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.589
 straight and I think that about us on 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:01.289
 have killed us in the end 22 22 

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:02.399
 offensive about us are far too many and 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.860
 we have to work on that 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.869
 the tbb until now on sunday against 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.289
