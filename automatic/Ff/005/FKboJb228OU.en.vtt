I'm<00:00:36.060> from<00:00:36.300> California<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:38.130> was<00:00:38.310> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I'm from California and this was the

first time I've ever lived in the
Midwest<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.470> so<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.340> difficult

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
Midwest and so it was really difficult

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
Midwest and so it was really difficult

environment and not really knowing
anybody<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.080> the<00:00:46.170> community<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.830> feel<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
anybody in the community I feel that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
anybody in the community I feel that
certain<00:00:48.840> things<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.470> shouldn't<00:00:50.220> weigh<00:00:50.370> on

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
certain things that shouldn't weigh on

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
certain things that shouldn't weigh on
our<00:00:50.640> minds<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.330> weigh<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.690> minds<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
our minds do weigh on our minds and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.100 
our minds do weigh on our minds and
having<00:00:52.949> someone<00:00:53.250> there<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.910> talk<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
having someone there to talk to is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.380 
having someone there to talk to is
really<00:00:55.860> useful<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.520> remember<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
really useful I remember when I was a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
really useful I remember when I was a
freshman<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.989> looked<00:00:58.260> heavily<00:00:58.590> upon<00:00:58.830> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
freshman I looked heavily upon the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.850 
freshman I looked heavily upon the
seniors<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.360> were<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.750> campus<00:01:01.080> for<00:01:01.500> help<00:01:01.680> for

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
seniors that were on campus for help for

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.160 
seniors that were on campus for help for
guidance<00:01:02.220> but<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.910> year<00:01:03.390> passed<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:03.930> left

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
guidance but a year passed and they left

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
guidance but a year passed and they left
and<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> didn't<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.190> where<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.430> turn<00:01:05.610> at

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

that is somewhat of a pillar for the

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.870 
that is somewhat of a pillar for the
community<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:34.709> huge<00:02:35.010> because<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.549> they

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
community it's huge because they they

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.309

know the experiences of the past the

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.110 
know the experiences of the past the
present<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.799> they<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.310> they<00:02:38.730> maybe<00:02:38.910> have<00:02:39.060> a

present and they can they maybe have a

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.460 
present and they can they maybe have a
better<00:02:39.299> sense<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.600> where<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.200> Muslim

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
better sense of where the Muslim

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.860 
better sense of where the Muslim
community<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.829> heading

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
community is heading

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.610 
community is heading
I<00:02:46.730> think<00:02:47.730> providing<00:02:48.180> safe<00:02:48.569> spaces<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.409> safe

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
I think providing safe spaces and a safe

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.229 
I think providing safe spaces and a safe
space<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.099> probably<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.610> number<00:02:50.879> one<00:02:51.030> thing

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
space is probably the number one thing

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.899 
space is probably the number one thing
that<00:02:51.269> students<00:02:51.780> need<00:02:52.099> not<00:02:53.099> just<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.549> terms<00:02:53.760> of

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
that students need not just in terms of

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.100 
that students need not just in terms of
a<00:02:53.970> physical<00:02:54.150> space<00:02:54.599> although<00:02:54.870> that's

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
a physical space although that's

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.770 
a physical space although that's
important<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.549> structure<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.510> as

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
important to like a structure but as

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.170 
important to like a structure but as
safe<00:02:58.319> space<00:02:58.620> metaphorically<00:02:59.370> between<00:02:59.879> people

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
safe space metaphorically between people

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.880 
safe space metaphorically between people
in<00:03:00.299> a<00:03:00.390> community<00:03:00.840> there<00:03:01.260> was<00:03:01.379> one<00:03:01.590> particular

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
in a community there was one particular

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.949 
in a community there was one particular
time<00:03:02.370> after<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.030> central<00:03:03.269> guidance<00:03:03.690> class

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
time after the central guidance class

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.800 
time after the central guidance class
where<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.769> had<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> couple<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.340> questions<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:06.000> I

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
where I had a couple of questions and I

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.319 
where I had a couple of questions and I
was<00:03:07.590> able<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.799> pull<00:03:08.010> CSeries<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.700> side<00:03:08.879> and

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
was able to pull CSeries to the side and

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.690 
was able to pull CSeries to the side and
he<00:03:09.870> literally<00:03:10.440> spent<00:03:10.769> probably<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.280> 40

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
he literally spent probably like 40

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.550 
he literally spent probably like 40
minutes<00:03:11.849> with<00:03:12.150> me<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.870> know<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.230> was<00:03:13.349> late

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
minutes with me and I know it was late

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.500 
minutes with me and I know it was late
he<00:03:13.709> probably<00:03:13.920> had<00:03:14.159> other<00:03:14.280> things<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.819> do<00:03:15.000> but

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
he probably had other things to do but

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.150 
he probably had other things to do but
not<00:03:15.720> at<00:03:15.900> all<00:03:16.049> during<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.379> time<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.980> feel
