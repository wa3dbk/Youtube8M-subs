00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello everyone and welcome to string 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.880
 of fashion he dot fr today we 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 let's get the wings the wings of the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.070
 phoenix is ​​of course the mark the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.849
 bitfenix well known for its entire range 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.039
 of housings 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.160
 today we will see wathier 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.080
 entry-level so a first price on 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 starts with the carton because the day 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 their faithful cards lives phoenix on 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.500
 find of course the logo a grain of 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.179
 place on the facade the name of the case 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 as well as the brand website 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.950
 we return cardboard that's heavy and we 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.379
 find patterns of the case with 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.660
 its main assets we all new 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.989
 so we lean the case still in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.789
 its plastic packaging 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 he is surrounded well framed by cases 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.559
 polystyrene benepe history of 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 travel in peace see 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.680
 now closer this case so 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.289
 beauty of color to black 1 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.710
 the plastic facade the rest is in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.470
 steel 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.510
 we can find it also in white so 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.600
 a deep true that at 170 mm for a 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.729
 height of 428 m and width of 185 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.670
 mm the facade we find the logo 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.770
 bitfenix and three goal caches in 5 25 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.689
 inches and so a facet while 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.330
 plastic no cover no 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.380
 coating I mean in rescue 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.900
 level to bring the right ground 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.369
 no glass door no glass of a 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.770
 pass a big window it's at all 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.390
 full opposite the same 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.960
 good there it's a little more classic you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.079
 tell me on the front part of this side 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.360
 we have the front panel on the side 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 by the way is in low hours 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.290
 a little zoom on on this panel on 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.399
 found a usb port 3.0 usb port 2.0 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.990
 audio input outputs the led the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.990
 reset button and the power button 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.810
 let's move on to the back of the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.880
 housing 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.040
 so with a heaping food 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 in the lower part that we see that we 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.880
 see here this location pci where 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.780
 we are the conrad is an average box 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.340
 tower in the format atix this little cache that 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.290
 I just eclipse the chassis and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.060
 do a hides to hide the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.459
 pci card bindings 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.410
 you just have to clip no life 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.019
 often that tonight aside of course for 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.140
 fix the cards 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.330
 it's simple effective at the top we have 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.160
 sure the location of the two shield waters 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.310
 pipe runs and a fan in 120 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.680
 mm that provides with the remote box 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.030
 side are attached to the chassis thanks to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.860
 hand screws that we are going to rush 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.319
 to remove history from getting an idea 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.319
 of the interior layout of what brad 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.849
 no it's not the storm it's me 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.040
 side plates quite fine my faith 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.299
 go we end up with an interior 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.430
 black everything - whose layout and my faith 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.560
 well designed we have a clearance at the level 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.680
 storage units that will allow in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.180
 placing to put in place 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.700
 graphics cards of a fairly long length 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.859
 consistent up to 30 centimeters before 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.670
 to see in more detail this interior on 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:24.030
 attack the bundle that is constituted 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.459
 therefore a guide that guides one 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.799
 pci square brackets reflexes and 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.299
 of a bag containing all the life 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.420
 run in the spring to set up 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.519
 the configuration within your morale 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.230
 So we come back to the interview box 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.620
 so with right if I was storing 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.600
 we start from the bottom with a hdd cage 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.639
 with three disk slots 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.970
 hard in 3 and a half inches of 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:50.100
 plastic slots that you have 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.750
 could see him these cards to facilitate the 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.340
 setting up your hard drive which 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.889
 are maintained by five blocks so 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.959
 a fixing system without tools 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.090
 unlike the one-and-a-half cage 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.069
 which requires the use of screws for 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.319
 fix your and if it's at the level of the 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.630
 bay 5 25 inches we find a system 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.360
 fixing without tools 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.770
 very simple very effective side plateau 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.290
 motherboards we have a big opening 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.850
 at the feeding level with four 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.739
 other small openings allowing the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.860
 passage of cables 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:23.550
 the tray is provided with offset that must 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.560
 in fact serves as the spacer a 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.420
 opening allowing access to 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.390
 the back of the motherboard found 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.760
 of course the fan in 120 mm is 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.530
 quite simple but the essential is there 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.080
 even the cages of the storage units 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.150
 have a hole in the facilities on 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.390
 passage of the airflow from the front of the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.550
 casing to entrust it to the level of 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.780
 power supply this one will propose 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.060
 between 4 4 small studs - idea naming 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.180
 that we do not have small children 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.010
 rubber pads that do not have on 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.960
 the reja if we find the different 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:03.690
 frontman cables she at the level of the 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.340
 bcn 5 inches we will end up with a 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.710
 more classic fastening system so 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.560
 with screws and his home that 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:15.860
 accompanies we find 1 on the units 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.210
 storage of different openings 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.940
 the great openness in the focused to 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.470
 the back of the black card no point 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.990
 anchor at this level there high level the 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.790
 plateau because in fact the plateau he 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.710
 arrived at the flower of the side door 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.480
 as we can see from the shot 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.350
 cable fixing will be done at the level 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.110
 small openings 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.810
 there will be a little more room for 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.120
 of 80 frankly that I come from you 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.300
 show we're going to spend now on the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.279
 front of the case that we will remove the 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.990
 frame 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:50.199
 so cautiously story not to 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.439
 break and little clips what they are in 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:57.839
 plastic I remind you me it's 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:06:02.919
 dismount quite easily because finally yes 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:06.610
 here is the plastic and the part 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:10.569
 metallic with the three slots 5 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:15.339
 25 inches the front that rather lateral 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:16.659
 panel to model connectivity and seven 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:20.229
 plastic elements that I'm going 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:23.409
 of eclipsed chassis so there is 4.4 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:26.080
 clipse so this is actually a 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.839
 filter that conceals locations 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.180
 two fans in 120 mm these 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.099
 fans will resume will settle 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.330
 directly on the filter through the holes 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:39.159
 that I have just shown you both 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.969
 fans and after we put it all back 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:46.479
 in place and we end up with with a 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:48.969
 body will have good ideas by two 120 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.249
 mm in front we put back to the facade in 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.279
 place and we'll go over the top of 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:53.279
 housing 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:02.259
 I switch the case of course 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.819
 equipped with four plastic feet but 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:05.649
 totally plastic there is no 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.379
 no rubber pads to finish 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:10.020
 his feet decidedly at comrades on 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:14.020
 the moral tale not the rubber 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.839
 we also have a removable filter or for the 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.919
 good power supply even though the 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:20.080
 rubber is not part of 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.939
 materials used on what is sold 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.800
 I must admit that the case is when 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:24.780
 even accounts on good fit 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.819
 inside 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.949
 everything is there the superfluity was put from 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:32.439
 side so to get a floor price 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:34.930
 indeed you will find this case at 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:37.750
 price of 40 euros so a very price 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:41.259
 affordable it's over for this 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.120
 video about the bitfenix cobra do not hesitate 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:45.460
 not to come to see us on the site and I 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.289
 tell you next time about the 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.400
 chain of modest point fr to be 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:50.400
 charles hello thank you
