I<00:02:36.290> think<00:02:37.290> yeah<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.830> was<00:02:37.950> good<00:02:38.130> for<00:02:38.280> us<00:02:38.340> I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
I think yeah I think I was good for us I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.100 
I think yeah I think I was good for us I
think<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:39.150> would<00:02:39.210> love<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.510> have<00:02:39.660> more

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
think you would love to have more

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.140 
think you would love to have more
practice<00:02:40.500> time<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.860> we<00:02:40.950> all<00:02:41.100> would<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.820> think

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
practice time as we all would so I think

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
practice time as we all would so I think
I<00:02:42.210> was<00:02:42.300> good<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.660> us<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.050> helps<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.340> we

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
I was good for us and it helps that we

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.070 
I was good for us and it helps that we
scored<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.910> plumbing<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.450> generally<00:02:45.900> score

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
scored the plumbing and generally score

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.150 
scored the plumbing and generally score
the<00:02:46.170> ball<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.410> shot<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> ball<00:02:46.770> better<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.070> think

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the ball we shot the ball better I think

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.120 
the ball we shot the ball better I think
that<00:02:47.370> mr.<00:02:47.730> Reese<00:02:47.880> tonight<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.980> we

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that mr. Reese tonight so I think we

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.460 
that mr. Reese tonight so I think we
just<00:02:50.160> might<00:02:50.340> score<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> ball<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.470> pathway

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
just might score the ball and pathway

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.200 
just might score the ball and pathway

to<00:03:28.320> accomplish<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.640> just<00:03:29.820> kind<00:03:29.970> of

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
to accomplish all you it's just kind of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.880 
to accomplish all you it's just kind of
more<00:03:30.180> time<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.540> specifically<00:03:31.140> work<00:03:31.350> on<00:03:31.560> thanks

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
more time to specifically work on thanks

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.970 
more time to specifically work on thanks
why<00:03:32.100> i<00:03:32.130> meant<00:03:32.580> in<00:03:32.700> terms<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.209> harassment

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
why i meant in terms of just harassment

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.440 
why i meant in terms of just harassment
grasping<00:03:34.980> themselves<00:03:35.730> or<00:03:36.120> anything<00:03:36.420> that

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
grasping themselves or anything that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.380 
grasping themselves or anything that
became<00:03:36.930> easier<00:03:37.350> after<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.459> think<00:03:39.299> we've

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
became easier after that I think we've

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.850 
became easier after that I think we've
got<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.570> pretty<00:03:39.720> good<00:03:39.900> idea<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:40.350> think<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:40.769> it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
got a pretty good idea I think but it

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.009 
got a pretty good idea I think but it
helps<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.760> always<00:03:42.000> helps<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.299> revisit

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
helps to it always helps to revisit

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.810 
helps to it always helps to revisit

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
we get a chance to do that with the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.110 
we get a chance to do that with the
