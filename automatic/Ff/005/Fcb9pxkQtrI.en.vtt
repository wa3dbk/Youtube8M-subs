00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.750

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.670
 zone is so let's start the first 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.960
 fabric that I will show you 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.329
 hence it is 100% cotton time cotton 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.770
 I think it's beautiful because he looks at it 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.020

 It looks beautiful this summer in Brazil. 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 getting to travel both to the government 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.299

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.320
 New to the bank for you, my videos. 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.390
 of the people who accompany me know will 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 to know for sure this was the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 first it is a 100% cotton cotton and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.509
 It cost December the method we go 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.729
 stay in the beautiful clothes because I think 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.729
 these prints are super high 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.909
 other fabric I bought clothes and 50 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.790
 centimeter said from here it's a nest 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.619
 no 100% clean it myself with personal meter 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.540
 Because he's black because I want to do it. 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.159
 a high waist shorts 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.750
 but as a slightly different model I already 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.700
 I have red you have already seen if you 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 I want to leave nobody here and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.100
 I already have a white one already I have 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.439
 also in the green has several more a black 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.399
 It's incredible, there is not I do not have one. 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.899
 mall 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.159
 I have a black shorts but not that I 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.899
 I did it, it's not the way I want it. 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.460
 because it was not what you did so do not leave 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.200
 The way I want, I'll know. 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.240
 sew and you can make clothes 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.219
 Wherever you want you still have doubts. 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.979
 I buy fabric as I already told you 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.450
 I think fabrics in the store are beautiful and 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.860
 usually when I buy I go 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.820
 think of what I will do 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.679
 but the main 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.450
 they are this that I want to make one 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.330
 shock but I 'm not sure of anything 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.550
 but surely we can expect that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.980
 It's going to be a cool thing to be cool and easy. 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.530
 and usually makes clothes cool and easy 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.260
 so this one to him was five because 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.090
 It was just killing me. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.430
 Another thing I bought the fabric was 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:35.860
 this here is a synthetic skin was 8 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:40.660
 euros and 80 by stf is with skin is with it 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.760
 I bought it to make us purse is 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.760
 to make bags because it's not I go 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.290
 start making scholarships is also because 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.550
 I saw some people doing then 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.530
 I said I'll do it, I'll try too. 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.630
 do we never actually did more 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.070
 I'll try to do, and I will not 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.709
 they will show you if you like 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.500

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.140
 This one is skinned with that super super. 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.760
 cool be different now everything beating 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.050
 This was the ninth goal in Brazil, I think. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.870
 that has no logic did not sell 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.000
 EcoPet another fabric that I bought 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.220

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.209

 he helps in and here he has these 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.739
 colored prints and I think it will 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.950

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.310

 summer will be beautiful so he was a 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.890
 metro and it was the desire of 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.560
 superliga also this fabric and people 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.920
 go pro next now the other one i bought 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.079
 This kid from here is amazing. 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.120
 I have several clothes, there's only one way out. 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.370
 ball but gains small but very I 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.829
 I do not remember other clothes with polka dots 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.329
 I like Bob did in fact I do not 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.310
 I know when I made it it's blue 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.930
 I do not know if Natalie in the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.100
 to see that the navy blue 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.590
 but they the husband with the balls 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.560
 White I want to make a super dress 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.820
 Beautiful little ball dress that I have 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.250
 have on average low and I wanted to do 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.010
 because I already have it when the thousand 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.180
 years ago when I started doing 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.969
 clothes 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.680
 mexi of the symbolic very cool so I go 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.600
 Try to do the same dress again 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.880
 because I have not watched I do not know 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.850
 where I went to stop my book I had it 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.490
 but I searched here I found that I 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.830
 I do not know , so I'm not going to do military. 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.060
 one of them the same or seemed more 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.740
 or less clear modernize a little 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.780
 because we can not stay in the past 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.880
 We can always keep updating. 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.380
 How do we sew people? 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.900
 You are always doing new things 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.490
 so I 'll do it, I think I'll do it 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.199
 the dress much like the one that already 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.490
 I had it here it's going to be what I thought it was 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.960
 cute with us 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.300
 I think if you do not like it, too. 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.949
 is very simple and very easy and this 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.030
 here it was also descended because it was a 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:58.030
 The last meter fabric I found beautiful is 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.770
 this is how the fabric 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.509
 when I look at hitting the eye like that 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.370
 This is going to take 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:08.190
 there is no way this is an area of 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:14.710
 cotton looks just like it's beautiful it 's a 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.960
 Party is not everything is answered by koff 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.820
 There's nothing you can do because I was there. 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.800
 down and started searching started 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.930
 we move in the province to 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.430
 People think when they hit the eye in that 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.280
 The fabric I said did not 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.250
 He's handsome, I think he's fine. 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.560
 blurred it colors theirs is mixed 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.990
 I have invested also a tac 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.460
 a little like the pictures 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.810
 which is also so much of the medium 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.970
 mixed and I also found 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.470
 invested this one also as soon as 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.280
 there was also said poxa that tissue is 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.659
 pretty 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.099
 It was our piece, it was whole. 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.470
 so here it's about a meter and 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.759
 I paid 9 years also when the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.490
 so we were always a 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.750
 A little less and I think it's beautiful and I'm going to do it 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.430
 something beautiful but I still do not know 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.020
 how to rate how to do just move 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.599
 did not know what to do a lot 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.729
 as it has been a little is not so little to 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:05.590
 do something else one thing right 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.180
 so I hope it comes up with cool ideas 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.520
 to make your clothes ruler because 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.400
 you expect a lot of cool ideas in 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.780
 agency have been beautiful if I lose 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.639
 I'll be losing because of what I did. 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.440
 a generally made clothing is the cool 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.580
 clothes I make I have more or 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.060
 least among the few things that will 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.900
 do 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.820
 and I also thank you all 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.000
 always 10 can continue sending 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.380
 generally only this way the 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 people in more than 10 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.520
 I may not even make the whole idea 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.380
 of that person but I always get some 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.669
 reference of that one sent to me 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.710
 along with that can from here 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.509
 seeming here and we are always a 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.060
 cool thing I always try to create the 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.770
 always try to always create the 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.860
 Easier things possible, people 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.449
 because I know what it's like to make you go 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.680
 Start here to make clothes very complicated. 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.810
 I think the video would not be so cool 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.759
 Why would you say poxa here delay? 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.190
 the clothing determines all this sacrifice 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.750
 for a clothes I prefer to buy account 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.080
 And the way I do, I make clothes. 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.729
 simple is easy so do we 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.130
 It 's cool everyone says 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.300
 I want to do too and it's the right thing because 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.400
 clothes that I can usually people 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.780
 It has very easy and clothes that everyone 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.699

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.560
 Tissue start with this cut 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:17.750
 language up on the clothes you see as 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.190
 It's not complicated, of course, I'll do this. 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.870
 The way I do it only for me if I 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.580
 to do for someone else would have to 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.800
 He loved us among a lot of things 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.330
