00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.589
 the germination of soybean seeds and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.510
 fast plant emergency 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.719
 uniform and with good productive performance 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.639
 They depend on seeds with high vigor to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.870
 explain what is considered a seed 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.730
 with high vigor 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.820
 We are going to talk to the researcher. 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.340
 josÃ© de barros france grandson france what 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.740
 you consider a seed with high 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.869
 force but only with high rigor as 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.779
 You already said well, it's the one you're going to have. 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.149
 a condition of germinating quickly and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.820
 produce a population of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.000
 fast and uniform way is fundamental 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.469
 for the success of soybean 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 establishing the crop with the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.730
 populations of suitable plants and plants 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.129
 high performance 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.489
 a high seed is a seed 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.649
 and will tolerate stress conditions 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.170
 for example what can I say as 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.210
 stress a drought after sowing 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.829
 a cold front that arrives and is very 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.660
 common in southern Brazil and low 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.480
 soil temperature 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.700
 the presence of surface compaction of the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 soil or silting between the lines 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 after a heavy rain then the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.700
 high-vigor seed it has conditions 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.610
 to tolerate is this situation of stress and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:21.090
 germinate and emerge normally by avoiding 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.790
 then to receive the hard replanting thing 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.189
 that a batch of seeds of medium vigor 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.400
 there was precarious color will not have conditions 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.680
 and in this situation when he put the producer 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.020
 think of saving on seed throws hand 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.750
 a lower quality seed it 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 will be more likely to have 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.220
 emergency germination in the field and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.110
 times he's going to have to lay 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.119
 receive the hard and receive the pain or 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.979
 replenishment is a disaster because the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.930
 producer will miss the best 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.909
 sowing will have to look for more 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.520
 seeds on the market will not find the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.680
 ideal cultivar for it will lose 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.600
 efficiency of herbicides in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.180
 fertilizers and so on this 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.229
 you will receive is to result in a 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.270
 lower then the crop producer 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.330
 starting with the high stringency seed 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.790
 he will get a guaranteed insurance but the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.440
 important parameters for a seed 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.330
 with high vigor 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.300
 we have several tests in the laboratory 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.760
 which measure the vigor of the seed as per 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.680
 For example, the tetrazolium test 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.900
 accelerated aging test 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.940
 length and white color is cold and so 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.820
 on says we have more and 11 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.830
 strength tests that can measure the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.460
 performance of the seed for what we 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.100
 of vigor and in this sense the 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.110
 producer of seed that begins 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.550
 tillage with a vigorous seed it will 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.690
 have a greater security of 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.650
 productivity 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.410
 at the experimental level not only with the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.260
 data, but also several 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.970
 national and international institutions 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.940
 at the parcel level we have shown 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.670
 plots that are sown with 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.710
 high stringency seeds can give 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.860
 increases in productivity range from 20 to 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.500
 35 percent that is extremely 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.530
 commercial bandwidth level 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.980
 in agriculture we have observed gains in 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.010
 productivity and up to 10% this is a factor 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.380
 very positive for the producer because 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.570
 it starts with the high vigor seed 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.160
 he will have the security of a good 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.860
 productivity up to a 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.570
 productivity that you recommend 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.230
 would give grain and seed producers 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.660
 that always starts in your crop is in 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.950
 cultivation with the best seed. 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.290
 quality 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.650
 I have a security that this seed has 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.660
 high germination and this will 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.780
 essential for the success of the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.780
 Agriculture
