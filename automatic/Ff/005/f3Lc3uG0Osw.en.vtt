effectively the first way I'll show you
guys<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:36.750> examples<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.860> basically<00:00:38.219> pop

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
guys two examples that basically pop

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.250 
guys two examples that basically pop
flashes<00:00:39.149> most<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.600> guys<00:00:39.719> know<00:00:39.960> what<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
flashes most of you guys know what this

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.430 
flashes most of you guys know what this
is<00:00:40.550> they<00:00:41.550> basically<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:42.600> into<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:43.050> area<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is they basically go into an area and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
is they basically go into an area and
pops<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.190> soon<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.730> enters<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.210> area

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
pops as soon as it enters the area

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.560 
pops as soon as it enters the area
giving<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.079> opponent<00:00:46.260> very<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:46.860> time<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
giving your opponent very little time to

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.799 
giving your opponent very little time to
react<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.600> them<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.079> turn<00:00:49.260> away<00:00:49.410> from<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
react to them and turn away from them so

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
react to them and turn away from them so
I'll<00:00:51.809> show<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> guys<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.320> example<00:00:52.760> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
I'll show you guys one more example the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.610

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
only thing with these kind of flashes is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.080 
only thing with these kind of flashes is
that<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.100> require<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.850> these

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that they require you to know these

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.150 
that they require you to know these
setups<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.870> many<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> guys<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.920> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
lot of pop flash setups so that's why

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
lot of pop flash setups so that's why
I'll<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:02.969> showing<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> guys<00:01:03.570> how<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.080> use<00:01:04.379> your

I'll be showing you guys how to use your
flashes<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> lot<00:01:05.369> more<00:01:05.549> effectively<00:01:06.119> without

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
flashes a lot more effectively without

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
flashes a lot more effectively without
knowing<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.500> pop<00:01:07.650> flash<00:01:07.860> setups

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
knowing these kind of pop flash setups

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.020 
knowing these kind of pop flash setups
and<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.530> next<00:01:10.860> two<00:01:11.010> ways<00:01:11.220> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and that will be the next two ways so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730 
and that will be the next two ways so
this<00:01:12.299> second<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:12.900> I'll<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.080> showing<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.530> guys

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
this second way I'll be showing you guys

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.219 
this second way I'll be showing you guys
on<00:01:13.950> how<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.159> use<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> flash<00:01:14.790> will<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> same

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
on how to use a flash will be the same

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.460 
on how to use a flash will be the same
as<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.580> first<00:01:17.820> flash<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.210> showed<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.659> but

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
as when the first flash I showed you but

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.160 
as when the first flash I showed you but
you'll<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.950> peeking<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.820> before<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> pops<00:01:21.630> if

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you'll be peeking it before it pops if

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.170 
you'll be peeking it before it pops if
you're<00:01:22.680> peeking<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.100> after<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.610> perhaps<00:01:23.850> then

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
you're peeking it after it perhaps then

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.570 
you're peeking it after it perhaps then
that's<00:01:25.049> basically<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.619> guess<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> incorrect

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
that's basically I guess the incorrect

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.210 
that's basically I guess the incorrect
way<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.939> using<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:28.110> these<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.710> flash

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
way of using it with these kind of flash

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.060 
way of using it with these kind of flash
that<00:01:29.579> basically<00:01:30.200> shows<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> opponent<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that basically shows the opponent and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
that basically shows the opponent and
screens<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.420> telling<00:01:33.689> them<00:01:33.990> hey<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> flash

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
screens at them telling them hey a flash

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.069 
screens at them telling them hey a flash
is<00:01:34.740> coming<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> peek

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
is coming you you really want to peek

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
is coming you you really want to peek
before<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.799> pops<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.460> catch<00:01:38.700> them

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
before it pops so you can catch them

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.330 
before it pops so you can catch them
with<00:01:39.420> their<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:39.750> turn<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> want<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
with their back turn so you want to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
more time so you can throw a flash like

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.889 
more time so you can throw a flash like
this<00:01:58.259> pull<00:01:58.829> out<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.130> gun<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> then<00:02:00.450> just

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
and even if they don't turn around you

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.700 
and even if they don't turn around you
have<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.850> advantage<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:10.320> are<00:02:10.440> still

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
have the advantage that they are still

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.250 
have the advantage that they are still
worried<00:02:11.160> about<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.640> flash<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.300> that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
worried about the flash and that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.870 
worried about the flash and that
something<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.040> moving<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.490> front<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
something is moving in front of the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.810 
something is moving in front of the
screen<00:02:15.210> distracting<00:02:15.840> them<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.400> yeah<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.700> at

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
screen distracting them so yeah but at

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.160 
screen distracting them so yeah but at
least<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.120> give<00:02:18.270> yourself<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.720> chance<00:02:18.990> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
least you give yourself a chance to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.690 
least you give yourself a chance to
catch<00:02:19.410> them<00:02:19.650> with<00:02:19.770> their<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.100> turns<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.610> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
catch them with their back turns to you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.640 
catch them with their back turns to you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
shown our last way of using a flash I'll

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.180 
shown our last way of using a flash I'll
be<00:02:35.970> showing<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.330> guys<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:37.350> basically<00:02:37.920> you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
be showing you guys it's basically you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.370 
be showing you guys it's basically you
can<00:02:38.370> use<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.670> any<00:02:38.820> way<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.420> long<00:02:39.660> as<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.900> gets<00:02:40.110> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
can use it any way as long as it gets it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.860 
can use it any way as long as it gets it
as<00:02:40.530> long<00:02:41.160> as<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.090> flash<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.600> pop

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
as long as you get the flash to pop

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.720 
as long as you get the flash to pop
behind<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:43.980> front<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.370> your<00:02:44.490> opponent

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
behind you but in front of your opponent

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.090 
behind you but in front of your opponent
so<00:02:45.630> instead<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.080> doing<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.440> flash<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.890> this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
so instead of doing a flash like this

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.280 
so instead of doing a flash like this
that<00:02:47.280> long<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.660> where<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.959> wait<00:02:49.110> till

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
that long a where you have to wait till

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
that long a where you have to wait till
it<00:02:49.380> pops<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.830> then<00:02:49.950> peek<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:52.100> yeah<00:02:53.100> so

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it pops and then peek and yeah so

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.680 
it pops and then peek and yeah so
basically<00:02:53.430> you're<00:02:53.880> giving<00:02:54.000> your<00:02:54.270> opponent's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
basically you're giving your opponent's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.420 
basically you're giving your opponent's
time<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.050> turn<00:02:55.290> from<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.709> if<00:02:55.890> they<00:02:56.130> see<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
time to turn from it if they see it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.699 
time to turn from it if they see it
coming<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.880> all<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.959> can<00:02:58.170> use<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.350> flash

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
coming and all that you can use a flash

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.380 
coming and all that you can use a flash
like<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.130> where<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.520> just<00:02:59.700> Bank<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.120> off<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
like this where you just Bank it off the

like this where you just Bank it off the
wall<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.870> peek<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.890> as<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.220> pops

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
wall and peek just as it pops

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.440 
wall and peek just as it pops
look<00:03:04.740> at<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.310> flash<00:03:05.580> basically<00:03:06.180> is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
look at this this flash basically is

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.740 
look at this this flash basically is
very<00:03:06.630> easy<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.170> see<00:03:07.530> coming<00:03:07.950> but<00:03:08.610> you're<00:03:09.570> going

turning<00:03:24.900> away<00:03:24.989> from<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.470> or<00:03:25.620> they'll<00:03:25.800> be

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
turning away from it or they'll be

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.310 
turning away from it or they'll be
blinded<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:27.060> it'll<00:03:27.420> give<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.750> advantage

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
blinded so it'll give you the advantage

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.520 
blinded so it'll give you the advantage
this<00:03:28.890> can<00:03:29.130> work<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.459> many<00:03:29.670> scenarios<00:03:30.530> like

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
this can work in many scenarios like

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.320 
this can work in many scenarios like
I've<00:03:31.709> used<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.160> one<00:03:32.370> here<00:03:32.640> before<00:03:33.030> as<00:03:33.120> well

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
I've used this one here before as well

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330 
I've used this one here before as well
where<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:33.900> blanked<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.290> out<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:35.100> flash

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
where I just blanked it out the flash

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.600 
where I just blanked it out the flash
off<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.700> wall<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:37.080> caught<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.799> CC<00:03:38.400> guy

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
off this wall and I caught a CC guy

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.840 
off this wall and I caught a CC guy
coming<00:03:39.060> up<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.450> say<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.920> are<00:03:40.950> holding<00:03:41.519> the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
coming up so say you are holding the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.539 
coming up so say you are holding the
bomb<00:03:42.060> site<00:03:42.330> as<00:03:42.450> terrorists<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.220> CT<00:03:44.220> trying<00:03:44.459> to

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
bomb site as terrorists and CT trying to

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.100 
bomb site as terrorists and CT trying to
retake<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.180> know<00:03:45.299> ones

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
retake and you know ones

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.199 
retake and you know ones
one<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.799> CT<00:03:47.160> spawn<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.730> they're<00:03:47.850> pushing

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
one is that CT spawn and they're pushing

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.600 
one is that CT spawn and they're pushing
up<00:03:48.390> then<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.650> use<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.830> flash<00:03:50.220> like<00:03:50.430> this

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
up then you can use a flash like this

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.600 
up then you can use a flash like this
and<00:03:50.820> peek<00:03:51.030> with<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:52.310> they'll<00:03:53.310> have<00:03:53.489> the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
and peek with it and they'll have the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.449 
and peek with it and they'll have the
same<00:03:53.640> effect<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.690> will<00:03:54.870> force<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.380> player<00:03:56.100> to

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
same effect it will force the player to

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.350 
same effect it will force the player to
decide<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.970> turn<00:03:57.239> from<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.630> or<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.970> know<00:04:00.060> keep

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
decide to turn from it or you know keep

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.530 
decide to turn from it or you know keep
staring<00:04:00.750> at<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.959> flash<00:04:02.060> let<00:04:03.060> me<00:04:03.209> see<00:04:03.420> I'll

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
staring at the flash let me see I'll

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.330 
staring at the flash let me see I'll
show<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:03.750> guys<00:04:03.900> one<00:04:04.170> more<00:04:04.200> example<00:04:04.680> if<00:04:05.070> your

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
show you guys one more example if your

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.449 
show you guys one more example if your
terrorists<00:04:05.850> here<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.280> bomb

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
terrorists here and you have the bomb

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.830 
terrorists here and you have the bomb
planter<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.269> want<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.540> come<00:04:09.690> back

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
planter and you want to come back

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.870 
planter and you want to come back
tunnels<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.410> hold<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.799> but<00:04:11.340> you're<00:04:11.519> afraid<00:04:11.760> of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
tunnels to hold it but you're afraid of

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.910 
tunnels to hold it but you're afraid of
a<00:04:12.090> quick<00:04:12.299> flank<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:13.319> can<00:04:13.560> use<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.740> flash

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
a quick flank you can use a flash

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.569 
a quick flank you can use a flash
like<00:04:15.520> this<00:04:16.109> oops<00:04:17.109> as<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> smoke<00:04:17.739> but<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.400> can

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
like this oops as a smoke but you can

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.699 
like this oops as a smoke but you can
use<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.790> flash<00:04:19.150> that<00:04:19.359> once<00:04:19.570> again<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:20.049> basically

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
use a flash that once again it basically

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.610 
use a flash that once again it basically
goes<00:04:21.040> behind<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.790> or<00:04:22.030> behind<00:04:22.720> an<00:04:23.080> object

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
goes behind you or behind an object

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.920 
goes behind you or behind an object
that's<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.490> point<00:04:24.790> of<00:04:24.910> it<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.750> won't

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
that's the the point of it and it won't

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.770 
that's the the point of it and it won't
get<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.230> at<00:04:26.380> all<00:04:26.820> as<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:28.000> can<00:04:28.180> see<00:04:28.360> like<00:04:28.570> that

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
get you at all as you can see like that

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.670 
get you at all as you can see like that
but<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.800> will<00:04:29.890> force<00:04:30.250> your<00:04:30.700> enemy<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.930> turn

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
but it will force your enemy to turn

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.700 
but it will force your enemy to turn
away<00:04:32.800> from<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.130> flash<00:04:33.370> once<00:04:33.640> again<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.710> yeah

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
away from the flash once again so yeah

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.130 
away from the flash once again so yeah
those<00:04:36.190> are<00:04:36.250> basically<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.880> ways<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.810> can<00:04:37.990> use

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
those are basically the ways you can use

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.680 
those are basically the ways you can use
your<00:04:38.290> flash<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.680> more<00:04:38.860> effectively<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.300> sum

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
your flash is more effectively so to sum

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.480 
your flash is more effectively so to sum
it<00:04:40.720> all<00:04:40.990> up<00:04:41.050> if<00:04:41.470> you're<00:04:41.710> gonna<00:04:41.890> throw<00:04:42.100> a<00:04:42.130> flash

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
it all up if you're gonna throw a flash

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.930 
it all up if you're gonna throw a flash
that's<00:04:42.730> very<00:04:43.600> easy<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:45.100> see<00:04:45.310> coming<00:04:45.580> and

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
that's very easy to to see coming and

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.300 
that's very easy to to see coming and
very<00:04:46.330> easy<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.720> turn<00:04:46.960> from<00:04:47.230> you<00:04:47.800> either<00:04:48.010> want

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
very easy to turn from you either want

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.030 
very easy to turn from you either want
to<00:04:48.400> peek<00:04:48.640> before<00:04:48.850> it<00:04:49.330> pops<00:04:49.540> or<00:04:50.380> you're<00:04:50.860> gonna

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
to peek before it pops or you're gonna

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.880 
to peek before it pops or you're gonna
want<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.370> use<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.580> flash<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.510> goes<00:04:53.169> behind<00:04:53.470> you

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
want to use a flash that goes behind you

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.680 
want to use a flash that goes behind you
where<00:04:54.100> you<00:04:54.190> can<00:04:54.340> peek<00:04:54.640> at<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.090> same<00:04:55.300> time<00:04:55.510> as<00:04:55.660> a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
where you can peek at the same time as a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.640 
where you can peek at the same time as a
pops<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:57.450> yeah<00:04:58.450> basically<00:04:58.720> use<00:04:59.200> that<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.560> your

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
pops and yeah basically use that to your

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.830 
pops and yeah basically use that to your
advantage<00:04:59.740> I<00:05:00.400> guess<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:01.210> can<00:05:01.419> show<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.660> guys

if you're hiding here in sight and the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.150 
if you're hiding here in sight and the
tires<00:05:05.050> are<00:05:05.260> trying<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.530> take<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.890> you<00:05:06.010> can

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
tires are trying to take it you can

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.310 
tires are trying to take it you can
actually<00:05:06.310> use<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.610> flash<00:05:06.970> like<00:05:07.210> this<00:05:07.419> where<00:05:08.200> you

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
actually use a flash like this where you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.340 
actually use a flash like this where you
just<00:05:08.560> Bank<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:08.980> low<00:05:09.160> off<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.550> wall<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.150> then

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
just Bank it low off the wall and then

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.770 
just Bank it low off the wall and then
peek<00:05:11.350> on<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.919> left<00:05:12.160> side<00:05:12.370> what<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.450> spots

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
peek on the left side what the spots
