my<00:00:05.190> twelve-volt<00:00:05.730> swamp<00:00:06.029> cooler<00:00:06.350> what<00:00:07.350> these

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
my twelve-volt swamp cooler what these

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.350 
my twelve-volt swamp cooler what these
are<00:00:07.740> right<00:00:07.950> here<00:00:08.189> are<00:00:08.400> just<00:00:08.429> little<00:00:08.849> Walmart

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
are right here are just little Walmart

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.330 
are right here are just little Walmart
fans<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.929> took<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> case<00:00:10.469> off<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.040> mounted

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
fans I took the case off and mounted

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.009 
fans I took the case off and mounted
them<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.759> baskets<00:00:12.330> they<00:00:12.509> came<00:00:12.780> with

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
them in that baskets they came with

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.490 
them in that baskets they came with
their<00:00:13.769> real<00:00:14.099> low<00:00:14.250> voltage<00:00:14.730> point<00:00:15.269> eight<00:00:15.990> amps

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
their real low voltage point eight amps

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.859 
their real low voltage point eight amps
and<00:00:16.890> then<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.760> wanted<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.240> where<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> could<00:00:18.720> have

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and then I wanted it where I could have

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.320 
and then I wanted it where I could have
one<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> other<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.210> I've

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
one on and not the other so what I've

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.939 
one on and not the other so what I've
done<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.840> don't<00:00:21.900> know<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
done I don't know if you can see that

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
done I don't know if you can see that
there<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.430> put<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.390> reverse<00:00:24.779> charge

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
there I put a little reverse charge

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.980 
there I put a little reverse charge
diode<00:00:25.680> on<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.460> when<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.210> turn<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.689> fan

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
diode on there so when I turn this fan

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
diode on there so when I turn this fan
on<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.769> should<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.189> come<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.820> when

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
on this one should not come on but when

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.790 
on this one should not come on but when
I<00:00:30.000> turn<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.990> both<00:00:31.199> both<00:00:31.529> should

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I turn this one on they both both should

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.479 
I turn this one on they both both should
come<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.059> then<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.489> can't

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
come on and then I have right here can't

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.350 
come on and then I have right here can't
see<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.030> well<00:00:36.239> but<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> my<00:00:37.050> 12<00:00:37.739> volt

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
see it that well but this is my 12 volt

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.180 
see it that well but this is my 12 volt
little<00:00:39.360> fountain<00:00:39.840> pump<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.710> doesn't<00:00:41.040> use

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
little fountain pump it doesn't use

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.600 
little fountain pump it doesn't use
nothing<00:00:41.610> 25<00:00:42.090> milliamps<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:44.100> whole<00:00:44.309> thing

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
nothing 25 milliamps so this whole thing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.180 
nothing 25 milliamps so this whole thing
doesn't<00:00:45.329> even<00:00:45.510> use<00:00:45.690> two<00:00:46.140> amps<00:00:46.530> probably<00:00:47.010> less

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
doesn't even use two amps probably less

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.360 
doesn't even use two amps probably less
than<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> half<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.050> say<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.980> anyway

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
than one and a half I say but anyway

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100 
than one and a half I say but anyway

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
show you what it looks like from the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170 
show you what it looks like from the
inside<00:01:34.020> here's<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> big<00:01:34.860> test<00:01:34.939> it's<00:01:35.939> pretty

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
inside here's the big test it's pretty

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
inside here's the big test it's pretty
cool<00:01:36.329> actually<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.780> did<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> dual<00:01:37.320> fan<00:01:37.590> setup

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
cool actually I did the dual fan setup

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.289 
cool actually I did the dual fan setup
like<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.750> because<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.670> these<00:01:41.670> girls<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
like this because I these girls in the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
like this because I these girls in the
front<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> directs<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> air<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> put

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
front it directs the air so and I put

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 
front it directs the air so and I put
this<00:01:45.180> since<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> turned<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> 12<00:01:46.710> volt<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
this since I turned it to 12 volt you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
this since I turned it to 12 volt you
can<00:01:47.610> use<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> original<00:01:48.060> 120<00:01:48.810> switch<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
can use the original 120 switch I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.780 
can use the original 120 switch I
recommend<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.340> got<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> high<00:01:50.759> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
recommend it because it's got a high a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.770 
recommend it because it's got a high a
low<00:01:51.180> already<00:01:51.649> but<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.210> 120<00:01:54.210> pumps<00:01:54.540> which

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
low already but the 120 pumps which

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
low already but the 120 pumps which
didn't<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> light<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.430> often<00:01:56.820> times<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
didn't have a light and often times I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.569 
didn't have a light and often times I
found<00:01:57.509> myself<00:01:57.689> leaving<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.530> pump<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.369> and

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
found myself leaving that pump on and

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.310
