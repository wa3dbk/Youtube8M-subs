00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
on our number line so far we have talked

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.230 
on our number line so far we have talked
about<00:00:03.840> positive<00:00:04.410> numbers<00:00:04.879> you're<00:00:05.879> about<00:00:06.060> to

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
about positive numbers you're about to

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.550 
about positive numbers you're about to
discover<00:00:06.450> that<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.109> not<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.379> whole

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560

building<00:00:10.769> with<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> lift<00:00:11.960> you<00:00:12.960> are<00:00:13.049> currently

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
building with a lift you are currently

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.560 
building with a lift you are currently
on<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.559> third<00:00:13.830> floor<00:00:14.040> if<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.269> press<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
on the third floor if you press the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.720 
on the third floor if you press the
button<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.900> go<00:00:16.109> down<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:17.220> will<00:00:17.340> soon<00:00:17.520> reach

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
button to go down you will soon reach

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.390 
button to go down you will soon reach
the<00:00:17.760> ground<00:00:18.119> floor<00:00:18.359> which<00:00:18.840> shows<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> zero<00:00:19.500> if

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the ground floor which shows a zero if

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.849 
the ground floor which shows a zero if
you<00:00:21.330> want<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.869> carpark<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.710> need

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
you want to go to the carpark you need

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.460 
you want to go to the carpark you need
to<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.039> down<00:00:23.220> further<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.960> go<00:00:25.109> down<00:00:25.140> one

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to go down further so you go down one

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.150 
to go down further so you go down one
more<00:00:25.680> floor<00:00:26.029> we<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.119> arrived<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.539> level<00:00:27.840> b1

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
more floor we have arrived at level b1

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.479 
more floor we have arrived at level b1
one<00:00:29.160> floor<00:00:29.490> below<00:00:29.820> zero<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:31.070> if<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.189> go<00:00:32.340> down

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
one floor below zero and if we go down

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.760 
one floor below zero and if we go down
another<00:00:32.790> floor<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.719> arrive<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.290> floors<00:00:34.590> below

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
another floor we arrive two floors below

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.940 
another floor we arrive two floors below
zero<00:00:35.480> now<00:00:36.480> let's<00:00:36.870> look<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.590> simpler

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
zero now let's look at this in a simpler

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
zero now let's look at this in a simpler
way<00:00:38.100> using<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.640> vertical<00:00:38.820> number<00:00:39.120> line<00:00:41.809> we

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
way using a vertical number line we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
way using a vertical number line we
start<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> third<00:00:43.350> floor<00:00:43.800> which<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.399> three

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
start at the third floor which is three

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.790 
start at the third floor which is three
on<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> number<00:00:45.390> line

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
on the number line

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
on the number line
now<00:00:46.800> let's<00:00:47.219> move<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.670> zero<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
now let's move down to zero on the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
now let's move down to zero on the
number<00:00:48.780> line<00:00:50.780> move<00:00:51.780> down<00:00:51.930> again<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.890> reach

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
number line move down again and we reach

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.350 
number line move down again and we reach
level<00:00:53.460> b1<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.750> again<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> level<00:00:55.440> BT<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
level b1 and then again to level BT the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
level b1 and then again to level BT the
concept<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> below<00:00:58.199> zero<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:58.949> represented

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
concept of below zero can be represented

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.209 
concept of below zero can be represented
using<00:00:59.789> negative<00:01:00.120> numbers<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.160> instead<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
using negative numbers so instead of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.090 
using negative numbers so instead of
writing<00:01:02.399> v1<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.149> BT<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:04.439> instead<00:01:04.769> write

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
writing v1 and BT we instead write

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.630 
writing v1 and BT we instead write
negative<00:01:05.549> 1<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.000> negative<00:01:06.030> T<00:01:07.220> we<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
negative 1 and negative T we can see the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.100 
negative 1 and negative T we can see the
same<00:01:08.820> movement<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> lift<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> new

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
same movement of the lift on a new

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.570 
same movement of the lift on a new
lumber<00:01:10.290> line<00:01:10.850> we<00:01:11.850> start<00:01:12.119> at<00:01:12.270> 3<00:01:14.000> move<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.450> 0

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
lumber line we start at 3 move down to 0

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
lumber line we start at 3 move down to 0
then<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.759> negative<00:01:18.150> 1<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.799> then<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> negative

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
then to negative 1 and then to negative

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.230 
then to negative 1 and then to negative
T<00:01:22.340> another<00:01:23.340> place<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.820> may<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.060> come<00:01:24.210> across

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
T another place you may have come across

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
T another place you may have come across
negative<00:01:24.840> numbers<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.650> measuring

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
negative numbers is in measuring

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.999 
negative numbers is in measuring
temperature<00:01:26.869> if<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.259> enter<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> Sahara

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
temperature if you enter the Sahara

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.280 
temperature if you enter the Sahara
Desert<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> temperature<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:30.990> very

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
Desert the temperature would be very

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.719 
Desert the temperature would be very
high<00:01:31.560> maybe<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.579> high<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.820> 50<00:01:33.270> degrees<00:01:33.570> Celsius

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
high maybe as high as 50 degrees Celsius

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.859 
high maybe as high as 50 degrees Celsius
if<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.030> enter<00:01:36.270> London

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
if you enter London

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.140 
if you enter London
the<00:01:37.290> temperature<00:01:37.710> will<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.100> lower<00:01:38.369> maybe

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the temperature will be much lower maybe

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.850 
the temperature will be much lower maybe
around<00:01:39.360> 15<00:01:39.960> degree<00:01:40.259> Celsius

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.740 

continuing<00:01:43.860> further<00:01:44.040> north<00:01:44.399> Moscow<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.570> get

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
continuing further north Moscow can get

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.380 
continuing further north Moscow can get
very<00:01:46.020> cold<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.590> could<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.549> 5<00:01:47.790> degrees<00:01:48.000> below

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
very cold it could be 5 degrees below

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.429 
very cold it could be 5 degrees below
zero<00:01:48.810> or<00:01:49.170> negative<00:01:49.890> 5<00:01:50.310> degree<00:01:50.670> Celsius<00:01:51.439> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
zero or negative 5 degree Celsius it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
zero or negative 5 degree Celsius it
would<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.920> even<00:01:53.250> colder<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.850> travel<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
would be even colder if we travel to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120 
would be even colder if we travel to
Antarctica<00:01:54.500> where<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> could<00:01:55.740> quite<00:01:55.950> easily

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
Antarctica where it could quite easily

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.840 
Antarctica where it could quite easily
be<00:01:56.399> 40<00:01:56.969> degrees<00:01:57.000> below<00:01:57.540> zero<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.229> negative<00:01:59.219> 40

be 40 degrees below zero or negative 40

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.330 
be 40 degrees below zero or negative 40
degrees<00:01:59.880> Celsius<00:02:00.950> let's<00:02:01.950> put<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
degrees Celsius let's put all this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.449 
degrees Celsius let's put all this
information<00:02:02.939> onto<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.299> number<00:02:03.570> line<00:02:05.000> 50

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459

information onto a number line 50
15<00:02:10.130> negative<00:02:11.130> 5<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.060> negative<00:02:13.400> 40<00:02:17.030> now<00:02:18.030> let's

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
15 negative 5 and negative 40 now let's

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.520 
15 negative 5 and negative 40 now let's
look<00:02:18.450> at<00:02:18.630> these<00:02:18.750> number<00:02:19.080> lines<00:02:19.110> written

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
look at these number lines written

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.559 
look at these number lines written
horizontally<00:02:19.800> which<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> way<00:02:21.120> we're<00:02:21.360> used

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.479 
represented like this we start at 4:03
then<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.800> down<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.099> 0<00:02:32.599> then<00:02:33.599> negative<00:02:33.630> 1<00:02:34.489> and

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
then go down to 0 then negative 1 and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
world it would look like this we start

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.430 
world it would look like this we start
at<00:02:45.150> 50<00:02:45.769> then<00:02:46.769> go<00:02:46.890> down<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.069> 15<00:02:48.260> then<00:02:49.260> to
