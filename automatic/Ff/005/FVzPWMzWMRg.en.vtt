00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.240 
over that like stick on that and then
that<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.020> easier<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> cut<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.040> be

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that way it's easier to cut and be

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.569 
that way it's easier to cut and be
fabric<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> wrapping<00:01:40.380> paper<00:01:40.590> would<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
fabric so wrapping paper would be so so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.060 
fabric so wrapping paper would be so so
much<00:01:41.729> easier<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.509> especially<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
much easier to do especially because it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.580 
much easier to do especially because it
won't<00:01:44.250> come<00:01:44.430> off<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.939> easy<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.720> fabric<00:01:46.380> does

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
won't come off as easy as fabric does

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
won't come off as easy as fabric does
and<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.159> only<00:01:47.280> reason<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.729> did<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> fabric<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and the only reason I did the fabric is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
and the only reason I did the fabric is
just<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.350> matures<00:01:49.710> my

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
just because it matures my

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.090 
just because it matures my
chair<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> made<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:52.050> chair<00:01:52.470> renovation

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
chair that I made or my chair renovation

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.650 
chair that I made or my chair renovation
if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.370> haven't<00:01:53.670> tried<00:01:53.730> that<00:01:53.970> video<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.420> I'll

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
link it down below for you guys to check
out<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.730> everything<00:01:57.240> matches<00:01:57.360> now<00:01:59.960> so<00:02:00.960> once

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
out so everything matches now so once

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.510 
out so everything matches now so once
you're<00:02:01.320> done<00:02:01.470> cutting<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.980> fabric<00:02:02.190> or

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you're done cutting the fabric or

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130 
you're done cutting the fabric or
wrapping<00:02:02.910> paper<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.780> you're<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
wrapping paper then you're going to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
wrapping paper then you're going to
begin<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.530> add<00:02:04.710> your<00:02:04.979> foam<00:02:05.280> sheets<00:02:05.580> behind<00:02:06.120> it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
begin to add your foam sheets behind it

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.120 
begin to add your foam sheets behind it
so<00:02:06.510> you're<00:02:06.660> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> flip<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
so you're going to flip this over and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.889 
so you're going to flip this over and
then<00:02:08.640> we're<00:02:08.880> going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> begin<00:02:09.179> by<00:02:09.330> spraying

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
then we're going to begin by spraying

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.710 
then we're going to begin by spraying
some<00:02:10.229> spray<00:02:10.890> adhesive<00:02:10.920> behind<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.450> then

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
some spray adhesive behind it and then

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.930 
some spray adhesive behind it and then
placing<00:02:13.260> your<00:02:13.440> foam<00:02:13.680> sheets<00:02:13.950> behind<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
placing your foam sheets behind it and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.220 
placing your foam sheets behind it and
you're<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> repeat<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> same<00:02:15.870> process

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you're going to repeat the same process

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650 
you're going to repeat the same process
just<00:02:16.530> cutting<00:02:17.340> off<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> excess<00:02:17.850> foam<00:02:18.420> sheet

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
just cutting off the excess foam sheet

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.250 
just cutting off the excess foam sheet
that<00:02:19.200> will<00:02:19.709> be<00:02:19.830> left<00:02:20.100> over<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.900> case<00:02:22.080> you're

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
that will be left over so in case you're

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.170 
that will be left over so in case you're
wondering<00:02:22.410> why<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:22.920> added<00:02:23.220> foam<00:02:23.489> sheets<00:02:23.760> behind

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
wondering why I added foam sheets behind

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.820 
wondering why I added foam sheets behind
it<00:02:24.330> that's<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.110> keep<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.440> from<00:02:25.590> slipping

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
it that's just to keep it from slipping

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.979 
it that's just to keep it from slipping
on<00:02:26.100> my<00:02:26.250> desk<00:02:26.520> especially<00:02:27.060> since<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.660> use<00:02:27.840> my

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
on my desk especially since I use my

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:39.080 
on my desk especially since I use my
mouse<00:02:28.200> over<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.610> after<00:02:38.790> you're<00:02:39.060> done

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
mouse over it so after you're done

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.390 
mouse over it so after you're done
cutting<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.720> extra<00:02:40.080> foam<00:02:40.260> off<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.709> sides<00:02:40.980> you
