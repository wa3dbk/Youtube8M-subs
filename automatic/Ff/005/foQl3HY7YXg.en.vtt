00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
strategy in place and if we look at

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
strategy in place and if we look at
their<00:01:28.530> marketing<00:01:28.770> slogan<00:01:29.579> which<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.970> serious

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
their marketing slogan which is serious

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
their marketing slogan which is serious
about<00:01:30.600> sport<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.009> into<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.340> store

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
about sport and then you go into a store

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
about sport and then you go into a store
it<00:01:33.060> doesn't<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.600> reflect<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.710> very

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it doesn't really reflect that that very

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
it doesn't really reflect that that very
slogan<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:35.880> between<00:01:36.659> those<00:01:36.900> two

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
slogan so I think between those two

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
slogan so I think between those two
