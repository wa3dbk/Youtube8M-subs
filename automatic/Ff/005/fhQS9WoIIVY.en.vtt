00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.559 
my prediction is this is somebody from
the<00:03:18.860> upcoming<00:03:19.860> Guild<00:03:20.310> Wars<00:03:20.459> beyond<00:03:20.970> content

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
the upcoming Guild Wars beyond content

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.330 
the upcoming Guild Wars beyond content
for<00:03:21.750> factions<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.440> pretty<00:03:22.650> much<00:03:22.769> like<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.159> war

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
for factions so pretty much like the war

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.640 
for factions so pretty much like the war
in<00:03:23.459> kryta<00:03:23.640> thing<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.510> faction<00:03:25.230> they<00:03:25.470> also

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
in kryta thing but in faction they also

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.830 
in kryta thing but in faction they also
added<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.159> new<00:03:26.310> map<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.909> represents<00:03:27.480> like<00:03:27.659> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
added a new map that represents like the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.020 
added a new map that represents like the
Great<00:03:28.080> destroyer<00:03:28.280> depths<00:03:29.280> kind<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.849> it's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
Great destroyer depths kind of it's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.869 
Great destroyer depths kind of it's
pretty<00:03:30.659> cool<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.709> mixes<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.519> up<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.730> little

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
pretty cool so that mixes it up a little

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.180 
pretty cool so that mixes it up a little
bit<00:03:33.060> also<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:33.750> get<00:03:33.900> on<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.049> win<00:03:34.349> streak<00:03:34.379> you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
bit also if you get on a win streak you

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.009 
bit also if you get on a win streak you
don't<00:03:35.640> stay<00:03:36.030> with<00:03:36.209> your<00:03:36.420> team<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.840> get

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
don't stay with your team you get

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.380 
don't stay with your team you get
randomized<00:03:37.650> every<00:03:38.099> single<00:03:38.430> time<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.239> that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
randomized every single time so that

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.300 
randomized every single time so that
eliminates<00:03:39.629> people<00:03:40.200> sinking<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.890> Korean

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
eliminates people sinking in the Korean

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.360 
eliminates people sinking in the Korean
districts<00:03:41.790> like<00:03:41.879> everyone<00:03:42.870> does<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:43.370> either

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
districts like everyone does but either

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.360 
districts like everyone does but either
way<00:03:44.670> makes<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.480> more<00:03:45.629> balanced<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.590> overall<00:03:47.159> I

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
way makes it more balanced so overall I

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.350 
way makes it more balanced so overall I
think<00:03:47.519> it's<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:48.000> good<00:03:48.180> change<00:03:48.510> you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
think it's a good change you

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.000 
think it's a good change you
can<00:03:49.450> be<00:03:49.600> annoying<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.080> sometimes<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.890> yeah<00:03:50.980> I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
can be annoying it sometimes so yeah I

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.320 
can be annoying it sometimes so yeah I
think<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.340> costumer<00:03:51.730> all<00:03:51.850> changes<00:03:52.240> are

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
think the costumer all changes are

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.360 
think the costumer all changes are
pretty<00:03:52.570> good<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.840> costume<00:03:53.530> was<00:03:53.560> themselves

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
pretty good that costume was themselves

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.760 
pretty good that costume was themselves
aren't<00:03:54.610> super<00:03:55.390> amazing<00:03:55.960> but<00:03:56.200> hey<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.440> bought

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770
