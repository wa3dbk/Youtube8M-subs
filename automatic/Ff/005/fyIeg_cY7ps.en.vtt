00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.820
 in the video I do not talk about is one of the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.010
 best games of star wars games star 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.689
 wars you should have looked through 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.640
 once in a lifetime 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 then this wonderful performance 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 me doing 168 deaths but that 's what 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.250
 same is me doing the song of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.250
 with your mouth at last let's go 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.780
 the first our list is star wars ridge 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.090
 racer who are game was falling from 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.699
 mature when a pitiful threat 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.350
 ghost came up after all this 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.840
 was one of the best conditions in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.570
 franchise just the opposite of what 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.340
 the gardens was in the game you are a pilot 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.769
 You can that will compete in improving 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.600
 he himself can be born in the championship cf 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.470
 says nothing too revolutionary to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 tell the truth 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.729
 except for the speed of the game had and 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.360
 for going inside the star world 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.689
 wars 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.490
 now imagine what you could do there 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.140
 with the franchise these days with 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.640
 power of video games and computers 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.640
 what do we have today? 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 our list is star wars knights of the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.759
 old republic 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 What happens when you mix with 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.350
 What happens when you mix 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.880
 RPG mechanics of consecrated EMBOL 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.310
 wars galactic 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.470
 the answer is in the face is night of the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 old republic that was one of the most 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.310
 innovators at that time precisely because 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.649
 bring a mechanical robust 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.659
 mechanical character management 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.340
 solid engaging and engaging storytelling 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.590
 still beautiful graphics and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.170
 battle animations definitely one 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.509
 game to none was to default and that 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.240
 even ended up being kind of the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.430
 the precursor of the work that bayer 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.740
 voting on me but it's a factor after 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.570
 for what she or the trilogy in the case 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.330
 she released after she was bought 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.580
 Ie not enough, you can still 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.740
 choose which side of the force you want 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.880
 based on the decisions you made 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.310
 during the game 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.830
 more recently the valley has launched the old 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.420
 republic an online game based on this 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.580
 homesick game 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.620
 despite the improved mechanics he did not 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.540
 comes at the foot of the classic version but 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.540
 still a good way said a 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:36.750
 little nostalgic third in the list a 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.940
 star wars dark horses that was the first 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.460
 game based on the franchise star wars and 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.630
 can be said that thanks to him that all 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.780
 the rest was developed and released 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.240
 later in fact the game is so 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.430
 that many elements have been 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.290
 were reused in the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.690
 own universe expanded with the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.980
 character fell off the farm that ended up 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.540
 becoming one of the first learnings 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.760
 from luke skywalker 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.090
 the game had two sequences that night 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.200
 force the two guards and two already 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.670
 casting daniel 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.650
 the latter had multiplayer as 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.930
 that has inspired the creation of 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.209
 of the button itself later releases a 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.160
 The high points of this game is that 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.170
 been made closed and 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.239
 presented animations with sound and image 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.160
 between one phase and another and for 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.060
 this is considered by many as a 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.060
 cinematic game 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.010
 and speaking of star wars battlefront he 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.060
 is next on our list which was a 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.280
 game that came from a simple idea 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.760
 to mix the universe of star wars with 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.950
 dont this idea is genius or simple and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.590
 led legions of people to lan houses and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.750
 to online games at the time for battle 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.280
 each other and recreate in clashes in 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.750
 star wars universe 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.000
 still today these games are very 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.220
 dear to the fans so much that the world 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.440
 practically all applauded standing up when 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.900
 newest franchise game was announced 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.400
 and practically that he was going to crucify games 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.620
 father when he decided to close 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.840
 servers and wipe out the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.930
 button 2 font closing 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.400
 we have star wars goals frame what 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.530
 could be better than being able to 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.570
 put inside the battles of star wars 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.750
 get inside the space battles 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.519
 of star wars is clear in london frame 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.250
 you assume the position of the pilot of 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.049
 several ships of the rebel alliance and has 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.820
 aim to fight the empire 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.450
 the game had quite a gameplay 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.400
 interesting 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.540
 time and provide a battle 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.340
 enough times 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.100
 of course it was not as frenetic and see 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.930
 our how star wars hitman but even 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.480
 so you can feel if practically 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.030
 a pilot and it's fun as hell 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.310
 I also wait a few people here. 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.290
 who liked the video of today and the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.090
 force be with you and until next time 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.390
