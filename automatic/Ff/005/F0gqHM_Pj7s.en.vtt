00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.330
 moment if the outer surface of your 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.029
 the windows are not too clean this immediately 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.220
 felt cloudy days seem more 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.110
 overcast rainy still birth a 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.599
 sunlight and 2 penetrates 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.100
 dirty haze however on window washing 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.410
 really do not want to spend your 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.090
 precious free time of course 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.300
 you don't want to pay extra money for 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.920
 window cleaner 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.250
 how wonderful it would be if god is us or 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.720
 themselves they now know how 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.579
 company thinking there is a world leader in 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.910
 glass manufacturing has developed 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.360
 pilkington asset first in the world 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.670
 self-cleaning glass 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.710
 pilkington asset can be used 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.870
 in almost all exterior designs 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.550
 This glass is equally suitable for both 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.420
 ordinary houses and for industrial 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.980
 buildings and offices 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 such glasses can be installed 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.550
 vertically and obliquely especially comfortable 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.379
 not for windows located in 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.809
 hard to reach places where most often 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.670
 accumulates dirt for direct comparison 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.530
 Peel kind of active with standard 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.240
 clear glass we sprayed on 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.259
 each of the two types of glass specially 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.880
 prepared solution 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.920
 imitating organic dirt 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.690
 falling onto the windows then these samples 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.619
 were installed next to each other in 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.569
 kitchen windows 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.520
 despite the fact that both samples 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:21.860
 inflicted the same amount of solution 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.330
 imitating organic dirt between 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.849
 they were visible from the start 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.119
 difference due to special coating 

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:28.970
 pilkington 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.369
 asset this test continued over 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.679
 30 hours was recorded using 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.270
 special filming method therefore 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.310
 what you see now is this show 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.349
 change occurred within 30 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.240
 hours compressed to a minute with a little 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.220
 time tracking you see a clock 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.690
 seriously an hour to clear the dirt on the window 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.849
 with glass pilkington 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.890
 the asset has already begun to decompose into 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.310
 standard glass no changes 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.310
 is observed 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.490
 diana minaj 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.490
 it rained at night 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.360
 the next morning there was an amazing effect 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.090
 action covering pilkington asset after 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.020
 night rain all even the most stable 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.310
 mud deposits decomposed and washed away 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.290
 the end of the shoot is only a couple 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.000
 contaminated places dirt continues 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.040
 decompose and fade away 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.380
 and now look at exactly the same 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 contaminated standard glass when 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.890
 ideal experimental conditions and 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.240
 created by sun and rain difference 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.940
 simply amazing and so glass glassington 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.700
 asset gives an impressive result as well 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.410
 he achieved glass peckington tar 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 as you can guess from the name itself 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.100
 has an active coating applied and 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.260
 chemically process 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.120
 production of this coating can not be erased 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.090
 scrape off it will persist in 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.530
 the lifetime of the glass 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.690
 unique feature from 1 flowed in two 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.250
 step impact falling on 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.860
 glass surface sun rays 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.690
 activates the cover it decomposes everything 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.150
 organic pollution and is required 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.110
 only minimal amount 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.850
 ultraviolet daylight 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.650
 light to the specified effect 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.480
 lasted indefinitely 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.100
 thanks to the coating during the rain 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.690
 hydrogen streams down 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.670
 wash off all the dirt while not forming 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.030
 drops which leaves stains on 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.920
 glass that makes the window look dirty 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.000
 the fact that glass is pilkington asset 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.459
 only a small amount is required 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.500
 ultraviolet energy 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.260
 means round the clock glass 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.480
 all 365 days of years even on rainy days 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.890
 and at night dry periods 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.620
 time or in cases where 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.720
 too much dirt accumulates glass 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.230
 pilkington asset you can just wash 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.230
 a hose 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.730
 glass pillington asset harmless for 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.709
 environment for both installation and 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.690
 during operation it is less 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.340
 degree needs washing than usual 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.010
 glass and does not require use 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.209
 chemical cleaners and detergents 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.370
 this glass can also be used 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.790
 combination with other glass companies 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.790
 pilkington 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.720
 additional information can be obtained 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.330
 on the website 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.920
 Do not deny yourself the pleasure 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.920
 look at the world through clean windows
