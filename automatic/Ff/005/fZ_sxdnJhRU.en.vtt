really hard to mix together so what you
want<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.800> start<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> few

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
want to do is start with a few

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.679 
want to do is start with a few
tablespoons<00:00:23.550> we'll<00:00:24.000> talk<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.330> seasoning

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
tablespoons we'll talk to the seasoning

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
tablespoons we'll talk to the seasoning
and<00:00:25.220> you're<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> mix<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.820> together

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and you're going to mix this together

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
and you're going to mix this together
into<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.630> cream<00:00:27.810> cheese<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> probably<00:00:29.160> take

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
into the cream cheese so probably take

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.519 
into the cream cheese so probably take
you<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> minute<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:29.849> two<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.090> mixing<00:00:30.439> longer<00:00:31.439> you

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
you a minute or two of mixing longer you

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
you a minute or two of mixing longer you
leave<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.160> softer<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.550> will<00:00:32.610> get<00:00:32.850> so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
leave it out the softer it will get so

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.280 
leave it out the softer it will get so
leave<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.540> out<00:00:33.660> longer<00:00:33.840> it'll<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> lot

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
leave it out longer it'll be a lot

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.979 
leave it out longer it'll be a lot
easier<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.739> stir<00:00:34.890> together<00:00:35.870> instructor<00:00:36.870> about
