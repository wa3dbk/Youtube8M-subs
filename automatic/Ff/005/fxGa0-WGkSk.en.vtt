 welcome to innova manualidades this 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.859
 I'll show you how to do this 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.380
 cute bracelet with the word not done 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.800
 with aluminum wire we will need 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.130
 these materials 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.470
 aluminum thread of 15 or 2 millimeters of 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.410
 thick mini flat-nose pliers 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.800
 round and cut colorful beads and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.800
 ruler 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:32.279
 let's see how it is done 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.150
 we cut a piece of 40 centimeters of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.150
 aluminum thread 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.110
 we measure 13 centimeters with the rule already 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.050
 from that's where we're going to start 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.329
 to elaborate the word what 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 I will leave the still image in the part 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.200
 superior so that as I go 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.890
 making sure you see how it is done 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.890
 each letter 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.760
 once finished we go putting the 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.350
 Colorful beads the amount will depend 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.350
 the size of each doll 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.430
 now we free about two or three 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.430
 centimeters of thread to make the closure 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.049
 by this end we are going to introduce the 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.579
 same number of colored beads that 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.579
 we had gotten on the other side 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.710
 let's free about two or three 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.630
 centimeters of thread so that the closure 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.630
 this time in the form of a hook 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.980
 to prevent the end of the thread 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.390
 click or spider let's kill the tip 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.390
 doing a little double 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.910
 now we make a kind of hook 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.910
 to open and close the bracelet 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.220
 Finally, we are adjusting well the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.290
 bracelet shaping and ready as you see 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.290
 It is very easy to do and in a few minutes 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:36.300

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.300
