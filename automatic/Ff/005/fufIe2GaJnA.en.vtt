00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.680 
off small range of motion maybe fewer
repetitions<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.920> slow<00:04:16.640> it<00:04:16.790> down

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.890 

now<00:04:23.690> we'll<00:04:23.930> try<00:04:24.140> both<00:04:24.590> legs<00:04:24.980> simultaneously

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
now we'll try both legs simultaneously

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.870 
now we'll try both legs simultaneously
go<00:04:26.900> into<00:04:27.230> this<00:04:27.380> slowly<00:04:27.710> if<00:04:28.010> one<00:04:28.220> leg<00:04:28.460> was<00:04:28.640> hard

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
go into this slowly if one leg was hard

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.480 
go into this slowly if one leg was hard
both<00:04:29.210> legs<00:04:29.600> is<00:04:29.780> even<00:04:30.020> harder<00:04:30.410> so<00:04:30.590> let's<00:04:31.280> make

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
both legs is even harder so let's make

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.220 
both legs is even harder so let's make
sure<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:31.910> we're<00:04:32.090> approaching<00:04:32.540> this<00:04:32.990> with
