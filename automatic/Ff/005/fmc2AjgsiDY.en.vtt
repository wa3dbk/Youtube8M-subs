subtle tanner that actually increases

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.860

a little higher end than the other one
this<00:03:11.829> is<00:03:11.980> i<00:03:12.069> think<00:03:12.340> around<00:03:12.459> six<00:03:13.180> or<00:03:13.299> seven

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599

this is i think around six or seven
dollars<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:15.069> $16<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.120> it's<00:03:16.359> somewhat

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
dollars and this is $16 so it's somewhat

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.770 
dollars and this is $16 so it's somewhat
double<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.829> price<00:03:18.269> what<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.359> like<00:03:19.510> about<00:03:19.540> this

double the price what I like about this
is<00:03:20.079> a<00:03:20.260> lot<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:21.069> actually<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:22.720> a<00:03:22.780> faster<00:03:23.910> um

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
is a lot is it actually is a faster um

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.039 
is a lot is it actually is a faster um
subtle<00:03:26.319> bronzer<00:03:26.849> compared<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.480> one<00:03:28.540> and

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
buying and buy the product so then they

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.460 
buying and buy the product so then they

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
again so it doesn't completely heal it

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.390 
again so it doesn't completely heal it
and<00:07:01.100> keep<00:07:01.370> it<00:07:01.490> moisturized<00:07:02.530> instead<00:07:03.530> it<00:07:03.860> heals

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
and keep it moisturized instead it heals

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.700 
and keep it moisturized instead it heals
it<00:07:04.610> and<00:07:04.820> keeps<00:07:05.150> it<00:07:05.360> moisturized<00:07:05.780> for<00:07:06.200> a<00:07:06.470> period

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
it and keeps it moisturized for a period

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.580 
it and keeps it moisturized for a period
of<00:07:06.860> time<00:07:07.040> and<00:07:07.400> then<00:07:07.460> it'll<00:07:08.450> make<00:07:08.870> a<00:07:08.900> chap<00:07:09.230> again

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
of time and then it'll make a chap again

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.220 
of time and then it'll make a chap again
so<00:07:10.340> you<00:07:10.430> keep<00:07:10.850> using<00:07:11.120> it<00:07:11.360> and<00:07:11.450> using<00:07:11.810> it<00:07:11.900> over

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
so you keep using it and using it over

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.380 
so you keep using it and using it over
again<00:07:12.320> that's<00:07:13.070> like<00:07:13.280> a<00:07:13.310> horrible<00:07:13.610> propaganda

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
again that's like a horrible propaganda

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.510 
again that's like a horrible propaganda
propaganda<00:07:14.870> to<00:07:15.500> like<00:07:15.650> buy<00:07:15.860> the<00:07:15.920> product<00:07:16.430> you
