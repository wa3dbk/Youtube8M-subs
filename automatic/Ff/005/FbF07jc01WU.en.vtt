prototype as you can see here he is from

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.460 
prototype as you can see here he is from

next-gen systems of prototype he is a
character<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.500> was<00:00:34.680> given<00:00:35.489> injections<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
serums and stuff to give him almost

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.560 
serums and stuff to give him almost
superhuman<00:00:38.780> powers<00:00:39.800> here<00:00:40.800> he<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.219> his

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
superhuman powers here he is with his

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
superhuman powers here he is with his
basically<00:00:42.570> his<00:00:42.809> main<00:00:43.260> melee<00:00:43.800> weapon<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.370> is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
basically his main melee weapon which is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.279 
basically his main melee weapon which is
this<00:00:45.379> blade<00:00:46.399> formed<00:00:47.399> an<00:00:47.550> almost<00:00:47.879> kind<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> like

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
this blade formed an almost kind of like

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.880 
this blade formed an almost kind of like
it<00:00:49.289> might<00:00:49.500> reminds<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> spawn

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
it might reminds me of the spawn

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.740 
it might reminds me of the spawn
sentient<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.730> spawns<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.149> me<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.449> Venom

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
sentient or not spawns to me about Venom

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.740 
sentient or not spawns to me about Venom
symbiote<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.460> spawn<00:00:56.969> armor<00:00:57.449> from<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
symbiote or the spawn armor from the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.430 
symbiote or the spawn armor from the
spawn<00:00:58.140> movie<00:00:59.090> looks<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.359> cool<00:01:00.539> he<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> made

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
spawn movie looks really cool he is made

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.810 
spawn movie looks really cool he is made
by<00:01:01.620> NECA<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> means<00:01:04.549> gotta<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.700> careful

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
by NECA so that means gotta be careful

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.550 
by NECA so that means gotta be careful
with<00:01:06.090> NECA<00:01:06.330> figures<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.840> tend<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> break

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
with NECA figures they tend to break

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.730 
with NECA figures they tend to break
easier<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.400> find<00:01:08.790> him<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:10.049> he<00:01:10.380> sold

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
easier you can find him actually he sold

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
easier you can find him actually he sold
out<00:01:10.890> right<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.460> big<00:01:11.640> bet<00:01:11.790> toy<00:01:11.939> store<00:01:12.240> so

link to big back toy store is going to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.420 
link to big back toy store is going to
be<00:01:23.130> over<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> sidebar<00:01:24.740> it's<00:01:25.740> really

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
be over there in the sidebar it's really

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.530 
be over there in the sidebar it's really
nicely<00:01:26.729> detailed<00:01:28.100> figure<00:01:29.299> articulation<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
nicely detailed figure articulation is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.880 
nicely detailed figure articulation is
the<00:01:30.810> arms<00:01:31.340> will<00:01:32.340> go<00:01:32.460> 360<00:01:33.140> now<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the arms will go 360 now this one the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.140 
the arms will go 360 now this one the
only<00:01:35.040> thing<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.280> gets<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.880> little

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
only thing that gets is this little

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.200 
only thing that gets is this little
joint<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.829> don't<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.030> too

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
joint here but don't be don't do it too

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.819 
joint here but don't be don't do it too
much<00:01:39.240> because<00:01:39.570> NECA<00:01:39.960> figures<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.560> tend<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
much because NECA figures they tend to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.830 
much because NECA figures they tend to
break<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> joints<00:01:42.020> risk<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.649> rotate

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
break at the joints risk here can rotate

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.039 
break at the joints risk here can rotate
arm<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.860> well<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:48.049> round-headed

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
arm here as well as round-headed

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
arm here as well as round-headed
articulation<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.950> hindered<00:01:50.310> due<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
articulation is hindered due to the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.660 
articulation is hindered due to the
hoodie<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:52.049> he's<00:01:52.259> wearing<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.460> got

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
hoodie that he's wearing and you got

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.139 
hoodie that he's wearing and you got
very<00:01:54.390> limited<00:01:54.689> waist<00:01:55.110> articulation<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
very limited waist articulation and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.050 
very limited waist articulation and
limited<00:01:57.229> feet<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.159> basically<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.880> get

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
limited feet so basically you can get

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660 
limited feet so basically you can get
just<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.750> minimum<00:02:01.079> pose<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.710> him<00:02:01.829> but

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
just like one minimum pose with him but

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.130 
just like one minimum pose with him but
the<00:02:02.820> reason<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.240> picked<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.990> he's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the reason I picked them up is he's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.510 
the reason I picked them up is he's
really<00:02:04.680> nice<00:02:04.829> figure

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
really nice figure

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
really nice figure
detailed<00:02:06.119> wise<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.570> mean<00:02:06.750> look<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.259> on

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
detailed wise I mean look right here on

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.029 
detailed wise I mean look right here on
the<00:02:07.500> back<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.710> mean<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> nice

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
the back you mean you get the nice

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.650 
the back you mean you get the nice
