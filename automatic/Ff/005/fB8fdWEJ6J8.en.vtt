00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
and then I came up with my proof of

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.520 
and then I came up with my proof of
concept<00:00:55.399> prototype<00:00:55.609> and<00:00:56.289> now<00:00:57.289> we're<00:00:57.500> just

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
concept prototype and now we're just

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.709 
concept prototype and now we're just
trying<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.010> get<00:00:58.760> out<00:00:58.940> there<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.210> license<00:00:59.600> it

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
so we can sell the idea to some company

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.340 
so we can sell the idea to some company
that<00:01:01.609> will<00:01:01.699> then<00:01:01.820> sell<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.149> product<00:01:02.600> can<00:01:03.260> you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.390 
interior eight not really work so I got
a<00:02:33.170> thought<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.530> myself<00:02:33.650> i<00:02:33.920> canna<00:02:34.100> shelf<00:02:34.280> at

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
a thought to myself i canna shelf at

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.370 
a thought to myself i canna shelf at
pump<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> actually<00:02:35.450> sucks<00:02:35.750> out<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.110> stain

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
pump it actually sucks out that stain

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.470 
pump it actually sucks out that stain
removes<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:36.890> stain<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.580> went<00:02:37.970> home<00:02:38.120> thought

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
removes that stain and went home thought

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.640 
removes that stain and went home thought
about<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.690> little<00:02:38.959> bit<00:02:39.050> more<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:39.470> why<00:02:39.560> i

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
about a little bit more that's why i

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.380 
about a little bit more that's why i
came<00:02:39.770> up<00:02:39.920> with<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.040> spot<00:02:40.250> sucker<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:41.150> tell<00:02:41.360> me

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
came up with a spot sucker so tell me

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.510 
came up with a spot sucker so tell me
after<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.900> conceptualize<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.770> idea<00:02:43.070> what

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
after you conceptualize the idea what

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.230 
after you conceptualize the idea what
was<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.760> next<00:02:43.910> step<00:02:44.090> um<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:45.709> well<00:02:46.430> inventing

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
was the next step um is well inventing

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.300 
was the next step um is well inventing
is<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.540> crazy<00:02:47.959> thing<00:02:48.260> everybody<00:02:48.709> has<00:02:48.890> ideas

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
is this crazy thing everybody has ideas

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.890 
is this crazy thing everybody has ideas
the<00:02:49.550> hard<00:02:49.760> part<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.090> getting<00:02:50.270> him<00:02:50.510> out<00:02:50.600> there

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
the hard part is getting him out there

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.190 
the hard part is getting him out there
and<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.100> now<00:02:52.490> we<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:53.060> went<00:02:53.480> home<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.990> thought

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
and so now we I went home and I thought

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.720 
and so now we I went home and I thought
about<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.440> more<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.680> then<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.070> came<00:02:55.430> up<00:02:55.610> with<00:02:55.640> my

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
about it more and then I came up with my

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.630 
about it more and then I came up with my
proof<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.120> concept<00:02:56.540> prototype<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.430> now<00:02:58.430> we're

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
proof of concept prototype and now we're

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.730 
proof of concept prototype and now we're
just<00:02:58.670> trying<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.120> get<00:02:59.870> out<00:03:00.050> there<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.320> license

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
just trying to get out there and license

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.170 
just trying to get out there and license
it<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:00.980> we<00:03:01.070> can<00:03:01.160> sell<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.490> idea<00:03:01.610> to<00:03:01.820> some

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
it so we can sell the idea to some

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.699 
it so we can sell the idea to some
company<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.750> will<00:03:02.810> then<00:03:02.959> sell<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.290> product

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
company that will then sell the product

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.920 
company that will then sell the product
okay<00:03:04.370> tell<00:03:04.550> us<00:03:04.700> about<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.060> next<00:03:05.360> step<00:03:05.600> in

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
okay tell us about that next step in
