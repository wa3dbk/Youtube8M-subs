want to get your any kind of wood and oh
you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:24.119> cobblestone<00:00:24.840> any<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> block

like<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.670> version<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.480> using<00:00:30.750> spruce

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
like in that version so I'm using spruce

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.569 
like in that version so I'm using spruce
because<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.619> think<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.920> looks<00:00:32.070> best<00:00:32.340> for

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
because I think it looks best for

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.680 
because I think it looks best for
building<00:00:32.700> amount<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.120> walls<00:00:33.300> but<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.570> could

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
building amount of walls but you could

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.680 
building amount of walls but you could
try<00:00:33.780> other<00:00:34.050> things<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:36.000> first<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.600> all

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
you're finished building this and watch

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.420 
you're finished building this and watch
through<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.109> whole<00:03:55.349> tutorial<00:03:55.829> if<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.069> guys

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
through the whole tutorial if you guys

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.640 
through the whole tutorial if you guys
do<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.540> should<00:03:58.109> actually<00:03:58.230> look<00:03:58.590> pretty

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
do it should actually look pretty

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.410 
do it should actually look pretty
successful<00:03:59.519> so<00:03:59.700> that's<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.000> back<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.359> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
successful so that's the back of the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.390 
successful so that's the back of the
ship<00:04:00.659> like<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:02.670> okay

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
ship like that okay

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.710 
ship like that okay
then<00:04:05.400> you're<00:04:05.790> probably<00:04:06.000> gonna<00:04:06.269> want<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.599> bring

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
then you're probably gonna want to bring

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.990 
then you're probably gonna want to bring
this<00:04:06.900> out<00:04:07.220> one<00:04:08.220> two<00:04:08.700> three<00:04:09.239> four<00:04:09.750> five<00:04:10.319> six

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.659 
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
thirteen<00:04:16.350> fourteen<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:19.769> shouldn't<00:04:20.459> look

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
thirteen fourteen that shouldn't look

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.500 
thirteen fourteen that shouldn't look
too<00:04:21.000> bad<00:04:22.340> shall<00:04:23.340> do<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.520> ensure<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.330> whole

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
too bad shall do that ensure the whole

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.439 
too bad shall do that ensure the whole
total<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.470> will<00:04:25.680> be<00:04:25.919> one<00:04:27.500> just<00:04:28.910> one<00:04:29.910> two

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
total of it will be one just one two

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.540 
total of it will be one just one two
three<00:04:31.080> four<00:04:31.680> five<00:04:32.400> six<00:04:33.090> seven<00:04:33.930> eight<00:04:34.110> nine<00:04:34.680> ten

eleven<00:04:36.360> twelve<00:04:36.570> thirteen<00:04:37.080> fourteen<00:04:39.410> that's

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen that's

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:50.080 
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen that's
that's<00:04:40.800> wrong<00:04:41.010> like<00:04:41.220> so<00:04:44.960> no<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:45.990> probably<00:04:46.410> do

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:00.310 

I<00:04:50.530> can<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:51.949> just<00:04:54.340> know<00:04:55.340> what<00:04:56.980> what<00:04:59.320> that's

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
I can so you just know what what that's

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.350 
I can so you just know what what that's
all<00:05:00.530> right<00:05:00.590> then<00:05:00.800> so<00:05:01.449> it's<00:05:02.449> just<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.720> bit<00:05:02.900> weird

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.939 

okay<00:05:08.360> so<00:05:08.419> that<00:05:09.050> is<00:05:09.199> what<00:05:09.380> your<00:05:09.530> ship<00:05:09.740> should

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
okay so that is what your ship should

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:16.750 
okay so that is what your ship should
look<00:05:10.130> like<00:05:10.160> so<00:05:10.490> far<00:05:15.010> all<00:05:16.010> you<00:05:16.190> need<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.460> do<00:05:16.580> it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
look like so far all you need to do it

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:27.420 
look like so far all you need to do it
then<00:05:16.940> is<00:05:17.090> just<00:05:17.120> build<00:05:17.750> it<00:05:17.900> up<00:05:18.080> build<00:05:26.290> it<00:05:27.290> up

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
then is just build it up build it up

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.820 
then is just build it up build it up
building<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.639> up<00:05:28.790> building<00:05:29.690> an<00:05:29.780> app<00:05:29.960> building

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
building it up building an app building

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:48.460 
building it up building an app building
it<00:05:31.010> up<00:05:31.100> sonny<00:05:31.550> jim<00:05:35.020> okay<00:05:36.020> done<00:05:36.169> so<00:05:41.289> and<00:05:42.289> so<00:05:47.470> then

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
it up sonny jim okay done so and so then

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.129 
it up sonny jim okay done so and so then
just<00:05:48.710> shift<00:05:48.979> and<00:05:49.820> then<00:05:50.030> slowly<00:05:50.389> move<00:05:50.900> around

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
just shift and then slowly move around

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.529 
just shift and then slowly move around
this<00:05:51.440> might<00:05:51.860> take<00:05:52.070> her<00:05:52.190> out<00:05:52.340> just<00:05:52.370> getting<00:05:52.880> all

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
this might take her out just getting all

00:05:53.539 --> 00:06:06.429 
this might take her out just getting all
around<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.770> whole<00:05:55.430> thing

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:06.439 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:20.970 

okay<00:06:07.069> done<00:06:07.249> so<00:06:13.029> so

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:27.580 

okay<00:06:21.980> then<00:06:22.160> I<00:06:22.570> should<00:06:25.930> hopefully<00:06:26.930> this<00:06:27.230> should

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
okay then I should hopefully this should

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.660 
okay then I should hopefully this should
be<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:27.860> last<00:06:28.010> layer<00:06:28.400> it<00:06:28.790> will<00:06:28.970> be<00:06:29.180> actually<00:06:29.330> so

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
be the last layer it will be actually so

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:55.500 
be the last layer it will be actually so
then<00:06:31.670> you<00:06:31.820> can<00:06:32.000> start<00:06:32.090> to<00:06:32.540> fill<00:06:32.900> it<00:06:33.020> in

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.230 

okay<00:06:56.510> that's<00:06:56.990> it<00:06:57.140> then<00:06:57.520> that's<00:06:58.520> your

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
it's got a big hole you can fill it in

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.590

with<00:07:00.920> water<00:07:01.280> it'll<00:07:01.580> be<00:07:01.700> a<00:07:01.730> sinking<00:07:02.150> ship

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
with water it'll be a sinking ship

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.180 
with water it'll be a sinking ship
