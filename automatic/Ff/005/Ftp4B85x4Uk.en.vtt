00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.280
 one of Latin America in this video les 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.130
 I'm going to talk about the well-known bodies 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.099
 microtubules is called this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.260
 way to a series of structures like 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.260
 are for example the centers 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.439
 the cilia oscyl jazz 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.439
 and the flagella 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.490
 and the mitotic spindle 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.930
 to chromatic taste present in mitosis 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.559
 because microtubule is because good is 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.030
 just the microtubules 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.280
 depending on how it is 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.500
 they organize they can not form any of 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.949
 these structures that is what I'm going to 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.559
 to tell in this video then I'm going to 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.030
 start with the first the first of 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.250
 they who are like reactions I said the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.649
 centers fundamentally centers 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.259
 they find in animals cells and 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.899
 they participate in the cell division because 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.060
 what do the centers organize this use 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.030
 mitotic or organize this use to 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.880
 chromatic from them radiate 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.920
 these fibers that what they do is go 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.619
 carrying all the organs vines for 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.010
 that go from the mother cell to the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.170
 diaz cells 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.740
 as the conformo of the centers the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.870
 centers are formed by two cylinders 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.210
 small and short this would come to be the 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.790
 final structure of the center no two 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.150
 short cylinders that are available 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.470
 perpendicular way 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.530
 every cylinder if we look at it from above 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.530
 It consists of nine structures 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:57.310
 how are you called triplets 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.310
 these triplets 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.159
 which are obviously formed by 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.110
 microtubules 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:12.040
 they unite with each other as they are in this in 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.410
 this case and they are formed by a micro 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.780
 tubule to a microtubule microtubule 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.780
 sep is to say its filaments 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.050
 they are obviously arranged in a circular 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.870
 with an inclination of 30 degrees from 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.720
 the center and they are joined by a 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.230
 protein a map that is called next 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.300
 and na 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.230
 then in this way 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.069
 is how the set is structured in the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.930
 centers 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.659
 well then 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.430
 another one of the structures that now 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:56.240
 there was talk 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.900
 they are the cilia and flagella 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.370
 what is the difference between the Indians and 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.540
 the flagella in general 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.040
 the cilia 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.930
 they are short 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.930
 and more abundant 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:21.090
 instead the flagella are longer and 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.350
 there are few or even a few 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.710
 cell there may be some solos 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.980
 from the flagella 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.590
 are projected to the extracellular medium is 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.510
 say that they leave the cell obviously 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.220
 they are surrounded by less plasma and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.810
 are used for the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.880
 locomotion and also to create 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.620
 currents in the liquid that surrounds 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.840
 the cells 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.760
 what would be here in this image is a 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.209
 cross section since it has the same 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.750
 structure and what you can appreciate is 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:56.010
 your famous structure called 9 + 2 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.049
 What this means you have half 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.629
 have triplets are formed by 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.620
 doublets notice that they consist of a 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.290
 'doublet' is central and then 9 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.780
 peripheral doublets that are joined by 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.440
 different proteins that's why 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.750
 they have this structure called 9 + 2 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.120
 obviously they are connected to each other and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.120
 connected with a central structure 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.600
 Y 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.990
 good and as I told you, they participate 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.310
 just in the locomotion of different 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.449
 fundamentally Syrian cells and 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.590
 flagella have for example the 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:37.240
 many criteria in many algae 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.249
 microscopic and also the protozoa 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.259
 They have this type of structure 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:45.109
 well then in this video what we saw 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.269
 they were like from the microtubules 

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:49.069
 different organs can be formed and 

00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:52.489
 from so-called micro bodies 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.809
 tubular as are the two centers 

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:55.809
 Sites and flagella 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.750
 educational I recommend the following 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.750
 videos so you can keep learning
