00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.370 
so I might be looking into selling this
knife<00:02:15.980> because<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.220> looks<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:18.240> won't<00:02:19.230> be

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
purpose built tougher for you know when

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.010 
purpose built tougher for you know when
you<00:05:44.550> need<00:05:44.700> to<00:05:44.850> walk<00:05:45.090> through<00:05:45.390> the<00:05:45.480> bones<00:05:45.720> and

stuff you know hunters know to make it

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.190 
stuff you know hunters know to make it
thicker<00:05:49.620> so<00:05:49.920> you<00:05:49.980> have<00:05:50.160> less<00:05:50.460> chance<00:05:50.520> of

that's<00:05:54.270> what<00:05:54.450> I<00:05:54.510> suspect<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.260> Gunny

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
that's what I suspect and the Gunny

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.660 
that's what I suspect and the Gunny
