00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.060
 guillotine show with day of the 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.060
 image 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.070
 It was the knife 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.070
 with this we can eat 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.990
 we also have a 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.930
 has a tone 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.060
 the beginning of this rule is found 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.060
 just where the knife goes down 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.130
 he says that with the rule we will measure what 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.130
 cut paper 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:37.610
 now we will make a death court 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.610
 we put the sheets in an orderly manner 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.470
 in the back 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.519
 once the paper is in the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.390
 correct position we will lower the press 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.390
 to affirm this 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.110
 and from the main lever we will remove the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.110
 safe 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.750
 this short of paper 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.750
 after the cut 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.950
 here we have one more view 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.730
 so 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.100
 thanks for watching our video
