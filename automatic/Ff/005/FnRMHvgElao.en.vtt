that blank space and reach ability for

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.000 
that blank space and reach ability for
something<00:00:10.630> useful<00:00:10.780> it<00:00:11.380> actually<00:00:11.530> puts<00:00:11.860> a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
something useful it actually puts a

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.890 
something useful it actually puts a
widget<00:00:12.430> in<00:00:12.550> there<00:00:12.760> so<00:00:13.270> you<00:00:13.330> can<00:00:13.450> see<00:00:13.600> if<00:00:13.690> we<00:00:13.780> go

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
widget in there so you can see if we go

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.240 
widget in there so you can see if we go
ahead<00:00:13.990> and<00:00:14.140> open<00:00:14.200> up<00:00:14.410> an<00:00:14.560> application<00:00:14.710> and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
ahead and open up an application and

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.040 
ahead and open up an application and
then<00:00:15.550> let's<00:00:15.790> say<00:00:15.970> we<00:00:16.150> invoke<00:00:16.450> reach<00:00:16.630> ability

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
then let's say we invoke reach ability

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.840 
then let's say we invoke reach ability
you'll<00:00:17.500> notice<00:00:17.710> that<00:00:17.920> we<00:00:18.010> get<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.370> control

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
you'll notice that we get a control

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.340 
you'll notice that we get a control
center<00:00:19.150> widget<00:00:19.450> right<00:00:19.600> up<00:00:19.750> here<00:00:19.900> so<00:00:20.110> we<00:00:20.230> have

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
center widget right up here so we have

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.110 
center widget right up here so we have
all<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.530> our<00:00:20.680> toggles<00:00:21.190> we<00:00:21.580> have<00:00:21.760> our<00:00:21.940> quick

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
all of our toggles we have our quick

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
brightness slider one thing we don't

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.990 
brightness slider one thing we don't
have<00:00:26.020> is<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.380> media<00:00:26.800> controls<00:00:27.220> but<00:00:27.520> you<00:00:27.850> can

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 
that the reach ability space actually

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.819 
that the reach ability space actually
dynamically<00:00:34.329> changes<00:00:34.899> depending<00:00:35.230> on<00:00:35.350> how<00:00:35.559> big

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
dynamically changes depending on how big

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.579 
dynamically changes depending on how big
the<00:00:35.859> widget<00:00:36.309> is<00:00:36.460> now<00:00:37.149> it's<00:00:37.690> pretty<00:00:37.960> cool<00:00:38.170> looks

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
the widget is now it's pretty cool looks

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:40.739 
the widget is now it's pretty cool looks
nice<00:00:38.829> well<00:00:39.399> there's<00:00:39.940> actually<00:00:40.300> more<00:00:40.510> widgets

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
nice well there's actually more widgets

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.569 
nice well there's actually more widgets
to<00:00:41.199> this<00:00:41.409> tweak<00:00:41.739> so<00:00:41.949> you<00:00:42.039> can<00:00:42.159> see<00:00:42.280> right<00:00:42.309> here

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
to this tweak so you can see right here

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.369 
to this tweak so you can see right here
if<00:00:42.670> we<00:00:42.760> go<00:00:42.850> ahead<00:00:42.909> and<00:00:42.999> swipe<00:00:43.269> across<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:44.260> we

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
if we go ahead and swipe across that we

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.439 
if we go ahead and swipe across that we
have<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:44.769> media<00:00:45.219> player<00:00:45.550> widget<00:00:46.030> right<00:00:46.179> up<00:00:46.329> here

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
have a media player widget right up here

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.299 
have a media player widget right up here
at<00:00:46.569> the<00:00:46.600> top<00:00:46.690> so<00:00:47.229> this<00:00:47.530> obviously<00:00:47.679> is<00:00:48.010> going<00:00:48.219> to

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
at the top so this obviously is going to

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.309 
at the top so this obviously is going to
allow<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.609> to<00:00:48.999> play<00:00:49.300> pause<00:00:49.600> go<00:00:49.929> to<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.139> next

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
something and then started deposit then

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.299

you'll<00:00:55.690> notice<00:00:55.989> that<00:00:56.019> you'll<00:00:56.229> have<00:00:56.379> album

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309

artwork<00:00:57.549> right<00:00:57.819> there<00:00:58.030> as<00:00:58.120> well<00:00:58.359> so<00:00:59.049> swiping

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
artwork right there as well so swiping

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.049 
artwork right there as well so swiping
again<00:00:59.679> one<00:00:59.859> more<00:00:59.979> time<00:01:00.039> this<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.729> app

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
again one more time this is the app

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.849 
again one more time this is the app
switcher<00:01:01.659> so<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:01.929> can<00:01:02.079> go<00:01:02.199> ahead<00:01:02.319> and<00:01:02.440> swipe

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.410 
switcher so you can go ahead and swipe
through<00:01:03.159> here<00:01:03.459> and<00:01:03.549> then<00:01:03.670> quickly<00:01:03.879> launch<00:01:04.180> any

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
through here and then quickly launch any

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.330 
through here and then quickly launch any
of<00:01:04.539> these<00:01:04.629> applications<00:01:05.320> just<00:01:05.409> by<00:01:05.680> tapping<00:01:06.009> on

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
of these applications just by tapping on

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.639 
of these applications just by tapping on
them<00:01:06.579> and<00:01:06.759> last<00:01:07.509> but<00:01:07.630> not<00:01:07.810> least<00:01:07.869> if<00:01:08.350> we<00:01:08.439> swipe

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
them and last but not least if we swipe

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.880 
them and last but not least if we swipe
over<00:01:08.799> one<00:01:09.100> more<00:01:09.250> time<00:01:09.310> we<00:01:09.759> also<00:01:10.000> have<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.890> clock

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
over one more time we also have a clock

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.950 
over one more time we also have a clock
widget<00:01:12.340> now<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.149> one<00:01:13.479> that<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.659> probably

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
widget now this is one that I probably

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.959 
widget now this is one that I probably
wouldn't<00:01:14.469> use<00:01:14.619> all<00:01:14.829> that<00:01:14.950> often<00:01:15.219> just<00:01:15.640> because

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
wouldn't use all that often just because

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.609 
wouldn't use all that often just because
I<00:01:16.000> mean<00:01:16.299> we<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.600> clock<00:01:16.960> right<00:01:17.200> there<00:01:17.439> in

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
I mean we have a clock right there in

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.590 
I mean we have a clock right there in
the<00:01:17.680> status<00:01:18.340> bar<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:18.939> we<00:01:19.060> don't<00:01:19.210> really<00:01:19.299> need

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
the status bar so we don't really need

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.929 
the status bar so we don't really need
this<00:01:19.810> but<00:01:20.109> it<00:01:20.350> does<00:01:20.530> look<00:01:20.560> nice<00:01:20.950> I'll<00:01:21.700> give<00:01:21.909> it

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
this but it does look nice I'll give it

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.999 
this but it does look nice I'll give it
that<00:01:22.210> but<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.960> get<00:01:23.289> rid<00:01:23.439> of<00:01:23.469> it<00:01:23.590> we<00:01:23.710> can<00:01:23.859> just

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
that but to get rid of it we can just

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.920 
that but to get rid of it we can just
tap<00:01:24.130> right<00:01:24.369> down<00:01:24.549> here<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.479> can<00:01:25.630> open<00:01:25.750> up

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
tap right down here and we can open up

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.389 
tap right down here and we can open up
