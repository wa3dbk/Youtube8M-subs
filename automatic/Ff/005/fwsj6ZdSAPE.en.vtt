by earth on februari 15 2013 closer than
our<00:00:15.369> geostationary<00:00:16.150> satellites<00:00:16.750> it's<00:00:17.260> about

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
our geostationary satellites it's about

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.260 
our geostationary satellites it's about
the<00:00:17.590> size<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:17.980> half<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.430> football<00:00:18.460> field<00:00:18.820> about

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270

45 meters in diameter and it goes in an
earthlike<00:00:23.440> orbit<00:00:23.980> so<00:00:24.340> it's<00:00:24.520> useful<00:00:25.120> to<00:00:25.630> keep

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
earthlike orbit so it's useful to keep

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.990 
earthlike orbit so it's useful to keep
track<00:00:26.110> of<00:00:26.140> it<00:00:26.350> but<00:00:26.980> let<00:00:27.130> me<00:00:27.160> first<00:00:27.250> answer<00:00:27.880> the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
track of it but let me first answer the

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000 
track of it but let me first answer the
question<00:00:28.360> you<00:00:28.450> may<00:00:28.570> have<00:00:28.870> in<00:00:29.230> your<00:00:29.290> mind<00:00:30.510> will

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
question you may have in your mind will

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.569 
question you may have in your mind will
2012<00:00:33.010> da14<00:00:33.730> hit<00:00:34.090> earth<00:00:34.270> in<00:00:34.540> 2013<00:00:35.940> no<00:00:36.940> yay<00:00:38.430> no<00:00:39.430> it

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
2012 da14 hit earth in 2013 no yay no it

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.750 
2012 da14 hit earth in 2013 no yay no it
won't<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:40.090> will<00:00:40.390> also<00:00:41.260> not<00:00:41.680> hit<00:00:42.010> in<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.489> next

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
won't it will also not hit in the next

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.479 
won't it will also not hit in the next
few<00:00:43.000> decades<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:43.840> may<00:00:44.079> hit<00:00:44.350> someday<00:00:44.980> there<00:00:45.310> is

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
few decades it may hit someday there is

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.940 
few decades it may hit someday there is
a<00:00:45.640> one<00:00:45.910> in<00:00:46.270> seven<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.020> a<00:00:47.079> half<00:00:47.110> million<00:00:47.530> chance

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
a one in seven and a half million chance

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.630 
a one in seven and a half million chance
that<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.700> will<00:00:48.790> hit<00:00:49.060> in<00:00:49.270> 21<00:00:50.050> 10<00:00:50.500> but<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.489> real

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
that it will hit in 21 10 but the real

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.910 
that it will hit in 21 10 but the real
lesson<00:00:51.880> here<00:00:52.149> is<00:00:52.600> that<00:00:52.989> these<00:00:53.350> objects<00:00:53.800> are

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
lesson here is that these objects are

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.350 
lesson here is that these objects are
out<00:00:54.070> there<00:00:54.250> we<00:00:54.430> do<00:00:54.579> live<00:00:54.790> in<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:54.940> cosmic

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
out there we do live in a cosmic

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.660 
out there we do live in a cosmic
shooting<00:00:55.630> gallery<00:00:55.809> and<00:00:56.350> we<00:00:57.130> need<00:00:57.309> to<00:00:57.340> track

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
shooting gallery and we need to track

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.310 
shooting gallery and we need to track
them<00:00:57.910> find<00:00:58.210> them<00:00:58.420> figure<00:00:58.660> out<00:00:58.719> what<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.050> do<00:00:59.170> if

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
them find them figure out what to do if

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.250 
them find them figure out what to do if
one<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.739> on<00:00:59.950> a<00:01:00.219> crash<00:01:00.850> course<00:01:01.000> for<00:01:01.540> Earth<00:01:01.719> what

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
one is on a crash course for Earth what

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.319 
one is on a crash course for Earth what
if<00:01:02.350> this<00:01:02.469> one<00:01:02.680> were<00:01:02.890> well<00:01:03.399> we<00:01:03.880> have<00:01:03.969> an<00:01:04.059> example

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
if this one were well we have an example

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.100 
if this one were well we have an example
about<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> century<00:01:05.049> ago<00:01:05.320> what<00:01:06.310> if<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:07.600> answered

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
about a century ago what if was answered

Tunguska<00:01:28.840> event<00:01:28.900> was<00:01:29.260> equivalent<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.920> a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
Tunguska event was equivalent to a

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.010 
Tunguska event was equivalent to a
nuclear<00:01:30.400> weapon<00:01:30.760> of<00:01:30.850> about<00:01:31.060> two<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.810> five

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
Hiroshima nuclear bomb so we're talking

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.370 
Hiroshima nuclear bomb so we're talking
about<00:01:38.979> a<00:01:39.100> lot<00:01:39.369> of<00:01:39.430> energy<00:01:39.670> here<00:01:40.150> how<00:01:40.900> often<00:01:41.110> do

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
about a lot of energy here how often do

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.950 
about a lot of energy here how often do
impacts<00:01:41.710> like<00:01:41.950> this<00:01:42.189> happen<00:01:42.610> about<00:01:43.090> every

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
impacts like this happen about every

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.140 
impacts like this happen about every
thousand<00:01:44.439> years<00:01:44.470> on<00:01:44.799> average<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.759> that<00:01:45.970> could

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
thousand years on average and that could

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.090 
thousand years on average and that could
be<00:01:46.180> tomorrow<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:47.020> could<00:01:47.229> be<00:01:47.259> five<00:01:47.590> thousand

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
be tomorrow that could be five thousand

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.340 
be tomorrow that could be five thousand
years<00:01:48.280> from<00:01:48.490> now<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.450> it's<00:01:49.720> something<00:01:49.990> that<00:01:50.259> we

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
years from now so it's something that we

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.109 
years from now so it's something that we
need<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.680> pay<00:01:50.799> attention<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.970> only

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
need to pay attention to it is the only

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.510 
need to pay attention to it is the only
preventable<00:01:52.840> natural<00:01:53.320> disaster<00:01:53.920> groups<00:01:54.430> like

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
preventable natural disaster groups like

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.670

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.229 
is the Earth's orbit in blue is 2012
da14<00:03:17.470> you'll<00:03:17.709> notice<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.070> over<00:03:18.430> here<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
da14 you'll notice that over here the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.509

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
two come together at this scale that's

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.910 
two come together at this scale that's
when<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:21.970> will<00:03:22.000> have<00:03:22.239> its<00:03:22.420> close<00:03:22.750> flyby<00:03:23.350> but

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
when it will have its close flyby but

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.890 
when it will have its close flyby but
it's<00:03:24.070> not<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.430> same<00:03:24.670> plane<00:03:25.090> it's<00:03:25.480> not<00:03:25.660> in<00:03:25.840> a

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
set as the Earth's orbit so this is

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.789 
set as the Earth's orbit so this is
looking<00:03:27.790> kind<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.090> edge<00:03:28.209> on<00:03:28.540> again<00:03:29.260> white<00:03:29.530> is

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
looking kind of edge on again white is

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.280 
looking kind of edge on again white is
the<00:03:29.980> Earth's<00:03:30.160> orbit<00:03:30.519> blue<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.480> asteroids

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the Earth's orbit blue is the asteroids

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.039 
the Earth's orbit blue is the asteroids
orbit<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.370> comes<00:03:33.549> from<00:03:33.790> below<00:03:34.690> from

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
orbit and so it comes from below from

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.259 
orbit and so it comes from below from
the<00:03:35.440> southern<00:03:35.739> hemisphere<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.430> comes<00:03:37.000> up

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
the southern hemisphere and comes up

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.810 
the southern hemisphere and comes up
above<00:03:38.080> during<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> process<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.370> closest

between<00:03:52.600> these<00:03:53.019> tick<00:03:53.350> marks<00:03:53.380> here<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.670> it

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
between these tick marks here so it

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.910 
between these tick marks here so it
passes<00:03:55.510> through<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:56.049> system<00:03:56.260> very<00:03:56.680> very

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
passes through the system very very

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.850 
passes through the system very very
quickly<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.970> green<00:03:58.480> ring<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.110> in<00:03:59.739> the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
quickly this green ring is in the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.229 
quickly this green ring is in the
equatorial<00:04:00.370> plane<00:04:00.610> where<00:04:01.090> our

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
equatorial plane where our

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.940 
equatorial plane where our
geosynchronous<00:04:01.810> satellites<00:04:02.470> are<00:04:02.680> things

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
geosynchronous satellites are things

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.520 
geosynchronous satellites are things
like<00:04:03.160> satellite<00:04:03.700> TV<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:04.510> zipping<00:04:05.350> in

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
like satellite TV so it's zipping in

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.160 
like satellite TV so it's zipping in
nearby<00:04:06.370> will<00:04:06.850> not<00:04:07.030> hit<00:04:07.269> any<00:04:07.510> satellites

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
nearby will not hit any satellites

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.570 
nearby will not hit any satellites
though<00:04:08.440> cuz<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.680> comes<00:04:09.100> through<00:04:09.310> a<00:04:09.370> pretty

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
though cuz it comes through a pretty

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.000 
though cuz it comes through a pretty
dead<00:04:09.880> area<00:04:10.150> who<00:04:10.959> discovered<00:04:11.290> this<00:04:11.530> LA<00:04:11.799> sagra

made this possible they were able to
find<00:04:24.729> this<00:04:24.880> because<00:04:25.270> they<00:04:25.419> had<00:04:25.599> a<00:04:25.630> new<00:04:25.870> camera

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
find this because they had a new camera

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:26.980
