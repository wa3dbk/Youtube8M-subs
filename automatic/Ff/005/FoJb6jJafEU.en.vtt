00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
option route as you will see here he

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.250 
option route as you will see here he
gets<00:00:14.670> very<00:00:14.969> good<00:00:15.299> position<00:00:15.509> against<00:00:16.109> man

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
gets very good position against man

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500 
gets very good position against man
defense<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.949> again<00:00:17.190> zone<00:00:17.460> he'll<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> little

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
defense and again zone he'll do a little

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.810 
defense and again zone he'll do a little
curl<00:00:18.810> route<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.320> he'll<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:20.189> able<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.430> catch<00:00:20.640> it

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
curl route and he'll be able to catch it

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.460 
curl route and he'll be able to catch it
right<00:00:20.970> underneath<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.779> linebackers

right underneath one of the linebackers

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.410 
right underneath one of the linebackers
of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> corners<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.640> will<00:00:23.820> work<00:00:23.939> better<00:00:24.210> if

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
of the corners that will work better if

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630 
of the corners that will work better if
you<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:25.199> running<00:00:25.890> back<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.250> pretty<00:00:26.519> good

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
you have a running back with pretty good

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.460 
you have a running back with pretty good
catching<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.359> great<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:27.869> better<00:00:27.930> than

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
catching not great but better than

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
catching not great but better than
average<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.369> he<00:00:29.640> will<00:00:29.760> hold<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
average that way he will hold on to it

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.490 
average that way he will hold on to it
because<00:00:30.510> he's<00:00:30.660> likely<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.260> hit<00:00:31.439> pretty

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
because he's likely to get hit pretty

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830 
because he's likely to get hit pretty
quickly<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.880> other<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.690> is

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
quickly the other thing I like to do is

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.420 
quickly the other thing I like to do is
I<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.559> receiver<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> far

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I like to get the receiver on the far

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.700 
I like to get the receiver on the far
right<00:00:35.640> side<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> screen<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.530> your

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
right side of the screen he is a on your

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.069 
right side of the screen he is a on your
screen<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.450> motion<00:00:39.450> him<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> right

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
screen and motion him out to the right

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.170 
screen and motion him out to the right
and<00:00:40.140> put<00:00:40.500> him<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> smart<00:00:41.340> routed<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.910> route

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and put him on a smart routed out route

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.760 
and put him on a smart routed out route
that's<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.780> our<00:00:42.809> second<00:00:43.379> option

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that's going to be our second option

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
that's going to be our second option
against<00:00:44.160> man<00:00:44.460> both<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:45.539> routes<00:00:45.780> are

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
against man both of these routes are

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.209 
against man both of these routes are
going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> get<00:00:46.200> open<00:00:46.289> against<00:00:46.620> man<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.070> they

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
going to get open against man so they

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.889 
going to get open against man so they
can't<00:00:47.460> use<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.760> both<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.090> them<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:48.780> your

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
can't use your both of them so if your

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.450 
can't use your both of them so if your
opponent<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> man<00:00:49.620> defense<00:00:49.980> unless<00:00:50.309> he's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
opponent is a man defense unless he's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.889 
opponent is a man defense unless he's
putting<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> zones<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> field

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
putting the zones out there on the field

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.689 
putting the zones out there on the field
he's<00:00:52.469> not<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:52.949> able<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.250> stop<00:00:53.309> just

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
he's not going to be able to stop just

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
he's not going to be able to stop just
those<00:00:53.940> two<00:00:54.180> routes<00:00:54.420> right<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> he

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
those two routes right there and he

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
those two routes right there and he
drops<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.430> wide<00:00:57.149> open<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:57.809> pretty

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
drops it here wide open so that's pretty

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 
drops it here wide open so that's pretty
random<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.829> run<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> again<00:00:59.399> he

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
random but when we run it again he

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
random but when we run it again he
definitely<00:01:00.120> makes<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> catch<00:01:00.840> moving<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
definitely makes the catch moving on to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
definitely makes the catch moving on to
his<00:01:02.370> own<00:01:02.520> defense<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.840> where<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
his own defense now this is where it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.509 
his own defense now this is where it
gets<00:01:04.170> really<00:01:04.500> beautiful<00:01:04.979> because<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.339> got

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
gets really beautiful because we got

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.370 
gets really beautiful because we got

every type of zone correct me if I'm
wrong<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:12.990> even<00:01:13.110> need<00:01:13.350> a

wrong and you don't even need a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.719 
wrong and you don't even need a
precision<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:13.979> thing<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.490> need<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
precision this thing you just need to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.550 
precision this thing you just need to
time<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.570> we're<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> drop

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
time it right so we're going to drop

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.990 
time it right so we're going to drop
back<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.430> we're<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> look

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
back here and we're just going to look

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.550 
back here and we're just going to look
for<00:01:18.210> him<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.630> behind<00:01:19.049> some<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> those

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
for him to get behind some of those

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
for him to get behind some of those
yellow<00:01:19.920> zones<00:01:20.189> right<00:01:20.850> underneath<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
yellow zones right underneath the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
yellow zones right underneath the
safeties<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.860> then<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.280> passes<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
safeties so right then we passes that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.160 
safeties so right then we passes that
middle<00:01:24.240> linebacker<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.780> want<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> go<00:01:25.110> ahead

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
middle linebacker we want to go ahead

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
middle linebacker we want to go ahead
and<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.619> throw<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> bullet<00:01:26.400> pass<00:01:26.610> again<00:01:27.150> no

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and just throw a bullet pass again no

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
and just throw a bullet pass again no
precision<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:28.500> sure<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.340> before

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
precision make sure we get it in before

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.830 
precision make sure we get it in before
he<00:01:29.820> gets<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> safety<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.600> way<00:01:30.720> he

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
he gets to the safety that way he

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
he gets to the safety that way he
doesn't<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.170> popped<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> drops<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> ball

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
doesn't get popped and drops the ball

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
doesn't get popped and drops the ball
and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.090> last<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.930> least<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.619> already

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and then last but not least we already

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.380 
and then last but not least we already
mentioned<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.729> hit<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.150> running

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
mentioned that we can hit the running

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480 
mentioned that we can hit the running
back<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> left<00:01:36.990> against<00:01:37.560> zone<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
back on the left against zone but the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
back on the left against zone but the
other<00:01:38.640> thing<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.210> against<00:01:39.600> zone<00:01:39.869> is

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
other thing we could do against zone is

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.840 
other thing we could do against zone is
look<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.590> B<00:01:40.890> receiver<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> screen

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
look at this B receiver on the screen

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.210 
look at this B receiver on the screen
right<00:01:42.030> now<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.290> soon<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.590> he<00:01:43.740> cuts<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
right now and then as soon as he cuts to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
right now and then as soon as he cuts to
the<00:01:44.310> inside<00:01:44.340> he's<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.780> between

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the inside he's going to get in between

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.600 
the inside he's going to get in between
a<00:01:46.200> couple<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.680> those<00:01:46.740> yellow<00:01:47.009> zones<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.520> if

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
a couple of those yellow zones there if

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.399 
a couple of those yellow zones there if
your<00:01:47.759> opponent's<00:01:48.090> running<00:01:48.360> zone<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.380> he

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
your opponent's running zone and then he

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.319 
your opponent's running zone and then he
will<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.799> open<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> touchdown<00:01:50.549> you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
will get open for the touchdown you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.429
