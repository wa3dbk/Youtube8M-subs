00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
home now

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.479 
home now
you<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.629> close<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.139> and<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:22.249> now<00:02:23.249> the<00:02:23.310> next

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
you can close this and this now the next
