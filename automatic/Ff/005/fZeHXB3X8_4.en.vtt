00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
of this you know I can wield it like a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.500 
of this you know I can wield it like a
pistol<00:03:20.709> extending<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.799> stock<00:03:22.040> I<00:03:22.340> almost<00:03:23.209> like

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
pistol extending the stock I almost like

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.380 
pistol extending the stock I almost like
it<00:03:23.690> without<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.170> foregrip<00:03:24.500> extended<00:03:25.310> but<00:03:26.180> I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
it without the foregrip extended but I

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.240 
it without the foregrip extended but I
guess<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.780> can<00:03:26.930> get<00:03:27.049> used<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.440> if<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.830> do

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
guess I can get used to that if I do

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.979 
guess I can get used to that if I do
inside<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.640> start<00:03:28.730> using<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.120> but<00:03:29.660> one<00:03:29.810> thing

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
inside and start using it but one thing

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.080 
inside and start using it but one thing
I<00:03:30.230> can<00:03:30.590> say<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:30.830> far<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.640> fire<00:03:31.850> selector

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
I can say so far is the fire selector

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.600 
I can say so far is the fire selector
switch<00:03:32.480> does<00:03:32.780> kind<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.130> dig<00:03:34.130> up<00:03:34.250> against<00:03:34.489> my

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
switch does kind of dig up against my

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.400 
switch does kind of dig up against my
hand<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:34.970> little<00:03:35.060> bit<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.450> no<00:03:35.989> big<00:03:36.140> deal<00:03:36.260> i'm

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
hand a little bit but no big deal i'm

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.650 
hand a little bit but no big deal i'm
sure<00:03:36.530> i'll<00:03:36.590> get<00:03:36.709> used<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.070> too<00:03:37.450> let's<00:03:38.450> see

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
