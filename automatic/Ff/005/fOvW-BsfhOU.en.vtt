00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.200
 I am the capi I greet him from here 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:09.599
 from the bright colorful and a little 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.139
 depressing fantasy world because 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.089
 here we are going to imagine what would happen if 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.340
 there would be a robot for everything if 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.500
 there would be a robot for everything would be sold 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 much the robot to get chatter to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.340
 the women, because it was worth to me and the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:31.500
 The truth is that the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.539
 she was not interested in anything according to this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.179
 I said ah so you look very interested to 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:40.679
 not being so interested and I said yes 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:47.000
 I said to him nothing just twisted my 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:50.210
 mouth do you really think so 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.190
 there's nothing else they take robbie's have if 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.140
 there would be a robot for everything would be very 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.360
 successful the robot to talk with the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 men will also go should put 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.050
 of the cable of calf the left band 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.150
 and so they leave two contentions so that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.870
 make relief is easy where I do not know 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.870
 why do not 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.320
 it's better than if they leave it 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.680
 what a barbarian steal me and if you know how 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.439
 change the oil if there was a robot 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.079
 for everything I would surely buy myself a 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.610
 robot to win the arguments 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.890
 automatically, I do not agree 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.679
 in which you go with your cronies but not 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.759
 I'm leaving for a little while I do not even go out 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:44.649
 with my friends, I have not seen them for years 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.649
 I also have the right to have fun but 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.009
 At the same time a while ago you left the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.970
 Farewell take Estefania and me 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:08.509
 I agreed it 's okay then go but not 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.509
 come late 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.050
 what a barbarian steal me and if there was a 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.060
 robot for all the most successful of all 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.060
 it would be the robot for the party 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.239
 of expense spending of expenditure of expenditure 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.239
 of the pattern 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.980
 the best we grow to the real world where 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.700
 we are not yet so slaves of the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.390
 technology 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.390
 the cell phone 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.000
