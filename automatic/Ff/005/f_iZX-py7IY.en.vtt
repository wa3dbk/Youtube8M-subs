 my homeland by the Kuban Choir 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.540
 the viewer felt the immense power of Russia 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.810

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.810
 land 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 but 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.560
 not without reason there is an opinion that people 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.760
 coming to the Kuban concert 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.040
 Cossack choir 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.080
 leaves transformed and shrill 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.360
 the beauty of the music played transform 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:20.510
 the most enthusiastic skeptics enthusiasts 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:23.120
 so it was this time not very certainly 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.900
 we liked, we are generally very 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.420
 love the Cossack Kuban choir 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.820
 and especially daughter nose and I believe that this 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.980
 the concert is just wonderful we walk on 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.070

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.160
 last year I was lucky to get on 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.160

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.860
 like these folk songs they charge 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.140
 good energy positive they are 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.940
 unite people I think that such 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.840
 concerts should be held as much as possible 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:56.110
 more often there is no Cossack blood of mine too 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.060
 mom and that's it with seaside-ahtarska 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.320
 here is the Kuban 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:05.320
 she is such a real Cossack and sings 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.870
 so loud and and constantly even 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.390
 now living in the Urals constantly 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.060
 conveys how i go to a concert she 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.030
 says hello big Cossack 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.530
 little choir in life is now left 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.680
 such impressions 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.870
 nice to the soul turned around and 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.700
 I wanted to sing and enjoy life 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.160
 because now you can see that 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.830
 going on life but all are notorious 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.690
 somehow we try to live apart and people 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.140
 they woke people to the very thing 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.090
 human and it was very nice i am from 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.640
 wholeheartedly glad that there are such groups 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.540

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.610
