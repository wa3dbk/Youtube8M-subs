00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.710
 game consists of that you are a simple one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 line that you move with the directional buttons 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 right and left and then you have to search 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 we can define it as a snake 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.600
 online 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.870
 you must therefore try to close the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.070
 opponents with right and left arrows 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.620
 you can play the matches are ffa match 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.050
 timbales we propose you a ffa match 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.430
 to show how the game remembered 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.860
 this this game you can simply 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.090
 log in with an anonymous account or you can 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.760
 if you also want to participate in it in shape 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.630
 guest or by registering and being able to 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.640
 also download an account per account 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.840
 premium to change the color of the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.720
 your lines 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.880
 also you can also make clans now 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.700
 or create your own club and see 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.770
 which simulates a young man called easy 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 and then making these ward clouds 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.270
 you can simply have fun together 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.720
 to your friends then play one against 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.280
 one two against two and 3 4 3 up to a 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:08.130
 maximum of 4 and then as you can see in 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.190
 this game is occasionally born 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.280
 some green symbols come out 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.440
 so now I gain from it 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.680
 I had to take advantage of me and me 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.590
 then it becomes smaller to pass 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.240
 in the middle of the holes or those then 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.360
 the green ones benefit himself 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.670
 the red ones are always recovered 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.430
 disadvantage the highs so for example 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.250
 they can invert the arrow keys 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.040
 or when with lightning a lightning 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.150
 increase the speed instead of those 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.920
 blue benefit all people 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.810
 so for example this then pass 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.820
 three walls without crashing so I can 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.940
 go from here go to the other side 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.920
 obviously we remember that the objective 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.300
 of the game is did not go to crash into 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.560
 the opponent's line 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.000
 therefore I win once I reach 40 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.950
 points 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.200
 so now we're playing with here 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.430
 of very poor people and of course me 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.810
 I am the loader who brings victory 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.670
 always when we finished 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.340
 presented this game then we do 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.050
 just see with game minutes 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.370
 then now after having exhausted the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.100
 arguments on this game o 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.060
 will immediately pass to the next period which 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.770
 it's a game that I really like 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.960
 personally we could 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.320
 use in at school during 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.200
 computer lessons or a little bit 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.040
 everywhere we all got along 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.480
 How many 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.930
 it was enough to simply choose a name 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.980
 which is not even to be recorded is not from 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.060

 In case you enter inside your integrate 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.950
 room to practice alone then 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.550
 consists of this game consists of one 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.880
 tina sphere that it is you who must 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.890
 try to score on the opposite goal 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.080
 to its color there are two teams that 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.000
 red and blue depending on that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.530
 that you are part of you must make goals in the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.760
 door opponent how to use 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.590
 answers for 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.209
 to do your tricky and then try to 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.940
 download the opponents now let's go to 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.449
 see in a public game like it 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.280
 plays 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:27.840
 you have this is called a practically 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.940
 a virtual five-a-side football and consists of why 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.729
 practically the keys are simple mi 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.860
 they are precise and the darts 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.830
 space to pull or 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.830
 the ics to pull so then decided net 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.240
 the space the directional darts 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.819
 maximum number of players to decide 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.120
 freedoms time from a minimum of 2 to a 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.879
 maximum of 22 which if not convenient 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.530
 because the lag will be absurd because it starts 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:00.009
 would be a virtual five-a-side football 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.110
 so there are some national ones 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:07.379
 clans where they challenge you can't 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.219
 also decide the types of fields this 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.289
 this is an example 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.529
 let's take an example with this field then 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:18.669
 also customize the number of yours 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:20.620

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.779
