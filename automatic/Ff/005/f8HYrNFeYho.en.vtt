to me and um I just found it funny cuz
I'm<00:02:33.580> thinking<00:02:34.239> all<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.349> is<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.890> is

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
I'm thinking all I do it this is this is

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.130 
I'm thinking all I do it this is this is
what<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> way<00:02:36.760> black<00:02:37.090> people's<00:02:37.510> hair<00:02:37.720> looking

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.670 
what the way black people's hair looking
