00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:14.949
 one of the things you can do to disconnect 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.250
 remove 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.519
 the cover 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.349

 sms 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.040
 this new above 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.730
 create a little more space 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.020
 it is always tight pora 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.620
 there are those who even take it apart 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.800
 this box will acquire a little further back 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.970
 I try to do work without disassembling 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.180
 without removing anything 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.340
 first thing here too 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.200
 pull 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 we move these whites 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.600
 docup that encloses the cover layer bait hook 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.989
 what a circus behind 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.480
 course 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.310
 therefore 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.320
 you get out layer property we can't talk to someone leave it that way 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 don't let it lodge down 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.180
 also because a pin that I can't find them 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.460
 then he thought that it is cannas to connect the plug is very uncomfortable 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.170
 we should work in this space 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
 hence the discomfort you tell me amorous 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
