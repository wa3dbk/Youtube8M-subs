mouse pad this mouse for about three

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.980 
mouse pad this mouse for about three
months<00:00:24.980> now<00:00:25.189> say<00:00:25.640> I've<00:00:26.029> had<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.270> good<00:00:26.450> chance<00:00:26.689> to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
months now say I've had a good chance to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.679 
months now say I've had a good chance to
get<00:00:27.109> used<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.560> mouse<00:00:27.740> and<00:00:27.769> I<00:00:28.449> was<00:00:29.449> going<00:00:29.630> to

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
get used to the mouse and I was going to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.350 
get used to the mouse and I was going to
do<00:00:29.810> an<00:00:29.900> unboxing<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.849> be<00:00:31.970> honest<00:00:32.210> I

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
do an unboxing but to be honest I

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.450 
do an unboxing but to be honest I

gaming mouses like the logitech series
and<00:01:07.280> stuff<00:01:08.649> so<00:01:09.649> functionality<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:11.179> got<00:01:11.360> four

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
and stuff so functionality you got four

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.420 
and stuff so functionality you got four
different<00:01:12.050> DPI<00:01:12.320> settings<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:13.369> goes<00:01:13.700> up<00:01:14.000> t<00:01:15.430> let

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
different DPI settings it goes up t let

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.929 
different DPI settings it goes up t let
me<00:01:16.549> just<00:01:16.729> check<00:01:16.939> for<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.390> yeah<00:01:17.860> 3,200<00:01:18.860> DPI<00:01:19.220> so

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
me just check for it yeah 3,200 DPI so

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.770 
me just check for it yeah 3,200 DPI so
DPI<00:01:20.420> is<00:01:20.540> how<00:01:21.049> many<00:01:21.430> per<00:01:22.430> per<00:01:22.790> inch<00:01:23.030> how<00:01:23.600> many

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
DPI is how many per per inch how many

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.249 
DPI is how many per per inch how many
pixels<00:01:24.909> you<00:01:25.909> cover<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:26.689> obviously<00:01:27.049> if<00:01:27.140> you've

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
pixels you cover so obviously if you've

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.039 
pixels you cover so obviously if you've
got<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.439> larger<00:01:28.210> DPI<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:29.600> you're<00:01:29.720> covering

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
got a larger DPI then you're covering

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.620 
got a larger DPI then you're covering
more<00:01:30.229> pixels<00:01:30.740> per<00:01:31.100> inch<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.060> get<00:01:32.420> more

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
more pixels per inch so you get more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
more pixels per inch so you get more
they'll<00:01:32.960> feel<00:01:33.170> more<00:01:33.350> sensitive<00:01:34.900> so<00:01:35.900> depending

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
they'll feel more sensitive so depending

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.100 
they'll feel more sensitive so depending
on what<00:01:36.829> screen<00:01:37.220> size<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.729> have<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.240> how<00:01:38.270> you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
on what screen size you have and how you

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.200 
on what screen size you have and how you
use<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.799> mouse<00:01:40.100> whether<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.579> like<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:40.909> altra

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
use a mouse whether you like it altra

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.389 
use a mouse whether you like it altra
sensitive<00:01:41.750> if<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:42.560> like<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.890> be<00:01:43.009> able<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.280> move

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
sensitive if you like to be able to move

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.580 
sensitive if you like to be able to move
it<00:01:43.549> around<00:01:43.610> quite<00:01:43.939> a<00:01:44.000> bit<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.439> adjust

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
it around quite a bit you can adjust

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.819 
it around quite a bit you can adjust
your<00:01:46.100> dpi<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.840> one<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.110> cool<00:01:48.350> things<00:01:48.380> is

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
your dpi and one of the cool things is

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.389 
your dpi and one of the cool things is
it's<00:01:49.640> not<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.909> set<00:01:50.240> DPI<00:01:50.659> as<00:01:50.899> well<00:01:51.110> say<00:01:51.439> in<00:01:51.710> the

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's not a set DPI as well say in the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.760 
it's not a set DPI as well say in the
software<00:01:52.790> you<00:01:52.909> can<00:01:53.060> change<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.960> dpi<00:01:54.290> for<00:01:54.619> each

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
software you can change a dpi for each

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.510 
software you can change a dpi for each
mode<00:01:55.719> say<00:01:56.719> when<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.229> click<00:01:57.530> this<00:01:58.100> red<00:01:58.159> button

get help get like a really good
sensitivity<00:02:21.889> and<00:02:22.370> DPI<00:02:22.760> setting<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.810> was

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
sensitivity and DPI setting that I was

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.340 
sensitivity and DPI setting that I was
really<00:02:24.260> comfortable

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
really comfortable

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.750

that<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.440> can't<00:02:27.680> really<00:02:27.890> deal<00:02:28.250> with<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.490> normal

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
that you can't really deal with a normal

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.670 
that you can't really deal with a normal
mouse<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.450> they<00:02:29.600> obviously<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.990> can<00:02:30.170> put<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
round with sensitivities and games but

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.850 
round with sensitivities and games but
it<00:02:32.810> gives<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:33.110> good<00:02:33.260> all-round<00:02:34.630> setting<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860

it's called rapid fire it must be

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.449 
it's called rapid fire it must be
because<00:03:43.820> it's<00:03:44.150> more<00:03:44.540> easy<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.840> click<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.459> a

because it's more easy to click and a
period<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:46.940> time<00:03:47.209> but<00:03:47.600> it's<00:03:48.260> probably<00:03:48.590> just

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
period of time but it's probably just

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.780

pretty sure you can buy the grips though
so<00:05:10.010> it's<00:05:10.130> not<00:05:10.220> a<00:05:10.280> massive<00:05:10.700> problem

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
so it's not a massive problem

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.320 
so it's not a massive problem
quality-wise<00:05:12.590> as<00:05:13.100> I've<00:05:13.700> been<00:05:13.730> saying<00:05:14.000> it's

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
quality-wise as I've been saying it's

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.730 
quality-wise as I've been saying it's
good<00:05:14.510> quality<00:05:14.930> but<00:05:15.170> it<00:05:15.320> does<00:05:15.470> feel<00:05:15.500> pretty

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
good quality but it does feel pretty

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.610 
good quality but it does feel pretty
plastic<00:05:16.600> there's<00:05:17.600> no<00:05:17.720> metal<00:05:18.020> parts<00:05:18.440> on<00:05:18.590> it

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
plastic there's no metal parts on it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.890 
plastic there's no metal parts on it
unlike<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.430> other<00:05:19.640> rats<00:05:19.910> where<00:05:20.210> you've<00:05:20.690> got

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
unlike the other rats where you've got

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.410 
unlike the other rats where you've got
metal<00:05:21.860> runners<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.430> stuff<00:05:22.670> doesn't<00:05:23.270> have

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
metal runners and stuff doesn't have

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.320 
metal runners and stuff doesn't have
that<00:05:23.620> but<00:05:24.620> then<00:05:24.740> again<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:25.160> is<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.310> budget<00:05:25.790> rat

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
that but then again it is a budget rat

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.940 
that but then again it is a budget rat
mouse<00:05:26.570> so<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:26.990> wouldn't<00:05:27.320> really<00:05:27.410> expect<00:05:27.530> to

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
mouse so you wouldn't really expect to

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
mouse so you wouldn't really expect to
have<00:05:28.220> all<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.940> bells<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:29.240> whistles<00:05:29.330> on<00:05:29.780> it<00:05:30.970> it

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
have all the bells and whistles on it it

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.000 
have all the bells and whistles on it it
doesn't<00:05:32.330> have<00:05:32.480> an<00:05:32.630> adjustable<00:05:32.840> weights<00:05:33.290> it

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
doesn't have an adjustable weights it

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.280 
doesn't have an adjustable weights it
feels<00:05:34.250> pretty<00:05:34.580> light<00:05:35.030> as<00:05:35.300> well<00:05:35.480> so<00:05:35.870> if<00:05:36.169> you

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
feels pretty light as well so if you

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.960 
feels pretty light as well so if you
like<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.710> more<00:05:36.860> heavy<00:05:37.070> mouse<00:05:37.340> I'd<00:05:37.640> recommend

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
like it more heavy mouse I'd recommend

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.000 
like it more heavy mouse I'd recommend
getting<00:05:38.210> something<00:05:38.660> with<00:05:39.290> adjustable<00:05:39.740> wait

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
getting something with adjustable wait

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.360 
getting something with adjustable wait
cuz<00:05:41.290> yeah<00:05:42.290> it's<00:05:42.500> a<00:05:42.590> bit<00:05:42.830> bit<00:05:43.520> like<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:45.370> runners

wireless mousers are getting a lot
better<00:06:13.490> but<00:06:14.000> I<00:06:14.270> think<00:06:14.900> for<00:06:15.110> gaming<00:06:15.530> you<00:06:15.890> always

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
better but I think for gaming you always

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.480 
better but I think for gaming you always
want<00:06:16.310> to<00:06:16.370> stick<00:06:16.580> with<00:06:16.610> wide<00:06:17.450> mouth<00:06:17.750> um<00:06:18.490> just

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
want to stick with wide mouth um just

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.700 
want to stick with wide mouth um just
because<00:06:19.820> you<00:06:20.240> don't<00:06:20.360> get<00:06:20.570> any<00:06:20.690> lag<00:06:21.169> or<00:06:21.440> and

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
because you don't get any lag or and

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.110 
because you don't get any lag or and
it's<00:06:21.890> completely<00:06:22.310> responsive<00:06:23.000> and

is great however quality it does feel a

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.530 
is great however quality it does feel a
bit<00:07:03.490> plasticky<00:07:03.820> but<00:07:04.480> then<00:07:04.600> again<00:07:04.720> I<00:07:06.540> think

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
bit plasticky but then again I think

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.050 
bit plasticky but then again I think
that<00:07:08.050> is<00:07:08.140> completely<00:07:08.560> outweighed<00:07:08.950> by<00:07:08.980> how<00:07:09.550> how

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
that is completely outweighed by how how

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.030 
that is completely outweighed by how how
nicest<00:07:10.750> mouse<00:07:10.930> is<00:07:11.110> to<00:07:11.260> use<00:07:11.440> and<00:07:11.650> how<00:07:11.740> good<00:07:11.950> it

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
feels in my hand and then obviously

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.480 
feels in my hand and then obviously
adjustability<00:07:14.620> be<00:07:15.010> the<00:07:15.070> only<00:07:15.220> other<00:07:15.400> thing

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
adjustability be the only other thing

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.510
