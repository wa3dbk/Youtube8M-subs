00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.750
 the next material they will comment on is the 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:19.210
 city ​​26 110 known as mg five 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.700
 This material was collected in the 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.180
 country called burundi the tiny country in the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.190
 Africa and collected in a region of 1,500 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.050
 meters of altitude and a region with 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.770
 precipitation around 1,700 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.110
 millimeters to 1 126 110 the number 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.880
 record this institution that 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.160
 international center of agriculture 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.530
 Tropical which is an absurd made 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.050
 launch in the year 2000, this material was 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.180
 It is one for which it was brizantha cultivar mg 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.090
 five win then the main 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.980
 feature of the five mg win is yours 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.140
 high forage production if we 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.450
 compared to compared to it 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.940
 marandu is much more productive 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.710
 while the husband is has the production in 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.200
 around 10 to 12 tonnes 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.749
 mg can reach up to 16 tonnes of 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.759
 dry matter per hectare per year your 

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:09.310
 protein production is around 10 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.159
 up to 13% than the main characteristic 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.920
 of India 5 is that it has a 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.899
 ability to regrow so much is that 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.659
 one of the cares we always recommend 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.090
 is that once you plant within 60 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.310
 days 70 days has to put field check 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.159
 if the year can be made first grazing and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.139
 then every 20 and 25 days in the period 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.270
 hot rainy period 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:33.399
 usually this material is ready 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.100
 to be a father of jade then this fast 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.049
 is that this 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.749
 cultivate mg five wins 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.819
 one of the main characteristics of g5 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.719
 is precisely its high capacity of 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:50.229
 regrowth and account living it takes 30 32 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.779
 and resprouting under the same conditions as mg 5 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.619
 with 20 and 25 days already people will be done 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.090
 grazing 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.439
 it is important to remember that this material 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.539
 was also launched by the city itself in 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.119
 1999 by doctor pedro rangel tac is a 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.130
 great researcher in the forage area 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.599
 who made the launch in the country called 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.599
 costa rica in central america
