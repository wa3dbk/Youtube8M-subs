 Japan Professional Basketball League bj League Final 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.050
 The battle to decide the tournament participation is an early morning 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.049
 It took place at Ariake Coliseum 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.079
 The high pressure met earlier is the opponent 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.150
 It is in the prefecture that became the season third place 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.239
 It is a team that won 2 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.239
 We advance to heat resistance 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.109
 I liked it because of the winning streak 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 In yesterday's game I was completely down 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.860
 I have not placed a third quarter 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 A certain price 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200
 While the students are not determined 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 Focus on Tokyo Loveland 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.310
 Make sure the score 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.940
 The final point was 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.460
 I enjoyed the run 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.230
 Tatsuya Takenaka 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.430
 I decided to participate in the final tournament 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 First of all because there is a limit in the video 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.940
 Urawa won 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.280
 It turns out to be a percentage 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.610
 Still ground golf 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.150
 Excluded output payment 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
 landing 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.840
 And the playoff looks like this 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.970
 Please give me 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.590
 Tokyo won the playoff with victory over Sendai final 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.740
 Apache is first 16 days 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.079
 Going to the finals with Higashi Mikawa phoenix in the eastern district No. 1 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.510
 You can spend 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.360
 It's a classic I won the 7211a west district winning team and the bj league 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.850
 It means that it will fight over the annual champion of 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.600
 is 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.750
 Japanese people who participated from all over the country because it is the second consecutive year 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.689
 I look forward to 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.490
 Is it also everyone's wish and want you to work hard next year 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.760
 But I participated in that 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.420
 It is not this year because it is Tokyo and Osaka 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.970
 Junior high school basketball's high price after Okinawa is Matsuo Shinonaka city 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.640
 It's a hotel of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.530
 After all it is supported by area and surely comes out and comes out 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.180
 I think 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.770
 After all the first match was known until now with 2 wins and 6 losses 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.540
 That's right 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.690
 Let's support everyone
