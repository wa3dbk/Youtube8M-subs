00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
just meant to be a proof of concept by

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
just meant to be a proof of concept by
the<00:01:26.790> programmer<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:27.900> said<00:01:28.170> make

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the programmer you know they said make

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
the programmer you know they said make
his<00:01:28.740> pac-man<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.670> did<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.030> notch<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.900> up

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
his pac-man so he did this notch it up

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.649 
his pac-man so he did this notch it up
in<00:01:31.140> about<00:01:31.229> two<00:01:31.619> weeks<00:01:31.860> or<00:01:32.040> something<00:01:32.220> crazy

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
in about two weeks or something crazy

and<00:01:33.659> said<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:35.009> how<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.990> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and said you know this is how it this is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.760 
and said you know this is how it this is
where<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:39.049> can't<00:01:40.049> put<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> sentence

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
where it's I can't put a sentence

together<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> proof<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.990> concept<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
together it was a proof of concept and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.160 
together it was a proof of concept and
the<00:01:44.520> people<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:44.880> Atari<00:01:45.180> said<00:01:45.479> yep<00:01:45.659> that's<00:01:45.899> fine
