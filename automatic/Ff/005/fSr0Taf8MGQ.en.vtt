00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.550
 and 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:24.710
 a spectacular product is a brand 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.710
 which I think is said in a mix 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.980
 it's a mascara that leaves the eyelashes three 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.739
 times longer and cooler than normal 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.780
 At this time I already applied it 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.520
 I have posts 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.649
 I have a friend the university very 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.000
 my dear, it's called roger and she started 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.870
 to sell the products of this brand 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.539
 yumi and me super recommended the mascara 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.059
 At first I was a bit like that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.340
 because you always see the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.690
 propaganda of these mascara is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.059
 spectacular is to let these 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.430
 lashes up to your forehead not those things 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.250
 very long and when you try it not 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.989
 you have to see but so much I existed I saw 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 the pictures of her I saw the pictures 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.020
 friends of them who had bought the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.790
 mascara and I said no this has to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.570
 work apart is my friend they are not 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 lying girls I bought it I got the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 last week and the only thing I've used 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.110
 so far is this precisely for 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.759
 go out at night because to me at the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.649
 night I like to have my eyelashes on 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.470
 long you know that I do not have anything of 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.429
 eyelashes I usually use my eyelashes 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.649
 false but with this product is used 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.420
 I have stopped using my false eyelashes 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.119
 I tell you last week that I did not 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 I put some false eyelashes I do not want 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.909
 say that I will never use them because 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.130
 obviously the false eyelashes have 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.330
 a different aspect can not 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.100
 buy one is that they are totally 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.140
 different lashes so it has 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.009
 natural and sometimes one wants something a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.100
 little more dramatic but these are 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.680
 totally 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.200
 the best is the look is natural if 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.299
 you are seeing what you can notice is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.950
 a look that nobody is going to realize that 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.900
 what you have is a lot of 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.020
 mascara what has different terry mel 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.820
 is that it comes with some fibers and those 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.170
 fibers make kong to the area and give more 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.670
 volume to the tab 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.670
 then I hope you like it 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.709
 and let's start the tutorial ok let's 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.900
 start then I already did one of my 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.239
 eyes then so that you can 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.239
 see the difference between one and the other 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.070
 this one already apply the mascara 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.070
 I hope you are watching 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.370
 the rhythm comes in a box and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:48.299
 when we see her 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.299
 It has some instructions inside 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:57.450
 and then two first come not only 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.450
 big but smaller 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.560
 i 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.560
 the big one is the gel 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.310
 and the boy are the fibers then for 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.590
 start we take the gel the gel is like 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.070
 if it was a normal mascara 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.070
 black 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.680
 but it's good 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.920
 but what can you see, let's apply 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.760
 exactly how we would apply a mascara 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.390
 in all all in all our 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.390
 tabs 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.430
 after applying the gel 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.510
 let's grab 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.510
 the fibers 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.959
 and we're going to apply gel syrup 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.350
 here you can see the difference of an eye 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:27.400
 with two passes of mascara and fibers and one 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.770
 past gel with fibers this more than one 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.620
 day look and this is more a look of 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.620
 night then let's repeat the step 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.000
 I usually wait a minute and I'll come back 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.470
 to do to make it more intense 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.970
 Especially if it's night time then 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.970
 grabbed the gel again 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.919
 I apply it 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.280
 I grab the fiber 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.710
 and I apply 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:09.539
 after passing the fiber I go back to 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.189
 Apply the gel so that the fibers 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.189
 stay in place 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.699
 if they have a little gel on the eyelid 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.090
 as well as I have I can take it out with a 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:29.199
 little bit of makeup remover 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.150
 ok then this is the final result 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.130
 here as you can see it I hope what 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.080
 they are seeing well 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.389
 Excuse me if I seem to be a little 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.790
 blind is that I have all the light coming in 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.169
 of the window behind the camera but 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.770
 What I wanted to tell you is that the 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:49.010
 difference between is this mascara and the 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.690
 False or false eyelashes is that 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.280
 when the eyelashes are not always put on 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.830
 you feel something different in the eyes 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.540
 you always feel like a little bit 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.940
 annoyance with this you do not feel 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.850
 absolutely nothing with this is 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.250
 totally natural it's as if it will not charge 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.950
 mascara at all or a mascara 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.950
 anybody does not do any 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.250
 difference are spectacular girls are 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.979
 the super recommend do not stop buying 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.750
 the use of not to try them and they do it 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.880
 in your comments below I would like 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.220
 that the other readers know what 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.690
 spectacular that is I know that your 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.210
 comments are going to be positive is 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.289
 impossible that you do not like this mascara is 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.249
 too spectacular at least 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:34.259
 like to have long eyelashes or thing 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:36.149
 very full if that is the case I do not know 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.599
 buy but if you love that 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:40.710
 those long pull tabs vibrate like 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.150
 these 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.520
 this is the mascara for you 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.400
