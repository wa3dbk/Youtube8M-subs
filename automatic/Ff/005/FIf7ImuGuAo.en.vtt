as<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> sort<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.920> right-wing<00:00:23.240> reactionary<00:00:24.260> but

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
as a sort of right-wing reactionary but

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.990 
as a sort of right-wing reactionary but
at<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> time<00:00:29.300> certainly<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.480> man<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.810> his<00:00:30.929> age

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
at the time certainly a man of his age

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.910 
at the time certainly a man of his age
he's<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> sympathetic<00:00:33.780> man<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.800> it's

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
he's not a sympathetic man I think it's

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.549 
he's not a sympathetic man I think it's
very<00:00:35.070> important<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.570> Esteban<00:00:37.200> be

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
very important that that Esteban be

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.770 
very important that that Esteban be
disliked<00:00:38.989> for<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.350> large<00:00:40.770> part<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> film

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
disliked for the large part of the film

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
disliked for the large part of the film
because<00:00:42.780> he<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.230> hard<00:00:44.570> I<00:00:45.980> hope<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.190> audience

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
because he is hard I hope the audience

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
because he is hard I hope the audience
will<00:00:47.550> understand<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.360> makes<00:00:48.600> him<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
will understand what makes him so but I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.720 
will understand what makes him so but I
don't<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:49.980> they'll<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.280> him<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.670> think

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
don't think they'll like him and I think

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.950 
don't think they'll like him and I think
that's<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> structure<00:00:53.930> what<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that's right for the structure what I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.439 
that's right for the structure what I
think<00:00:55.440> happens<00:00:55.980> at<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> end<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> story<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
think happens at the end of the story is

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.920 
think happens at the end of the story is
that<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.719> he<00:00:57.840> gets<00:00:58.020> older<00:00:58.440> he<00:00:58.469> sweetens<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.930> he

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that as he gets older he sweetens and he

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.349 
that as he gets older he sweetens and he
is<00:01:01.050> forgiven<00:01:01.530> by<00:01:01.710> his<00:01:01.920> wife<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
about forgiveness and about the fact

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.260 
about forgiveness and about the fact
that<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.580> must<00:01:11.850> as<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:13.590> race<00:01:14.150> forgive<00:01:15.150> each

and stop wanting to revenge but actually

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.219 
and stop wanting to revenge but actually

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
to accept that people are what they are

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.980 
to accept that people are what they are
because<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:25.830> they've<00:01:26.009> been<00:01:26.189> made<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.480 

although<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.530> hope<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:32.009> won't<00:01:32.159> like

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
although I think I hope we won't like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.210 
although I think I hope we won't like
him<00:01:32.729> through<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> picture<00:01:33.509> at<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> end<00:01:34.409> his

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
him through the picture at the end his

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.969 
him through the picture at the end his
wife<00:01:35.750> when<00:01:36.750> talking<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> his<00:01:37.470> daughter<00:01:37.740> says

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
wife when talking to his daughter says

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.530 
wife when talking to his daughter says
you<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.189> your<00:01:38.369> father<00:01:38.579> isn't<00:01:38.820> malicious<00:01:39.360> he

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you know your father isn't malicious he

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.569 
you know your father isn't malicious he
just<00:01:39.720> has<00:01:39.869> too<00:01:40.049> much<00:01:40.200> energy<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.369> I<00:01:44.369> think

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
just has too much energy and I think

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.830 
just has too much energy and I think
that's<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> pretty<00:01:44.970> good<00:01:45.090> signing<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that's a pretty good signing up of

seen I liked the performances he got out
of<00:01:54.930> actors<00:01:55.290> which<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.740> always<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> sign<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:57.030> an

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
of actors which is always a sign for an

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
of actors which is always a sign for an
actor<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.689> look<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
actor you look for that because you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130 
actor you look for that because you
think<00:01:59.210> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.240> director<00:02:00.719> may<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
think you know director may be good a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.039 
think you know director may be good a
story<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.890> maybe<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> camerawork

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
story or maybe but a camerawork

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.139 
story or maybe but a camerawork
I'll<00:02:04.710> made<00:02:05.039> a<00:02:05.070> good<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.340> cutting<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.060> he

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
I'll made a good at cutting but if he

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.119 
I'll made a good at cutting but if he
also<00:02:06.299> gets<00:02:06.600> good<00:02:06.899> performances<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.009> his

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
also gets good performances out of his

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.100 
also gets good performances out of his
actors<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:08.640> obviously<00:02:08.759> he<00:02:09.030> takes<00:02:09.269> care<00:02:09.539> over

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
actors then obviously he takes care over

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.220 
actors then obviously he takes care over
that<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.790> strangely<00:02:12.150> enough<00:02:12.239> some<00:02:12.629> directors

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that and strangely enough some directors

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.140 
that and strangely enough some directors
in<00:02:13.379> film<00:02:13.620> aren't<00:02:14.250> very<00:02:14.430> interested<00:02:15.030> in

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
in film aren't very interested in

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.690 
in film aren't very interested in
performance<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> thought<00:02:19.370> three<00:02:20.370> years<00:02:20.580> ago

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
performance so I thought three years ago

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.699
