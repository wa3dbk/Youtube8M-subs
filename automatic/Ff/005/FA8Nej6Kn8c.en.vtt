00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.190 
it easy for them to gain later because
if<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.240> start<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.600> thousand<00:02:07.020> one<00:02:07.170> hundred

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
if you start a thousand one hundred

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800 
if you start a thousand one hundred
Baylor<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:09.090> don't<00:02:09.270> start<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> tournament

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
Baylor you don't start the tournament

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780 
Baylor you don't start the tournament
with<00:02:10.229> thousand<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:10.830> hundred<00:02:10.860> Baylor<00:02:11.280> yes

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
with thousand one hundred Baylor yes

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.670 
with thousand one hundred Baylor yes
only<00:02:12.150> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
only you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.330 
only you
you<00:02:13.739> get<00:02:14.000> 2200<00:02:15.079> then<00:02:16.079> you<00:02:16.290> will<00:02:16.439> have<00:02:16.469> 100

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
you get 2200 then you will have 100

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.770 
you get 2200 then you will have 100
points<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.000> clan<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:18.569> much<00:02:18.750> easier

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
points for the clan so it's much easier

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.000 
points for the clan so it's much easier
to<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.469> from<00:02:19.500> zero<00:02:20.989> 2200<00:02:21.989> then<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.829> go<00:02:22.980> from

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
to go from zero 2200 then to go from

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.449 
to go from zero 2200 then to go from
thousand<00:02:23.549> two<00:02:23.670> hundred<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.560> 2400<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:26.129> gain<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
thousand two hundred to 2400 to gain the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.569 
thousand two hundred to 2400 to gain the
same<00:02:26.640> amount<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.939> points<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.959> that's<00:02:28.140> why<00:02:28.579> if

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
same amount of points so that's why if

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.550 
same amount of points so that's why if
the<00:02:29.760> tournament<00:02:30.180> has<00:02:30.329> started<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.019> asked<00:02:31.200> clan

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
the tournament has started we asked clan

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.309 
the tournament has started we asked clan
members<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.099> leave<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.909> clan<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.810> lower<00:02:34.019> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
members to leave the clan to lower the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.670 
members to leave the clan to lower the
value<00:02:34.500> as<00:02:34.980> down<00:02:35.609> as<00:02:35.639> possible<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.510> come<00:02:37.500> back

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
value as down as possible and come back

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.129 
value as down as possible and come back
to<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.219> gain<00:02:39.030> valor<00:02:39.359> on<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:39.840> tournament

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
to then gain valor on the tournament

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.259 
to then gain valor on the tournament
because<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:41.040> points<00:02:41.430> are<00:02:41.609> added<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
because then the points are added to the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.229 
because then the points are added to the
clan<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:43.739> gave<00:02:44.189> points<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.000> clan

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
clan if you gave points to the clan

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.440 
clan if you gave points to the clan
meaning<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.769> gained<00:02:47.069> three<00:02:47.489> hundred<00:02:47.790> baylor

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
meaning you gained three hundred baylor

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.349 
meaning you gained three hundred baylor
on<00:02:49.159> the<00:02:50.159> tournament<00:02:50.609> and<00:02:50.669> you<00:02:50.819> leave<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.150> clan

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
on the tournament and you leave the clan

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.809 
on the tournament and you leave the clan
this<00:02:51.629> 300<00:02:52.109> points<00:02:52.290> will<00:02:52.680> be<00:02:52.709> minus<00:02:53.159> on<00:02:53.579> the

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
this 300 points will be minus on the

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.860 
this 300 points will be minus on the
total<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:55.079> that<00:02:55.409> is<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:56.159> is<00:02:56.400> why<00:02:56.730> when<00:02:57.689> there

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
total so that is that is why when there

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.780 
total so that is that is why when there
r<00:02:57.959> minus<00:02:58.230> points<00:02:58.680> they<00:02:58.799> are<00:02:58.889> also<00:03:00.409> subtracted

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
r minus points they are also subtracted

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.520 
r minus points they are also subtracted
there<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.909> go<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.299> that's<00:03:03.810> all<00:03:04.139> there<00:03:04.409> is<00:03:04.439> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
there you go so that's all there is to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.429 
there you go so that's all there is to
know<00:03:04.709> about<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.219> clan<00:03:05.489> tournament<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.439> there

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
know about the clan tournament and there

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.020 
know about the clan tournament and there
might<00:03:07.590> be<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.799> confusion<00:03:08.189> at<00:03:08.400> some<00:03:08.579> point<00:03:08.819> with

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
might be a confusion at some point with

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.449 
might be a confusion at some point with
the<00:03:09.150> individual<00:03:09.780> tournament<00:03:10.370> recently<00:03:11.370> you

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
the individual tournament recently you

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.229 
the individual tournament recently you
think<00:03:11.669> we<00:03:11.849> could<00:03:11.969> go<00:03:12.169> they<00:03:13.169> put<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.980> is

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
think we could go they put in that is

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.330 
think we could go they put in that is
the<00:03:15.239> same<00:03:15.419> tournament<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:16.439> just<00:03:17.250> for

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
the same tournament but just for

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.860 
the same tournament but just for
individual<00:03:18.090> not<00:03:18.329> four<00:03:18.659> clans<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:21.599> in<00:03:21.720> this

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
individual not four clans so in this

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.119 
individual not four clans so in this
case<00:03:22.139> if<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.799> click<00:03:23.129> on<00:03:23.250> your<00:03:23.430> trailer<00:03:25.129> we

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
case if you click on your trailer we

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.520 
case if you click on your trailer we
will<00:03:26.250> get<00:03:26.430> straight<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.030> player<00:03:27.530> top

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
will get straight to the player top

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.069 
will get straight to the player top
player<00:03:28.949> leaderboard<00:03:29.879> so<00:03:30.599> that's<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
player leaderboard so that's for the

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.099 
player leaderboard so that's for the
total<00:03:31.379> value<00:03:31.530> learn<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.510> 17,000<00:03:33.510> mobloc

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
total value learn so the 17,000 mobloc

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.849 
total value learn so the 17,000 mobloc
and<00:03:34.379> if<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.129> go<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.549> sign<00:03:35.760> here<00:03:36.859> paleo
