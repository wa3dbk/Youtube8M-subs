gonna try to move across the middle and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.310 
gonna try to move across the middle and
hang<00:01:19.440> out<00:01:19.619> work<00:01:20.869> because<00:01:21.869> they're<00:01:22.020> probably<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
hang out work because they're probably a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.600 
hang out work because they're probably a
little<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.590> fortified<00:01:23.159> over<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
little bit fortified over here it's a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.160 
little bit fortified over here it's a
standard<00:01:23.940> computer<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.630> they're<00:01:24.899> not<00:01:24.990> bigger

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
standard computer so they're not bigger

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.690 
standard computer so they're not bigger
but<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> best<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.369> probably<00:01:26.490> have

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
but not the best but they probably have

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.630 
but not the best but they probably have
something<00:01:26.909> over<00:01:27.149> here<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.490> see

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
something over here but as you can see

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.010 
something over here but as you can see
it<00:01:29.789> allows<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.119> transfer<00:01:30.479> units<00:01:30.780> very

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it allows you to transfer units very

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.290 
it allows you to transfer units very
quickly<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.679> easily<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:32.940> use<00:01:33.179> this

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
quickly and easily and you can use this

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:43.899 
quickly and easily and you can use this
to<00:01:33.450> capture<00:01:33.630> points<00:01:34.110> no<00:01:34.649> problem

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909

they can't take more than one
panzerschreck<00:02:02.310> day<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.390> there's<00:02:03.690> some

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
panzerschreck day right and there's some

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.120 
panzerschreck day right and there's some
fainter<00:02:04.140> stretch<00:02:04.320> we'll<00:02:04.500> find<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.830> how<00:02:04.950> many

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
fainter stretch we'll find out how many

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.980 
fainter stretch we'll find out how many
they<00:02:05.220> could<00:02:05.369> take<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.790> bet<00:02:06.420> two<00:02:06.570> shots<00:02:06.840> will

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
they could take I bet two shots will

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:16.430 
they could take I bet two shots will
take<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> out<00:02:12.470> two<00:02:13.470> shots<00:02:15.080> that's<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:16.260> right

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
take it out two shots that's all right

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.250 
take it out two shots that's all right
good<00:02:16.770> experiment<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.840> see<00:02:18.989> how<00:02:19.140> they

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
good experiment but you can see how they

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.370 
good experiment but you can see how they
can<00:02:19.380> be<00:02:19.440> utilized<00:02:19.560> specially<00:02:20.280> early-game

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
can be utilized specially early-game

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.510 
can be utilized specially early-game
like<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.470> said<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.739> machine<00:02:22.980> gun<00:02:23.070> will<00:02:23.310> not

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
like I said that machine gun will not

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.640 
like I said that machine gun will not
suppress<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.989> better<00:02:25.110> than<00:02:25.200> nothing

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
suppress but it's better than nothing

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.590 
suppress but it's better than nothing
and<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> squad<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:30.209> second

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
pretty handy move this 80 gun back where

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.390 
pretty handy move this 80 gun back where
it<00:02:35.160> needs<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.650> second<00:02:37.950> ability<00:02:38.130> this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
it needs to go the second ability this

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
watch out for the 80 because this is

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.170 
watch out for the 80 because this is
light<00:04:30.290> armor<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.890> it<00:04:31.550> will<00:04:31.669> be<00:04:31.790> taken<00:04:32.090> out

light armor and it will be taken out

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.330 
light armor and it will be taken out
quickly<00:04:32.590> this<00:04:33.590> should<00:04:33.860> be<00:04:33.950> noted<00:04:34.220> this

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
quickly this should be noted this

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.280 
quickly this should be noted this
half-track<00:04:34.820> cannot<00:04:35.390> be<00:04:35.570> upgraded<00:04:35.750> with<00:04:36.080> the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
AAA gun the quad 50s however it does

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.170 
AAA gun the quad 50s however it does
reinforce<00:04:40.070> as<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.520> can<00:04:40.640> see<00:04:40.760> here<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.000> have

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
reinforce as you can see here I have

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.260 
reinforce as you can see here I have
this<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.750> stew<00:04:42.320> two-star<00:04:42.860> rear<00:04:43.520> echelon<00:04:43.640> squad

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
this to stew two-star rear echelon squad

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.820 
this to stew two-star rear echelon squad
which<00:04:44.570> means<00:04:44.780> it<00:04:44.900> can<00:04:44.990> have<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.140> fifth<00:04:45.350> unit<00:04:45.650> and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
which means it can have a fifth unit and

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.710 
which means it can have a fifth unit and
you<00:04:45.919> can<00:04:46.070> see<00:04:46.160> here<00:04:46.370> that<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.669> fifth<00:04:47.480> man<00:04:47.690> I

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
you can see here that it fifth man I

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.050 
you can see here that it fifth man I
mean<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.470> can<00:04:48.770> reinforce<00:04:49.130> from<00:04:49.730> this<00:04:49.880> half

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
mean it can reinforce from this half

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.250 
mean it can reinforce from this half
track<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:51.050> that's<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.500> pretty<00:04:51.770> handy<00:04:53.260> feature

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
track so that's a pretty handy feature

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.650 
track so that's a pretty handy feature
of<00:04:54.500> this<00:04:54.590> commander<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.150> last<00:04:56.360> two<00:04:56.600> are

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
of this commander and the last two are

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.450 
of this commander and the last two are
probably<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.710> last<00:04:57.770> two<00:04:57.979> abilities<00:04:58.340> this

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
probably the last two abilities this

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.560 
probably the last two abilities this
commander<00:04:58.790> are<00:04:58.910> probably<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.270> most<00:04:59.390> useful

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
commander are probably the most useful

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.020 
commander are probably the most useful

security brush is how quick it is watch
this<00:05:41.460> I<00:05:41.669> think<00:05:42.030> it's<00:05:42.120> about<00:05:42.270> six<00:05:42.630> seconds<00:05:43.020> by

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
this I think it's about six seconds by

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.140 
this I think it's about six seconds by
the<00:05:43.169> time<00:05:43.349> I<00:05:43.380> click<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:44.220> when<00:05:44.430> the<00:05:44.880> artillery

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
the time I click to when the artillery

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.420 
the time I click to when the artillery
starts<00:05:45.539> falling<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:46.139> if<00:05:47.009> they're<00:05:47.190> not<00:05:47.220> paying

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
starts falling so if they're not paying

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.680 
starts falling so if they're not paying
attention<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:48.120> enemy's<00:05:48.360> not<00:05:48.509> paying

attention the enemy's not paying

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.200 
attention the enemy's not paying
