00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.920
 we have here the mold of the part 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.900
 superior that is this kind of shirt 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.940
 this remeron that we have in animal print 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.039
 I tell you that basically to see would be 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.619
 medium as a rectangle that what 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.570
 we did was round the edges a bit 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.910
 as you can see I was thinking to 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.140
 tell them what way I could do but the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.240
 true that we could start from a 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.910
 rectangle we did the part of the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.980
 shoulders and obviously we cut by the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.170
 neckline theme that to see girls the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.600
 neckline can do it round what can 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.760
 do instead more neck flips and stays 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.230
 according to the design that you like 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.390
 give the top part of this 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.060
 shirt and with regard to the part of 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.520
 down is going to be a simple rectangle that 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.590
 you can cut it into double cloth if it stops 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.080
 have only the seam in the center 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.660
 back that's going to be kind of 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.250
 skirt that is going to have this dress that goes 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.920
 to be important that they are a fabric of 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.250
 point so that by the time they place the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.900
 dress says them and they look good 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.119
 stuck the body well sep sig 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.759
 once then we cut the molds 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.630
 I want to show you we have here the 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.590
 top part 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.929
 another proposal also 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.000
 so strong that it's a kind of animal 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.549
 print but good are clearly others 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.590
 colors in colorado with medium black that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.170
 It has some specks and what we are going to 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.600
 to do is to know if the union of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.759
 shoulders and as for the bottom part 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.659
 I want to show you we are not going to join 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.689
 directly on the side, but 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.539
 approximately 7 centimeters from 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.609
 edge let's mark a straight line that 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.890
 it will also have about 20 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.259
 centimeters long and what we're going to 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.079
 do directly is chinchÃ³n with the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.880
 sewing a seam straight 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.739
 that way you guys when you place in 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.049
 this reverol is going to explode 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.840
 waist yes and once you guys 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.719
 they knew these straight seams 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.819
 on one side as on the other we have left 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.459
 put her skirt as you can see is 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.159
 very simple that is the rectangle 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.530
 as I told them in a fabric that 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.959
 he says for you to sit down and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.780
 Mark the divine silhouette that we have 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.040
 women in this case we have the sewing 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.860
 that we are going to place it in the center 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.830
 back and what we have left to do 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.740
 is to unite the part of the shirt to our 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.080
 skirt as you can see is wider the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.360
 rower theme because for this thing 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.710
 we are going to go pursing and we will go 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.920
 accommodating throughout our entire 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.710
 skirt so that then that frowns 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.080
 and when we place it, take that cute 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.680
 way once we have this I can 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.320
 say that we already have in our dress 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.020
 done later is the subject of the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.910
 details I want to show that they 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.130
 you can place look, I did this 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.470
 kind of embroidery on the sides 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.690
 because they can not put a tape on 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.880
 good you those little endings 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.520
 that you know they do not give you that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.080
 detail to this dress and well there it is 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.910
 the combination so much that I made 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.440
 benito tells us anger with the 'animal 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.480
 print 'is not a matter of being 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.010
 overloaded good it seems to me that in 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.010
 this dress we learned the lesson
