 let's take about everything in order we 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.359
 consider new blocks that adds 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.029
 dubs 161 is a block of coal that is where it 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.449

 nine wheat carpet crafted from two 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 wool and baked clay looks 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.640
 so here it is before but you can 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.300
 paint the cortes again more precisely just 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:50.879

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.860
 ovens 161 are called horse renewal 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.489
 update he adds horses 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.780
 here are donkeys and mules if you cross a horse 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 sleep well and it rain they basically 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.369
 all this animals can ride them 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.840
 to teach 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.409
 poke them right mouse button climbed and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.200
 having driven a little bit to drive them 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.670
 well you need a saddle to hang them like 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.350
 us here and on the horse and also on 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.080
 horse can hang armor which 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.820
 is usually found in deep in oslo data 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.640
 can hang a chest and again 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.240
 use it like 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 just a portable large inventory here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.540
 also added a leash 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.470
 us which with which you can 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.829
 to drive horses and lead the move over to 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.170
 a pillar if you need to go there under it 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:53.670
 drive knit give everyone the beach back 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:59.490
 and there was a tag that can 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:05.649
 enchant anvil and somehow 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.240
 I call my animal friend too 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.170
 called also generally can actually 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.569
 call any mobs 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.360
 but I think the creeper will not be very happy 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:20.800
 If you call you like that on another 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:25.209
 that 's the same as us in 161 have changed 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 generation of desert world is no longer 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.860
 lake generated 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.900
 the Greeks do not pour on the edges of the desert in 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.010
 the bottom world again added generation 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.190
 chests and well they can be found in hell 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.140
 fortresses well and accordingly dungeons I 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.630
 already as I speak you can find the tag and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.540
 horse armor which can be diamond 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:56.700
 iron and gold also 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.989
 we are now riding out of it herself 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.650
 to go here we need like this 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.870
 ascend 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:11.859
 Yes, and then you can go to the left shift 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:15.609
 earlier it was also impossible in 162 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.459
 could add little zombies about you 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.570
 I will try to sleep 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:28.870
 all shoo from here such he is small 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:30.790
 very smart nasty this here and also 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.730
 there is the same in mop small 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:39.910
 svinozombi again with the same 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.739
 Only parameters that's even faster 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.940
 here is a lapis lazuli block 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.410
 it now has a different texture a bit 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.459
 eggs are calling run on water 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.470
 logo in earlier versions could not 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.920
 disappear sometimes 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.060
 what 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:03.060
 corrects and flint now he loses 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.060
 its strength when activated dynamite 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.850
 player hunger now 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:17.220
 taken away when regenerating health that 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:19.660
 change touched by the gameplay and by 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.590
 the program part is the main thing 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.480
 mark this texture pack now 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.250
 recycled into resource packs 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.470
 they now contain not only textures and 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.950
 sounds languages fonts and all this is possible 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.950
 change 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.410
 java 5 will also change it and 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.710
 now there is simply no if you have me 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.780
 again, update the necessary launcher 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.410
 can now load open jel without 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.820
 mistakes 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:57.460
 what was problematic in 15 improved 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:02.800
 performance and the interface itself became 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.360
 more user friendly also here 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.850
 when launching launcher 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.669
 now all libraries are downloaded 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.229
 server regardless if you have them or 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:17.520
 there are no them and it gives you the opportunity 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:23.110
 better and supporting game 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:26.310
 162 it goes more like a bug fix and removes 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.180
 magic rather than adding something new 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.729
 the only thing is to add these 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.820
 crayons zombies and horse are tamed now 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:40.000
 remembers who tamed her change then 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:44.070
 sprint now improved runaway 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.630
 respectively Polish fonts in 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:54.150
 resourcepack oh they look better now in 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:58.210
 servers in the 152 server list 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.539
 displayed as 1 and 3 such a small tank 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:07.580
 in fact, the principle is not critical 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:11.119
 Dup things on mules or donkeys was his 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.939
 fixed resurspack 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:16.159
 take part 1 of course it's a good thing 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.189
 but they crumbled and this too 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.319
 corrected 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.699
 Now it was impossible to change if you're on 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:26.270
 the horse was wearing armor 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.860
 then if you wanted to change it then it was 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.729
 impossible to do she just not 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.449
 opened horse inventory could be 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:37.159
 shifted blocks at 161 and choke that 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:40.399
 again did not add joy 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.539
 users could in hell forts 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.909
 didn't spawn 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.649
 and unreal already that is, if in new 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.949
 some yes our here everything is fine 

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:51.020
 It is in Persia 161 and if you found in 15 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.139
 fortress comrades sit down you could not 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.809
 just find there any mobs 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:01.149
 in 162 it was fixed so you can not 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:07:05.360
 worry that's about regards 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:07.969
 Changes 161 did not bring practically 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:12.789
 nothing he just prepared the cards for 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:14.569
 export to the upcoming version 17 and 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:19.939
 accordingly remained 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:25.039
 bug1 is not pleasant enough when the game 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:28.069
 running in windowed mode here and us 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:30.259
 need let's say download the game but 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:33.830
 when loading for when creating a new 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:35.870
 the world we are deploying the game and we 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:39.229
 just everything is shifted to the bottom left 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.719
 parts of the screen but let's agree here 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:45.379
 everything seems to be not very good 

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:47.839
 well, everything else is a color 

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:50.139
 of heaven it is cured of course just 

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:52.399
 collapse there is again deploy but 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:58.519
 as stated in the joke osadochek something 

00:07:52.399 --> 00:08:00.259
 stayed and on this all subscribe to 

00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:03.370
