just just just to the right of the track
and<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> side<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.510> drive

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and if we look to the side as we drive

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.500 
and if we look to the side as we drive
across<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.530> pad<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.510> suspension

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
across this first pad the suspension

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.790 
across this first pad the suspension
will<00:00:48.719> lower<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:49.820> but<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.809> really<00:00:52.590> good

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
will lower a bit but the really good

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340 
will lower a bit but the really good
part<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.660> second<00:00:55.140> pad

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
part is when you get to the second pad

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
part is when you get to the second pad
and<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.649> want<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.920> slow<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.030> can

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and you want to go slow so you can

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
and you want to go slow so you can
actually<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> lowering<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.710> once<00:00:58.890> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
actually see it lowering and once it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
actually see it lowering and once it
lowers<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.520> want<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> pause<00:00:59.940> the<00:00:59.969> game<00:01:00.420> go

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
over to photo mode and then you could

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.070 
over to photo mode and then you could
take<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.860> many<00:01:05.040> photos<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.850> want<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.930> can

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
see it's basically a street sweeper now

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.830 
see it's basically a street sweeper now
it's<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.990> low<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.729> low<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> bumper

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it's so low it's like so low the bumper

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's so low it's like so low the bumper
is<00:01:13.310> pretty<00:01:14.310> much<00:01:14.580> nearly<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.299> ground<00:01:15.860> the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
is pretty much nearly on the ground the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.219 
is pretty much nearly on the ground the
front<00:01:17.130> wheels<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.610> tucked<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.990> really

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
front wheels are tucked and it really

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.980 
front wheels are tucked and it really
allows<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.890> some<00:01:20.070> nice<00:01:20.670> nice<00:01:21.360> opportunities

when they do this is it doesn't work
quite<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.520> well<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:57.240> Reverse<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.110> actually

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
quite as well in Reverse if you actually

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.469 
quite as well in Reverse if you actually
go<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> back<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.250> towards<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> towards<00:02:00.420> the

pad<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.500> doesn't<00:02:01.950> work<00:02:02.040> quite<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.310> well<00:02:02.549> you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
pad it doesn't work quite as well you

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
pad it doesn't work quite as well you
see<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.000> suspension<00:02:03.479> doesn't<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.140> lower

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
see the suspension doesn't really lower

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.950 
see the suspension doesn't really lower
that<00:02:04.649> much<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.130> lowers<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> little<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that much it lowers a little bit but it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.380 
that much it lowers a little bit but it
doesn't<00:02:07.380> lower<00:02:07.590> quite<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.280> much<00:02:08.520> as<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.000> could

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
doesn't lower quite as much as it could

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.080 
doesn't lower quite as much as it could
and<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.920> actually<00:02:11.099> lowered<00:02:11.489> quite<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> bit

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and it actually lowered quite a bit

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
and it actually lowered quite a bit
there<00:02:12.300> though<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> had<00:02:13.050> actually<00:02:13.200> never

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
there though I had actually never

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.320 
there though I had actually never
tried<00:02:13.769> going<00:02:14.010> all<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> way<00:02:14.400> back<00:02:14.670> before<00:02:14.909> so

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
tried going all the way back before so

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.860 
tried going all the way back before so
maybe<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:16.409> know<00:02:16.500> maybe<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:18.060> could<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.750> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
maybe you know maybe you could do do it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.449 
maybe you know maybe you could do do it
that<00:02:19.080> way<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.560> actually<00:02:19.739> wanted<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.220> like

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
that way if you actually wanted to like

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.960 
that way if you actually wanted to like
if<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.700> wanted<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.959> at<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.379> Reverse<00:02:22.980> you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
if you wanted to go at it in Reverse you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.460 
if you wanted to go at it in Reverse you
could<00:02:24.150> actually<00:02:24.299> come<00:02:24.629> down<00:02:24.659> to<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.140> end

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
could actually come down to this end

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.729 
could actually come down to this end
wait<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.819> lower<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:28.260> pause<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
wait for it to lower and then pause the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.430 
wait for it to lower and then pause the
game<00:02:28.769> again<00:02:29.269> go<00:02:30.269> over<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.569> photo<00:02:30.780> mode<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:31.349> you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
game again go over to photo mode and you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.140 
game again go over to photo mode and you
could<00:02:31.590> actually<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:32.040> some<00:02:32.099> different<00:02:32.760> angles

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
could actually get some different angles

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.559 
could actually get some different angles
this<00:02:33.329> way<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.560> mean<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.610> decently

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
this way and I mean it's it's decently

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.140 
this way and I mean it's it's decently
slammed<00:02:37.049> it's<00:02:37.349> not<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:37.769> slammed<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.790> was<00:02:38.970> on

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
slammed it's not as slammed as it was on

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.030 
slammed it's not as slammed as it was on
the<00:02:39.239> other<00:02:39.360> side<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> mean<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.890> front

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
the other side but I mean the front

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.160 
the other side but I mean the front
wheels<00:02:41.280> are<00:02:41.640> kind<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.569> tucked<00:02:42.780> they're<00:02:43.019> not

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
wheels are kind of tucked they're not

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.390 
wheels are kind of tucked they're not
quite<00:02:43.409> as<00:02:43.440> tucked<00:02:43.769> as<00:02:43.890> they<00:02:44.010> were<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
quite as tucked as they were on the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.699 
quite as tucked as they were on the
other<00:02:44.519> side<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.909> I<00:02:45.030> said<00:02:45.269> but<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:46.170> works<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
other side like I said but it works the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.800 
other side like I said but it works the
best<00:02:47.010> if<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.579> drive<00:02:47.910> straight<00:02:48.299> across<00:02:48.629> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
best if you drive straight across the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.900 
best if you drive straight across the
from<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.170> side<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.069> other<00:02:50.220> pad<00:02:50.549> going

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
from this side to the other pad going

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.890 
from this side to the other pad going
slowly<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.910> pause<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.359> game<00:02:54.390> at<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
slowly and you pause the game at the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
slowly and you pause the game at the
exact<00:02:55.200> right<00:02:55.470> moment<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.340> hope<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.849> guys
