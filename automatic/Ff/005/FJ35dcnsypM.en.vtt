00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 I like this video you 're releasing now. 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.990
 that she flies a long time ago I think 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 cool because it has a mood between the beginning 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.320
 of the door is one thing I really 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:19.220
 It was changing with the coolest weather 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 thing that oil and I remember what 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.720
 maybe your opinion the polis programs 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.829
 launched the program 1234 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.540
 depends more on this but does not take 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.329
 be a great video in the games 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.680
 I just do not know if this fits today anymore. 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.390
 commercial of something that always 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.280
 always works everybody made a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.020
 commercial today were legal and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.309
 thinks it's very fun people 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 is in the fucking father with whom nobody 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.469
 also remembers the commercial of the g14 I think 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.100
 I have the vacuum recognition of the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.869
 will 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:11.150
 irani training with ball than can be 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.150
 the commercial will start cocaine 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.969
 it will subscribe a few pages to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.729
 Talk about scratch cards, I do not know, crazy. 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.140
 The week life we 're working on is 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.840
 call big luck 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.210
 basically it 's a manicure that is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.149
 alexandra cunha and joÃ£o a client taking 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.670
 the cotton and finding marks on the nails 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.409
 crazy show that says she's earned a 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.689
 because he found three marks on the nail 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.899
 of the client conceptually the people 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.520
 has developed a brand for this is always 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.740
 this type of lottery is marking this 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.670
 team is all about life then 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.330
 I returned the fingers have the knife and that the rafa 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.110
 to cut off the customer's fingers and 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.549
 the blood 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.920
 another reference we used also 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.840
 it was these television commercials that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.090
 are ipi zeradas the animations are very 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.159
 exaggerated are very cheesy even then 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.250
 here we use the after effects to 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.380
 and the forest is composed of elements 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.120
 of the then has the fingers have a bag of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.630
 money has the stalls have blood 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.500
 under each element of this animate 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.170
 separately are here I can 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.950
 removing the layers and you go 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.200
 seeing how the elements are separated 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.750
 visual here to make up after them 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.030
 brand in the program encourages you 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.290
 sets a first chicken frame is 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.150
 input and a frame come out that logo 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.139
 it was basically this way 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:47.299
 the bag falls appears the school knives 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.130
 the name of the 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.430
 fit your looks 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.540
 I'm deleting here to show another 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.630
 image is a help hand really is the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.310
 hand here as well as you can. 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.760
 to see that I 'm deleting her hand from the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.319
 picture I had to clean 34 frames myself 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.890
 I think this could save from the curse 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.600
 You'll see what I'm doing. 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.970
 very moving movement is very easy 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.340
 clean stop would be perfect only that 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.680
 Camera shakes but I think it's giving 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.080
 right doing or cleaning a lot here 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.640
 and so the book in photoshop 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.550
 A lot of people say that they did not do it. 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.160
 reflects on the expensive ball the ball does not come with 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.410
 this has to be equal to 4 and was the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.430
 Today's tutorial how I am me 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:48.010
 weekend up next to my the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:49.540
 antis then is how we school 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.060
 of the computer program he 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.489
 has to be exported in alpha 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.190
 that the background is transparent 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.620
 so the whole animation has bottom 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.230
 transparent then the video goes low 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.780
 as claimed video is underneath and 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.100
 animation on top with the bottom of them 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.380
 transparent then we can see 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.010
 the animation is what has underneath that is the 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.419
 video animation to be applied here but the 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.970
 color will be treated in question a show of mine 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.530
 best of jokes is just a joke just talk 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.060
 Now we have nothing there, will not we? 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.070
 Do you want to know to trust little or even 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.070
 enlarge the car of the audi sound crew 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.020
 neither do I believe that I did not see the end 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.190
 This is everyone's story. 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.750
 Brazil boy to spend the end of the day. 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.830
 novel that was doing what it wants 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.380
 to do in life I do not have time 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.540
 losing this law I can not do anything 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.930
 who is not afraid nothing has happened 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.280
 Strange I Only Here Will See You Your Business 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.920

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.140

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.310
 I already had acetone in the subtitles 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.070

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.980
