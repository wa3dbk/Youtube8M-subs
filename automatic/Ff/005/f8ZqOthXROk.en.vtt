that you want done you can move the

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.170 
that you want done you can move the
fuzziness<00:01:01.300> scale<00:01:01.720> up<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.170> down<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.760> idea<00:01:04.089> is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
fuzziness scale up and down the idea is

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.550 
fuzziness scale up and down the idea is
to<00:01:04.600> get<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.920> area<00:01:06.280> that<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.580> want<00:01:07.560> so

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.880 
to get the area that you want so
something<00:01:09.310> around<00:01:09.490> there<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.890> whenever

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
something around there and whenever

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.219 
something around there and whenever
you're<00:01:12.310> satisfied<00:01:12.910> with<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.780> click<00:01:14.020> OK<00:01:14.490> and

you're satisfied with it click OK and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.570 
you're satisfied with it click OK and
then<00:01:17.229> you'll<00:01:17.410> go<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.619> image<00:01:19.110> adjustments<00:01:20.110> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
then you'll go to image adjustments and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.040 
then you'll go to image adjustments and
color<00:01:21.580> balance<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:27.250> move<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.270> red<00:01:28.600> to<00:01:28.929> the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
color balance you move the red to the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.350 
color balance you move the red to the
right<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.460> can<00:01:30.610> move<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:30.880> as<00:01:30.970> much<00:01:31.179> as<00:01:31.330> you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
right you can move it as much as you

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.219 
right you can move it as much as you
want<00:01:31.690> um<00:01:32.789> like<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.940> directions<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.780> wrote<00:01:34.990> out

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
want um like the directions I wrote out

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.290 
want um like the directions I wrote out
say<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.619> can<00:01:35.979> do<00:01:36.130> more<00:01:36.640> than<00:01:36.850> one<00:01:37.030> pass

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
say you can do more than one pass

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.139 
say you can do more than one pass
remember<00:01:38.050> so<00:01:38.770> obviously<00:01:39.399> if<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.580> go<00:01:39.700> too<00:01:39.789> far

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
remember so obviously if you go too far

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.460 
remember so obviously if you go too far
but<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.420> main<00:01:40.569> thing<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.869> you<00:01:40.959> want<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.229> go<00:01:41.380> to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
but the main thing is you want to go to

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.740 
but the main thing is you want to go to
the<00:01:41.679> right<00:01:41.860> with<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.069> rad<00:01:42.369> and<00:01:43.300> you<00:01:43.479> want<00:01:43.690> to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
the right with the rad and you want to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
the right with the rad and you want to
go<00:01:43.899> left<00:01:44.709> with<00:01:44.920> magenta<00:01:45.489> and<00:01:45.580> yellow<00:01:45.670> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.870 

something<00:01:49.479> like<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:50.110> probably<00:01:52.440> and<00:01:53.880> just

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
something like that probably and just

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.389 
something like that probably and just
just<00:01:55.179> like<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.950> could<00:01:57.069> see<00:01:57.250> the

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
just like this so you could see the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.770 
just like this so you could see the
differences<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:59.619> is<00:01:59.679> the<00:02:00.310> original<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
differences this is the original and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.199 
differences this is the original and
this<00:02:01.899> is<00:02:02.050> after<00:02:02.470> obviously<00:02:03.399> much<00:02:04.330> better<00:02:06.209> okay

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
this is after obviously much better okay

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.249 
this is after obviously much better okay
so<00:02:07.270> now<00:02:07.539> I'm<00:02:07.629> going<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.840> show<00:02:07.959> you<00:02:07.989> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
so now I'm going to show you the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.770 
so now I'm going to show you the
alternate<00:02:09.160> method<00:02:09.550> first<00:02:10.390> thing<00:02:10.569> one<00:02:10.690> you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
alternate method first thing one you

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.949 
alternate method first thing one you
just<00:02:10.929> let<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.170> magnifying<00:02:11.709> glass<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.959> just

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
just let the magnifying glass and just

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.540 
just let the magnifying glass and just
keep<00:02:14.170> zooming<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:14.739> until<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> image<00:02:15.190> gets

keep zooming in until the image gets

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.880 
keep zooming in until the image gets
picked<00:02:15.849> pretty<00:02:16.150> pixelated<00:02:16.420> or<00:02:17.200> until<00:02:17.770> you're

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
picked pretty pixelated or until you're

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.770 
picked pretty pixelated or until you're
satisfied<00:02:18.069> with<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.060> about<00:02:19.360> good

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
satisfied with it this is about good

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.979 
satisfied with it this is about good
enough<00:02:19.959> maybe<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.379> little<00:02:20.500> closer<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:22.840> you're

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
enough maybe a little closer then you're

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.300 
enough maybe a little closer then you're
gonna<00:02:23.080> select<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.410> polygonal<00:02:23.770> lasso<00:02:23.920> tool

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
gonna select the polygonal lasso tool

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.470 
gonna select the polygonal lasso tool
right<00:02:24.790> here<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:27.910> right<00:02:28.120> click<00:02:28.150> to
