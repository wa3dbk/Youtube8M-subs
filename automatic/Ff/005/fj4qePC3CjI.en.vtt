reason<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:07.370> call<00:02:07.700> them<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.000> be<00:02:08.180> spades

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
reason that I call them to be spades

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.140 
reason that I call them to be spades
simply<00:02:08.869> because<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.590> has<00:02:09.740> one<00:02:10.040> joint<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.729> as

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
simply because it has one joint and as

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.560 
simply because it has one joint and as
two<00:02:11.900> inches<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:13.370> pieces<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.000> body<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.450> it's

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
two inches to pieces to the body so it's

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.710 
two inches to pieces to the body so it's
just<00:02:14.720> easier<00:02:15.050> to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
just easier to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.990 
just easier to
but<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.290> can<00:02:18.440> see<00:02:18.710> that<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.340> size<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.820> this

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
but you can see that the size of this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.480 
but you can see that the size of this
Bay<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.570> very<00:02:21.140> similar<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> lot<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.310> size

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
Bay is very similar to a lot of the size

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.210 
Bay is very similar to a lot of the size
of<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.270> fish<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.660> this<00:02:23.750> tank<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.320> see<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.920> think

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
of the fish in this tank I see you think

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.560 
of the fish in this tank I see you think
that<00:02:25.430> they<00:02:25.610> would<00:02:25.760> want<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.000> run<00:02:26.210> from<00:02:26.360> this

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
that they would want to run from this

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.320 
that they would want to run from this
baby<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:27.590> these<00:02:27.770> fish<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.520> curious<00:02:28.910> that

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
baby but these fish is so curious that

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.500 
baby but these fish is so curious that
you<00:02:30.170> throw<00:02:30.410> this<00:02:30.620> fade<00:02:30.860> out<00:02:31.100> there<00:02:31.370> I'll<00:02:32.300> let

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you throw this fade out there I'll let

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.630 
you throw this fade out there I'll let
it<00:02:32.540> sink<00:02:32.900> down<00:02:32.960> a<00:02:33.140> little<00:02:33.380> ways<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:34.310> can<00:02:34.430> see

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it sink down a little ways you can see

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.370 
it sink down a little ways you can see
is<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.330> don't<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.960> do<00:02:36.110> anything

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
is like this I don't have to do anything

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.500 
is like this I don't have to do anything
with<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.770> rod<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.820> bait<00:02:38.030> moves<00:02:38.270> back

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
with the rod and that bait moves back

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.280 
with the rod and that bait moves back
and<00:02:38.690> forth<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.160> see<00:02:40.430> how<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.820> draws

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
and forth but can you see how it draws

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.110 
and forth but can you see how it draws
every<00:02:42.290> single<00:02:42.680> fish<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.190> tank<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
every single fish in the tank to the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.050 
every single fish in the tank to the
speak<00:02:44.740> you<00:02:45.740> even<00:02:46.040> though<00:02:46.160> they<00:02:46.340> may<00:02:46.580> not<00:02:46.820> be

speak you even though they may not be
able<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.330> get<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.780> paper<00:02:48.050> out<00:02:48.230> because

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
able to get this paper out because

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.950 
able to get this paper out because
they're<00:02:48.920> not<00:02:49.070> very<00:02:49.250> big<00:02:49.490> the<00:02:50.240> larger<00:02:50.720> fish

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
they're not very big the larger fish

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.510 
they're not very big the larger fish
will<00:02:51.170> be<00:02:51.260> able<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> get<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.800> making<00:02:52.400> their

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
will be able to get this making their

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.210 
will be able to get this making their
mouth<00:02:53.020> but<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:54.290> can<00:02:54.440> see<00:02:54.800> when<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.040> thought

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
mouth but you can see when I thought

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.760 
mouth but you can see when I thought
about<00:02:55.460> that<00:02:55.820> draw<00:02:56.120> power<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.470> I'm<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.740> a

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
about that draw power so but I'm in a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.100 
about that draw power so but I'm in a
tournament<00:02:58.220> situation<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.150> I'm<00:02:59.240> looking<00:02:59.690> for

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
tournament situation and I'm looking for

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.250 
tournament situation and I'm looking for
those<00:03:00.320> larger<00:03:00.980> than<00:03:01.130> average<00:03:01.280> fish<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:03.170> I

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
those larger than average fish and I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.780 
those larger than average fish and I
don't<00:03:03.290> necessarily<00:03:03.590> woman<00:03:04.340> kitchen<00:03:04.640> because

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
don't necessarily woman kitchen because

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.520 
don't necessarily woman kitchen because
I<00:03:04.880> want<00:03:05.120> attachment<00:03:05.660> practice<00:03:06.080> because<00:03:06.350> then

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
I want attachment practice because then

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.690 
I want attachment practice because then
it's<00:03:06.680> harder<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.130> catch<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.400> during<00:03:07.580> the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
it's harder to catch a during the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.310 
it's harder to catch a during the
tournament<00:03:08.090> but<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.540> can<00:03:08.720> get<00:03:08.870> them<00:03:09.020> to<00:03:09.050> show

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
tournament but I can get them to show

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.040 
tournament but I can get them to show
themselves<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:11.150> throw<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.570> next<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.020> a

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
themselves I can throw this next to a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.260 
themselves I can throw this next to a
log<00:03:12.290> here<00:03:12.980> comes<00:03:13.220> an<00:03:13.370> eight<00:03:13.490> pounder<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:13.940> really

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
log here comes an eight pounder I really

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.670 
log here comes an eight pounder I really
really<00:03:14.630> quick<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:14.810> hit<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.110> away<00:03:15.290> from<00:03:15.500> them

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
really quick and hit it away from them
