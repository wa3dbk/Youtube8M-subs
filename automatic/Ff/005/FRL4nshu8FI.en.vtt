00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
preferably yeah and then a half block in

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.830 
preferably yeah and then a half block in
front<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.330> has<00:00:21.359> something<00:00:21.720> to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
second okay guys I got the mining carts

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.650 
second okay guys I got the mining carts
so<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:15.490> have<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.700> head<00:03:15.880> up<00:03:16.030> here<00:03:16.300> I<00:03:16.330> actually

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
so you have to head up here I actually

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.240 
so you have to head up here I actually
mess<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.620> little<00:03:18.010> bit<00:03:18.520> so<00:03:18.910> um<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:21.040> you

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
mess this up a little bit so um if you

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.130 
mess this up a little bit so um if you
guys<00:03:21.460> are<00:03:21.760> doing<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.150> remember<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.810> correct

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
guys are doing this remember to correct

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.950 
guys are doing this remember to correct
this<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:23.920> needs<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.340> come<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.600> there's<00:03:25.900> a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
this this needs to come so there's a

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.780 
this this needs to come so there's a
block<00:03:26.290> over<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:27.580> they<00:03:27.730> drop<00:03:28.060> here

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
block over this and then they drop here

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.220 
block over this and then they drop here
on<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.500> basically<00:03:32.680> build<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:34.230> do

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
on to that and so basically build a do

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.490 
on to that and so basically build a do
the<00:03:35.410> usual<00:03:35.590> build<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.220> barrier<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:38.350> it'll

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
the usual build the barrier so it'll

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.960 
the usual build the barrier so it'll
drop<00:03:38.710> down<00:03:39.150> have<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.270> like<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:43.170> actually

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
drop down have it like that and actually

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.390 
drop down have it like that and actually
you<00:03:45.970> should<00:03:46.180> probably<00:03:46.350> have<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.530> have<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.160> like

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
you should probably have it have it like

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.840 
you should probably have it have it like
this<00:03:48.670> just<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.180> be<00:03:49.300> sure<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:50.850> that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
this just to be sure that the that

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.340 
this just to be sure that the that
you're<00:03:52.060> mine<00:03:52.360> carts<00:03:52.750> won't<00:03:52.930> get<00:03:53.080> like<00:03:53.230> all

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
you're mine carts won't get like all

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.190 
you're mine carts won't get like all
messed<00:03:53.650> up<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.040> stuff<00:03:54.310> when<00:03:54.610> they<00:03:54.730> come<00:03:54.940> down

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
messed up and stuff when they come down

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.330 
messed up and stuff when they come down
so<00:03:56.200> they<00:03:56.320> have<00:03:56.470> like<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.680> straight<00:03:57.010> thing<00:03:57.220> to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
so they have like a straight thing to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:06.449 
so they have like a straight thing to
come<00:03:57.520> down<00:03:57.730> into<00:03:59.700> okay<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:05.130> messed<00:04:06.130> up<00:04:06.280> over

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
come down into okay I messed up over

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.590 
come down into okay I messed up over
here<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.790> little<00:04:06.940> bit<00:04:07.590> that's<00:04:08.590> fine<00:04:09.480> then<00:04:10.480> you

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
here a little bit that's fine then you

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.570 
here a little bit that's fine then you
can<00:04:10.720> also<00:04:10.840> use<00:04:11.140> these<00:04:11.350> blocks<00:04:11.740> if<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.160> want<00:04:12.340> to

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
can also use these blocks if you want to

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.620 
can also use these blocks if you want to
like<00:04:13.980> actually<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.220> think<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.430> need<00:04:15.490> this<00:04:15.730> you

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
like actually I think I need this you

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.010 
like actually I think I need this you
wanted<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.900> hide<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.470> or<00:04:18.430> whatever<00:04:18.840> we<00:04:19.840> could

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
wanted to hide it or whatever we could

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.190 
wanted to hide it or whatever we could
have<00:04:20.170> it<00:04:20.320> like<00:04:20.470> that<00:04:20.500> or<00:04:22.050> something<00:04:23.050> like<00:04:23.140> that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
have it like that or something like that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.820 
have it like that or something like that
so<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.890> don't<00:04:24.040> have<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.190> look<00:04:24.310> at<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:24.840> anyway

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
so you don't have to look at it anyway

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.029 
so you don't have to look at it anyway
so<00:04:27.460> now<00:04:28.300> we<00:04:28.360> have<00:04:28.689> this<00:04:29.139> here<00:04:29.439> and<00:04:29.680> we<00:04:29.740> need<00:04:29.889> to

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
so now we have this here and we need to

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:35.159 
so now we have this here and we need to
throw<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.669> mining<00:04:31.120> cards<00:04:31.449> in<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:35.050> come

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
throw the mining cards in and so we come

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.679 
throw the mining cards in and so we come
up<00:04:35.319> here<00:04:37.949> and<00:04:38.949> you<00:04:39.909> have<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.120> put<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.270> powered
