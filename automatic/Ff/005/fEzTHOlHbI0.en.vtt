00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.609
 all classes including in formula 1 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.949
 and in the limo 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 today he turns in the kitzbühel valley 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.660
 few rounds with the new golf 7 for 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.269
 motion briefly the endangered on offroad 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 trimmed the sport mode turned on 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.520
 and here we go, jackie is right in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.860
 his element and brings everything from the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
 new wolfsburger allrader raus that goes 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 easily there by the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.399
 further development of the for motion system 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.810
 with a Haldex clutch generation 5 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.460
 hardly slip occurs 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.830
 in curves helps above all the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.570
 Steering rear axle in addition 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.210
 stability exists 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.860
 after a few kilometers over ice snow 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.260
 and mud is jacky ickx one 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.890
 first opinion about the golf before motion 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.890
 can be 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.390
 surely golf is a legendary one 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.910
 car this one has a four-wheel system 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.810
 that's his very smart thing 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:24.080
 decent as well is a new alex 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:33.770
 five clutch built the an extra 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:37.310
 I myself had a lot of fun 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.560
 very grateful to him on this route 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.660
 to drive because here shows up 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.700
 what an all-wheel-drive translation 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.410
 of course with the corresponding tires 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.420
 but with this system life goes 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:02:03.619
 With this car you can go to any place 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:06.140
 on the backwaters brand one over 110 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.450
 kilowatts and a capacity of 2 liters 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.229
 one can assume well over that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.180
 to come to the mountain 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.700
 on average, our test car consumes 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.370
 thanks to cylinder deactivation and 5 liters 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.280
 diesel in jacky ickx driving style are 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.120
 like 7 liters apropos 6 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.819
 yakin 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.379
 our test driver feels the new four-wheel drive 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.420
 system continues on the tooth and 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.670
 safely manipulates his golf through the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.510
 meanwhile we devote ourselves to that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.950
 outer and that's what he looked like before jackie 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.950
 for a test drive through locations 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.460
 at the rear, golf and for motion 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.820
 Emblems on the properties of our 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.730
 test car towards the rear bumper 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.590
 are a wide black plastic 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.470
 summit and fog lights 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.290
 Integrates the third brake light 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.480
 is max Pohl 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:12.490
 the luggage compartment holds 340 liters works 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:14.650
 you go back to the bench around 1230 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.210
 on the test track shows up with rx 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.400
 continue in his element 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.350
 a fatigue warning, he will probably 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.420
 do not need the there is in the 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.580
 equipment variants comfortline and 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.340
 highline as standard and warns the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.480
 driver with decreasing concentration 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.480
 with an acoustic signal 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.400
 the interior of the room looks dark, too 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.680
 material and processing are correct 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.299
 the tone here makes the color and ds 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.299
 99 percent black 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.810
 riders are allowed to sit on the rear 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.810
 Be happy about generous legroom 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.520
 after a few turns over snow and ice 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.650
 jacky ickx even a few 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.400
 Safety tips for the goods were on 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.400
 slippery underground 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.350
 So with these weathers like snow 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.070
 or ice, there is only one rule 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.990
 slower and be extremely careful 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.949
 is rauffahren is simple shutdown 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.780
 a little heavier 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:37.360
 Above all, it is a measure 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:38.949
 Sensibility ahead I can get here 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.740
 not like on a normal street 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:45.750
 You have to drive cool and reserved 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.750
 then you have no problems synonymous
