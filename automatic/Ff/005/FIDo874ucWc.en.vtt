00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello friends how are you in this video you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.649
 I'm going to give those basics to have a 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.019
 beautiful hair these basic ones such 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.059
 Once we have a bad habit at the moment of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.160
 wash our hair to treat our 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 good hair I'm going to tell you those 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.369
 basic steps that we have to do to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.289
 have healthy hair, beautiful hair 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.240
 and I'm going to start with the shampoo what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.480
 would happen if I tell you that only 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.760
 you need the size of an almond 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.130
 shampoo to wash our hair if a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.079
 tiny amount not the amount anymore or 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 least has been from this line of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.360
 your finger to the tip is what we need 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 to wash our hair and many 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 Sometimes the mistake many make me 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.809
 I include also is that we use 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.430
 enough amount of shampoo to apply 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.280
 our hair says that for us 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.379
 wash our hair better and be very 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.510
 clean if it's true 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.730
 the shampoo is designed for that the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.070
 shampoo is designed to wash our 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.410
 hair but if we do it excessively what 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.150
 what we are doing is also washing 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.520
 those oils 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.500
 are essential for hair to have 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.110
 shine so hair does not dry out 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.420
 too much so you have to use the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.480
 amount of an almond or as you already 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.980
 I said this we use this crime and the 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.920
 hairline that we have here from the hairline 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.050
 is at the tip is what we need from 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.120
 just shampoo to wash our 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.200
 We are going to put our hair 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.450
 let's face about two or three 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.520
 seconds between our among our 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.160
 hands and then we apply it in our 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.170
 hair from the root to the tip of the root 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.550
 to the point in the case of women 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.110
 Well, it's going to be a little more complicated 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.000
 because you have to give long hair 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.520
 no but of men it is the same 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.430
 process you rub it 23 seconds in your hand 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.100
 and from the root to the tip and that 's it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.700
 we leave about 30 to 40 seconds in our 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.160
 hair and rinse it then we continue 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.229
 with what the conditioner is before 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.570
 apply your conditioner you have to 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.400
 Dry your hair do not take it out 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.229
 completely but you have to remove the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.540
 excess water that has remained in your 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.759
 hair after you applied the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.440
 shampoo and you changed it because you have to 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.940
 dry your hair you have to remove the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.940
 excess water that remains 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.530
 the hair completely then apply 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.030
 this conditioner because you have to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.220
 remove excess water from our 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.160
 hair before the conditioner by the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.200
 simple reason that if 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.390
 you apply your conditioner on that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.210
 hair with excess water are 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.580
 diluting the effect that has to be the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.860
 conditioner that is moisturizing and 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.260
 strengthen your hair so that you have to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.600
 Dry the water completely and apply the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.130
 conditioner and give it time to give 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.900
 time to the conditioner the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.820
 conditioner will not work with 30 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.610
 seconds to the conditioner you have to 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.670
 leave approximately 23 minutes 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.490
 in your hair so that it penetrates and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.490
 hydrate your hair perfectly once 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.740
 that you have already applied the conditioner to 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.860
 your hair and it's been 23 seconds 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.100
 then if it continues to rinse you but 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.620
 Rinse it with cold water or warm water 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.480
 never never never from the nuncas 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.590
 rinses with hot water and water 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.810
 hot what you do is going to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.570
 wither and it will resect you much more 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.440
 always apply the condition and remove 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.320
 the conditioner 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.750
 to your hair with warm water or cold water 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.200
 that's going to be a big difference in your 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.200
 hair 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.570
 once you go to pull out your hair 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.940
 you rub it does not grab is the towel and you 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.670
 You go around like that everywhere, not the 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.400
 buds treat it delicately grabs the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.050
 towel and dry the west giving you 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.420
 taps with the towel all over the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.080
 hair this way your hair does not go 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.690
 to create the frizz well those ruffled hairs 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.700
 everywhere not the frizz many times 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.530
 we caused it by the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.870
 way we treat the hair when drying 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.900
 we did not grab the quickie towel and 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.079
 we do well and they make the hair 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.180
 produce the frizz and at the same time 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.519
 withering that break and mistreating it 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.420
 so do not rub your hair, tantalize it 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.579
 delicacy 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.019
 if you're one of those girls or those guys that 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.269
 They have long hair and they like it 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.849
 brush then look for a brush with 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.129
 the bristles the bristles or the teeth like 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.379
 they call it is a little separated and I'll 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.940
 Do you do the brushes if you give them 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.769
 brush with a brush that has the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.259
 bristles very close what are you doing 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.840
 is to tear the hair in a certain way 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.639
 putting strength and you will fall more 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.729
 so look for a brush that has the 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.810
 very separate bristles and comb you what 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.419
 as usual 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.130
 now to finalize the products 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.570
 that you use on your hair in the way 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.520
 that you apply them have a lot to do 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.650
 many times in the case of men 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.229
 We take the jen or the ointment that we 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.240
 we put it on like that and we put it on 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.760
 everywhere do not take your time either 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.639
 to comb it takes you do not do a little bit 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.580
 and from the tip upwards of the roots 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.009
 from the root to the tip forgiveness always with 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.860
 delicacy you never have to do it towards 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.599
 crazy because what you're doing is 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.080
 mistreat your hair the girls what 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.470
 have 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.349
 subus 0 in the argan oil or what 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.240
 always put on very delicately 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.039
 always half of the hair to the 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.139
 tip or if you have dry hair then 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.319
 the root to the tip but never anything else 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.229
 be it the menso to the crazy thing those are not 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:20.199
 problems that can bring so that 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.210
 our hair look ugly 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.909
 messy look with frizz so that 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.189
 these are basic basics the most basic 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.210
 that you have to know to treat 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.699
