00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.390
 when 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.349
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.070
 my youtube channel to another 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.919
 film about the dji phantom quadrocopter 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.970
 or how loving my anglicisms 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:25.239
 The job center would say yes 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.059
 this time it should be about the batteries 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.200
 The lithium polymer batteries with those of the 

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.439
 copter is operated 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.790
 one is there by default 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.920
 flight time with such a battery 2200 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.350
 he has the milliah here 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.110
 Depending on how hot or cold it is 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.450
 It's about seven outside when it's cold 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.370
 up to ten minutes and at temperatures 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.270
 over 10 degrees 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.579
 yes so 10 to a maximum of maybe 13 14 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.489
 minutes, of course, also dependent 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.790
 little of the flight maneuvers you do 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.700
 flies who wants to fly longer 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.820
 He has to change the battery 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.880
 of course not in flight but must 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.640
 so stop and then one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.460
 Replacement battery a tree a spare battery in 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.470
 use acoustically use the turnkey 2.2 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.810
 She wants to give you a quick look today 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.970
 introduce and also tell you why me 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.970
 I opted for these batteries 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.940
 if your extra battery is buying it 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.900
 you want to have in here right now 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.170
 Germany actually has three options 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.390
 first option is the original battery of 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:51.220
 to buy dji again 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.690
 the currently costs soja 27 28 euro and 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.570
 is synonymous with everything 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.229
 what we of course for the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.080
 Atom quadrocopter needs a second 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.160
 alternative there are batteries of 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.190
 sls are qualitatively very good 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.850
 However, no xc60 connection that is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.330
 this connection here with this xc60 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.450
 Connection is the battery with the 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.070
 charger connected and also with the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.489
 Of course, you know that when you know 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.550
 have flown with it and this one 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.850
 exactly this xc60 connection has just 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.489
 the sls battery light of the there are kids 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.530
 where such a connection with it is 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.000
 but then you have to own the first 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.070
 Solder firmly so they are stuck here 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.390
 soldered and then shrink with a 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.400
 also provided and accordingly so here 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.440
 yes sealed that's a bit 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.840
 Work who is not afraid of the work and 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.269
 according to soldering iron and the like 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.330
 Home has the can such a kit 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.989
 order with an additional xc60 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.750
 connection and then yes such a sms 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:07.670
 buy battery for about 25 euros 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.630
 Personally , I was in favor of it 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.920
 this turnkey 2.2 batteries decided because 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.350
 here is an xc60 connection directly 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.940
 and also the second connection of the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.299
 Bellenzer connection is available here 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.450
 and also direct fit for the dji 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.410
 phantom charger from the performance data 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.350
 here is the turnkey 2.2 battery almost 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.090
 identical to the original phantom battery 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.670
 it a bit more powerful even 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.910
 even in the tips what the unload 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.660
 concerned 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.300
 otherwise but relatively otherwise 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.710
 identical values the design is one 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.550
 a little different that I show 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.150
 now times if you have the two batteries 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.000
 direct comparison then you notice 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.700
 that the left one is about the same 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.840
 However, the turner jacko is such a 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.400
 a bit higher 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.490
 that does not matter much there 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.190
 battery compartment in the theory phantom 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:09.180
 quadrocopter so that has no problems 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.370
 Also the width of the two batteries is in 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.180
 The turner jacko is about the same 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.520
 a bit wider 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.090
 But that is not a problem because he fits 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.910
 also wonderful in the head in there 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.070
 Of course I would like that in the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.400
 Practice demonstrating here you see 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.070
 turner the 2.2 battery and fits here 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.930
 very easy in there is even right and 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.370
 on the left a little bit more space 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.330
 there is still plenty of space left 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.100
 So it fits wonderful thing in the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.880
 the two batteries clearly 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.970
 differ is the length of the cable 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.340
 the phantom battery is of course exactly 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.250
 for the d and i phantom quadrocopter 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.520
 So you see, here are quite short 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.850
 the turner cable is the acute one 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.860
 also thought for other victims and has 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.220
 With it a little more leeway 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.620
 the cables are in the flap of the 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.169
 quadrocopter ours the phantom 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.660
 Quadrocopter is therefore something more 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.160
 to stow cable who ever 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.690
 he knows that anyway 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.330
 is a voluntary matter and 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.630
 that's really the only downside 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.580
 to this törn jacko you must therefore 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.580
 Stow a little more cable 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.090
 However, that is also feasible and with 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.370
 a little exercise no problem 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.460
 due to the slightly longer cable 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.770
 and the sea ​​of packaging weighs 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.300
 turner jacko also something more 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.240
 the original phantom aco is included 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.460
 175 grams and the door 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:49.910
 g2 battery is at 193 grams so about 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.849
 810 grams more not the world but it 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.139
 should be mentioned 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:58.520
 In conclusion, one can say that 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:01.250
 turner the 2.2 batteries for the dsi phantom 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.770
 Quadrocopters are a real recommendation 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.930
 I have my say on ebay 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.970
 bought for 18 euros and a few 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.860
 Crushed there you can not complain 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.669
 from there my recommendation to you the 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.370
 thermal 2.2 batteries and if you like that 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.919
 film should have fallen thumb then 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.599
 subscribe me up and write 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:23.050
 me a nice comments below 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.050
 the movie
