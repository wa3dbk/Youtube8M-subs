winter in the southern hemisphere it's
been<00:00:15.750> pretty<00:00:15.929> cold<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.550> challenge

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
been pretty cold but the challenge

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.050 
been pretty cold but the challenge
basically<00:00:18.350> was<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.770> construct<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.490> layer<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.880> 9

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
basically was to construct a layer in 9

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.810 
basically was to construct a layer in 9
cubic<00:00:21.539> inches<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.369> this<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:23.670> I've<00:00:23.789> come

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
cubic inches and this is what I've come

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.870 
cubic inches and this is what I've come
up<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.660> short<00:00:25.199> video<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.710> show<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.920> what

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
up with a short video to show you what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.990 
up with a short video to show you what
it<00:00:27.000> does<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> bit<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.220> was

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it does and what it's all a bit I was

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.370 
it does and what it's all a bit I was
lucky<00:00:30.240> enough<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> fleet<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.109> Hong

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
lucky enough to have a fleet of Hong

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.340 
lucky enough to have a fleet of Hong
Kong<00:00:31.560> tram<00:00:31.830> cars<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.630> hadn't<00:00:33.630> built<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
Kong tram cars that I hadn't built a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.709 
Kong tram cars that I hadn't built a
layer<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.070> yet<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:36.000> literally<00:00:36.239> daunting

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
layer for as yet as literally daunting

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.840 
layer for as yet as literally daunting
so<00:00:36.930> he's<00:00:37.590> provided<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> perfect<00:00:38.640> opportunity

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so he's provided the perfect opportunity

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
so he's provided the perfect opportunity
to<00:00:39.920> provide<00:00:41.149> something<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.920> up

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to provide something that I can get up

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.940 
to provide something that I can get up
to<00:00:44.070> run<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.030> also<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> fun<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.530> well

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.310 

used<00:00:51.500> photo<00:00:52.500> backdrops<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.399> I've<00:00:54.079> found<00:00:55.079> on

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
used photo backdrops that I've found on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.310 
used photo backdrops that I've found on
the<00:00:55.760> internet<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:58.579> some<00:00:59.579> other<00:01:00.320> appropriate

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
the internet and some other appropriate

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.969 
the internet and some other appropriate
signage<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:03.530> decorate<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> layer<00:01:05.510> and<00:01:06.799> we<00:01:07.799> can

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
signage to decorate the layer and we can

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.060 
signage to decorate the layer and we can
show<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:10.860> actually<00:01:11.189> operates<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.760> well<00:01:13.070> very

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
show it actually operates as well very

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:44.660 
show it actually operates as well very
basically<00:01:14.670> though<00:01:15.049> so<00:01:16.049> let's<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> go

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.639 

the<00:01:45.670> operations<00:01:46.270> through<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.990> double<00:01:47.439> pole

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
the operations through to double pole

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.109 
the operations through to double pole
double<00:01:47.679> throw<00:01:48.009> switches<00:01:48.460> which<00:01:48.880> are<00:01:51.119> all

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
double throw switches which are all

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.690 
double throw switches which are all
manually<00:01:52.479> driven<00:01:53.039> I'm<00:01:54.039> not<00:01:54.340> at<00:01:54.460> all<00:01:54.549> that

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
manually driven I'm not at all that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.940 
manually driven I'm not at all that
technique<00:01:55.210> for<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.479> electrical<00:01:56.200> savvy<00:01:56.649> so

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
technique for the electrical savvy so

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.919 
technique for the electrical savvy so
this<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.700> fairly<00:01:57.970> basic<00:01:58.270> arrangement<00:01:58.630> that

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
this is a fairly basic arrangement that

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:05.700 
this is a fairly basic arrangement that
I've<00:01:59.049> come<00:01:59.259> up<00:01:59.380> with

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.100 

and<00:02:06.710> that's<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.430> birdie<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.209> hope<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.810> enjoyed

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
and that's a birdie so hope you enjoyed

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.780 
and that's a birdie so hope you enjoyed
it<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:10.510> happy<00:02:11.510> modelling
