a<00:01:23.110> round<00:01:23.740> shaped<00:01:24.100> object<00:01:25.710> now<00:01:26.710> next<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:29.020> show

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
a round shaped object now next is I show

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.720 
a round shaped object now next is I show
you<00:01:29.950> how<00:01:30.490> we<00:01:30.550> use<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:32.710> eye<00:01:32.890> level<00:01:33.190> technique

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
you how we use this eye level technique

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.250 
you how we use this eye level technique
while<00:01:34.660> making<00:01:34.960> any<00:01:35.320> round<00:01:36.100> shaped<00:01:36.570> object<00:01:37.570> I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
while making any round shaped object I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:45.090 
while making any round shaped object I
take<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.100> case<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.360> glass<00:01:40.600> right<00:01:44.100> for

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
take the case of a glass right for

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.720 
take the case of a glass right for
example<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.710> is<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:47.860> glass<00:01:48.390> kept<00:01:49.390> on<00:01:50.730> the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
example this is a glass kept on the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.820 
example this is a glass kept on the
dining<00:01:52.090> table<00:01:53.370> then<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.610> top<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.540> glass

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
dining table then the top of the glass

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:08.160 
dining table then the top of the glass
may<00:01:56.830> appear<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.960> match<00:01:59.260> or<00:02:01.350> oval<00:02:02.350> shaped

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.059 

say<00:02:08.740> this<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.160> top<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:10.319> am<00:02:11.319> relating<00:02:11.890> this

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
say this is the top I am relating this

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.290 
say this is the top I am relating this
top<00:02:12.400> with<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.890> when<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:14.920> comes<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.459> the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
top with this and when it comes to the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.320 
top with this and when it comes to the
lower<00:02:16.450> part<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.110> glass<00:02:17.980> then<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.940> will<00:02:19.150> be

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
lower part of this glass then it will be

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:29.770 
lower part of this glass then it will be
more<00:02:19.630> round<00:02:22.560> than<00:02:23.560> this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.490 

I<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:30.500> relate<00:02:30.770> this<00:02:31.270> shape<00:02:32.270> with<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.170> level

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
I can relate this shape with this level

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.640 
I can relate this shape with this level
basically<00:02:34.250> gradually<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.450> going<00:02:35.720> down

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
basically gradually it is going down

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.410 
basically gradually it is going down
right<00:02:37.540> gradually<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:38.660> going<00:02:38.960> down<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:43.420> say

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
right gradually it is going down so say

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.210 
right gradually it is going down so say
here<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.350> visibility<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.480> 40%<00:02:48.220> gradually

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
here the visibility is 40% gradually

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.190 
here the visibility is 40% gradually
when<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.520> goes<00:02:49.670> down<00:02:49.960> visibility<00:02:50.960> visibility

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
when it goes down visibility visibility

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.910 
when it goes down visibility visibility
increases<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.760> say<00:02:53.180> 50%<00:02:53.600> or<00:02:54.430> 60%<00:02:56.110> right<00:02:57.110> same

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
increases to say 50% or 60% right same

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.810 
increases to say 50% or 60% right same
way<00:02:58.100> if<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.880> glass<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.810> kept<00:03:00.530> on<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.830> center

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
way if the glass is kept on the center

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.630 
way if the glass is kept on the center
table<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.390> center<00:03:03.230> table<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:03.650> definitely<00:03:04.190> and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
table and center table is definitely and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.990 
table and center table is definitely and
then<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.750> top<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.740> the<00:03:07.220> center<00:03:07.580> table<00:03:07.730> is

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
then the top of the center table is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.160 
then the top of the center table is
always<00:03:09.430> lower<00:03:10.430> than<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.850> top<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.870> dining

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
always lower than the top of the dining

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.920 
always lower than the top of the dining
table<00:03:12.700> then<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.910> will<00:03:14.120> appear<00:03:16.270> this<00:03:17.270> much<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
table then it will appear this much the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.720 
table then it will appear this much the
top<00:03:18.080> will<00:03:18.260> appear<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.680> much<00:03:18.860> when<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.160> when

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
top will appear this much when it when

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.180 
top will appear this much when it when
it<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:20.030> kept<00:03:20.270> on<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.480> center<00:03:20.900> table<00:03:24.190> then

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
it is kept on the center table then

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.810 
it is kept on the center table then
again<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:26.000> base<00:03:26.240> of<00:03:26.480> this<00:03:26.720> will<00:03:27.350> be<00:03:27.820> more

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
again the base of this will be more

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.940 
again the base of this will be more
wrong<00:03:29.680> then

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.180 

the<00:03:34.460> top<00:03:35.500> here<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.940> top<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.690> can<00:03:39.260> relate<00:03:39.890> with

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
the top here the top I can relate with

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.320 
the top here the top I can relate with
this<00:03:41.150> level<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.319> pace<00:03:42.880> with<00:03:43.880> this<00:03:44.090> level

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
this level in the pace with this level

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:50.040 
this level in the pace with this level
if<00:03:44.600> it<00:03:44.990> is<00:03:46.000> 50%<00:03:47.590> then<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.860> base<00:03:49.069> would<00:03:49.310> be

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
if it is 50% then the base would be

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.570 
if it is 50% then the base would be
around<00:03:51.050> 70<00:03:51.590> or<00:03:51.680> 75%<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:53.770> take<00:03:54.770> one<00:03:54.980> more<00:03:55.160> example

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
around 70 or 75% I take one more example

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.890 
around 70 or 75% I take one more example
if<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:57.350> glass<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.620> kept<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.520> flow<00:04:01.900> then

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
if the glass is kept on the flow then

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.070 
if the glass is kept on the flow then
the<00:04:03.200> top<00:04:03.739> will<00:04:04.610> be<00:04:04.790> more<00:04:05.030> wrong<00:04:05.270> even<00:04:05.900> than

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
the top will be more wrong even than

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:14.080 
the top will be more wrong even than
this<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:10.250> base<00:04:12.519> could<00:04:13.519> be<00:04:13.700> more<00:04:13.880> wrong

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
this and the base could be more wrong

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.470 
this and the base could be more wrong
maybe<00:04:14.989> 200<00:04:15.470> percent<00:04:15.830> I<00:04:16.040> can<00:04:17.030> relate<00:04:17.329> this

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
maybe 200 percent I can relate this

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.140 
maybe 200 percent I can relate this
level<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:19.570> say<00:04:20.570> this<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.900> 70<00:04:21.290> percent<00:04:21.650> and

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
level to this say this is 70 percent and

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:37.010 
level to this say this is 70 percent and
the<00:04:23.150> pace<00:04:24.490> could<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.720> 100<00:04:26.720> percent<00:04:30.730> right

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.909 

here<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:38.460> visibility<00:04:38.940> 70%<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.780> top<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.470> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
here the visibility 70% of top and the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.279 
here the visibility 70% of top and the
visibility<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:42.030> base<00:04:42.539> is<00:04:42.810> hundred

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
visibility of the base is hundred

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.240 
visibility of the base is hundred
percent<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.610> this<00:04:45.599> is<00:04:45.750> when<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.770> kept<00:04:47.069> on

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
percent so this is when it is kept on

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.869 
percent so this is when it is kept on
the<00:04:48.349> dining<00:04:49.349> table<00:04:51.319> this<00:04:52.319> is<00:04:52.500> when<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.490> kept

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
the dining table this is when it is kept

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.770 
the dining table this is when it is kept
on<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.440> center<00:04:55.440> table<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:56.389> this<00:04:57.389> is<00:04:57.569> in<00:04:57.690> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
on the center table and this is in a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.369 
on the center table and this is in a
case<00:04:57.960> when<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.289> is<00:04:58.409> kept<00:04:58.979> on<00:04:59.129> the<00:04:59.479> ground<00:05:02.360> wrong

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
case when it is kept on the ground wrong

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.460 
case when it is kept on the ground wrong
right<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:06.090> is<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.449> way<00:05:06.599> things<00:05:07.289> are

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
right so this is the way things are

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.980 
right so this is the way things are
handled<00:05:08.180> keeping<00:05:09.180> high<00:05:09.659> levels<00:05:10.199> in<00:05:10.349> mind<00:05:10.620> and

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
handled keeping high levels in mind and

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.680 
handled keeping high levels in mind and
handling<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.139> shapes<00:05:13.380> properly<00:05:13.919> in<00:05:14.389> the<00:05:15.389> next

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
handling the shapes properly in the next

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.770 
handling the shapes properly in the next
class<00:05:15.900> I'll<00:05:16.650> teach<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.610> how<00:05:17.789> to<00:05:18.030> handle<00:05:18.479> these

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
class I'll teach you how to handle these

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.850 
class I'll teach you how to handle these
ovals<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.800> circles<00:05:20.610> with<00:05:21.479> technique<00:05:21.900> because

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
ovals and circles with technique because

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.200 
ovals and circles with technique because
directly<00:05:23.400> if<00:05:23.580> we<00:05:23.750> draw<00:05:24.750> these<00:05:25.050> ovals<00:05:25.440> maybe

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
directly if we draw these ovals maybe

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.709 
directly if we draw these ovals maybe
students<00:05:28.759> at<00:05:29.759> times<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.300> have<00:05:30.509> seen

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
students at times I have seen

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.149 
students at times I have seen
instruments<00:05:31.229> are<00:05:31.319> not<00:05:31.349> able<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.770> make<00:05:32.009> the

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
instruments are not able to make the

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.610 
instruments are not able to make the
words<00:05:32.370> properly<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:33.509> shapes<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:34.020> these<00:05:34.259> ovals

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
words properly the shapes of these ovals

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.570 
words properly the shapes of these ovals
are<00:05:34.800> not<00:05:34.979> accurate

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
are not accurate

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.119 
are not accurate
many<00:05:35.969> a<00:05:36.060> times<00:05:36.300> or<00:05:36.830> whether<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:37.979> is<00:05:38.099> your

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
many a times or whether it is your

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.510 
many a times or whether it is your
circle<00:05:38.759> or<00:05:38.940> oval<00:05:39.479> shapes<00:05:40.409> do<00:05:41.009> not<00:05:41.190> come<00:05:41.400> out

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
circle or oval shapes do not come out

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.610 
circle or oval shapes do not come out
accurate<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.599> I<00:05:42.630> have<00:05:43.050> different<00:05:43.259> techniques

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
accurate so I have different techniques

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.890 
accurate so I have different techniques
how<00:05:44.009> to<00:05:44.069> handle<00:05:44.490> these<00:05:44.669> ovals<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.389> circles

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
how to handle these ovals and circles

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.930 
how to handle these ovals and circles
that<00:05:46.409> that<00:05:47.009> I'll<00:05:47.190> teach<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.520> in<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.699> next
