00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.889 
pdw-57 with the suppressor and the
quick-draw<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.540> bit<00:00:36.630> about<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
quick-draw but a little bit about the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.450 
quick-draw but a little bit about the
gameplay<00:00:37.140> first<00:00:37.620> before<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.160> into<00:00:38.340> my

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
gameplay first before we get into my

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.010 
gameplay first before we get into my
favorite<00:00:38.820> weapon<00:00:39.149> attachments<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
favorite weapon attachments and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.130 
favorite weapon attachments and
everything<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> weapon<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.989> for<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
everything for the weapon but for the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.319 
everything for the weapon but for the
gameplay<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> hard<00:00:44.399> point<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.820> raid<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
gameplay it is a hard point on raid I

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.830 
gameplay it is a hard point on raid I
think<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.289> go<00:00:46.440> twenty<00:00:46.950> two<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.219> two<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.690> it's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
think I go twenty two and two so it's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.520 
think I go twenty two and two so it's
not<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> greatest<00:00:49.440> game<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:51.440> recorded<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
not the greatest game but I recorded it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.260 
not the greatest game but I recorded it
because<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> enemy<00:00:53.160> team<00:00:53.460> gets<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.879> five<00:00:54.090> or

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
because the enemy team gets like five or

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.590 
because the enemy team gets like five or
six<00:00:54.420> points<00:00:54.870> um<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.969> game<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
six points um in the game for the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.049 
six points um in the game for the
hardpoint<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.100> pretty<00:00:59.609> cool<00:00:59.789> like

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
hardpoint and it's it's pretty cool like

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.400 
hardpoint and it's it's pretty cool like
honestly<00:01:00.359> I've<00:01:00.660> never<00:01:00.690> had<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> happen

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
honestly I've never had that happen

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.439 
honestly I've never had that happen
before<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.370> could<00:01:02.640> have<00:01:02.730> went<00:01:02.850> flawless

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
before if we could have went flawless

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
before if we could have went flawless
that<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.409> been<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:04.650> better<00:01:04.979> but

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that would have been even better but

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.780 
that would have been even better but
five<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.840> six<00:01:07.020> points<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.530> still<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:08.520> good

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
five or six points is still pretty good

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420 
five or six points is still pretty good
to<00:01:09.030> keep<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> enemy<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.170> uh<00:01:10.200> yeah<00:01:10.979> that's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to keep the enemy at so uh yeah that's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
to keep the enemy at so uh yeah that's
why<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.670> recording<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:13.200> why<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.350> did

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
why I'm recording it so that's why I did

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.490

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
suppressor and I like quick drawn

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
suppressor and I like quick drawn
extended<00:01:59.640> mags<00:01:59.880> honestly<00:02:00.270> you're<00:02:00.689> even<00:02:00.960> needs

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
extended mags honestly you're even needs

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.270 
extended mags honestly you're even needs
to<00:02:01.200> press<00:02:01.409> her<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.740> thing<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.130> don't

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
to press her on this thing and you don't

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.730 
to press her on this thing and you don't
even<00:02:02.369> need<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> site<00:02:03.110> its<00:02:04.110> most<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.409> time<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
even need a site its most the time but I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
even need a site its most the time but I
think<00:02:04.950> suppressor<00:02:05.490> really<00:02:05.790> helps<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> out<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
think suppressor really helps it out I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
think suppressor really helps it out I
don't<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.069> why<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> can
