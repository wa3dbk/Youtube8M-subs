on<00:00:03.810> analog<00:00:04.410> cars<00:00:04.879> I<00:00:05.879> want<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> make<00:00:06.450> this<00:00:06.600> video

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
on analog cars I want to make this video

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.750 
on analog cars I want to make this video
on<00:00:07.140> customers<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:07.919> an<00:00:08.040> analogue<00:00:08.400> car

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
on customers that have an analogue car

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.280 
on customers that have an analogue car
and<00:00:09.120> if<00:00:09.630> your<00:00:09.840> car<00:00:10.080> fails<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.830> run<00:00:11.179> after<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.450> you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and if your car fails to run after a you

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.589 
and if your car fails to run after a you
know<00:00:13.380> 10<00:00:13.650> or<00:00:13.769> 20<00:00:14.099> minutes<00:00:14.429> maybe<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.389> hit<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
know 10 or 20 minutes maybe it's hit the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.359 
know 10 or 20 minutes maybe it's hit the
wall<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> couple<00:00:16.350> times<00:00:18.980> this<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.189> we're

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
wall a couple times this is we're

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.990 
wall a couple times this is we're
testing<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.880> car<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.480> tracks<00:00:21.840> it's

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
testing the car out on the tracks it's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.620 
testing the car out on the tracks it's
it's<00:00:24.000> good

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it's good

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.839 
it's good
what<00:00:25.199> there's<00:00:25.439> two<00:00:25.619> reasons<00:00:25.859> why<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.430> analog

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
what there's two reasons why your analog

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
what there's two reasons why your analog
car<00:00:27.210> would<00:00:27.449> fail<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.779> run<00:00:28.140> after<00:00:28.710> maybe<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
car would fail to run after maybe a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.609 
car would fail to run after maybe a
couple<00:00:29.670> minutes<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.150> running<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.080> first<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
couple minutes of running the first of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.400 
couple minutes of running the first of
is<00:00:31.920> your<00:00:32.369> motor<00:00:32.910> mount<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.719> prongs<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:35.059> your

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
is your motor mount the prongs on your

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
is your motor mount the prongs on your
motor<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:38.160> bent<00:00:38.550> up<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.090> aren't<00:00:39.480> touching

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
motor have bent up and aren't touching

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.500 
motor have bent up and aren't touching
the<00:00:39.989> circuit<00:00:40.710> okay<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.270> two

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the circuit okay these are the two

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
the circuit okay these are the two
circuits<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.739> front<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
circuits that go up to the front of the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.380 
circuits that go up to the front of the
car<00:00:44.370> they<00:00:45.300> come<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:46.250> okay<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:48.300> are

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
car they come out okay and there are

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.209 
car they come out okay and there are
like<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> spring<00:00:49.140> action<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:50.010> they

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
like a spring action you see how they

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.729 
like a spring action you see how they
are<00:00:50.250> spring<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.539> there<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.559> see

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
are spring in there like that you see

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.150 
are spring in there like that you see
how<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:53.010> push<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> okay

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
how they push in there like that okay

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.520 
how they push in there like that okay
your<00:00:56.160> guide<00:00:56.460> pin<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.090> has<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.480> clip<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.140> there

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
your guide pin it has to clip in there

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.490 
your guide pin it has to clip in there
okay<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.980> also<00:01:01.980> spring<00:01:02.460> okay<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:04.199> have

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
okay and also spring okay if these have

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.219 
okay and also spring okay if these have
gotten<00:01:04.890> bent<00:01:05.510> okay<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:06.750> they've<00:01:06.900> gotten

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
gotten bent okay or they've gotten

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.719 
gotten bent okay or they've gotten
twisted<00:01:07.500> you're<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.700> good

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
twisted you're not going to have good

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630 
twisted you're not going to have good
contact<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.630> your<00:01:09.840> guide<00:01:10.110> pin<00:01:10.470> okay<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
contact with your guide pin okay and you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.210 
contact with your guide pin okay and you
might<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> new<00:01:12.510> circuit<00:01:13.049> okay<00:01:13.350> usually<00:01:14.130> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
might need a new circuit okay usually we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.830 
might need a new circuit okay usually we
have<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> send<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> new<00:01:14.970> chassis<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.689> you've

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
have to send you a new chassis if you've

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.929 
have to send you a new chassis if you've
done<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.320> okay<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.640> number

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
done that okay but this is the number

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
done that okay but this is the number
one<00:01:18.270> reason<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.049> car<00:01:19.290> not<00:01:19.530> working<00:01:19.920> is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
one reason for the car not working is

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.120 
one reason for the car not working is
your<00:01:20.220> prongs<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.869> motor<00:01:22.080> mount<00:01:22.229> have

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
your prongs on your motor mount have

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
your prongs on your motor mount have
been<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.299> snap<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.659> back<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
been up and so when you snap it back in

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
been up and so when you snap it back in
they're<00:01:26.220> not<00:01:26.400> making<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:27.119> contact<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
they're not making good contact with the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
they're not making good contact with the
circuit<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.570> okay<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
circuit here okay and that can be the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.990 
circuit here okay and that can be the
reason<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.950> has<00:01:35.130> been<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.579> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
reason you know if this has been up so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.399 
reason you know if this has been up so
I'm<00:01:36.090> gonna<00:01:36.180> bend<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.720> these<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.200> little

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
I'm gonna bend one of these up a little

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.340 
I'm gonna bend one of these up a little
bit<00:01:37.970> okay<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> touch<00:01:43.079> down

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
bit okay you don't have it touch down

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.550 
bit okay you don't have it touch down
there<00:01:43.700> no<00:01:44.700> circuit<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> basically<00:01:46.049> you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
there no circuit so you basically you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.539 
there no circuit so you basically you
pop<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.100> Bend<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.820> prong<00:01:48.180> down<00:01:49.220> okay<00:01:50.250> see

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
pop it out Bend that prong down okay see

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.080 
pop it out Bend that prong down okay see
I<00:01:50.579> bent<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.060> down<00:01:51.439> snap<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.740> back<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I bent that down snap that back in and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.830 
I bent that down snap that back in and
boom<00:01:55.020> car<00:01:55.799> will<00:01:55.979> run<00:01:56.189> now<00:01:56.759> another<00:01:57.509> reason

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
boom car will run now another reason

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
boom car will run now another reason
that<00:01:58.049> your<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.520> guide<00:01:59.729> braid<00:02:00.210> should

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that your your your guide braid should

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.190 
that your your your guide braid should
move<00:02:00.780> back<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.350> forth<00:02:01.649> freely<00:02:02.100> sout<00:02:02.520> Springs

move back and forth freely sout Springs
that's<00:02:04.200> part<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> return<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.939> called

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
that's part of the return that's called

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.690 
that's part of the return that's called

there's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.479> spring<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.379> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
there's a little spring here see that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.690 
there's a little spring here see that
little<00:02:10.530> spring<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.670> can

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
little spring here and all of you can

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.460 
little spring here and all of you can
see<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.120> close<00:02:12.390> enough<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:13.290> it's

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
see it close enough but it's

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.020 
see it close enough but it's
right<00:02:13.650> in<00:02:13.830> here<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.160> kind<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.460> wire<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:15.000> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
right in here it's kind of a wire with a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.600 
right in here it's kind of a wire with a
spring<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.630> then<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.810> wire<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.410> that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
spring and then a wire and that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.940 
spring and then a wire and that
basically<00:02:17.610> allows<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.240> guide<00:02:18.450> pin<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.140> spring

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
basically allows the guide pin to spring

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.590 
basically allows the guide pin to spring
back<00:02:20.160> into<00:02:20.640> position<00:02:20.760> see<00:02:21.240> how<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.420> bringing

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
back into position see how it's bringing

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.180 
back into position see how it's bringing
back<00:02:21.860> if<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.250> these<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:24.240> gotten<00:02:24.630> bent<00:02:25.190> okay

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
back if if these have gotten bent okay

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.070 
back if if these have gotten bent okay
and<00:02:26.490> I've<00:02:27.090> seen<00:02:27.480> some<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.780> these<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.990> are
