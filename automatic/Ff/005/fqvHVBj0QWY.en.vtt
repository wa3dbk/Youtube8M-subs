00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.530 
for you guys and it comes along with a
massive<00:00:11.599> massive<00:00:13.519> unnecessary<00:00:14.519> set<00:00:15.420> of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
massive massive unnecessary set of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.740 
massive massive unnecessary set of
instructions<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.770> these<00:00:16.859> pistons<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.750> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
instructions for these pistons and it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500 
instructions for these pistons and it
opens<00:00:19.140> strictly<00:00:19.770> from<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.189> top<00:00:20.400> now<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> could

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
opens strictly from the top now I could

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240 
opens strictly from the top now I could
have<00:00:21.600> added<00:00:21.779> pistons<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> bottom<00:00:22.830> but

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
have added pistons on the bottom but

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.730 
have added pistons on the bottom but
that<00:00:23.430> would<00:00:23.550> mean<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.689> wouldn't<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.500> as

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that would mean that it wouldn't be as

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.810 
that would mean that it wouldn't be as
massive<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.260> resource<00:00:28.260> unfriendly<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
massive and resource unfriendly as I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.889 
massive and resource unfriendly as I
could<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.119> made<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.610> said<00:00:33.000> I'm

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
could have made it so with that said I'm

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.630 
could have made it so with that said I'm
when<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.440> click<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> be

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
have block storage now the best thing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.660 
have block storage now the best thing
about<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.800> opening

you're<00:00:57.840> gonna<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> manually<00:00:58.530> reset<00:00:58.920> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you're gonna have to manually reset this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.619 
you're gonna have to manually reset this
thing<00:00:59.309> every<00:00:59.670> single<00:00:59.850> time<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.480> use

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
thing every single time you want to use

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.869 
thing every single time you want to use
it<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:01.199> gonna<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> break<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.920> tons

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it you're gonna have to break out tons

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.100 
it you're gonna have to break out tons
of<00:01:03.149> blocks<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:04.049> i<00:01:04.439> didn't<00:01:04.860> add<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:06.110> closing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
of blocks because i didn't add a closing

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.740 
of blocks because i didn't add a closing
mechanism<00:01:07.409> which<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.390> i<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:09.630> too

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
mechanism which is because i was too

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.120 
mechanism which is because i was too
lazy<00:01:09.930> i<00:01:10.140> could<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.439> added<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> other

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
lazy i could have added one on the other

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460 
lazy i could have added one on the other
side<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> make<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> even<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.360> massive<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.439> i

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
side to make it even more massive but i

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.280 
side to make it even more massive but i
decided<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> stop<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.580> opening<00:01:14.909> sequence

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
decided to stop at the opening sequence

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.800 
decided to stop at the opening sequence
so<00:01:16.290> when<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> click<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.250> button<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.210> whole

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
so when I click this button this whole

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.960 
so when I click this button this whole
thing<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> start<00:01:20.070> opening<00:01:20.490> it's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
thing is going to start opening it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.880 
thing is going to start opening it's
going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> push<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> blocks<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.290> then

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
going to push the blocks here and then

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.120 
going to push the blocks here and then
it's<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> wait<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> reset<00:01:24.810> it

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's going to wait for you to reset it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:50.650 
it's going to wait for you to reset it
okay<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.820> click<00:01:27.090> spun

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.910 

also<00:01:51.660> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.900> see<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> Pistons<00:01:52.680> are

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
also you can see the Pistons are

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.220 
also you can see the Pistons are
sometimes<00:01:53.190> pretty<00:01:53.760> buggy<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.870> spawns

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
sometimes pretty buggy and it spawns

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.890 
sometimes pretty buggy and it spawns
very<00:01:55.620> annoying<00:01:56.070> bats<00:01:56.550> that<00:01:57.210> make<00:01:57.420> annoying

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
very annoying bats that make annoying

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.760 
very annoying bats that make annoying
noises<00:01:58.170> along<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.040> Pistons<00:01:59.490> moving

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
noises along with the Pistons moving

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.830 
noises along with the Pistons moving
while<00:02:01.770> you're<00:02:02.370> using<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.510> opening

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
while you're using it on the opening

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.030 
while you're using it on the opening
sequence<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.570> am<00:02:07.080> just<00:02:07.260> going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.619> claim

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
sequence so I I am just going to claim

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.560 
sequence so I I am just going to claim
this<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:10.020> most<00:02:11.000> unnecessarily<00:02:12.000> large

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
this as the most unnecessarily large

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.260 
this as the most unnecessarily large
noisy<00:02:13.610> annoying<00:02:14.840> non<00:02:15.840> resource<00:02:16.440> friendly

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
noisy annoying non resource friendly

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.820
