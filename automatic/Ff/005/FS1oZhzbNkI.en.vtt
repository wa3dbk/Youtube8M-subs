 life in fullness our life is like 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.950
 this blank sheet of paper and when 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.620
 a year begins 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.970
 we make plans we start 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.660
 do projects and we say I'm going to work 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.720
 I'm going to study I'm going to travel and we start 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.730
 to do the folds that we consider 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.170
 more prudent and convenient we do 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.740
 health purposes 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 we make purposes 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:09.840
 the rest for the exercise to do 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.870
 a diet and lose weight to produce more 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.170
 etcetera and we make our park red 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.170
 all right 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.409
 but most important is not what 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 we are willing to do 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.850
 and the most important thing is that we are 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.000
 willing to give up because our 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.060
 life is going to be full when we take off 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.250
 what hinders us remember that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.390
 pretty help what does not get in the way so 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.060
 scissors 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.100
 let's remove those negative attitudes 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.740
 that have been destroying us in the first 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.200
 place the addictions those vices of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.009
 take vices to add 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.759
 drugs that addiction to the bad guys 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.450
 modern means of communication all that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.379
 look 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.930
 you have to remove relationships with people 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.480
 that may be destroying not only 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.510
 our life our marriage our 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.910
 family because everything that takes away 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:29.640
 the tlc well let's put here all 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.540
 the pieces of paper will form a word 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.540
 a word 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.540
 one 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.340
 terrible for us we know her 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.390
 is in English people who know 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.310
 English will immediately discover 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:55.219
 have a h 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:58.849
 has one has an ele and others and that 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:03.049
 wants to say that word in English is not 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.709
 gel is not help he carries a p 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.709
 This is the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.930
 that is formed 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.930
 it means hell 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.000
 if we do not take away attitudes 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.520
 negative vices grudges envy 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.560
 let's make our life our 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.490
 marriage of our family a 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.800
 hell if we do not take off 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.830
 infidelities betrayals resentments 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.320
 revenge hate violence let's do 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.260
 of our work from our family of 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.240
 our country a hell all that we 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.600
 we removed was what was going to be a 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.480
 hell 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.239
 and look what we have left 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.239
 when we have removed that we have left 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.480
 a road to heaven 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:05.540
 what makes us the most 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:08.750
 similar is forming in us near 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.140
 what sacrifice implies the cross implies 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:16.430
 death resigns but the way to life 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.690
 you choose what you want 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.670
 hell 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.270
 or a path to heaven that you decide 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.880
 if you are willing 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.660
 shorten 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.950
 with what is destroying your life 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.400
 now it is important to know how to cut it 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.039
 because there are people who cut but short 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.039
 babies 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.039
 grabs 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.520
 and start doing what we already said 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.580
 we say is that I want to study I want 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.700
 work I want to do this or that 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.070
 makes his plans but after a 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:06.030
 time he wanted to make those plans 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.700
 begins to desist and begins to cut and 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.470
 begins to leave pending things that 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:17.820
 do and trust what happens the same 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:21.210
 project of life they cut it but in reverse 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.310
 they begin by removing their studies no longer 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.800
 I'm going to study them to it was not the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.660
 career that I wanted, I'm going to change 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.960
 of faculty 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:35.090
 I'm not going to work anymore, it's very heavy 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.550
 my work I'm going to go elsewhere 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.190

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:46.260
 new cuts look what you're doing 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:51.300
