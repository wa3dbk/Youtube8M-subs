00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.599 
am not good at that so I'm going to
practice<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.129> little<00:02:25.219> bit<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:27.530> ring<00:02:28.250> here

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
practice a little bit and this ring here

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.849 
practice a little bit and this ring here
is<00:02:28.730> actually<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.180> knife<00:02:29.420> handle<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.989> used<00:02:30.709> to

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
is actually the knife handle I used to

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.009 
is actually the knife handle I used to
have<00:02:31.010> our<00:02:31.430> I've<00:02:31.790> seen<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> survival<00:02:32.569> pause<00:02:32.750> or

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
have our I've seen the survival pause or

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.660 
have our I've seen the survival pause or
we've<00:02:33.140> using<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.470> survival<00:02:33.920> pods<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
we've using the survival pods and the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.420 
we've using the survival pods and the
nights<00:02:34.879> with<00:02:35.540> bison<00:02:35.959> don't<00:02:36.769> seem<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.129> be<00:02:37.250> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
nights with bison don't seem to be the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.819 
nights with bison don't seem to be the
highest<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.939> quality<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:38.989> I'm<00:02:39.109> assuming<00:02:39.650> it's

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
highest of quality but I'm assuming it's

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.530 
highest of quality but I'm assuming it's
just<00:02:40.220> for<00:02:40.639> two<00:02:41.150> purposes<00:02:41.629> in<00:02:42.019> here<00:02:42.379> really<00:02:42.560> a

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
just for two purposes in here really a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.599 
just for two purposes in here really a
magnesium<00:02:44.540> striker<00:02:45.079> bar<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:46.220> cut<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
magnesium striker bar and to cut the

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.319 
magnesium striker bar and to cut the
paracord<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.900> know<00:02:48.409> right<00:02:48.530> here<00:02:49.099> these<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.639> don't

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
paracord I know right here these I don't

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.970 
paracord I know right here these I don't
know<00:02:50.389> if<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.510> can<00:02:50.599> see<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.769> can<00:02:51.859> see

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
know if you can see that you can see

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.379 
know if you can see that you can see
that<00:02:52.129> that's<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.609> that's<00:02:52.970> one<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.299> the

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
that that's the that's one of the

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.050 
that that's the that's one of the
buttons<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.859> other<00:02:55.040> side<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.519> same<00:02:55.700> space

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
buttons on the other side the same space

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.210 
buttons on the other side the same space
um<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:59.030> yeah<00:02:59.329> that's<00:02:59.659> just<00:02:59.989> about<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
um so yeah that's just about that the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.550 
um so yeah that's just about that the
knife<00:03:01.370> itself<00:03:01.579> oh<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.629> figured<00:03:03.079> out<00:03:03.200> how<00:03:03.319> long

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
knife itself oh I figured out how long

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.089 
knife itself oh I figured out how long
it<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.769> by<00:03:04.599> flattening<00:03:05.599> it<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.260> then<00:03:06.500> bending

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
it is by flattening it and then bending

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.009 
it is by flattening it and then bending
it<00:03:07.220> up<00:03:07.430> right<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.030> sharp<00:03:08.359> angle<00:03:08.750> until<00:03:08.840> it

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
it up right the sharp angle until it

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.449 
it up right the sharp angle until it
doesn't<00:03:09.319> want<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.650> bend<00:03:09.829> anymore<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:10.400> I'm

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
doesn't want to bend anymore so I'm

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.619 
doesn't want to bend anymore so I'm
assuming<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.909> probably<00:03:11.180> about<00:03:11.269> an<00:03:11.450> inch

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
assuming it's probably about an inch

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.080 
assuming it's probably about an inch
long<00:03:12.069> probably<00:03:13.069> shouldn't<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:13.519> doing<00:03:13.849> that<00:03:13.879> in

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
long probably shouldn't be doing that in

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.470 
long probably shouldn't be doing that in
case<00:03:14.269> I've<00:03:14.419> been<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.689> nice<00:03:14.870> amount<00:03:15.340> also<00:03:16.480> this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
case I've been the nice amount also this

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.020 
case I've been the nice amount also this
knife<00:03:17.659> seems<00:03:17.989> sorry<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.010> paracord<00:03:19.609> seems<00:03:19.879> to

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
knife seems sorry the paracord seems to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.869 
knife seems sorry the paracord seems to
be<00:03:20.120> really<00:03:20.419> well<00:03:20.780> done<00:03:20.989> tight<00:03:21.669> except<00:03:22.669> for<00:03:22.699> a

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
be really well done tight except for a

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.369 
be really well done tight except for a
couple<00:03:22.909> spots<00:03:23.359> where<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.840> can<00:03:23.959> see<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.229> knife

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
couple spots where you can see the knife

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.780 
couple spots where you can see the knife
coming<00:03:24.739> through<00:03:24.919> like<00:03:25.099> right<00:03:27.400> there<00:03:28.400> that

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
coming through like right there that

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.399 
coming through like right there that
looks<00:03:29.000> more<00:03:29.090> like<00:03:29.299> the<00:03:29.449> sheath<00:03:29.780> part<00:03:30.079> of<00:03:30.169> its<00:03:30.290> I

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
looks more like the sheath part of its I

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.390 
looks more like the sheath part of its I
know<00:03:30.470> these<00:03:30.680> do<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:31.129> knives<00:03:31.340> come<00:03:31.489> in<00:03:31.699> sheets

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
know these do the knives come in sheets

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.860 
know these do the knives come in sheets
but<00:03:34.400> it<00:03:34.519> seems<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.060> high<00:03:35.180> quality<00:03:35.209> for<00:03:35.840> the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
but it seems really high quality for the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.210 
but it seems really high quality for the
price<00:03:35.930> especially<00:03:36.409> considering<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.069> it

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
price especially considering that it

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.740 
price especially considering that it
says<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.519> is<00:03:37.639> hand<00:03:37.819> braided<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.299> don't<00:03:38.510> know<00:03:38.599> how

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
says it is hand braided I don't know how

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.460 
says it is hand braided I don't know how
true<00:03:39.079> that<00:03:39.169> is<00:03:39.340> but<00:03:40.340> they<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:41.720> want<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.379> believe

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
true that is but they I want to believe

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.110 
true that is but they I want to believe
it's<00:03:42.769> true<00:03:42.979> because<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.669> eighteen

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
it's true because this is eighteen

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.839 
it's true because this is eighteen
dollars<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.870> really<00:03:45.169> nice<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.819> so<00:03:46.819> I
