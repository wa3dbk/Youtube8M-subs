to the outside world but to myself

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.560 
to the outside world but to myself
running<00:01:21.620> is<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:21.830> way<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.430> connect<00:01:23.210> with<00:01:23.450> the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.630 
days since I've run I relaxed into it
and<00:02:23.510> I've<00:02:24.230> let<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> pressure<00:02:24.830> go<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.550> I've

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
and I've let the pressure go and I've

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.520 
and I've let the pressure go and I've
allowed<00:02:25.880> myself<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.570> focus<00:02:27.050> on<00:02:27.230> other<00:02:27.380> things

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
allowed myself to focus on other things

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.520 
allowed myself to focus on other things
and<00:02:28.510> now<00:02:29.510> today

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
