 that seat more photoshop ball 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.650
 chances 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.260
 I was thinking right now that the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.600
 to make available to you on the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 I ended up remembering that the pretty cool effect 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.300
 despite this article but it 's very cool 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.380
 even if it is the effect of gta san andreas 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.550
 first good file open 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:42.629
 choose an image choose an image 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:46.620
 here is a photo that I took an ok come 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.610
 filter filter gallery in a click to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.890
 these isolated posters 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.260
 here does not have a lot of right 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 to put is not what most head your 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.579
 image to whom thickness give these location 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.659
 19 have also okay to give this 5 and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.030
 postponement 3 gave the okay okay and filter and the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.750
 line of filters again only now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 in sword 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.150
 see the tape an event well 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.420
 differentiated 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.030
 you there you choose the best head 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.000
 image so long it also deals with the layout 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.210
 mine at 18 is already pretty cool 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.330
 detail the trace 3 smoothness puts a 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.570
 idea here for me is getting good from the tape 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.970
 still an okay and see what effect well 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.340
 interesting that is our image 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.560
 now this is the very simple and good effect 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.980
 cool to do is if you want 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.190
 any image there a video lesson is just 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.619
