 we start 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.460
 and practically the part of the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.900
 beginning to start the demon has 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.560
 sold his soul by the legs of a 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.069

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.069
 feels to see her dancing the youngest 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.069
 again greater and a greater re 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.329
 ok friends then after this part 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.200
 we passed between the battery and followed 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.200
 many 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.709
 we are going to occupy a greater sun and a 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.709
 greater and the rhythm is going to be 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.990
 up we're just going to occupy it 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.990
 the pace up 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 and 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.750
 ok we will not be this way the devil 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.920
 his soul has come with his legs and a 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.760
 working blonde who dances and strips 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.670
 in concord a place that closes in 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.470
 the mornings and ok we went to the rhythm 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.720
 where it starts, let's say that the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.740
 part pons of the song was going to be the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.700
 rhythm down down 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.750
 down up 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.090
 change again it would be down down 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.470
 up top 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:46.319
 down up and change the ones that from that 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.250
 way and he sits down to watch her dance 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.110
 as a drink 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.280
 city 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.940
 17 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.940
 dance 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.579
 then they go 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.590
 although for the part of the rhythm of sections 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:11.810
 is a to a greater re we occupy nothing more the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:14.990
 finger one the rope five fret five and 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.370
 the little finger on the fret 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.100
 7 rope 4 then we did this 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.590
 and let's go to the bottom 7 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.030
 equally with the most figures and then 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:32.530
 to fret 9 and then to fret 10 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.530
 everything will remain this way 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.560
 and it's the preparation to fall back 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.120
 to the summary that is going to give a return to 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.100
 the song for the chicken at home 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.330
 and you can do it that way 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.330
 to be like that we started 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:05:00.590
 he himself has not sold his soul for the 

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:04.639
 legs of a blonde who works 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:09.110

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:11.449

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.389
 watch her dance 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.389
 as entered and then it goes 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:32.260
 the demon has come his soul with the 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.230
 legs and a blonde that works that 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.490
 and dances naked in harmony one 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:42.840
