go back over it with a rag start at the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:30.440 
go back over it with a rag start at the
area<00:03:16.600> where<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.630> first<00:03:18.049> painted<00:03:18.920> which

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.979 

and<00:03:31.450> just<00:03:31.659> really<00:03:31.840> rub<00:03:32.170> hard<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:35.049> get<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.379> in

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
and just really rub hard to get it in

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.509 
and just really rub hard to get it in
and<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.140> already<00:03:38.560> sort<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:40.409> like<00:03:41.409> a<00:03:41.519> gray

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
and it's already sort of like a gray

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.640 
and it's already sort of like a gray
wash<00:03:43.150> Swedish<00:03:43.989> finish<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.109> more<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.439> run

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
wash Swedish finish and the more you run

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.869 
wash Swedish finish and the more you run
probably<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.280> more<00:03:48.489> will<00:03:48.640> come<00:03:48.790> off<00:03:48.939> and<00:03:50.879> make

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
probably the more will come off and make

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.240 
probably the more will come off and make
sure<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.329> rub<00:03:52.659> off<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.349> direction<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:54.099> the

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
sure you rub off in the direction of the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:09.030 
sure you rub off in the direction of the
grain<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:05.200> Swedish<00:04:05.560> finish<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:07.859> don't<00:04:08.859> know

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
grain so Swedish finish is I don't know

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.649 
grain so Swedish finish is I don't know
I<00:04:09.069> had<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.400> hardest<00:04:09.700> time<00:04:09.849> trying<00:04:10.419> to<00:04:10.480> figure

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
I had the hardest time trying to figure

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.360 
I had the hardest time trying to figure
out<00:04:10.870> what<00:04:11.019> Swedish<00:04:11.379> Trinity<00:04:11.739> would<00:04:11.889> have<00:04:12.250> to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
out what Swedish Trinity would have to

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.229 
out what Swedish Trinity would have to
do<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.700> took<00:04:13.599> me<00:04:13.810> forever<00:04:14.049> so<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:15.849> just<00:04:16.000> kind<00:04:16.180> of

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
do it took me forever so I just kind of

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.969 
do it took me forever so I just kind of
came<00:04:16.389> up<00:04:16.539> with<00:04:16.570> his<00:04:16.780> own<00:04:16.930> technique<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.680> know<00:04:17.769> a

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
came up with his own technique I know a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.009 
came up with his own technique I know a

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.120 

when<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.900> do<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.080> lot<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.380> like<00:04:34.620> painting

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
when you do a lot of like painting

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.710 
when you do a lot of like painting
techniques<00:04:35.639> it's<00:04:35.970> other<00:04:36.210> than<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.630> a

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
techniques it's other than just a

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.080 
techniques it's other than just a
straight<00:04:37.020> color<00:04:37.289> it's<00:04:38.280> more<00:04:38.550> like<00:04:38.759> a<00:04:38.789> just

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
straight color it's more like a just

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.140 
straight color it's more like a just
trial<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.570> error<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:39.840> to<00:04:40.139> see<00:04:41.120> what<00:04:42.120> you

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
trial and error just to see what you

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:52.010 
trial and error just to see what you
like<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:47.039> front<00:04:50.600> it's<00:04:51.600> really<00:04:51.840> pretty

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
like the front it's really pretty

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:06.260 
like the front it's really pretty

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
that i used earlier to dry hard to get
