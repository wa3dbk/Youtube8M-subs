power<00:01:55.560> I've<00:01:56.250> got<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.579> say<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.420> is

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
power I've got to say that this is

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.149 
power I've got to say that this is
probably<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.049> thing<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.439> those<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
probably a good thing for those for the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.120 
probably a good thing for those for the
more<00:01:59.340> discerning<00:02:00.020> audio<00:02:01.020> listener<00:02:01.469> they

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
more discerning audio listener they

they're<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.220> in-ear<00:02:30.520> headphones<00:02:31.000> made<00:02:31.210> by

they're the in-ear headphones made by

they're the in-ear headphones made by
Steinhauser<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.560> I'd<00:02:32.710> say<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.040> bass<00:02:33.220> is<00:02:33.430> a

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
Steinhauser and I'd say the bass is a

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.190 
Steinhauser and I'd say the bass is a
little<00:02:33.730> less<00:02:33.880> than<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.780> mean<00:02:34.930> enough

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
little less than that but I mean enough

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.930 
little less than that but I mean enough
I<00:02:35.410> mean<00:02:35.650> even<00:02:36.070> if<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.310> are<00:02:36.459> listening<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.820> R&amp;B

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
I mean even if you are listening to R&amp;B

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.730 
I mean even if you are listening to R&amp;B
nowadays<00:02:37.720> them<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.959> equalize<00:02:38.440> from<00:02:38.590> your

a<00:02:41.890> problem<00:02:42.310> but<00:02:42.760> certainly<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.300> you're

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
a problem but certainly if you're

terms of the build and the look okay so

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.380 
terms of the build and the look okay so
we've<00:02:59.050> discussed<00:02:59.380> sound<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.890> they're<00:03:00.580> big<00:03:00.940> 50

millimeter<00:03:01.780> drivers<00:03:02.050> now<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.830> might<00:03:02.950> think

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
millimeter drivers now you might think

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.460 
millimeter drivers now you might think
wow<00:03:03.310> seems<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.880> bit<00:03:04.000> big<00:03:04.030> what<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> look<00:03:04.989> silly<00:03:05.230> no

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
wow seems a bit big what I look silly no

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.570 
wow seems a bit big what I look silly no
actually<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.739> think<00:03:05.890> they<00:03:05.980> look<00:03:06.130> really<00:03:06.160> cool

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
actually I think they look really cool

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.820 
actually I think they look really cool
kind<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.420> makes<00:03:07.600> you<00:03:07.690> look<00:03:07.720> retro<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.500> the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
kind of makes you look retro and the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.070 
kind of makes you look retro and the
other<00:03:08.950> advantage<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.520> if<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.820> live<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.360> cold

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
other advantage is if you live in a cold

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.600 
other advantage is if you live in a cold
place<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:12.250> United<00:03:12.580> Kingdom<00:03:14.370> these<00:03:15.370> keep

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
place like the United Kingdom these keep

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.850 
place like the United Kingdom these keep
you<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.880> nice<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.360> warm<00:03:16.510> not<00:03:17.260> too<00:03:17.560> hot<00:03:17.830> and

you is nice and warm not too hot and

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.830 
you is nice and warm not too hot and
that<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.580> start<00:03:18.880> sweating<00:03:19.120> unless<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.690> take

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
that you start sweating unless you take

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.410 
that you start sweating unless you take
them<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.200> gym<00:03:20.519> which<00:03:21.519> might<00:03:21.970> be<00:03:22.180> a<00:03:22.209> little

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
them to the gym which might be a little

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.380 
them to the gym which might be a little
bit<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.630> an<00:03:22.690> issue<00:03:22.840> which<00:03:23.110> I'll<00:03:23.260> explain<00:03:23.650> later

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
bit of an issue which I'll explain later

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.270 
bit of an issue which I'll explain later
they<00:03:25.390> do<00:03:25.510> really<00:03:25.959> really<00:03:26.260> fit<00:03:26.830> nice<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
they do really really fit nice in the

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.220 
they do really really fit nice in the
end<00:03:27.310> even<00:03:27.850> though<00:03:28.120> they're<00:03:28.299> quite<00:03:28.690> sort<00:03:29.200> of

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
end even though they're quite sort of

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.259 
end even though they're quite sort of
heavy<00:03:29.500> ish<00:03:29.769> they<00:03:29.980> really<00:03:30.549> don't<00:03:30.760> feel<00:03:30.970> that

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
heavy ish they really don't feel that

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.060 
heavy ish they really don't feel that
bad<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:32.049> your<00:03:32.170> head<00:03:32.290> at<00:03:32.410> all<00:03:32.530> in<00:03:32.709> fact<00:03:32.860> they're

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
bad on your head at all in fact they're

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.460 
bad on your head at all in fact they're
probably<00:03:33.100> I'm<00:03:34.090> gonna<00:03:34.390> go<00:03:34.570> far<00:03:34.870> as<00:03:35.170> saying

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
probably I'm gonna go far as saying

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.360 
probably I'm gonna go far as saying
they're<00:03:35.680> probably<00:03:35.950> one<00:03:36.100> of<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.250> most

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
they're probably one of the most

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.400 
they're probably one of the most
comfortable<00:03:36.970> headphones<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:38.049> I've<00:03:38.140> ever

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
comfortable headphones that I've ever

probably<00:05:33.850> three<00:05:34.150> times<00:05:34.360> as<00:05:34.600> thick<00:05:34.840> as<00:05:34.990> your

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
probably three times as thick as your
