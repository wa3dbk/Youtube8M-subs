our<00:01:39.030> mold<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> mold<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:40.050> line<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
our mold and the mold in line with the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.960 
our mold and the mold in line with the
chocolate<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> wafers<00:01:41.280> also<00:01:41.580> being<00:01:41.730> dropped

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
chocolate the wafers also being dropped

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.790 
chocolate the wafers also being dropped
into<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.390> mold<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.050> soft<00:01:43.560> first

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
into the mold this is the soft first

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.380 
into the mold this is the soft first
phase<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.370> process<00:01:44.760> of<00:01:44.910> making<00:01:44.940> an<00:01:45.270> actual

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
phase of the process of making an actual

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
phase of the process of making an actual
KitKat<00:01:45.900> bar<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.100> line<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.940> see

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
KitKat bar down the line you can see

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.220 
KitKat bar down the line you can see
just<00:01:48.300> behind<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.660> there's<00:01:48.840> an<00:01:48.930> x-ray<00:01:49.200> machine

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
just behind me there's an x-ray machine

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.590 
just behind me there's an x-ray machine
what<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.920> does<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.490> looks<00:01:50.760> for<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.390> see<00:01:51.540> if

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
what this does is it looks for to see if

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.320 
what this does is it looks for to see if
they're<00:01:51.780> wafers<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.380> important<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.920> mold

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
they're wafers be important to the mold

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.220 
they're wafers be important to the mold
obviously<00:01:54.330> if<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.540> isn't<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.780> waiter<00:01:54.960> in

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
obviously if there isn't a waiter in

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.870 
obviously if there isn't a waiter in
there<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.680> gets<00:01:55.800> rejected<00:01:56.160> further<00:01:56.520> down<00:01:56.760> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
there it gets rejected further down the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.150 
there it gets rejected further down the
line<00:01:57.470> there's<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.530> there's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.010> lot

responsibility and there's a lot of
trust<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.050> is<00:02:01.230> very<00:02:01.440> much<00:02:01.620> if<00:02:01.920> you're

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
trust that it is very much if you're

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.730 
trust that it is very much if you're
willing<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> give<00:02:02.760> that<00:02:02.910> person<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.360> respect

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
willing to give that person with respect

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.600 
willing to give that person with respect
they're<00:02:04.740> more<00:02:04.890> than<00:02:05.010> willing<00:02:05.160> to<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
they're more than willing to get that

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.160 
they're more than willing to get that
respect<00:02:05.910> back<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.960> case<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
respect back to you and it's a case of

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
respect back to you and it's a case of
just<00:02:07.650> getting<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.610> people<00:02:08.940> getting<00:02:09.149> on

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
just getting on with people getting on

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.300 
just getting on with people getting on
the<00:02:09.479> fatigue<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.170> say<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.649> better<00:02:10.920> job<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the fatigue I say the better job that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.100 
the fatigue I say the better job that
you<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.910> more<00:02:12.240> interesting<00:02:12.750> jobs<00:02:12.960> they're

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you do the more interesting jobs they're

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.100 
you do the more interesting jobs they're
likely<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.410> give<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> morning

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
likely to give you in the morning

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.350 
likely to give you in the morning
so<00:02:15.590> every<00:02:15.770> day<00:02:15.950> everyone<00:02:16.340> says<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.790> keep<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.150> gift

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
so every day everyone says I keep a gift

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
so every day everyone says I keep a gift
cutback<00:02:17.690> going<00:02:18.190> they're<00:02:19.190> probably<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.550> best

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
cutback going they're probably the best

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.550 
cutback going they're probably the best
thing<00:02:20.000> from<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.540> point<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.870> view<00:02:20.960> of<00:02:21.020> work<00:02:21.320> is

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
thing from a point of view of work is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.810 
thing from a point of view of work is
the<00:02:21.710> fact<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.340> quality<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
the fact that the quality of the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.070 
the fact that the quality of the
training<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:23.330> receive<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.870> job

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
training that we receive and the job

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.780 
training that we receive and the job
that<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.290> do<00:02:24.410> at<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.560> end<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.860> day<00:02:25.040> but

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
that you do at the end of the day but

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.030 
that you do at the end of the day but
obviously<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.570> have<00:02:26.720> over<00:02:26.990> 14<00:02:27.350> apprentices<00:02:27.890> at

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
obviously we have over 14 apprentices at

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.170 
obviously we have over 14 apprentices at
the<00:02:28.130> yacht's<00:02:28.310> site<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:28.880> there's<00:02:29.060> obviously

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
the yacht's site so there's obviously

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.120 
the yacht's site so there's obviously
quite<00:02:29.420> quite<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> good<00:02:30.230> social<00:02:30.410> scene<00:02:30.770> between

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
quite quite a good social scene between

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.670 
quite quite a good social scene between
us<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> best<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.930> both<00:02:33.050> on<00:02:33.290> face<00:02:33.530> it

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
us so get the best of both on face it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.470 
us so get the best of both on face it
when<00:02:33.800> you<00:02:33.890> get<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.640> work<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.030> also<00:02:35.210> get

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
when you get get to work and also get

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.460 
when you get get to work and also get
away<00:02:35.780> so

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.200 

here<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.040> can<00:02:44.220> see<00:02:44.370> behind<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.180> of

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
here you can see behind this is one of

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.570 
here you can see behind this is one of
the<00:02:45.390> wrapping<00:02:45.840> machines<00:02:46.320> as<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.160> completely

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
the wrapping machines as you completely

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.400 
the wrapping machines as you completely
hit<00:02:47.760> caps<00:02:48.000> which<00:02:48.300> affect<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.020> main<00:02:49.200> line

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
hit caps which affect on the main line

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.980 
hit caps which affect on the main line
which<00:02:49.650> muscle<00:02:50.070> more<00:02:50.190> than<00:02:50.340> one<00:02:50.720> down<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> line

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
which muscle more than one down the line

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.350 
which muscle more than one down the line
and<00:02:52.260> wraps<00:02:52.710> ready<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.460> put<00:02:53.730> into<00:02:53.820> boxes<00:02:54.240> and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and wraps ready to be put into boxes and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.140 
and wraps ready to be put into boxes and
then<00:02:54.540> shipped<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:54.990> to<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.970> if<00:02:56.970> I'm<00:02:57.120> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
then shipped out to there if I'm a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.460 
then shipped out to there if I'm a
fitter<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.600> probably<00:02:57.810> say<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> hammer<00:02:58.320> is

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
fitter I probably say a hammer is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.840 
fitter I probably say a hammer is
probably<00:02:58.710> my<00:02:58.860> favorite<00:02:59.160> tool<00:02:59.370> but<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
probably my favorite tool but the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.340 
probably my favorite tool but the
