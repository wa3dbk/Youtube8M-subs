00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 soon also for London explains a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.929
 as was the case with this negotiation 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.370
 that was fast anyway 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.740
 emotions in short, to get to dress 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.890
 the jersey so important in the year of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 center have been a negotiation 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.430
 the withdrawal with the Florentine was very fast 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 and I heard the manager Leonardi col 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.630
 which I had worked in the sector 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.779
 youth of juve it took a moment 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070
 entered immediately agreements are 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.989
 very happy paw to start this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
 new adventure find many friends 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.370
 because now that a second mind 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 local in that juve you played are 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.520
 a pair with antonio mirante which is the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.649
 Parma goalkeeper is played with many 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 palermo players in the florentine 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.969
 that you find here so in short it is a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.350
 parma that sounds familiar to you in 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.600
 this moment with so many companions who 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.070
 already addressed also in the national how 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.649
 antonio cassano, however, seen that before 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 yes surely they will be exchanged 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.129
 easy insertion also because 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.379
 I know almost everyone 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.730
 in addition to mirante also with palladino 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.970
 we played together in the spring 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.680
 so I can't wait to start this 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.470
 this new adventure 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.479
 you are known to be a fullback 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.110
 an external let's say he can do in 3 5 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.119
 2 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.890
 the whole right wing band left 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.780
 very flexible played many games in 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 national 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.740
 but you could maybe even cover one 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.090
 roles in a three-man defense and you 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.830
 feel ready also if necessary 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.470
 this you think you are above all a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.869
 external not mister but I heard the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.170
 Minister briefly asked me all 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170
 Italy 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.570
 I've always been a flexible player 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.820
 which adapts to situations therefore if 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.040
 I will be asked to play defense 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.040
 I will very gladly also because I am 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.500
 born in that role in the spring to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.140
 juve so it will be just a moment for me 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.509
 return to do what I always have 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.340
 did in fact find yourself cassandri find 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.440
 also amauri who was his companion at 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.210
 palermo munari strongly of state three 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.800
 days ago because he also arrived from 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.180
 little said that it is probably the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.700
 best player i ever have 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.290
 played you also played with many 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.759
 craftsmen players however a couple with 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.140
 amauri home right now really 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.269
 among the best in the league 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.570
 yes I certainly played both with the 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:18.100
 died that with antonio nazionale yes 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.880
 complete wonderfully I saw a but 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.230
 last year regenerated and certainly 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.390
 it will be a couple that can make sparks 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.570
 but surely the group think that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.519
 it must be a star but our point 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.850
 of strength because this team always has 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.010
 made great leagues 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.870
 thanks to the contribution of everyone's choice 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.060
 number 2 as never the number that 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.200
 identifies precisely the role in short that 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.780
 I did it for so many years 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.420
 if a bit of a return to the old and then 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.579
 also the last free available then 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.070
 I chose the 2 also because the dictation 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.900
 my daughter dictated that little girl e 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.420
 so I hope it brings good luck 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.450
