so<00:02:00.340> nice<00:02:01.340> nice<00:02:01.790> little<00:02:02.060> simple<00:02:02.360> figure<00:02:02.630> you

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
so nice nice little simple figure you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.179 
so nice nice little simple figure you
can<00:02:03.770> plug<00:02:04.040> his<00:02:04.220> gun<00:02:04.460> into<00:02:04.670> his<00:02:04.880> hand<00:02:06.040> just<00:02:07.040> like

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
can plug his gun into his hand just like

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.880 
can plug his gun into his hand just like
that<00:02:07.430> oh<00:02:08.799> yeah<00:02:09.799> mmm<00:02:10.729> very<00:02:11.180> nice<00:02:11.890> articulation

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
that oh yeah mmm very nice articulation

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.430 
that oh yeah mmm very nice articulation
law<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.459> very<00:02:13.670> simple<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.120> shoulder<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.350> a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
law is very simple just shoulder to a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.940 
law is very simple just shoulder to a
bowl<00:02:15.620> here<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.130> then<00:02:17.019> waist<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.380> then<00:02:18.590> I

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
bowl here and then waist and then I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.000 
bowl here and then waist and then I
guess<00:02:19.940> his<00:02:20.090> foot<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.630> pivot<00:02:20.989> due<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.920> the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
guess his foot can pivot due to the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.060 
guess his foot can pivot due to the
transformation<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.750> all<00:02:23.900> in<00:02:23.989> all<00:02:24.079> not<00:02:24.320> too

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
transformation but all in all not too

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.470 
transformation but all in all not too
bad<00:02:26.019> yeah<00:02:27.019> so<00:02:27.320> just<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.820> quick<00:02:29.060> size

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
bad yeah so just to do a quick size

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.970
