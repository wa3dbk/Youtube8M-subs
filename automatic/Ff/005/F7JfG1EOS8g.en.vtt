00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.769
 turned out to be no friend and no enemy 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.340
 you canâ€™t disassemble the valve or hara 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 Man Tang storm take a chance 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.670
 don't leave him alone 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.000
 8 bundle in one set 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.190
 understand leg start parsing the song 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.230
 lyrics and chords of the song you find on 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.239
 site on the left you see the text 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.210
 where place is taking each chord 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.399
 for some reason the horizontal line in the right 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.650
 parts are digital chords by 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.170
 which is convenient to play a song and memorize 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.949
 followers here this song we 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.809
 play bust four 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.949
 is played as follows 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.650
 hitting the thumb 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.970
 then we catch the string index 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.479
 finger 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.270
 then we connect two strings first and 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.869
 second two fingers and go back to 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.799
 the first blow can be four 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.560
 hitting means every chord 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.900
 is played up once meaning we 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.900
 We start to play the first line of am. 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.980
 then comes some 7 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.120
 next line 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.189
 well, the last 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.520
 but 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.549
 the song is very light and you are no problem 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.200
 handle her for times for 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.319
 diversity is possible in each couplet 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.000
 change type of accompaniment i.e. if 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.400
 the first couplet we played brute force 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.040
 four in the second you can go on 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.590
 bust six in bust game 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.890
 Six, too, every chord we beat 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.890
 once for example if a friend turned out to be 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.890
 suddenly 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.050
 Spain 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.910
 the road 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.210
 and so on can also be played here yet 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.380
 so that is when 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:52.580
 called playing a tweak that is bass and 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.580
 I answer so he follows 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:16.430
 and so on, the point is that we play 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.040
 times and the groove is played and the answer is two three times 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.840
 two three 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.049
 when we play chord em is advantageous to them 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.290
 full fingering playing a pass chord 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.790
 km2 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:36.069
 3 then change the next bass too Sarah 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.069
 proud and repeat 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.930
 but this accompaniment technique will require 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.420
 certain skills from you 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.450
 therefore I recommend starting with more 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.390
 brute force four or brute force 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.709
 sixes put huskies do not forget 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.489
