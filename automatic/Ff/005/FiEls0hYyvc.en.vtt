grips to fit through the rod blank we're

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.150 
grips to fit through the rod blank we're
going<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> use<00:00:12.900> different<00:00:13.200> size<00:00:13.440> razor<00:00:13.860> ones

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
going to use different size razor ones

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.859 
going to use different size razor ones
or<00:00:14.340> Reimers<00:00:15.350> what<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:17.070> is

most cork comes with a quarter inch
inside<00:00:20.640> diameter<00:00:21.140> I'm<00:00:22.140> gonna<00:00:22.350> go<00:00:22.500> ahead<00:00:22.590> and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
inside diameter I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.810 
inside diameter I'm gonna go ahead and
slide<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> blank<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:24.720> show<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.019> that

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
slide this on the blank to show you that

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.800 
slide this on the blank to show you that
it's<00:00:26.820> only<00:00:26.910> gonna<00:00:27.060> stop<00:00:27.390> there

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's only gonna stop there

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.109 
it's only gonna stop there
we<00:00:28.349> need<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.010> cork<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.519> all<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> way<00:00:29.910> down

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
we need this cork to go all the way down

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.460 
we need this cork to go all the way down
to<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> bottom<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.019> way<00:00:31.140> we're<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to the bottom in a way we're going to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.170 
to the bottom in a way we're going to
accomplish<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.399> reaming<00:00:32.910> out<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
accomplish that is by reaming out the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.630 
accomplish that is by reaming out the
inside<00:00:33.480> diameter<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.989> cork<00:00:34.230> grips<00:00:34.489> okay

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
inside diameter of the cork grips okay

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
inside diameter of the cork grips okay
when<00:00:35.969> reaming<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.420> cork<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.840> we're<00:00:37.559> going

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
when reaming your cork out we're going

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.319 
when reaming your cork out we're going
to<00:00:37.770> always<00:00:38.040> start<00:00:38.309> from<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.640> back<00:00:38.850> end<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
to always start from the back end of the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.290 
to always start from the back end of the
cork<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.410> reason<00:00:40.739> being<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.610> reamer<00:00:42.090> has

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
cork the reason being is this reamer has

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
cork the reason being is this reamer has
a<00:00:42.329> slight<00:00:42.750> taper<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.649> does<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.950> rod<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.340> want

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
a slight taper so does your rod we want

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
a slight taper so does your rod we want
those<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> match<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> end<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
those to match up in the end of the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.920 
those to match up in the end of the
process<00:00:46.670> I'm<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> go<00:00:48.059> ahead<00:00:48.180> rain<00:00:48.780> from

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
process I'm going to go ahead rain from

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.920 
process I'm going to go ahead rain from
the<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.289> end<00:00:49.550> twisting<00:00:50.550> turning<00:00:51.180> just

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the back end twisting turning just

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
the back end twisting turning just
ripping<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.680> middle<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.129> cork<00:00:53.460> as

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
ripping out the middle of this cork as

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.990 
ripping out the middle of this cork as
best<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:55.039> making<00:00:56.039> sure<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> go<00:00:56.520> straight
