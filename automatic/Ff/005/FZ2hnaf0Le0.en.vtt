the deck low enough and to do that is to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.470 
the deck low enough and to do that is to
put<00:00:29.039> small<00:00:29.310> tires<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:31.489> go<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.520> Torsen

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
put small tires on and go with Torsen

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.569 
put small tires on and go with Torsen
and<00:00:33.960> where<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.469> drop<00:00:34.680> kind<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> drop

and where I can drop kind of have a drop

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.209 
and where I can drop kind of have a drop
axle<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.510> rid<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> spring<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.040> see

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
axle get rid of the spring you can see

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.440 
axle get rid of the spring you can see
the<00:00:38.399> pivot<00:00:38.640> fitting<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.860> how<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> works

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
the pivot fitting here how that works

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.569 
the pivot fitting here how that works
the<00:00:42.450> sail<00:00:42.660> boat<00:00:42.870> trailer<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.129> video<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the sail boat trailer I have a video of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.150 
the sail boat trailer I have a video of
explains<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.300> need<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:45.930> articulation<00:00:46.649> but

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
explains the need for articulation but

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
explains the need for articulation but
also<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:48.120> one's<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.629> pivot<00:00:48.780> way<00:00:49.050> up

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
also this one's going to pivot way up

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
also this one's going to pivot way up
and<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and get out of the way you can kind of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.689 
and get out of the way you can kind of
see<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.270> mimicked<00:00:51.750> mimic<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
see it mimicked mimic there with the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.569 
see it mimicked mimic there with the
sail<00:00:54.149> opening<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> power<00:00:54.960> button<00:00:55.199> over<00:00:55.410> there

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
sail opening the power button over there

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.619 
sail opening the power button over there
so<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:57.300> gonna<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.629> galvanized<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.629> aluminum

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
so it's gonna be galvanized and aluminum

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.340 
so it's gonna be galvanized and aluminum
you<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.680> when<00:01:01.829> all<00:01:01.859> aluminum<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:03.780> will<00:01:04.049> float

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you know when all aluminum it will float

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.910 
you know when all aluminum it will float
with<00:01:04.769> six<00:01:05.489> tires<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.119> three<00:01:06.360> axles<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
with six tires and three axles and that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.950 
with six tires and three axles and that
can<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:08.369> hard<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.760> part<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can be pretty hard to part to get the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.380 
can be pretty hard to part to get the
boat<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> trailers<00:01:11.159> flooding<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
boat on when the trailers flooding so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.590 
boat on when the trailers flooding so
where<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.869> main<00:01:13.080> tube<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.590> steel<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.600> it's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
where that main tube is steel which it's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.950 
where that main tube is steel which it's
about<00:01:15.900> twice<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> thickness<00:01:17.720> one<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> those

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
about twice a thickness one of those

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.899 
about twice a thickness one of those
tubes<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.650> old<00:01:19.890> trailer<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
tubes on that old trailer so I'm kind of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.940 
tubes on that old trailer so I'm kind of
going<00:01:21.090> well<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.930> about<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> same<00:01:22.500> mount

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
going well that's about the same mount

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.450 
going well that's about the same mount
material<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> had<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.439> should<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.220> strong

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
material that I had and should be strong

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.179 
material that I had and should be strong
enough<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.420> boat<00:01:28.140> hull<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
enough now that boat hull is going to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
enough now that boat hull is going to
actually<00:01:29.280> sit<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.329> trains<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.750> gonna<00:01:30.900> sit<00:01:31.170> on

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
these are tourists and axles instead of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.760 
these are tourists and axles instead of
spring<00:01:53.360> just<00:01:54.360> bullet<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> frame

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
spring just bullet right to the frame

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130 
spring just bullet right to the frame
they're<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.460> simple<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:57.840> there's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
they're really simple and then there's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.270 
they're really simple and then there's
the<00:01:59.299> arm<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.110> pitch<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.439> arm<00:02:01.829> up

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
the arm you can pitch the arm up

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.750 
the arm you can pitch the arm up
