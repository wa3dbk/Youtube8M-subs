00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
don't like paint just pull your needle
back<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.350> needles<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:43.860> expensive<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
back because needles are expensive to

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.609 
back because needles are expensive to
make<00:01:45.119> sure<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.570> sticky<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.990> couldn't<00:01:46.530> be

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
make sure it's not sticky it couldn't be

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.130 
make sure it's not sticky it couldn't be
can<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.070> seeking<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.899> make<00:01:49.110> sure

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
can be seeking out but just make sure

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.280 
can be seeking out but just make sure
it's<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.470> sticking<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:49.950> too<00:01:50.130> much

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
it's not sticking out too much

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.470 
it's not sticking out too much
and<00:01:51.920> then<00:01:52.490> what<00:01:52.910> you<00:01:52.970> want<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.120> do<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.330> just

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
and then what you want to do is just

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.070 
and then what you want to do is just
pour<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:53.720> bit<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.960> thinners<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:55.810> this<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:56.960> why

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
pour a bit of thinners on it this is why

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.510 
pour a bit of thinners on it this is why
you<00:01:57.140> need<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.350> pull<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.650> back<00:01:57.830> as<00:01:58.040> soon<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.400> get

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
you need to pull it back as soon you get

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.850 
you need to pull it back as soon you get
the<00:01:58.670> towel<00:01:58.910> or<00:01:59.420> your<00:01:59.690> rag<00:01:59.900> order<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.530> you<00:02:00.740> just

the towel or your rag order and you just

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.590 
the towel or your rag order and you just
put<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.130> on<00:02:01.190> there<00:02:01.400> just<00:02:01.940> give<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.150> light<00:02:02.330> rub

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
put it on there just give a light rub

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.650 
put it on there just give a light rub
and<00:02:03.440> take<00:02:03.650> it<00:02:03.770> off<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:04.790> completely

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
and take it off and it's completely

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.310 
and take it off and it's completely
clean<00:02:07.119> then<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.240> can<00:02:08.420> let<00:02:08.509> can<00:02:09.110> let<00:02:09.229> the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
clean then you can let can let the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.650 
clean then you can let can let the
needle<00:02:09.560> back<00:02:09.710> out<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.160> put<00:02:10.520> all<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.600> way

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
needle back out so you put all the way

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.550 
needle back out so you put all the way
back<00:02:11.840> salt<00:02:12.170> saline<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.330> then<00:02:14.540> let<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.410> out

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
back salt saline and then let it out

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.430 
back salt saline and then let it out
again<00:02:16.660> then<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.690> would<00:02:17.870> come<00:02:18.020> back<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.350> your

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
again then you would come back to your

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.420 
again then you would come back to your
little<00:02:18.560> cap<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:20.000> got<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> bit<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.390> pain<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.720> it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
little cap it's got a bit of pain in it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.560

bit through it um all the way colors i
think<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:31.310> are<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.300> get<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> an<00:02:33.170> airbrush

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
think they are you can get a an airbrush

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.170 
think they are you can get a an airbrush
cleaner<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.459> basically<00:02:34.760> just

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
cleaner and you just basically just

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.230 
cleaner and you just basically just
leave<00:02:35.600> your<00:02:35.750> airbrush<00:02:36.020> in<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.860> cop<00:02:37.209> but<00:02:38.209> i
