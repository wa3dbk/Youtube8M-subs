mascara<00:02:07.580> wand<00:02:07.670> sometimes<00:02:08.509> doesn't<00:02:08.959> get<00:02:09.520> and

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
mascara wand sometimes doesn't get and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.010 
mascara wand sometimes doesn't get and
it<00:02:10.670> coats<00:02:11.260> right<00:02:12.260> at<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.530> root<00:02:13.570> which<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.600> nice

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
it coats right at the root which is nice

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.430 
it coats right at the root which is nice
because<00:02:15.470> sometimes<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.510> mascara<00:02:17.989> wands

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
because sometimes the mascara wands

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.880 
because sometimes the mascara wands
don't<00:02:18.650> always<00:02:18.860> get<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.550> deep<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.860> then<00:02:21.860> I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
don't always get that deep and then I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.910 
don't always get that deep and then I
also<00:02:22.130> like<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.489> coat<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.970> bottom<00:02:23.120> lashes<00:02:23.920> with

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
also like to coat the bottom lashes with

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.530 
also like to coat the bottom lashes with
a<00:02:24.950> big<00:02:25.250> one<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.820> sometimes<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:26.450> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
a big one like this sometimes it's a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.750 
a big one like this sometimes it's a
little<00:02:26.750> bit<00:02:26.900> harder<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.320> get<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.430> bottom

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
little bit harder to get the bottom

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.720 
little bit harder to get the bottom
lashes<00:02:29.260> or<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.530> can<00:02:30.680> get<00:02:30.800> really<00:02:31.040> messy<00:02:31.280> so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
lashes or you can get really messy so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.660 
lashes or you can get really messy so
that's<00:02:31.940> where<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.989> comes<00:02:33.320> in<00:02:33.590> nicely

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.150 

just<00:02:38.450> gets<00:02:38.690> enough<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.230> there<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.740> now's<00:02:39.950> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
just gets enough on there so now's the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.000 
just gets enough on there so now's the
part<00:02:40.400> where<00:02:41.300> I'm<00:02:41.450> going<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:42.020> be<00:02:42.140> doing<00:02:42.319> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
part where I'm going to be doing the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.040 
part where I'm going to be doing the
liner<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.500> today<00:02:45.500> I'm<00:02:45.709> using<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:46.130> gel<00:02:46.340> liner

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050

you're doing it on yourself you just
need<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.910> figure<00:03:08.090> out<00:03:08.209> where<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.480> position

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
get to the base of the lash because you

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.479 
get to the base of the lash because you
can<00:03:19.340> always<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:20.620> always<00:03:21.620> go<00:03:21.830> back<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.280> it's

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
can always I always go back in it's

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.720 
can always I always go back in it's
never<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:23.150> one<00:03:23.600> continual<00:03:24.470> line<00:03:24.680> feel<00:03:25.610> like

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
never just one continual line feel like

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.570 
never just one continual line feel like
it<00:03:25.880> gets<00:03:26.090> cleaner<00:03:26.530> if<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.680> pay<00:03:27.860> attention<00:03:27.980> more

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
it gets cleaner if I pay attention more

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.789 
it gets cleaner if I pay attention more
to<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.910> top<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.510> line<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.959> then<00:03:30.410> go<00:03:30.590> back

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
to the top of the line and then go back

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.830 
to the top of the line and then go back
in<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.069> fix<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.400> bottom<00:03:31.640> or<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:32.330> depending<00:03:32.510> on

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
in and fix the bottom or so depending on

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.410 
in and fix the bottom or so depending on
how<00:03:32.989> dramatic<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.620> look<00:03:33.799> you<00:03:33.980> want<00:03:34.220> if<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:35.180> want

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
how dramatic a look you want if you want

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.920 
how dramatic a look you want if you want
a<00:03:35.690> big<00:03:36.290> more<00:03:36.560> modern<00:03:37.040> cat<00:03:37.340> eye<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:38.330> can<00:03:38.510> you

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
a big more modern cat eye you can you

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.870 
a big more modern cat eye you can you
know<00:03:39.019> keep<00:03:39.260> pulling<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.890> out<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.730> whole

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
know keep pulling it out but the whole

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.449 
know keep pulling it out but the whole
idea<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:42.200> really<00:03:42.380> want<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.680> arch<00:03:43.160> it

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
idea is that you really want to arch it

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.750 
idea is that you really want to arch it
up<00:03:43.609> however<00:03:43.910> big<00:03:44.540> or<00:03:44.930> however<00:03:45.170> angled<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.519> go

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
up however big or however angled you go

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.509 
up however big or however angled you go
with<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.120> keep<00:03:47.359> it<00:03:47.510> going<00:03:47.540> up<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.100> keeps<00:03:49.280> the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
with it keep it going up so it keeps the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.300 
with it keep it going up so it keeps the
eye<00:03:49.549> open<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:51.100> then<00:03:52.100> I'm<00:03:52.519> just<00:03:52.579> going<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.090> pull

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
eye open and then I'm just going to pull

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.949 
eye open and then I'm just going to pull
it<00:03:55.310> up<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.730> little<00:03:55.850> bit<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.359> fit<00:03:57.079> in<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:58.840> let<00:03:59.840> it

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
it up a little bit and fit in I let it

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.440 
it up a little bit and fit in I let it
go<00:04:00.140> out<00:04:00.380> let<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.489> brush<00:04:01.730> this<00:04:02.000> thin<00:04:02.209> brush

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
does that really great and then for a

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.849 
does that really great and then for a
man<00:04:07.459> then<00:04:07.670> again<00:04:08.120> it's<00:04:08.299> personal<00:04:08.870> choice<00:04:09.260> but

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859

inside of her life
so<00:04:14.980> for<00:04:15.980> her<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.489> completes<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.150> look<00:04:17.450> this<00:04:17.690> is

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
so for her it completes the look this is

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
right on the inside but it really

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.630 
right on the inside but it really
depends<00:04:24.960> how<00:04:25.140> deep<00:04:25.410> or<00:04:25.620> intense<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.220> want<00:04:26.250> the
