00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.600
 new sloth the video today is there 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.760
 something special for me and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.000
 Although mountain view in the sugar-free 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.429
 Variation here is even on it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 that means the bottle is still here 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 from my last london trip of it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.480
 now six seven months ago 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.760
 I have two very cool monju varieties 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.400
 bought that is now one of them me 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.349
 but wanted only a few fan packages 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.150
 unpack and also toast 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.090
 thank you very much at this point before me 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.399
 i am dedicated to the next fan package i am 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 but another two energy drinks and three 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.250
 such things here of me still 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.540
 push in between 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
 so do not worry so will 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 unpacked and you know it I am one 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
 huge mountain view prey 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.649
 I think three drinks for the lonely 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 island there would be mountain view and 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.340
 I think there's a lot of free students here 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.280
 not at all and I personally can 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.530
 also do not ever remember anywhere 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 sugar-free mountain you drunk too 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.800
 to have 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.570
 if I look at it now and see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.400
 a kilocalorie to 100 milliliters 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.830
 So schwant me evil really that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.549
 this sorry taste i hope tomorrow 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.350
 you 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.689
 they have something else 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.430
 but I do not think so 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.490
 really because you know it mountain 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 view belongs to the pepsi group and who 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.790
 because the pepsi light varieties and everything 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.180
 probably knows the white probably 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 will be back to us this sweet and so on 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.799
 expect hydrogen there 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.020
 Otherwise, of course, the stuff has caffeine 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.759
 but he is less than imagined 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.070
 no energy drink but mountain you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.340
 accordingly, 19 milligrams of caffeine 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.759
 to 100 milliliters and otherwise that is 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.950
 of course, this neon again 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.530
 shining green yellow from the egg we what 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.000
 everyone from the bottle to me 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.159
 personally, of course, I prefer one 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 can drinkers i find drinks from the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.100
 dose taste even with a difference again 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.350
 a bit better than his 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.119
 bottle but what the hell of the design 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.040
 I thought it was good that you were there directly 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.750
 also can see through the gray calm that 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.110
 is not the normal mountain view there 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.619
 that is something else like this and now 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.510
 her key, of course, first 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.950
 This green shines so beautiful above all else 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.319
 If I'm not here now, you do not say that 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 All the light of the green t shirt 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:23.409
 right now I'm snooping 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.060
 yes it smells like normal mountain view 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:29.540
 I would almost imagine that 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.799
 that judging is different than that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
 normal mountain view that can of course 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.340
 also at the s.der bottle are there 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 it's a bit like there is something in it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.420
 so it does not smell like normal 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.879
 so my smell so if he tells me now 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.260
 under the trunk and my eyes closed 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.959
 I would say mountain view though 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.010
 Something is not quite natural 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.900
 we have a bottle from where rhine 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.950
 but we can look pour 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.579
 Of course 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.019
 and that's how you see it outside 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.579
 the bottle out there are then many 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.409
 Disappointed if you have this 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.629
 unpack luminous things 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.099
 I would almost say that that 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.750
 sorry for a whole corner 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.400
 looks different than the normal one 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.440
 is currently on the camera no 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.220
 a bit green over it 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.900
 really is not a bubble from as soon as 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.430
 So bubbles not as a few glasses 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.019
 sat down but still down 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.480
 otherwise clear now but where there 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.629
 I would also once again smells very briefly 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.250
 I do not smell different like 100% 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:38.599
 normal mountain youth but now 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:42.949
 mountain user free it is completely normal 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:52.810
 Sorry sweetener stuff taste of it there 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:52.810
 the bad thing is, you keep it 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.889
 normally yes is in the zero or 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.139
 light products mostly so long as one 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.139
 in the beginning drinks and it stays that way 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.640
 it tastes like that 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.739
 this taste always comes 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.260
 only if you already have it 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.719
 has swallowed down the problem is 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.340
 Here I do not know here on the 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:20.959
 Idea if I drink it that it is 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.280
 this is so normal to wonder 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.830
 Mountain view with full calories 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.080
 would act that is already taste 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.729
 unlike the normal mountain view 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.840
 So right in the beginning I hope you 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.530
 know what I mean 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.030
 you can do that a bit 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.680
 understand and from the experience too 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.330
 already made when I taste in 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.669
 the first in the first second where I am 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.620
 in the mouth had to evaluate that 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.440
 that would be mountain view for me 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.180
 but does not somehow warn new species 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.830
 So no original mount you can taste it 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.830
 if something is wrong, that will be directly to me 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:58.880
 Clear when I swallow and after 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.560
 three wins it is still one 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.699
 little bit of that breath of that memory 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.639
 from the mountain view 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.919
 that remains on the lip that has one 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.560
 also still on the back here and 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:14.690
 So next to her you realize that it's murder, though 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.789
 that only noticeable to 10 20 80 90 percent 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.159
 the taste he is in the mouth off 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.039
 This one says this normal grief 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.349
 taste this sugar-free where why 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:28.150
 still no solution was found 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.150
 that tastes better sensible 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.750
 no sorry even if the whole bottle 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.870
 now here with 500 milliliters then 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.770
 just five calories has none 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.380
 chance 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.039
 I do not want to drink that and I do 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.020
 am shocked that it is mountain view 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.120
 in this sugarless disgusting variation 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.280
 is that then I say like all 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.810
 other sugar-free drinks too 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.300
 tastes or a large part there is yes 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.590
 here and there we took two three exceptions 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:05.300
 have been terminated for 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:08.630
 but this sorry city ​​is it no 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.039
 no no no imported from england 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.380
 saved up for a long time 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.389
 but I knew it would be dangerous 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.849
 at but sugar-free product for it 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.980
 can i promise you the next one 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.140

 the next word about yourself 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.280
 The fridge was so looking forward to it 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.050
 I am correct and I am now 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.090
 all the months really pulled together 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.230
 not just that way and then 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.240
 I could not stand it anymore but 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.280
 the next one will be right so me 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.740
 At least I hope that's right

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.530
