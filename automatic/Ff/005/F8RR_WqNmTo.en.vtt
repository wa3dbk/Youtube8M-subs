00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi to all my friends i am ex and praise 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.180
 I am here to introduce myself again 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.389
 video that the boys is second episode 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.830
 of the series road to one million consti 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.960
 precisely that particular evening in the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.219
 which I will trade and I will try 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.350
 just to get to a million 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.029
 credits and maybe giving me advice but 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.340
 above all players to be able to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.779
 use during the sale 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.850
 however privatize I wanted to remind you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 pass it wired.com site interested in 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 buy the fifa caddy and use 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.840
 the axel code precisely as a discount with 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 I recommend axel with two anyway 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.410
 guys here we are to present this 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 new episode and I want to tell you immediately 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.100
 one thing in this episode you will see 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.180
 this is really strange prices 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.649
 because to all the clips 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.510
 sorry for the repetition of the words of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.160
 I had made this episode I had it 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.030
 recorded even before it went 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 offline 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.500
 the web app market on xbox xbox 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.949
 so I recommend you don't go 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.329
 pay attention to the cost of the players o 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.520
 better how many I bought a player 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.350
 by those who sell it because now you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.250
 they are raised much more than anything else 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.170
 tends to players I have used 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.879
 because in fact they are players there 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.339
 advice though as I have already said 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.229
 many times to make you good at 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.270
 it's not like there are any particular players 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.250
 it can be done with everything in fact principle 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.990
 which takes a card at a price e 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 refer to a much higher price 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.259
 simple, however, if you are interested 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.909
 know which players are used best 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.890
 what the players focused on 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.570
 in this video there are three mainly 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.320
 the first and boilesen left-back 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.479
 Ajax 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.000
 the second is left-back holebas 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 della roma is the third alloy yaya touré 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.920
 of the poor the bomber yapi yapo and ico iac 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 pious I used a sort of trick 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.180
 you can follow it this way because in fact it is 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.460
 I took as cc we change the form 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.079
 precisely by buying i changed a role 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.750
 sorry just by buying the change 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.460
 cc cdc role and resells it dc entries to a 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 really higher price because in fact 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.840
 yapi yapo is usually found as a cdc 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.220
 and since people don't want to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.479
 maybe take it first to the midfielder 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.759
 central that costs less 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.890
 then take the module change enter it 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.530
 and then use it as a 16 low invitation to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.390
 look for the cdc price or better player 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.159
 who has the card tell us if we can 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.549
 say and take it whatever its own 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.560
 price 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.880
 so I recommend you use a lot 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.770
 I have done these change roles now 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.330
 an example we want but you can of course 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.950
 use it with any other 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930
 player then I want to say that in 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.549
 this episode 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.439
 but stretching to make life buys because 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.629
 as I said at the beginning really 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.549
 difficult but then more credits are had 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.469
 better because in fact you can bet or 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.819
 on more players or on less 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.379
 players that cost a little more with 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.590
 which you can obviously do 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.389
 a lot a lot more profit a little more than 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.010
 earnings here I hope you explained to me 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.840
 well anyway guys keep to 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.939
 first to ask you something if someone 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.159
 of you expert in photography like things 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.989
 he wanted precisely that you advised me and 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.659
 or rather I wanted advice on this 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.639
 someone should recommend me one 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.799
 I thought that reflex depends on 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.930
 reflex with maybe not many 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.060
 functionality but that is in the structure 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.680
 reflex that is good for recording 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.389
 in fact I would like to start making videos 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.849
 a little more particular as I have it 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.439
 higher said my dream I do not say that 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.599
 It is to just change disposes 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.459
 make yourself verified but do others too 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.629
 kind of video I already have in mind between 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.370
 precisely I need a very good one 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.469
 camcorder so maybe if you can 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.969
 Apple recommended here as I have already said 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.010
 not a lot of features because otherwise 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.859
 they sell off big money things they do 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.359
 now as I have not told you anyway 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.129
 this here I also wanted to tell you that 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.799
 lately or better in the coming days 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.690
 will bring out more episodes of the break 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.459
 million coins because facts I want them 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.720
 you live the real prices of those 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.909
 players I am in at the moment 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.439
 because if not, I'm not saying it's not useful 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:29.030
 however it could be much more useful if 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.069
 precisely the prices were the real ones 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.209
 and secondly it also began to change 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.609
 method in what sense 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.620
 practically I will go hard I don't say 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.599
 record light pro putting case i 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.379
 i find a good 200 player buy now 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.599
 let's put it this way 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.180
 and what do I do at that time? 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.430
 recording you comment above I sell it 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.019
 stop recording and I will do every 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.370
 time so that I will have to register 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.470
 something in the sense every time 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.030
 I'll take the player I 'll make a comment 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.220
 I will sell it will make a comment again 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.079
 so there will come a kind of complete in 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.150
 direct and you will have to let me know if 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.220
 prefer or not the type of that 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.540
 video, however, here you do not see another 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.250
 player I used in this 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.349
 video used wright phillips 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.329
 english striker of the mls not me 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.859
 mistake and at the beginning used a 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.780
 right back now I don't remember the 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.000
 the German name and what I did 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.340
 practically cinema only 5 at auction 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.349
 I'll do it now maybe it happened 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.419
 so however I will explain the principle to you 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.150
 five at auction we all take a chance to 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.700
 1500 so-called but we take all 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.290
 these 5 and since we are 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.760
 at the beginning maybe in so many people it is not 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.410
 that completes or better not 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.060
 he is very careful about the players he puts 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.680
 he invents so he can even sell them 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.620
 we take them all we put case 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.690
 1500 we put them all at auction 2005 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.190
 so I don't say isfahan pressing because ai 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.990
 pre crisis from a different thread must 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.090
 wait just be sure 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.800
 to have taken all the players and all 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.320
 the cards of the same player but with 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.850
 maybe this method puts them short 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.800
 more then we will put down revenge havens 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.020
 2002 and in a short time you will succeed in 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.850
 sell them all to earn 700 credits 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.040
 it doesn't seem bad to players at all 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.840
 as you can see the role change is used 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.120
 also for other players as it may be 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.380
 lambda wii but it is the moma of hawes 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.300
 excused pardons 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.150
 then there is also another if not me 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.800
 Mexican mistake to drive me now 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.270
 remember how skype rom I recommend you 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.160
 use him because now he isn't 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.410
 you will say but I will use many of them in a 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.150
 future however boys said kasper that 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.830
 this episode has served you 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.960
 I recommend you leave a nice like 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.550
 we have to overcome the likes of 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.720
 Last video, however, I will begin to do the 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 same thing I do in the second 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.290
 channel that then each episode the pacos 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.670
 of del must exceed I like 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.280
 in the previous episode 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.380
 the last life reached 3,337 mi 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.650
 like it seems to 33 Trentino and lollo 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.630
 lol 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.870
 and so I recommend this video must 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.890
 reach 3338 please do it e 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:45.870
 so having said this and I can tell you 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.870
