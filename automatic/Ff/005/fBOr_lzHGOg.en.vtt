00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.110
 the pacific rift motorstorm demo is now available 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.469
 the sequel to this exciting extreme driving game will see the light this 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.640
 next October 28 and the demonstrative version that seen the light for 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.089
 few European users chosen at random or for those who have 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.089
 hired the service has the American Playstation 3 store 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.050
 we do not know in what state of development the demo is but we hope 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.980
 that it's a very, very early version, since the visual result is very far 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 of the shown in the celeste the game 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.840
 the first thing we will see will be the intro made in principle by 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.900
 completely useless scenes to go to the minute choose the game mode and that 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.360
 the vehicle that we want between the three available a ranchera a motorcycle 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 a giant monster trad 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.150
 we started the quarrel and the first thing we see is a textures really 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.940
 worthy of the last generation on the ground that makes us think once again 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.710
 in what state of development is at stake which we hope will 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.710
 change radically in its final version 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.020
 but already put in to who soon we will forget the details for 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.830
 Enjoy the speed and thrilling shooting that are motorcycle racing 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.550
 storm and there is still one hundred percent the spirit of the original game 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.680
 having some slight adjustments to make it more accessible with a 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.900
 control much simpler and arcade like a greater difficulty to overturn 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 our vehicles 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.200
 technically it is a null progress with respect to its first delivery and even 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.050
 Some details have worsened the fluctuation in the auto system 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.270
 shaded vegetation in three dimensions and various dark spots of 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.030
 motorstorm 1 again make an appearance to join with worse textures and 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.030
 a really poor overall finish 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.159
 with a single circuit and three vehicles we can not give some impressions either 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.079
 much more extensive because as we have already said on several occasions that we do 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.619
 much that represents the final quality of the product to put us 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.619
 analyze it thoroughly 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.980
 at the end of October when we have because the final version of the game before 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.789
 our hands that the time will come to judge him 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.849
 Now it's time to enjoy running and pulling the track and needs
