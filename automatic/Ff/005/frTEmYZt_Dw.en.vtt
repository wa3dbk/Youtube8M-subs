00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 hi friends how are you good today we are going to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.740
 create in this tutorial fire and smoke to 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.810
 that's good in principle I'm going to eliminate 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.720
 our initial square 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.780
 and I'm going to add 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.250
 a plan or if you could use any 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.279
 another element was a plan or a is going to be 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.090
 something useful now I'm going to scale it a 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.220
 bit 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:38.100
 and we want to indicate it to this plane 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:41.340
 they will be inside oxer and I will go to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.450
 quick effects or quick effect 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.980
 I'm going to say we care smoke 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.960
 and notice that not only will it put me 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.190
 our planes in a transparent way 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.210
 but it will generate a domain and the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.920
 domain is this square too 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.000
 transparent this cube 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.540
 and that he himself will tell us what 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.630
 it's going to be the place where it shows 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.140
 with our smoke effect that's why 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.590
 It is convenient to install 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.090
 enough between major make my domain 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.360
 greater representation of the smoke I'm going to 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.360
 to have 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.800
 and raising a little bit 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.810
 and now let's take the plane in the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:42.060
 Look, if I go, I always go 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 working in object mode 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:51.610
 and I'm going to the effects see that I have 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.310
 the type of effect and I'm going to say here 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.600
 fail 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.560
 yes game and one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.310
 publicis now to this united and beats 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.310
 notice that there I will see 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 represented 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.740
 directly fire 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.410
 and the smoke as long as I go 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.600
 going forward 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.530
 of the frames 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.530
 it will leave me 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.840
 extending expanding towards the part 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 superior of the domain 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.510
 in fact from here we can go 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:48.790
 modifying some questions the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:51.590
 surface volume the difference 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.900
 the flame 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.610
 we can go playing with each one of these 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.590
 properties to be able to modify 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:07.569
 some details about 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:12.060
 our game and about the effect of smoke 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.060
 well I hope this has served you 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.550
 shortly we will go higher 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.550
 number of tutorials
