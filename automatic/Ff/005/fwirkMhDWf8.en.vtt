00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.469
 attached glands 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.230
 are intended for the preparation of 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.600
 special liquids 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.280
 that attack food 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.039
 and transform them into substances 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.450
 assimilable 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.100
 this gland is nexuses are 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.100
 the salivary glands 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.449
 and the liver 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.810
 the pancreas 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.780
 the salivary glands are 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.780
 parotid glands 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.040
 the maxillary sub 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.239
 here 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.720
 sub lingual there are also small 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.720
 glands 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.940
 inside the mouth they secrete a liquid 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.010
 called saliva 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.000
 starting the digestion of some 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.000
 carbohydrates 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.130
 of the liver 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.359
 is below 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.359
 of the diaphragm muscle 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.440
 to remove the diaphragm below the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.440
 diaphragm muscle and on his right side 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.190
 it's found 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.190
 the liver 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.540
 has multiple functions only 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.460
 we will name the secret linked digestive 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.460
 to a substance called bile 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.950
 the liver then secretes a substance 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.660
 called bile 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.660
 and before reaching the duodenum 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.590
 the bile 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.070
 that leaves the liver flows towards the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.070
 vesicle 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.520
 so that it increases its concentration 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.320
 since the vesicle is responsible for 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.320
 absorb a large part of liquid chulin and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.320
 electrolytes 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.630
 the bile is formed by bilirubin 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.819
 cholesterol and bile salts 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.750
 the latter exercises an action of the fish 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.020
 I tried to decide disintegration of 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.840
 fat particles making them more 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.840
 small so they can be digested later 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.260
 pancreas 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:19.330
 It is located behind the stomach 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.330
 secret pancreatic juice in the duodenum 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.510
 This contains enzymes to digest 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.070
 carbohydrates proteins and fats in addition 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.170
 has a large amount of baking 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.150
 sodium that neutralizes the acid 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.150
 coming from the stomach through the 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.150
 scam 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.000
 and then the attached glands and let's 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.370
 now the peritoneum 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.710
 the peritoneum is a membrane that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.210
 it wraps almost all the organs 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.480
 contained in the abdominal cavity with 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.510
 the purpose of holding them possesses a double 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.140
 wall and secretes a liquid that facilitates 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.660
 the sliding of the organs that 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.050
 they must make some movement with the 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.070
 purpose of carrying out 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.070
 its function
