00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a little bit so that way we aren't

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
a little bit so that way we aren't
putting<00:01:23.040> our<00:01:23.340> tiles<00:01:23.670> right<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> top<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.080> their

another<00:01:36.210> mark<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.920> way<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.369> two

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
another mark so that way we have two

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.310 
another mark so that way we have two
different<00:01:38.790> marks<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.020> run<00:01:40.200> our

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
different marks on here to run our

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
different marks on here to run our
straight<00:01:40.590> line<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.979> we'll<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.579> ahead<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
straight line with we'll go ahead and

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.649 
straight line with we'll go ahead and
choose<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> point<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.579> put<00:01:44.880> another<00:01:44.970> mark<00:01:45.360> in
