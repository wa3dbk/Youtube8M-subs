in the background you know anyway
there's<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.550> little<00:02:19.880> air<00:02:20.060> dial<00:02:20.480> there<00:02:22.210> it's<00:02:23.210> on

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
there's a little air dial there it's on

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.920 
there's a little air dial there it's on
hi<00:02:23.630> there<00:02:24.050> now<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.980> indicate<00:02:25.340> solar<00:02:25.730> power<00:02:26.030> so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
hi there now to indicate solar power so

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.830 
hi there now to indicate solar power so
you<00:02:26.960> got<00:02:27.140> high<00:02:27.350> medium<00:02:28.070> low<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.460> charge<00:02:28.810> when<00:02:29.810> I

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you got high medium low in charge when I

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.680 
you got high medium low in charge when I
bought<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.350> watch<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.740> was<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:30.980> medium<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.660> I

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
bought the watch it was on medium but I

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.120 
bought the watch it was on medium but I
put<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.960> out<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.200> Sun<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.800> bit

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
put it out in the Sun for a bit

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.680 
put it out in the Sun for a bit
let's<00:02:34.280> now<00:02:34.460> backhand<00:02:34.880> hi<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:36.440> that's<00:02:36.830> fine<00:02:37.690> now

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
let's now backhand hi so that's fine now

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.830 
let's now backhand hi so that's fine now
it<00:02:39.050> also<00:02:39.290> has<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:42.050> atomic<00:02:42.320> here<00:02:42.680> timekeeping

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
it also has the atomic here timekeeping

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.270 
it also has the atomic here timekeeping
so<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.930> receives<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.440> radio<00:02:45.740> signal<00:02:46.010> every

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
so it receives a radio signal every

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.150 
so it receives a radio signal every
night<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.660> keeps<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.160> bang-on

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
night and that keeps it bang-on

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.670 
night and that keeps it bang-on
up-to-date<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.120> keeps<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.050> time<00:02:51.230> completely

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
up-to-date and keeps the time completely

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.430 
up-to-date and keeps the time completely
accurate<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.690> press<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.050> button<00:02:54.110> here

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
accurate you just press this button here

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.220 
accurate you just press this button here
and<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.130> tells<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:55.670> when<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.850> last<00:02:56.230> update

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
and it tells you when the last update

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.390 
and it tells you when the last update
was<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.800> was<00:02:57.890> at<00:02:58.010> 202<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.970> morning<00:02:59.420> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
was and it was at 202 this morning and

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.780 
was and it was at 202 this morning and
that<00:03:01.400> happens<00:03:01.700> every<00:03:01.790> night<00:03:02.060> just<00:03:02.690> once<00:03:02.900> and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
that happens every night just once and

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.330 
that happens every night just once and
you<00:03:04.790> know<00:03:04.910> it<00:03:05.030> keeps<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.450> time<00:03:06.340> completely

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
you know it keeps the time completely

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.270 
you know it keeps the time completely
accurate<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.910> second<00:03:08.270> all<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.570> time<00:03:08.780> so

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
accurate to the second all the time so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.590 
accurate to the second all the time so
these<00:03:10.280> watches<00:03:10.790> with<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:11.360> feature

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
these watches with this feature

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.199 
these watches with this feature
effectively<00:03:12.560> are<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:13.040> most<00:03:13.220> accurate

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
effectively are the most accurate

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.890 
effectively are the most accurate
