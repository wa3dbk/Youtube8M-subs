00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
and they decided on Mark Hamill now

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.640 
and they decided on Mark Hamill now
apparently<00:01:41.990> what<00:01:42.260> they're<00:01:42.380> going<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.560> be

doing<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:43.160> they're<00:01:43.430> going<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.640> be<00:01:43.730> doing<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
doing is they're going to be doing the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.590

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.750 
because he is later Kelvin World War two
um<00:04:38.990> but<00:04:39.990> in<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.260> comics<00:04:40.680> he<00:04:40.860> was<00:04:41.010> killed<00:04:41.340> I

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
um but in the comics he was killed I

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.690 
um but in the comics he was killed I
think<00:04:42.330> by<00:04:42.450> Baron<00:04:42.810> Zemo<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.500> jet<00:04:44.280> plane<00:04:44.520> they

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
think by Baron Zemo in jet plane they

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.180 
think by Baron Zemo in jet plane they
decided<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.360> really<00:04:45.740> mesh<00:04:46.740> with<00:04:46.770> all<00:04:47.040> the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
decided to really mesh with all the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.520 
decided to really mesh with all the
origins<00:04:47.550> together<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.360> Batroc<00:04:48.960> the<00:04:49.020> leaper<00:04:49.170> is

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
origins together so Batroc the leaper is

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.380 
origins together so Batroc the leaper is
going<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.860> be<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.070> one<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:50.340> kills<00:04:50.580> him<00:04:50.820> which

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
going to be the one that kills him which

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.120 
going to be the one that kills him which
sets<00:04:51.780> Captain<00:04:52.440> America<00:04:52.470> down<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:52.950> whole

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
sets Captain America down this whole

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.330 
sets Captain America down this whole
vengeance<00:04:53.790> pace<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:55.190> apparently<00:04:56.190> what's

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
vengeance pace and apparently what's

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.280 
vengeance pace and apparently what's
going<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.550> be<00:04:56.610> happening<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:57.240> because<00:04:57.300> he<00:04:58.170> has

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
going to be happening is because he has

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.350 
going to be happening is because he has
that<00:04:58.320> super<00:04:58.800> ability<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.700> jump<00:04:59.970> what<00:05:00.240> he's

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
that super ability to jump what he's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.840 
that super ability to jump what he's
apparently<00:05:00.570> going<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:00.990> be<00:05:01.080> doing<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.680> his<00:05:02.460> foot

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
apparently going to be doing is his foot

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.230 
apparently going to be doing is his foot
is<00:05:03.060> literally<00:05:03.540> going<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> impale<00:05:05.240> through

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
is literally going to impale through

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.350 
is literally going to impale through
Bucky's<00:05:06.690> chest<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:07.830> then<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.640> kick<00:05:09.060> him<00:05:09.180> off

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
Bucky's chest and then just kick him off

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.680 
Bucky's chest and then just kick him off
he<00:05:09.600> flies<00:05:09.990> off<00:05:10.290> like<00:05:10.530> 300<00:05:11.370> miles<00:05:11.550> away<00:05:11.820> so

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
he flies off like 300 miles away so

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.090 
he flies off like 300 miles away so
that's<00:05:12.840> pretty<00:05:13.080> much<00:05:13.230> happens<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.710> Bucky<00:05:13.920> and

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
that's pretty much happens to Bucky and

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.590 
that's pretty much happens to Bucky and
that's<00:05:14.250> where<00:05:14.490> Captain<00:05:14.940> America<00:05:15.210> kind<00:05:15.510> of

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
that's where Captain America kind of

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.400 
that's where Captain America kind of
goes<00:05:15.720> rogue<00:05:16.200> for<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.560> bit<00:05:16.740> um<00:05:17.540> and<00:05:18.540> there<00:05:19.170> is

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
goes rogue for a bit um and there is
