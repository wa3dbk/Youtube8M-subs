00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.670 
the way and and I play in quite a weird
tuning<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.720> just<00:00:27.960> thought<00:00:28.170> I'd<00:00:28.320> start<00:00:28.590> by

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
tuning so I just thought I'd start by

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.380 
tuning so I just thought I'd start by
giving<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> tutorial<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> tuning<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
giving you a tutorial of the tuning that

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.930 
giving you a tutorial of the tuning that
I<00:00:30.480> playing<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.529> you're<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.800> standard<00:00:32.489> just

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
I playing so if you're in standard just

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.150 
I playing so if you're in standard just

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160

but<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.129> think<00:00:47.250> um<00:00:47.600> open<00:00:48.600> tunings<00:00:49.340> our

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
but I just think um open tunings our

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.090 
but I just think um open tunings our
walk<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.530> sort<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
walk and if you sort of this just you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.229 
walk and if you sort of this just you
and<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.309> guitar<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.790> really<00:00:53.970> take<00:00:54.149> your

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and your guitar I can really take your

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
and your guitar I can really take your
part<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.750> I'll<00:00:54.899> show<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.170> how<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> one

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
part so I'll show you how to do the one

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
part so I'll show you how to do the one
I<00:00:55.980> used<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.600> you've<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.960> start<00:00:58.199> by<00:00:59.210> tuning

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
I used so you've got to start by tuning

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
I used so you've got to start by tuning
your<00:01:00.920> ie<00:01:02.390> down<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.690> D<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.190> can<00:01:05.430> use<00:01:05.640> your

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
your ie down to a D so you can use your

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.310 
your ie down to a D so you can use your
D<00:01:06.030> string<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.250> octave<00:01:08.250> M<00:01:09.560> Gaiden<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> that's

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
D string as a octave M Gaiden so that's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
D string as a octave M Gaiden so that's
down<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> deep<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> can't<00:01:17.399> hear<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.729> just

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
down to deep if you can't hear that just

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.740 
down to deep if you can't hear that just
go<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.479> twelfth<00:01:18.780> fret<00:01:18.929> on<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.229> D<00:01:19.350> string

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
go to the twelfth fret on your D string

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.980 
go to the twelfth fret on your D string
that's<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> same<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.780> you've<00:01:24.780> got<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that's the same and then you've got a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.249 
that's the same and then you've got a
tune<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.440> B<00:01:25.679> string<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.910> a<00:01:27.240> D<00:01:27.539> string<00:01:27.960> so

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
tune your B string up to a D string so

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.630 
tune your B string up to a D string so
it's<00:01:28.410> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.770> same<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it's going to be the same as the and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.880 
it's going to be the same as the and
this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.759> quite<00:01:30.000> heavy<00:01:30.330> on<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.660> guitar<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:30.990> I'd

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
this is quite heavy on the guitar so I'd

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.100 
this is quite heavy on the guitar so I'd
recommend<00:01:32.429> using<00:01:32.640> sort<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> custom<00:01:33.899> light

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
recommend using sort of custom light

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.730 
recommend using sort of custom light
maybe<00:01:34.710> 11<00:01:35.100> gauge<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> extra<00:01:35.820> strings<00:01:36.149> and

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
maybe 11 gauge and extra strings and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.690 
maybe 11 gauge and extra strings and
because<00:01:37.740> if<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> haven't<00:01:38.070> got<00:01:38.220> new<00:01:38.369> strings

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
because if you haven't got new strings

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.930 
because if you haven't got new strings
then<00:01:38.880> they're<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.149> snaps

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
then they're just snaps

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.230 
then they're just snaps
[Music]

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.360 

they're<00:01:47.240> both<00:01:47.420> on<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.630> same<00:01:47.720> note<00:01:48.140> now<00:01:48.380> and

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
they're both on the same note now and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.340 
they're both on the same note now and
the<00:01:49.520> D<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.300> G<00:01:50.330> you're<00:01:50.750> leaving<00:01:51.050> us<00:01:51.170> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
the D and the G you're leaving us and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.359 
the D and the G you're leaving us and
say<00:01:52.030> see<00:01:53.030> if<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.660> minute<00:01:53.900> you've<00:01:53.990> got

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
say see if the minute you've got

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.730 
say see if the minute you've got
which<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.030> nice<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:57.170> then<00:01:57.380> you're<00:01:57.530> tuning

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
which is nice and then you're tuning

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.599 
which is nice and then you're tuning
your<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.299> down<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.570> G<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:03.159> again<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.460> use

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
your a down to a G and again you can use

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.160 
your a down to a G and again you can use
your<00:02:04.640> g<00:02:04.939> string<00:02:05.090> as<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> guide<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:08.869> can<00:02:09.080> do

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
your g string as a guide and you can do

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.089 
your g string as a guide and you can do
in<00:02:09.319> octaves<00:02:09.739> again<00:02:12.640> nice<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.830> we're<00:02:15.950> nearly

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
in octaves again nice and we're nearly

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.910 
in octaves again nice and we're nearly
at<00:02:16.190> em<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.849> so<00:02:17.510> now<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.780> low<00:02:18.049> E<00:02:18.080> you've<00:02:18.739> got

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
at em and so now the low E you've got

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.530 
at em and so now the low E you've got
tuned<00:02:19.160> down<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.549> C<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.180> one's<00:02:20.390> quite

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
tuned down to C and this one's quite

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.089 
tuned down to C and this one's quite
difficult<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.170> hear<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.560> you're<00:02:21.650> not<00:02:21.799> used<00:02:21.980> to

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
difficult to hear if you're not used to

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.280 
difficult to hear if you're not used to
the<00:02:22.220> tuning<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.390> basically<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:23.989> bring<00:02:24.170> it

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the tuning so basically you can bring it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.949 
the tuning so basically you can bring it
down<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.470> DD<00:02:28.329> but<00:02:29.329> then<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:29.599> got<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.780> go<00:02:29.930> down

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
down to DD but then it's got to go down

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:41.550 
down to DD but then it's got to go down
another<00:02:30.440> step<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:31.010> C<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.640> that's<00:02:40.700> quite<00:02:40.940> nice

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
another step to C so that's quite nice

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.170 
another step to C so that's quite nice
um<00:02:45.910> yeah<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.120> that's<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.390> tuning<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.840> use<00:02:48.140> and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
um yeah so that's the tuning I use and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.000 
um yeah so that's the tuning I use and
I've<00:02:50.180> got<00:02:50.420> capo<00:02:50.780> third<00:02:51.079> fret<00:02:51.379> which<00:02:51.560> means<00:02:51.799> in

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
I've got capo third fret which means in

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.940 
I've got capo third fret which means in
b-flat

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
b-flat

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.990

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.460 

and<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.090> haven't<00:02:59.330> got<00:02:59.450> very<00:02:59.480> high<00:02:59.840> vocal<00:03:00.290> range

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
and I haven't got very high vocal range

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.960 
and I haven't got very high vocal range
so<00:03:00.739> if<00:03:00.800> you've<00:03:00.920> got<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.099> higher<00:03:01.280> range<00:03:01.550> submit

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
so if you've got a higher range submit

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.699 
so if you've got a higher range submit
you<00:03:02.090> could<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:03.050> original<00:03:03.260> key

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
you could do it in the original key

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.809 
you could do it in the original key
which<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.129> C<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.269> can't<00:03:05.540> see<00:03:05.780> it

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.490
