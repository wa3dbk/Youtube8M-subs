it<00:00:27.180> goes<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.539> keep<00:00:27.720> getting<00:00:27.990> better<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
it goes to keep getting better and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
it goes to keep getting better and
you're<00:00:30.029> working<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.599> often<00:00:31.529> quite<00:00:31.920> mind<00:00:32.279> you

two things then they go and they're very
focused<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.780> improving<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:37.110> aspects<00:00:37.530> there

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
continually improving getting look at

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
continually improving getting look at
improving<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.370> Odin<00:00:50.610> handicapper<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.300> be

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
improving the Odin handicapper would be

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
improving the Odin handicapper would be
similar<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.230> often<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.129> actually<00:00:53.430> happens

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
similar but often what actually happens

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.560 
similar but often what actually happens
is<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.980> hugged<00:00:55.980> offers<00:00:56.430> ambition<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
is it hugged offers ambition with the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.410 
is it hugged offers ambition with the
game<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.260> slightly<00:00:58.530> different<00:00:59.420> it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
game can be slightly different it's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
game can be slightly different it's
interesting<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.410> players<00:01:01.829> are

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
interesting that not all players are

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
interesting that not all players are
actually<00:01:02.670> necessarily<00:01:03.629> interested<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
actually necessarily interested in

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.510 
actually necessarily interested in
improving<00:01:04.470> their<00:01:04.769> score<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> chanukah<00:01:06.229> a

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
improving their score or the chanukah a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
improving their score or the chanukah a
lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.610> times<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.330> may<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.570> want

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
lot of times is that they may just want

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.850 
lot of times is that they may just want
to<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.260> rid<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.439> slots<00:01:11.030> with<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.360> better

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
to get rid of slots with for better

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.120 
to get rid of slots with for better
believable<00:01:13.860> further<00:01:14.159> hmm<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.900> therefore

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
believable further hmm so therefore

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
believable further hmm so therefore
therefore<00:01:17.130> how<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.970> work<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.360> their

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
therefore how you go that work in their

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.330 
therefore how you go that work in their
game<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.960> based<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.439> what<00:01:19.920> their<00:01:20.159> actual

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
game will be based on what their actual

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
game will be based on what their actual
goals<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.090> ambitions<00:01:21.540> are<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> guy

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
goals and ambitions are for the guy

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.020 
goals and ambitions are for the guy
right<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.479> also<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.229> need<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> be

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
right and then also you need to be

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
right and then also you need to be
flexible<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.659> much<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.590> often<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
flexible and as much that often the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.080 
flexible and as much that often the
alien<00:01:29.939> handicap

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
alien handicap

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.029 
alien handicap
the<00:01:31.659> same<00:01:31.869> amount<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.140> time<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.380> weapons<00:01:32.829> game

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
the same amount of time to weapons game

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.109 
the same amount of time to weapons game
they've<00:01:33.369> are<00:01:33.579> Jeff<00:01:33.820> over<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.299> battery<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
they've are Jeff over the battery so

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.209 
they've are Jeff over the battery so
what<00:01:37.659> happens<00:01:38.259> is<00:01:38.380> if<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.619> look<00:01:38.829> at<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.070> 15

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
what happens is if you look at the 15

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.279 
what happens is if you look at the 15
what<00:01:40.179> person<00:01:40.630> actually<00:01:40.750> wants<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.200> achieve

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
what person actually wants to achieve

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.340 
what person actually wants to achieve
and<00:01:41.679> improving<00:01:42.009> they<00:01:42.100> go<00:01:42.250> up<00:01:42.490> front<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:44.049> how

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
and improving they go up front to how

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.279 
and improving they go up front to how
much<00:01:44.590> time<00:01:44.890> we've<00:01:45.100> got<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.549> elevated<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.960> then

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
much time we've got to elevated and then

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.709 
much time we've got to elevated and then
you<00:01:47.409> set<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.770> program<00:01:48.369> boasted<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.240> program

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
you set the program boasted a program

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.929 
you set the program boasted a program
based<00:01:50.110> on<00:01:50.409> those<00:01:50.560> two<00:01:50.890> those<00:01:51.250> two<00:01:51.310> areas<00:01:51.640> which

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
based on those two those two areas which

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.179 
based on those two those two areas which
is<00:01:52.090> obviously<00:01:52.390> what<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.990> goals<00:01:53.229> are<00:01:53.469> man<00:01:53.920> I'm

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
is obviously what the goals are man I'm

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.190 
is obviously what the goals are man I'm
like<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.549> put<00:01:54.670> into<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:54.909> mhm<00:01:55.600> eccentric

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
like and put into it mhm eccentric

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.169 
like and put into it mhm eccentric
cetera<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:57.280> primarily<00:01:57.819> would<00:01:58.000> be<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
cetera so that primarily would be the

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.359 
cetera so that primarily would be the
difference<00:01:58.359> between<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.619> two<00:01:59.799> areas<00:02:00.039> of

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
difference between the two areas of

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.870
