00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.570
 technical-tactical version 2.0 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.920
 mold and presenting new graphics 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.900
 new reports 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.770
 Good, I'll open the program here for you. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.430
 see 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.310
 It's what has changed since the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.949
 here I enter with my password is with the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.810
 people who already have software knows how to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.830
 We need our lady can put 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 the file 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.750
 So what you see here has changed. 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.430
 totally the lot of the program here I 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 I will insert the name of my team with the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.390
 power for example I'll put my name 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.530
 I will not put the name of a team and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.320
 saw the Corinthians for example I go 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.129
 put here on the opposing team is 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.390
 put the botafogo championship of arb 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.920
 other result 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.230
 I will not go into details of this 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.379
 criterion that is not good 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.100
 we have 23 players here. 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.140
 given away 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.540
 running from the fifa changes of the loins 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.210
 could have more players 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.040
 It's okay, we have here is variable step 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.570
 wrong pass right design unarmed 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.979
 intersection crossing intersection 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.799
 wrong crossing 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.500
 lack committed lack suffered 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:30.460
 we have headboard 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.729
 defended off with right leg leg 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.210
 left yellow card red card 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.490
 the first ball wins or is lost second 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.470
 ball won or lost 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.789
 here we can zoom in is to 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.830
 get closer 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.990
 depending on each notebook in each 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.649
 you will have to check and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.899
 zoom in or out here to stay on 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.600
 better look inside your computer 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.220
 is he to choose and continue with the same 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.470
 function of others then we just 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.640
 we need to click on the action of each 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.759
 player 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.860
 with each click we will generate one more 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.570
 the report is not governed by the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.310
 player one of the actions of the first time 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.950
 continues the same functions with each click 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.920
 in the sum of our time timer 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.100
 start the game start the game 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.560
 ball to use when using the game is 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.959
 we now have an offensive corner on the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.600
 google and off the defensive chains in 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.680
 group and offside offensive side foul in the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.380
 goal out 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.750
 side defense defensive 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.530
 impediment and in the future 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.990
 we have the technical aspects of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.930
 team then we have pass 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.540
 wrong design headers finalizations 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.400
 trave defended off go right leg 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.130
 left leg card yellow card 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 red quadrants of the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.550
 our opponents are now ours 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.950
 aspects in terms of design quadrants 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.500
 in which there is great of the field was generated 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.310
 against attack and yes or no finalized in 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.220
 goal yes or no loss of possession of ball in 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.500
 what was the standard and was was wasted 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.020
 ball was disarmed we had general 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.350
 against attack yes or no ended yes 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:22.209
 or not go wrong from the quadrant that was 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.790
 Quadrant Finishing Quadrant 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.650
 which was also here the quadrants 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.209
 it's the same thing just clicking you 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.600
 They will have results not to be 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.140
 wasting time I already have the software 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.750
 here it is already with the data ready for 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.280
 I can show you the data 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.290
 so you're seeing the guy here 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.150
 player with his or her actions from the first 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.230
 second pass time wrong one pass 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.510
 certain design of the values total values 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.000
 of the first voting time of the second 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.720
 time 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.750
 the headlines I bring everything 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.870
 in report all is time of possession of 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.230
 ball in the first half time 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.780
 they are already well organized 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.730
 to be printed then only you print 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.650
 that you will play if you do not have the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.170
 results are here 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.560
 how many shares had a 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.390
 each quadrant of the opposing team 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.810
 right here we have a possession graphic 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:26.410
 then 34% in the first half 70 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.000
 in the second is a collective graphic of the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.280
 first time 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 we have here the actions of our team 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.020
 wrong pass right disarm 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.170
 disarmed interception of crosses 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.320
 ciep wrong crossing fault committed 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.700
 already the first ball finalizations and 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.160
 second ball 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.300
 here below the graphics of the opponent 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.270
 the first time 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.090
 here the quadrants of the actions of the first 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.590
 time to remember the first time in the 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.920
 of each quadrant souza 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.230
 here we have a graph for each action 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.670
 technique of each player then by 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.040
 example here goes wrong 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.090
 we have the 23 players logical that the 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.580
 game I will not have 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.410
 we'll have all 23 players playing 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.560
 but here is just for us is an example and 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.320
 we get the results so it 's touch with 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.840
 23 players the value for each pass 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.270
 certain interception then for each action 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.460
 technique we have the values for all 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.790
 players faced this from the first 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.040
 time for the second time we have the 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.130
 same graphics the same the same ones 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.080
 present the results 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.280
 individual second time charts 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.240
 separate 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.400
 It's right and collective graphic for the final 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.370
 from the game to the end of the game then we 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.150
 we have the collective graph of ours here 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.820
 of the opposing team and the quadrants 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.520
