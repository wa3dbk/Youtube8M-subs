it's<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.900> weapon<00:02:57.230> joystick<00:02:57.620> mm-hmm<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.400> have

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
it's a weapon joystick mm-hmm you have

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.530 
it's a weapon joystick mm-hmm you have
here<00:02:59.140> elevation<00:03:00.140> up<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.010> down<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.300> kind

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
here elevation up and down so it's kind
