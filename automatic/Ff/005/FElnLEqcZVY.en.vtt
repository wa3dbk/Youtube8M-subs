okay<00:00:01.530> due<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.550> availability<00:00:03.470> which<00:00:04.470> goes

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
okay due to availability which goes

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.059 
okay due to availability which goes
against<00:00:05.279> my<00:00:05.460> better<00:00:05.670> judgment<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.890> purchased<00:00:07.890> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
against my better judgment I purchased a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.169 
against my better judgment I purchased a
clutch<00:00:08.730> fan<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.780> from<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.620> van<00:00:10.940> from<00:00:11.940> Napa

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
clutch fan for from my van from Napa

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.110 
clutch fan for from my van from Napa
because<00:00:12.690> my<00:00:13.049> old<00:00:13.230> one<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.469> just<00:00:14.160> plain<00:00:14.730> shot

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
because my old one was just plain shot

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.390 
because my old one was just plain shot
and<00:00:16.430> put<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:19.380> actually<00:00:19.619> worked

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and put it on and it actually worked

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.040 
and put it on and it actually worked
good<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> problem<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:24.050> wouldn't

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
good but the problem is it wouldn't

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.380 
good but the problem is it wouldn't
engage<00:00:26.210> until<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.630> temperature

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
engage until my temperature

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.130 
engage until my temperature
my<00:00:29.870> temperature<00:00:30.440> level<00:00:30.800> was<00:00:31.000> almost<00:00:32.000> eight<00:00:32.900> of

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
my temperature level was almost eight of

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.140 
my temperature level was almost eight of
an<00:00:33.230> inch<00:00:33.320> away<00:00:33.590> from<00:00:33.740> the<00:00:34.040> red<00:00:34.250> on<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.940> gauge

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
an inch away from the red on the gauge

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.150 
an inch away from the red on the gauge
and<00:00:36.190> didn't<00:00:37.190> like<00:00:37.400> that<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:38.630> I<00:00:39.110> took<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.010> back

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
and didn't like that so I took it back

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.840 
and didn't like that so I took it back
out<00:00:40.630> actually<00:00:41.630> several<00:00:42.200> times<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.400> was

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
out actually several times and was

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.410 
out actually several times and was
trying<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:44.900> adjust<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:46.550> fan<00:00:46.760> itself<00:00:47.150> is

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
trying to adjust it the fan itself is

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.930 
trying to adjust it the fan itself is
riveted<00:00:47.900> shut<00:00:48.170> so<00:00:48.559> I<00:00:48.830> didn't<00:00:49.460> really<00:00:49.550> want<00:00:49.700> to

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
riveted shut so I didn't really want to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.700 
riveted shut so I didn't really want to
open<00:00:50.090> up<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.600> silicone<00:00:51.080> part<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.650> it<00:00:51.800> but<00:00:53.710> what

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
open up the silicone part of it but what

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.570 
open up the silicone part of it but what
I<00:00:54.739> ended<00:00:55.070> up<00:00:55.190> doing<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:56.800> cutting<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:58.070> new<00:00:58.220> groove

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
I ended up doing is cutting a new groove

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.040 
I ended up doing is cutting a new groove
as<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.120> can<00:00:59.300> see<00:00:59.480> in<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.690> pictures<00:01:00.140> and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
as you can see in the pictures and

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.570 
as you can see in the pictures and
because<00:01:03.050> if<00:01:03.410> I<00:01:03.560> went<00:01:03.770> to<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.009> first<00:01:04.190> groove

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
because if I went to the first groove

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.260 
because if I went to the first groove
above<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:06.229> know<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.590> casting<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.850> was<00:01:08.030> way

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
above you know in the casting it was way

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.999 
above you know in the casting it was way
too<00:01:08.300> much<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.020> clutch<00:01:09.290> fan<00:01:09.560> would<00:01:09.770> never

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
too much the clutch fan would never

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.460 
too much the clutch fan would never
disengage<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.390> cut<00:01:11.660> a<00:01:11.690> new<00:01:11.869> groove<00:01:12.140> as<00:01:12.380> you

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
disengage so I cut a new groove as you

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.830 
disengage so I cut a new groove as you
can<00:01:12.650> see<00:01:12.800> in<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:12.979> pictures<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:14.210> installed<00:01:14.600> it

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
can see in the pictures we installed it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.990 
can see in the pictures we installed it
and<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:15.860> nailed<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:16.790> hit<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.360> sweet<00:01:18.050> spot<00:01:18.110> and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
and I nailed it I hit the sweet spot and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.790 
and I nailed it I hit the sweet spot and
just<00:01:20.000> for<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.630> sake<00:01:20.869> of<00:01:20.899> this<00:01:21.170> video<00:01:21.380> I'm

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
just for the sake of this video I'm

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.820 
just for the sake of this video I'm
going<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.009> demonstrate<00:01:22.360> how<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.750> clutch<00:01:24.080> fan<00:01:24.350> is

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
going to demonstrate how a clutch fan is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.010 
going to demonstrate how a clutch fan is
supposed<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.490> work<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.540> proper

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
supposed to work and the proper

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
supposed to work and the proper
temperature

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.870 

as<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.080> hear<00:01:34.140> now<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.470> fan<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.310> engaging

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
as you can hear now the fan is engaging

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
as you can hear now the fan is engaging
but<00:01:36.270> you'll<00:01:36.390> hear<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.630> quiet<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
but you'll hear it quiet down here in a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:49.400 
but you'll hear it quiet down here in a
minute

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:02:24.610 

disengage

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:03:05.040 

a<00:02:24.700> little<00:02:25.700> bit

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:27.750 

probably<00:03:05.710> not<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.280> get<00:03:06.550> sitting<00:03:06.940> here<00:03:07.150> like

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.570 

there<00:03:28.120> goes<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.780> did<00:03:28.959> its<00:03:29.110> job

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.100 

different<00:03:33.330> game

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.250 

heat<00:03:38.470> up<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.830> bit<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:40.030> before<00:03:40.090> my<00:03:40.750> temperature

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
heat up a bit but before my temperature

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.890 
heat up a bit but before my temperature
kit<00:03:41.620> gets<00:03:42.100> much<00:03:42.370> higher<00:03:42.640> than<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.120> is

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.350 

it<00:03:47.200> will<00:03:47.439> engage<00:03:47.799> again<00:03:48.040> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
it will engage again and
