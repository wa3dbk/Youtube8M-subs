brainwashing him now oz was pretty

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.020 
brainwashing him now oz was pretty
special<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.710> he<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.250> able<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.670> retain

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
special because he was able to retain

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
patients were not now the brainwashing

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
patients were not now the brainwashing
wasn't<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> complete<00:00:59.579> success<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.359> oz<00:01:00.570> was

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
wasn't a complete success because oz was

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.510 
wasn't a complete success because oz was
able<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.320> retain<00:01:01.620> some<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> his<00:01:02.129> older

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
able to retain some of his older

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.780 
able to retain some of his older
memories<00:01:02.910> such<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:04.019> his<00:01:04.559> hatred<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.010> Atlas<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
memories such as his hatred for Atlas I

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490 
memories such as his hatred for Atlas I
think<00:01:06.090> oz<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> best<00:01:07.049> characters

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
think oz is one of the best characters

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500 
think oz is one of the best characters
for<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> couple<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.340> reasons<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.180> playable

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
for a couple of reasons one is playable

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.600 
for a couple of reasons one is playable
quotes<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:10.049> great<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:11.040> probably<00:01:11.369> more

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
quotes are great but probably more

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.580 
quotes are great but probably more
importantly<00:01:11.670> than<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.810> entire<00:01:13.080> story

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
importantly than that the entire story

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.760 
importantly than that the entire story
of<00:01:13.860> EXO<00:01:14.310> zombies<00:01:14.360> kind<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.900> centered<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.560> oz

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
of EXO zombies kind of is centered on oz

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
of EXO zombies kind of is centered on oz
it<00:01:17.100> rotates<00:01:17.549> around<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.060> character<00:01:18.479> oz<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.990> he

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it rotates around the character oz so he

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.850 
it rotates around the character oz so he
is<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.530> vital<00:01:20.009> cog<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.939> XO<00:01:21.840> zombie<00:01:22.409> machine

i<00:02:12.910> think<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.360> emcs<00:02:13.840> were<00:02:14.020> completely

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
i think the emcs were completely

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.190 
i think the emcs were completely
necessary<00:02:15.180> given<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.240> fact<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.660> have<00:02:16.810> XO

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
necessary given the fact that we have XO

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.050 
necessary given the fact that we have XO
zombie<00:02:17.560> suits<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:18.160> can<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.490> jump<00:02:18.880> out

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
zombie suits on and we can just jump out

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.660 
zombie suits on and we can just jump out
of<00:02:19.150> any<00:02:19.510> bad<00:02:20.140> situation<00:02:20.830> we<00:02:20.920> get<00:02:21.100> ourselves<00:02:21.190> in

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
of any bad situation we get ourselves in

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.850 
of any bad situation we get ourselves in
so<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.970> e<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.270> Z's<00:02:22.480> prevent<00:02:22.930> us<00:02:23.110> sometimes

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
so the e of Z's prevent us sometimes

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.350 
so the e of Z's prevent us sometimes
from<00:02:24.130> getting<00:02:24.370> out<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.640> sticky<00:02:24.790> Jam<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.330> I

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
from getting out of a sticky Jam so I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.390 
from getting out of a sticky Jam so I
think<00:02:25.450> they're<00:02:25.690> necessary<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:26.770> yes<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.190> don't

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400

think it's the best one that they gave
us<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.280> what<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.489> does<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.760> shoots<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.090> little

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
us so what it does the shoots a little

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300 
us so what it does the shoots a little
ball<00:03:16.480> out<00:03:16.750> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.110> out<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.770> barrel<00:03:18.130> of<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
guns in that ball will then send a laser

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.270 
guns in that ball will then send a laser
horizontally<00:03:21.820> across<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.510> room<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.280> forward

horizontally across the room and forward

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.300 
horizontally across the room and forward
so<00:03:24.730> anything<00:03:25.600> in<00:03:26.050> its<00:03:26.230> path<00:03:26.320> will<00:03:26.830> get<00:03:26.980> cut<00:03:27.280> in

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
so anything in its path will get cut in

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.690 
so anything in its path will get cut in
half<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.090> actually<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.959> one<00:03:29.560> shot<00:03:29.890> kill<00:03:29.950> up

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
half it's actually a one shot kill up

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.150 
half it's actually a one shot kill up
until<00:03:31.269> around<00:03:31.450> 12<00:03:31.900> would<00:03:32.170> not<00:03:32.410> upgrade<00:03:33.010> it

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
after that it makes crawlers so you need

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.630

a hair on some of the traps now granted
the<00:06:11.639> flogger<00:06:11.939> is<00:06:12.180> still<00:06:12.389> going<00:06:12.479> to<00:06:12.539> be<00:06:12.629> the

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
the flogger is still going to be the

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.510 
the flogger is still going to be the
greatest<00:06:12.930> trap<00:06:13.289> of<00:06:13.469> all<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.830> times<00:06:14.099> and<00:06:14.430> I'm

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
greatest trap of all the times and I'm

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.030 
greatest trap of all the times and I'm
really<00:06:14.729> partial<00:06:15.089> to<00:06:15.659> the<00:06:15.779> acid<00:06:16.139> trap<00:06:16.349> on<00:06:16.560> mob

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
really partial to the acid trap on mob

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.930 
really partial to the acid trap on mob
but<00:06:17.570> by<00:06:18.570> far<00:06:18.840> i<00:06:18.900> think<00:06:19.320> that<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:19.680> traps<00:06:19.950> on<00:06:20.310> EXO

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
but by far i think that the traps on EXO

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.340 
but by far i think that the traps on EXO
zombies<00:06:20.970> were<00:06:21.510> a<00:06:21.540> little<00:06:21.690> more<00:06:21.840> innovative

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
zombies were a little more innovative

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.780 
zombies were a little more innovative
than<00:06:22.380> what<00:06:22.740> we<00:06:22.860> had<00:06:22.980> seen<00:06:23.160> from<00:06:23.370> treyarch<00:06:23.730> in

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
than what we had seen from treyarch in

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.610 
than what we had seen from treyarch in
the<00:06:23.850> past<00:06:24.060> so<00:06:24.240> hopefully<00:06:24.810> treyarch<00:06:25.140> did<00:06:25.410> take

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
the past so hopefully treyarch did take

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.860 
the past so hopefully treyarch did take
a<00:06:25.650> little<00:06:25.950> note<00:06:26.190> from<00:06:26.430> EXO<00:06:27.330> zombies<00:06:27.360> and
