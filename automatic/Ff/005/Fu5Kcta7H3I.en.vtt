00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
three months so obviously the front end

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.530 
three months so obviously the front end
is<00:00:57.220> tough<00:00:57.430> as<00:00:57.640> a<00:00:57.670> base<00:00:57.879> chart<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.270> already

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540

is tough as a base chart is already
pretty<00:00:58.720> aggressive<00:00:59.230> as<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.500> is<00:00:59.620> right<00:00:59.890> so<00:01:00.129> this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
pretty aggressive as it is right so this

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.100 
pretty aggressive as it is right so this
vehicle<00:01:00.640> was<00:01:00.730> designed<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:01.180> make<00:01:01.960> those

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
vehicle was designed to make those

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.200 
vehicle was designed to make those
people<00:01:02.470> that<00:01:02.500> hog<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:02.920> left<00:01:03.129> lane<00:01:03.340> hopefully

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
people that hog the left lane hopefully

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.090 
people that hog the left lane hopefully
get<00:01:04.390> out<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.570> your<00:01:04.629> way<00:01:04.809> right<00:01:05.110> so<00:01:05.950> it's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
get out of your way right so it's

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.760 
get out of your way right so it's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
literally so he obviously wasn't hugged

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660

as a child it's a very very aggressive
car<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.259> we're<00:01:11.380> not<00:01:11.770> ashamed<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:12.250> that<00:01:12.310> that's

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
car and we're not ashamed of that that's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.400 
car and we're not ashamed of that that's
what<00:01:12.850> charge<00:01:13.090> is<00:01:13.180> supposed<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.660> be<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.380> I

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
what charge is supposed to be so I

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.640 
what charge is supposed to be so I
Sartre's<00:01:14.860> are<00:01:15.009> supposed<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.250> be<00:01:15.369> even<00:01:15.700> more

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
Sartre's are supposed to be even more

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.950 
Sartre's are supposed to be even more
aggressive<00:01:17.650> so<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.509> starts<00:01:19.690> with<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
aggressive so so it starts with the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.660 
aggressive so so it starts with the
front<00:01:20.200> end<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:20.650> we<00:01:20.740> have<00:01:20.890> a<00:01:20.920> unique<00:01:21.250> look<00:01:21.430> now

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
front end so we have a unique look now

going to change the graphics a little

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.180 
going to change the graphics a little
bit<00:01:25.479> make<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.140> little<00:01:26.320> more<00:01:26.440> aggressive<00:01:26.680> a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.990 
natural coke bottle that's in the
vehicle<00:01:48.070> a<00:01:48.130> lot<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.280> journalist<00:01:48.640> would<00:01:48.790> cope

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.430 
vehicle a lot of journalist would cope
on<00:01:49.150> what<00:01:49.360> are<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.480> talking<00:01:49.750> about<00:01:49.810> but<00:01:50.320> it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
on what are you talking about but it's

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.720 
on what are you talking about but it's
in<00:01:50.560> there<00:01:50.710> if<00:01:50.800> you<00:01:50.860> look<00:01:51.040> at<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.280> body<00:01:51.490> side

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
in there if you look at the body side

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.580 
in there if you look at the body side
flutters<00:01:52.510> over<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.780> front<00:01:53.020> wheels<00:01:53.200> cinch

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
flutters over the front wheels cinch

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.200 
flutters over the front wheels cinch
down<00:01:53.680> right<00:01:54.250> behind<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.610> front<00:01:54.760> hair<00:01:55.000> and

down right behind the front hair and

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.030 
down right behind the front hair and
squalls<00:01:55.720> again<00:01:56.050> so<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.320> body<00:01:56.440> can<00:01:56.560> echoes

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
squalls again so the body can echoes

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.950 
squalls again so the body can echoes
that<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.850> scoop<00:01:58.120> does<00:01:58.330> as<00:01:58.510> well<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:58.900> it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
that and the scoop does as well so it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.140 
that and the scoop does as well so it
has<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.110> very<00:01:59.320> recognizable<00:01:59.970> unmistakable<00:02:00.970> lot

the<00:02:22.270> engine<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.900> 6.4<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:23.860> first<00:02:24.099> thing

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the engine is a 6.4 so first thing

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.559 
the engine is a 6.4 so first thing
you'll<00:02:24.340> notice<00:02:24.520> yes<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.209> makes<00:02:25.360> five

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
you'll notice yes it makes five

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.660 
you'll notice yes it makes five
horsepower<00:02:25.900> less<00:02:26.260> than<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.470> 392<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.220> there's<00:02:27.580> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
horsepower less than a 392 and there's a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.490 
horsepower less than a 392 and there's a
reason<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.150> I'll<00:02:28.360> explain<00:02:28.660> but<00:02:29.380> it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
reason for that I'll explain but it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.440 
reason for that I'll explain but it
gives<00:02:29.769> up<00:02:29.980> nothing<00:02:30.400> in<00:02:30.580> actual<00:02:30.970> performance

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
gives up nothing in actual performance

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.990 
gives up nothing in actual performance
i'll<00:02:31.599> show<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> tour<00:02:32.140> carafes<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.819> new

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
i'll show you the tour carafes the new

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.750 
i'll show you the tour carafes the new
srt8<00:02:34.750> engine<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.410> all<00:02:35.709> about<00:02:36.010> torque<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.610> yeah

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
srt8 engine is all about torque so yeah

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.790 
srt8 engine is all about torque so yeah
the<00:02:36.910> peak<00:02:37.090> horsepower<00:02:37.239> is<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.290> an<00:02:38.470> improvement

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
the peak horsepower is is an improvement

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.589 
the peak horsepower is is an improvement
but<00:02:39.010> look<00:02:39.250> at<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.489> torque<00:02:39.670> raft<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.480> we've

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
but look at the torque raft so we've

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.420 
but look at the torque raft so we've
taken<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:41.140> torque<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.530> moved<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.860> way<00:02:42.099> way

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
taken that torque and moved it way way

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.040 
taken that torque and moved it way way
down<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.910> torque<00:02:43.150> curve<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.900> don't

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
down and torque curve so you don't

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.270 
down and torque curve so you don't
really<00:02:44.140> have<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.410> go<00:02:44.620> reach<00:02:44.800> for<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.100> power

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
really have to go reach for the power

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.470 
really have to go reach for the power
it's<00:02:45.489> there<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.850> minute<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.150> touch<00:02:46.299> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
it's there the minute you touch the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.690 
it's there the minute you touch the
pedal<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.170> car<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.680> moving<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.310> at<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.549> lower

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
pedal the car is moving so at the lower

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.270 
pedal the car is moving so at the lower
parsi<00:02:49.090> RPM<00:02:49.450> range<00:02:49.660> we<00:02:50.140> have<00:02:50.260> over<00:02:50.500> 80<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.980> 90

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
parsi RPM range we have over 80 to 90

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.979 
parsi RPM range we have over 80 to 90
pounds<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.640> torque<00:02:51.880> improvement<00:02:52.510> over<00:02:52.959> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
pounds of torque improvement over the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.930 
pounds of torque improvement over the
exit<00:02:53.319> engine<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.980> anybody<00:02:54.519> understand

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
exit engine and that anybody understand

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.000 
exit engine and that anybody understand
cars<00:02:55.209> that's<00:02:55.959> what<00:02:56.170> really<00:02:56.440> moves<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.799> dance

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
cars that's what really moves to dance

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.089 
cars that's what really moves to dance
is<00:02:57.400> pork<00:02:58.349> service<00:02:59.349> 60<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.739> haven't<00:02:59.980> done<00:03:00.040> our

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
is pork service 60 we haven't done our

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.949 
is pork service 60 we haven't done our
official<00:03:00.549> final<00:03:00.790> testing<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.510> magazine's

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
official final testing it the magazine's

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.960 
official final testing it the magazine's
always<00:03:02.230> beat<00:03:02.410> us<00:03:02.560> two<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:02.890> far<00:03:03.069> we're<00:03:03.700> looking

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
always beat us two so far we're looking

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.670 
always beat us two so far we're looking
at<00:03:04.120> numbers<00:03:04.480> up<00:03:04.690> well<00:03:05.140> underneath<00:03:05.440> five

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
at numbers up well underneath five

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.770 
at numbers up well underneath five
seconds<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.250> it's<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.430> very<00:03:06.489> quick<00:03:06.910> car<00:03:07.180> it's

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
seconds so it's a very quick car it's

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.930 
seconds so it's a very quick car it's
very<00:03:07.959> practical<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.950> does<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.430> lot<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.640> things

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
very practical that does a lot of things

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.610 
very practical that does a lot of things
well<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.959> what<00:03:11.140> we're<00:03:11.260> trying<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.470> do<00:03:11.590> here

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
well so what we're trying to do here

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.550 
well so what we're trying to do here
with<00:03:11.950> dodge<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.849> me<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.150> !<00:03:14.140> on

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
with dodge and this is to me is the ! on

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.860 
with dodge and this is to me is the ! on
a<00:03:14.590> never<00:03:14.860> neutral<00:03:15.069> concept<00:03:15.790> you'll<00:03:16.540> create<00:03:16.750> a

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
a never neutral concept you'll create a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.599 
a never neutral concept you'll create a
car<00:03:17.079> that<00:03:17.230> can<00:03:17.290> do<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:17.650> many<00:03:17.739> things<00:03:17.859> well<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
car that can do so many things well that

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.890 
car that can do so many things well that
you're<00:03:18.760> like<00:03:18.970> scratching<00:03:19.450> your<00:03:19.540> head<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> don't

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
you're like scratching your head I don't

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.420 
you're like scratching your head I don't
even<00:03:20.049> need<00:03:20.140> an<00:03:20.320> extra<00:03:20.620> sports<00:03:20.920> car<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.130> can<00:03:21.310> have

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
even need an extra sports car I can have

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.660 
even need an extra sports car I can have
one<00:03:21.640> car<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.359> does<00:03:22.570> everything<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:24.190> RT<00:03:24.549> is

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
one car that does everything the RT is

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.920 
one car that does everything the RT is
for<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.910> people<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.239> maybe<00:03:25.600> can't<00:03:25.870> afford

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
for the people that maybe can't afford
