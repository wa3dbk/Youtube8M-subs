00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.129
 these Olympic capabilities are supported by 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.629
 a simple anatomical feature his tail with 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.750
 half the length of his body 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.190
 It works as a built-in counterweight 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.690
 moving it from one side to the other allows it 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.690
 spin abruptly at full speed 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.769
 it was a slow call chasing a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.199
 dam was quite like the big 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.509
 felines of today when a 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.460
 animal tries to dodge the are able 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.940
 to spin quickly swinging the tail 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 to one side strengthen the terrain and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.390
 intercept the dam that deals with 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.820
 escape 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.309
 if we combine all these characteristics 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 speed agility and a powerful sense 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.030
 of smell to be persecuted by the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 Deinonico must be for a young man 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.800
 sauro poseid贸n despite his 500 kilos of 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.180
 weight like contemplating the chronicle of a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.949
 announced death 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.390
 especially if the persecutors were more 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.820
 one's 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 in the Cretaceous predators lurk 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.270
 like the tyrannosaurus rex whose 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.890
 jaws are able to bite with 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.890
 almost 4 tons of force 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.820
 and the deinonico whose sharp claws 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.820
 they can section the meat 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680
 but the dams that hunt these 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 carnivores are armed to the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.240
 teeth 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.189
 when we rebuild the world of 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.020
 dinosaurs we saw carnivores attacking 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.610
 to herbivores and we forget that in the world 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.040
 real herbivores have their own 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.290
 defense mechanisms 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.000
 he sauro poseid贸n for example he 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.760
 defend growing to proportions 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.460
 mammoth 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.190
 this is a young specimen but it measures almost 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.980
 6 meters tall it is an animal 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.150
 on the border of adolescence a 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.150
 animal in full flight 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.509
 following his heels go not only one 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.150
 but two reactors reactors that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.190
 respond to the dynamic name these 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.190
 small murderers work as a team 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.060
 the day musicus did not weigh much more than 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.850
 a human being and when they attacked a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.369
 animal like the poseid贸n insurance hunt a 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.869
 steam is granted a great advantage of 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.250
 that way your chances of getting 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.250
 food increased considerably 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.940
 is a strategy still employed in the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.130
 present 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.050
 When they hunt together the lions are 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.570
 capable of tearing down such large prey 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.490
 like a 4-ton elephant and only 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.680
 they have teeth and claws 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.720
 the deinonico is instead deploys a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.310
 most formidable weapons arsenal 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.680
 than that of any other creature of 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.380
 our time the only defense of the saur 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.000
 or poseid贸n is its enormous size but the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.380
 of ironic have learned that you can 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.390
 open a gap in any shield 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.030
 defensive disposing of weapons 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.070
 suitable as for example claws 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.200
 Curves in the hands of almost 8 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.760
 centimeters in length designed to 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.620
 climb on the body of their prey 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.560
 like a climber's jam 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.390
 the ideal attack is to jump on the back 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.489
 of the prey cling to your body or 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.370
 get in position and then hit 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.140
 the blow that gave the deinonico used 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.670
 the arms to place the body in the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.659
 right position and strike the blow 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.390
 definitive was able to hit with sum 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.340
 quickly and when they attacked an animal of 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.470
 large size used the arms 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.030
 to climb on his back when doing it 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.980
 the other weapon could come into play 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.489
 main thing that counted the claws 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.489
 of the legs 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.010
 the name of anonymous means 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.930
 terrible claw in reference to the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.450
 hinge joint or liming ying 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.450
 its hind legs the cutting end
