00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.920
 and 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.300
 we prepare the mobile eyelid with a 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.760
 prebase and we're going to start applying a 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.649
 beige in the lacrimal area towards the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.210
 half of the mobile eyelid and the rest of the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.370
 mobile eyelid let's take a color 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.770
 coral let's start creating an effect 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.500
 of triangle first apply a little bit of 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.880
 amount and betty culminating we're going to 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.130
 Wear this color also in the wit 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.750
 of tabs and when we have in the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.880
 way that we want you simply have 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.659
 that blur the cut with a shadow 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.659
 matte beige 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 a little more intensity to makeup 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.710
 applying a burgundy shade on everything 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 on the outside and creating the same 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 triangle effect that we have created 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.710
 before and blurring to begin with 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.360
 to create in the transition to the color that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.970
 let's apply real depth 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.860
 let's add a very light copper tone 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 in the area of ​​the upper cut of 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.270
 makeup before catching this color 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.490
 I have told copper and start 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.439
 integrate it and create the real depth 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.090
 for this we are going to create first a 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.159
 kind of eyeliner line that will go 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.080
 from the outer zone of the middle of the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.720
 upper eyelid and then once what 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 let's have it, let's take it by the banana 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.140
 creating a kind of effect of 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.539
 open triangle 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.729
 we are going to blur little by little what 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.799
 we connect lower klan of tabs and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.840
 as we are not going to work the cut with the 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.560
 matte shadow you see we've used 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.560
 previously 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.370
 yes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.370
 and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.410
 to touch the point of light of the lacrimal with 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.180
 a pigment a little brighter and 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.190
 let's go directly the eyeliner 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.020
 in this case the eyeliner is not the center 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.250
 makeup attention simply we 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.349
 will help to intensify the line 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.480
 top of tabs is that you believe it like 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.000
 you want but make sure it's 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.900
 the corner right in the middle of the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.900
 external shadows 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.980
 all right 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.140
 i 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.930
 let's move on to give the points of 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.060
 makeup intensity we will apply 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.590
 a black on the bottom line of water 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.170
 let's do the tabs and 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.790
 we will apply several layers of mask in 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.500
 this time I will not apply any 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.599
 False appearance so I decide 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.519
 Mix two different bases with two 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.680
 different mask formulas for 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.959
 create an intense shoulders effect retouch 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.549
 in my eyebrows as intense as the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.310
 eye makeup and then I'll go to 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.920
 return to give the beige color in the bow 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.239
 from the eyebrows before moving to 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.829
 corrector that we will use as 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.829
 always to correct and to occur 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.920
 as always we apply the base from the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.510
 center towards the edges blurring what 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.160
 well and devoting several minutes to 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.990
 get the most integrated finish and 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.780
 then we seal with the powders that are most 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.220
 adapt to your face, we return the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.140
 volume to the face with a contour of 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.390
 light and we went on to create an effect 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.550
 man on the lips uses a color 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.710
 coral by all lips and then a 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.320
 color with the darkest only in the 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.860
 external commissures we had finished this 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.860
