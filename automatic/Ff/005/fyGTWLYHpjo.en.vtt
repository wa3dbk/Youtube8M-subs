00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 and you're also more at 

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.690
 thank god on friday morning 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.400
 Fridays Friday morning there was again 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.460
 more so much with coconut milk and off 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.770
 At noon I had something really good 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.130
 my mum did that and gave it 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.020
 There it left these doubts 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 I think for the most part 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.570
 chickpeas as they are, I think 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.330
 also made and I had such a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.550
 little cooked vegetables with broccoli 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.450
 and mushrooms and sugarcakes and 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 I usually do that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.030
 yogurt sauce over it but this time I had 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.770
 just sweet balsamic vinegar 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.309
 By the way, you will find this recipe 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.500
 also on my blog and this recipe 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.120
 be found on my blog telling 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.760
 you because you will beat it 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 If she gets it I'll have a chocolate dream 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 because it really is a chocolate dream 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.109
 I think it's so great 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.140
 Do you know this pudding in the shop 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.630
 is quite high in these plastic cups 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.960
 with with this cream on top of this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.360
 transparent and about tastes 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 it only ten times better and is 2 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.920
 and of course all my recipes here 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.939

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.980
 guest surplus I have it of course 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.410
 not all eaten alone 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.050

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.330
 you want to say then I can 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.150
 very happy to post the recipe on 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.630
 his blog ok on saturday morning there was 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.480
 again my father soaked with banana 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.730
 to and allowed 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.300
 Saturday afternoon was then 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.370
 as the title already reveals so this 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.320
 Pictures where most titles are already on it 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.320
 or what's on it are mostly for 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.980
 thought my blog because I have therefore 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.050
 his category has the thirst for food 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.280
 question mark exclamation point and i have 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.500
 Just want to see that already 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.000
 if you are maybe on this 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.660
 Picture I have recognized here again 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.550
 Most pasta made with spinach sauce 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.020
 the players just are not 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.350
 just spinach with margarine 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:26.030
 or four players to do it then 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.970
 block here and harnik and have over it 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.980
 I still cigar crisis of the clear 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.830
 Of course, they also do the whole thing 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.880
 I just live to block 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.100
 in the evening there was my pear again 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.830
 Salad as you can see in the picture 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.440
 can be very solemn again 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.740
 Sunday breakfast on my lap bed 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.900
 There were carrots 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.150
 tomato and donations glass to the triple and 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.130
 The white is my vegan mozzarella 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.540
 but in July to antalya tastes 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.430
 I just called it 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.200
 that's pretty good and gets better around 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.700
 Italy at the fridge I suspect 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.440
 it's because soya milk 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.470
 is inside and therefore probiotic 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.020
 Bacteria are and probably also what with 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.910
 a mature then has to do as I said 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.500
 best you can taste them at four 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.000
 that lasts up to five days in the fridge 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.970
 You will also find a recipe on his blog 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.400
 and there I still have my cucumbers 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.990
 and carrots by the way this white brown 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.080
 mush that can Buss him this sesame and 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.960
 over the tomatoes 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.730
 birthday can take as bitter law 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.400
 later there was only our lag 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.930
 because as I said when we have breakfast on 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.019
 sunday then always at the end 12 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.819
 really quite a lot then I have me 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.790
 baked yet so what was the total 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.969
 So I was disappointed 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.560
 made big and that was somehow whole 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:59.379
 funny that I liked so much 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.680
 I think it was because that's it 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.939
 had started to ferment easily 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.379
 pretty weird smelled so I know 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.480
 how long so I was I got me 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.340
 myself with water I suspect 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.079
 that his water was an expert 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.389
 to go 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.630
 Of course, it quickly gets away with it 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:20.380
 I then made the cookies 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.889
 only with no sugar and chocolate 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.740
 on it and the cocoa mixed in and me 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.630
 tell you that these were the most disgusting 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.099
 you place I ever done 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.710
 you did not taste good shows up 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:34.449
 Still, my mom was still like that 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.759
 That's what they do that cookies then 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.889
 just after three to four days after 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.590
 then she's seen somehow it will 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.289
 no less she has the easy in 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.610
 thrown my kitchen in garbage and me 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.940
 have it the next day in the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.199
 biotonne seen nice or 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.400
 i hope i have my diary 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:58.229
 has fallen and in the next 1-2 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.229
 two weeks, then two sharp 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.930
 now
