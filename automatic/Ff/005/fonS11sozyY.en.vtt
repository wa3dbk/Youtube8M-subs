 making video and this time we are 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.070

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.250
 we are here in a game with ari 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.910
 kraft 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.910
 nothing 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.230
 Well now, nothing is going to be 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.809
 watching below on the screen is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.760
 it's a tweet that you just posted 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.440
 two days I think I had not climbed the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.180
 video but I laziness did not have time 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.239
 but here we are as always 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.079
 reporting here in the channel we are 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.730
 when a human being between me and him arish 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.589
 but but that's not important, so 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.920
 do not take it into account how important what 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:59.239
 I'm going to tell you in case you do not know 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.640
 is that finally four studies has been 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.790
 decided to get a good update 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.340
 for console maikel and well it makes me 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.600
 very rare sometimes I think it's a tournament 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.420
 but it looked pretty serious I do not think so and 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.050
 Well, he just said that they are going to get a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.100
 update the update 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:25.440
 minecraft of pc that the 1.6 point 4 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.240
 they are going to convert to consoles minecraft 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.180
 planets if they are going to do that you have to 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.240
 put a big thing and how can you say 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.420
 from there in the tweet that said what 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.640
 unless they were going to transform the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.440
 upgrade 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.700
 until 12.4 6.4 they will last a little bit 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.330
 time but while something good 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.190
 you can wait 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.610
 and you can draw a list also of 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.580
 changes that did not confirm them but 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.960
 yes some other people who are at 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.200
 so much about this 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.350
 and is ready to say it 's up 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.350
 here 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.250
 you know with the maps 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.140
 the horses 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.000
 the witches 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.440
 the bat that has already been confirmed 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.440
 that updates back 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.800
 I would take care 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.319
 the objects and blocks are clay 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:55.160
 colors one stay in although that I do not know 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.160
 what is this is the horses 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.540
 it's bad truth in a then 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.540
 the coal block 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.680
 yes 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.129
 I'll look in the video 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.790
 that mother who is a chest down and you put 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:46.190
 a copper up and what I go 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.190
 falling in the per is it 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.410
 that does not vote on this logical since 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.410
 mother why 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.129
 I have no idea very well what is 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.459
 based but I think that mother comes in 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.459
 a mod 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.739
 as you know 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.710
 the pressure plate of 1 million but 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.980
 this was not in versions anymore 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:21.670
 advanced as supposedly room 1.6 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.400
 like four then so the people there 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.310
 but because nothing decree is nothing 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.870
 confirmed so if you do not get any of 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.700
 these things do not come to me 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.920
 I 'm not telling you that it's going to be 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.830
 next update as I told you in 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:41.070
 a video and at the end the four studies 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.070
 determined because they did not get the points 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.870
 but now they just announced that it's going 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.870
 to be the biggest so far 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.700
 horses 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.050
 and apart I think they know they are the 1.6 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.449
 it's already in the minecraft wiki of 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.300
 console 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:22.630
 it is called food 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.590
 okay 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.640
 but I would also like that 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.670
 will implement the adventure mode and the 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.820
 super hardcore modes that you rent for 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:36.640
 tournaments 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.800
 even of launches hardcore sport mode and 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.610
 that they fix the connection is not seen anymore 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.550
 I know that 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.770
 do not tell me you can not and the one about 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.889
 eyes is a great game has a lot of 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.689
 things to implement as well as that is a 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.759
 game as simple as micra he is not going to 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:56.409
 able to support then also block 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.409
 of commands would be fine 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.900
 but guys you leave in the 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.069
