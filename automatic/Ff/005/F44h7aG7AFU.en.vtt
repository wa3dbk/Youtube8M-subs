00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
trying to saw something out and I'd

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.670 
trying to saw something out and I'd
tried<00:00:58.480> loads<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.809> different<00:00:58.899> software<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.530> try

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
tried loads of different software to try

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.849 
tried loads of different software to try
to<00:00:59.739> flip<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.070> image<00:01:00.719> I've<00:01:01.719> got<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:02.050> glasses<00:01:02.620> but

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
to flip the image I've got I glasses but

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.580 
to flip the image I've got I glasses but
it<00:01:02.890> only<00:01:03.070> works<00:01:03.219> with<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:04.050> isight<00:01:05.050> camera<00:01:05.080> not

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
it only works with the isight camera not

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.719 
it only works with the isight camera not
external<00:01:06.130> webcam<00:01:06.430> so<00:01:06.970> it's<00:01:07.180> pretty<00:01:07.420> pointless

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
external webcam so it's pretty pointless

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.320 
external webcam so it's pretty pointless
anyway<00:01:09.729> we'll<00:01:09.910> just<00:01:09.940> get<00:01:10.869> into<00:01:11.170> this<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:12.330> dress
