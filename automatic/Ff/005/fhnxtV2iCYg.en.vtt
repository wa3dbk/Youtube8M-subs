00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.910
 few marvel comics have so much 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.059
 affection and success on the part of the most 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.460
 candles as it is spiderman all 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.469
 we know who is not that young man who 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.630
 got his superpowers thanks to the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.819
 bite of a spider later for the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.650
 radiation something that surprises us 

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:22.019
 too knowing what the history is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.300
 of marvel but what is it that makes 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.149
 spirit is so successful on the part of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.489
 crowd the answer is simple it 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.470
 deals with the evolution of the character and 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.289
 what it was about a person like 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.109
 any other is to say is not a 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.510
 billionaire like Tony Stark did not fight 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.129
 in World War II not even 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.370
 has powers granted by the gods 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.469
 Nordic is about a normal god and of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.570
 an ordinary guy who goes to the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.850
 school that remains with friends even if they are 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.589
 few in your case and you have a family 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.559
 which he puts on top of the 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.629
 pedestal friends on the occasion of the return 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.480
 from Peter Parker to the comics after 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.239
 a time that I think is very good and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.979
 very good series superior spiderman 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.690
 these are the comics of speedy at 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 over the years 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.730
 according to my opinion starting at four 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.160
 first with comics known to all 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.050
 and very old followed by the three 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.810
 last ones that are very recent and in my 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.850
 opinion surpasses the ancients 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.729
 number 7 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.009
 friends the number 7 position is taken by the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.530
 saga dedicated to the one who will be soon 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.619
 in the series one of the worst enemies 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.409
 of the spider man I speak of the saga of 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.899
 damn suit if you live in Spain ' 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.240
 you can get by the way from 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.700
 the first comic that I will say at this moment 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.399
 until the last of them thanks to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.530
 mannini the damn costume as I said 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.810
 before it presents the enemy par excellence 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.270
 of spiderman not only because his powers 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 are identical to those of the purest 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.340
 muscles but also because it shares 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.470
 with his soul mate 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.210
 an immense hatred towards the I speak 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.240
 obviously of poison 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.640
 - or whatever you want to call it a thing is 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.649
 sure this villain was one of those who 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.739
 more headaches he gave to 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.319
 trepamuros especially because it was for 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.239
 so to speak extorted since his 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.180
 secret identity is revealed thanks to 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.360
 alien number 7 for less 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.760
 number 6 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.250
 position number 6 is taken by a series 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.380
 that although he did not attempt against his identity 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.900
 secret yes it is true that it almost killed 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.430
 spiderman had to use all 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.370
 his last forces so that this one 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.340
 could survive and still did not win the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.710
 battle torment tells how the doctor 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.470
 connors became the lizard again 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.720
 is manipulated by a witch who doing 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.180
 voodoo manages to disrupt the sense 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.340
 spiderman arachnid causing him a 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.610
 huge headache that prevents it from 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.490
 concentrate on the struggle being violent and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.230
 slowly defeated by the lizard if 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.209
 I would not have had any luck in 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.180
 the final battle would have been impossible 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.920
 that would have survived number 6 for 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.050
 torment 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.600
 number 5 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.270
 the number 5 place is the one that 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.090
 I think it 's one of the most comics 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.910
 tenebrous and macabre of spiderman os 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.830
 I open the last craven hunt in 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.680
 the one who graven shot a speedy 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.440
 house and usurp his post burying 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.310
 speedy in life and waking one or two 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.440
 weeks later 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.270
 later after they tax there 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.210
 defamed with his deeds to the battered 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.060
 superhero who obviously furious 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.740
 clamor revenge this is one of the only 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.900
 occasions in which spiderman has 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.510
 wanted for a moment to kill someone and 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.220
 he said has been very good series os the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.980
 I recommend a lot 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.080
 number 4 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.790
 the fourth position takes the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.310
 comic that shocked a whole 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.200
 generation and which also meant one of 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.659
 the most controversial comics of the saga of the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.269
 trepamuros except of course the 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.860
 number 700 of amazing spider-man that was 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.010
 prelude to what would be superior 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.140
 spider-man is about the return of the 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.879
 green goblin we already know that the elf 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.099
 Green knows the secret identity of 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.569
 spiderman is more he was the first to 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.660
 do it and he did it in my opinion very 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.220
 smart very smartly in this 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.459
 number shows the death of gwen 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.079
 stacy the first great love of peter 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.030
 predecessor of mary jane and I can not say 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.160
 more of this series because only with 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.440
 have told you this and you see why it 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.529
 deserves to the fourth position although more 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.400
 later I will give more details I will not say more 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.620
 number 3 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.389
 the bronze medal is worn 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.790
 saga that also caused its controversy 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.919
 apart from being one of the classics of 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.020
 marvel at his young age and having been 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.880
 written by mark miller who 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.250
 is currently working on the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.190
 kick-ass comic outcome too very 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.680
 recommended is the deadliest battle 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.300
 who has had the spider as a man 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.460
 the six sinister ones cost him 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.090
 imagined and now it's twelve 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.229
 sinister you just heard it 12 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.419
 headed not only for the sexennium 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:09.050
 original but also by villains like 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.539
 electro lizard etcetera be very 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.430
 recommended by marvel nights I want 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.870
 say with marvel nights simply that 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.360
 does not follow the original line the amazing 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.639
 spider-man and which is also one of 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.689
 the most controversial endings of all the 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.529
 Spirit series I will not say more 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.109
 number 2 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:29.479
 at number 2 we have a series 

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:32.059
 of spiderman very recent call 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.669
 sins of the past in which speedy 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:37.189
 he knows those who are supposedly his 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.649
 two children for part of their romance with 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:42.079
 gwen stacy who as I said before 

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:44.179
 died because of the green goblin and 

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:46.699
 from the spiderman himself because she 

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:49.279
 He undressed when the hero himself reached it 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.169
 with his web and it's just this 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.939
 last thing that makes speedy feel 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.219
 so guilty of the harsh childhood that has 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.169
 had their children who want to kill 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.569
 his own father to take revenge for what 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.870
 he made his mother very hard series that 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.230
 wear the silver medal 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.030
 number 1 the gold medal takes it 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.180
 to the comic that in my opinion is the most 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:13.240
 dark of the whole series of spider came out 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.730
 in 2008 and it supposed an end 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.790
 too epic from the cyber wars sagas 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.820
 or civil wars it's about the series 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.380
 back to black or back in black in the 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.750
 that after making his identity public 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.030
 secret aunt mary is shot 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.740
 that leaves her badly injured 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.290
 this is for peter a huge shock 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.420
 emotional and that means that the 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.760
 black suit not because the suit is 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.320
 alien but because he wants to reflect 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.960
 that is willing to kill the 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.910
 responsible if necessary showing in 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.340
 the color of the suit the huge change of 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.740
 personality that peter suffers when clamoring 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.530
 revenge I will not say more for this for 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.870
 gut more plot just say that if 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.940
 noir was too dark a story 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.520
 it is brought to peace 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.560

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.450

 weeks I could not upload videos by 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.289

 as often as it was before 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.960
