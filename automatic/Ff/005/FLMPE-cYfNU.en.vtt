hand<00:00:34.739> cannon<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:36.030> awesome<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
hand cannon which is really awesome in

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.350 
hand cannon which is really awesome in
single-player<00:00:37.340> it<00:00:38.340> doesn't<00:00:38.820> measure<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
single-player it doesn't measure up to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.180 
single-player it doesn't measure up to
the<00:00:39.600> auto<00:00:39.750> rifle<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.730> PvP<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:42.480> my<00:00:42.719> opinion

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
the auto rifle in PvP that's my opinion

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
the auto rifle in PvP that's my opinion
so<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> want<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:44.969> look<00:00:45.120> at<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> primary

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so when you want to look at a primary

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.840 
so when you want to look at a primary
weapon<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.620> gotta<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.920> Auto<00:00:47.160> rifle<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
weapon you gotta go Auto rifle you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.540 
weapon you gotta go Auto rifle you
simply<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.710> by<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.250> thing<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
simply have to by the way one thing I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.100 
simply have to by the way one thing I
still<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.120> gotten<00:00:51.390> used<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
still have not gotten used to is the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.900 
still have not gotten used to is the
halo<00:00:52.469> style<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> got<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> shoot<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.610> 20

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
halo style you got to shoot them like 20

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.880 
halo style you got to shoot them like 20
times<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.480> melee<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.289> close<00:00:55.559> kills

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
times and then melee for up close kills

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.000 
times and then melee for up close kills
that's<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> do<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
that's really the way to do it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
that's really the way to do it
but<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> auto<00:00:59.280> rifle<00:00:59.730> for<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> medium<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.660> long

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
but the auto rifle for a medium to long

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.240 
but the auto rifle for a medium to long
range<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.710> tears<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.520> apart<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> put<00:01:05.159> on

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
range just tears them apart so put on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
range just tears them apart so put on
that<00:01:05.400> auto<00:01:05.610> rifle<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> secondary<00:01:07.170> when

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that auto rifle and for a secondary when

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.219 
that auto rifle and for a secondary when
people<00:01:07.979> do<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.340> close<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> go

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
people do get close you got to go

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.190 
people do get close you got to go
shotgun<00:01:10.710> come<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.549> know<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> although<00:01:12.600> on

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
shotgun come on you know it although on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410 
shotgun come on you know it although on
certain<00:01:13.770> maps<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.460> certain<00:01:14.640> game<00:01:14.939> types<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
certain maps and in certain game types a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.630 
certain maps and in certain game types a
sniper<00:01:15.689> rifle<00:01:15.920> certainly<00:01:16.920> proves<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
sniper rifle certainly proves to be the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.020 
sniper rifle certainly proves to be the
better<00:01:17.909> option<00:01:18.470> but<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.770> small<00:01:20.490> corridors

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
better option but in small corridors

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.200 
better option but in small corridors
like<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.630> map<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> shotgun<00:01:23.210> there's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
like this map here the shotgun there's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.350 
like this map here the shotgun there's
just<00:01:24.390> no<00:01:24.750> match<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> powerup<00:01:26.369> close<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
just no match for the powerup close and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.539 
just no match for the powerup close and
even<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> hit<00:01:28.500> them<00:01:28.590> once<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
even if you hit them once and then you

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.490 
even if you hit them once and then you
melee<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.180> boom<00:01:30.479> they're<00:01:30.810> not<00:01:30.990> surviving

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
melee them boom they're not surviving
