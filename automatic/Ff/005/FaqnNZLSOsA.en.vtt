00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
for about four minutes and it's now

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.270 
for about four minutes and it's now
ready<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.550> pour<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:43.979> light

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
ready to pour and it has a really light

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.490 
ready to pour and it has a really light
liquor<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.149> brew<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:49.320> quite

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
liquor and you can brew it for quite

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200 
liquor and you can brew it for quite
some<00:01:49.770> time<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.220> doesn't<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.549> get<00:01:50.850> bitter

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
some time it doesn't really get bitter

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510 
some time it doesn't really get bitter
so<00:01:51.690> my<00:01:51.840> second<00:01:52.140> cup<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.410> stronger<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so my second cup will be stronger but it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
so my second cup will be stronger but it
won't<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.759> bitter<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.380> that's<00:01:55.380> how<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> make<00:01:55.800> a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
won't be bitter and that's how to make a

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.399 
won't be bitter and that's how to make a
white<00:01:56.160> tea
