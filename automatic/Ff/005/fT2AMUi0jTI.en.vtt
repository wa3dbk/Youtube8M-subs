fights were all incredibly easy in fact
in<00:01:55.479> most<00:01:55.600> cases<00:01:55.900> especially<00:01:56.590> at<00:01:56.680> first<00:01:56.830> there

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.830 
in most cases especially at first there
wasn't<00:01:57.340> much<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.640> punishment<00:01:57.880> at<00:01:58.299> all<00:01:58.330> for

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
wasn't much of a punishment at all for

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.570 
wasn't much of a punishment at all for
dying<00:01:59.020> during<00:01:59.260> a<00:01:59.409> boss<00:01:59.619> flight<00:01:59.890> you'd<00:02:00.400> simply

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
dying during a boss flight you'd simply

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.070 
dying during a boss flight you'd simply
continue<00:02:01.090> from<00:02:01.240> where<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.479> left<00:02:01.689> off<00:02:01.810> before

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
continue from where you left off before
