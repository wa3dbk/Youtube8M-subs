00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 It's the tchan looks the toss was personal everything 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.770
 good 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.740
 Today's video is special to teach. 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.740
 for you some variations of the famous 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.350
 pineapple hairstyle that is already the darling 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:34.110
 between the three are punished for being 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:36.420
 a very fast and practical hairstyle for 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.300
 do this hairstyle I recommend that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.820
 you wear a very firm elastic because 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.500
 the trend is that the more you turn 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.170
 You must elastic but it will mess up. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 the hair but it will mess up one of ater 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 so I'd rather use a very firm 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.879
 because that way I do not need to turn around 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.210
 and it more or less says the hair I started 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.010
 then making the traditional pineapple that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.510
 it is nothing more than to tie the hair in the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.510
 top of the head with an elastic 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.450
 after fixing, just adjust according to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.460
 more or less rounded taste and the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.130
 final touch the differential will be 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.840
 introduced in the news not the way 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.630
 conventional but within the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.759
 hair and that's what's going to give you an elegance 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.030
 more to the look leave something more 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.100
 differentiated and I usually use with a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.180
 matching the earring because headband 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.180
 very delicate 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.160
 and now we are going to the second option 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.870
 I'll make the pineapple and the side is the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.780
 same thing except I'll understand 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:56.450
 and then just adjust according to the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.450
 I like to leave more or less full 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.650
 and since I do not have compliance and the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.560
 hair does not reach the elastic behind 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.750
 The trick is to use the clips and I'll go 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.940
 put the clips on both fingers before 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.440
 to really end because there are the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.880
 own caches that are left out 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.880
 that will cover iran 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.770
 I usually wear this type of hairstyle 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.770
 with very big and flashy earrings 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.220
 and now I'm going to do one more time 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.349
 side pineapple only now leaving the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:55.280
 fringe and a piece of the side of the hair 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:57.829
 loose after arrest is just go 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.829
 settling in a way to try 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.459
 to make the pineapple uniform with this 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.890
 was released and then I'm introducing 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.079
 staples everything inside the root for 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:17.680
 increase the volume and leave it 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:21.709
 the pineapple and to complete the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.950
 I chose a solitary earring to wear 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.519
 opposite the trim of the fringe and is 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.519
 that the result 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.830
 and we go to the fourth option 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:41.870
 This time I'm going to make the pineapple and I'm going 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.870
 let the strip loose 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.410
 and now I will understand the fran newspaper 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.960
 ter using tic tacs and people who 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.300
 They like to untangle a comb 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.580
 passes a lot of j to make it quite right 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.040
 but I only do it that way anyway 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.330
 stretching and putting the chic tatio and 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.090
 I think it looks really cool and in the end I 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.160
 the final wick adjustment with whites and 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.800
 always using that trick of leaving a 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.480
 space for the boxes themselves 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.070
 cover the times 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.920
 I see right here without using any 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.050
 accessory is something very stylish that 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.420
 can be used in 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.850
 more formal and the fifth option is a 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.610
 variation of this same hairstyle I go 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.950
 use a cloth tiara with wire and I'll 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.950
 put it around the pineapple itself 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.320
 here's no specific trick I just went 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:05:01.550
 coiling to annoy around herself 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:05:04.250
 even the scientist was very terezinha and the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.010
 sixth option is to use a hair band 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.110
 between france and pineapple 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.660
 I know I do today when it's something super. 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:25.760
 common used this way is already well 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:28.280
 different and this was my tip of 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.980
 Today I hope that every day you learn 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.810
 to enjoy the best of your hair and 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.000
 Please do not forget to give a 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.700
 being followed helped us and signing up 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.950
 Because every week there is something new around here. 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.950
 a kiss for everyone and such
