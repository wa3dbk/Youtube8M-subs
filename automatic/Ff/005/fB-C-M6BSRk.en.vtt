iWay into the pit of lost souls
I<00:01:36.329> guess<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.380> prove<00:01:38.040> how<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> jerk

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I guess to just prove how much of a jerk

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:39.319 
I guess to just prove how much of a jerk
he<00:01:39.119> is

he is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.499 
he is
and<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.900> finally<00:01:40.350> learn<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.070> his<00:01:42.030> plan<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509

now first of all I did hear beforehand

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.550 
now first of all I did hear beforehand
that<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.420> group<00:01:45.630> would<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.869> called<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> Red

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that the group would be called the Red

that the group would be called the Red
Lotus<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.460> didn't<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> declare<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659

destroying all of civilized order by
kidnapping<00:03:27.640> children<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.450> assassinating

kidnapping children and assassinating

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.840 
kidnapping children and assassinating
people<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.470> exactly<00:03:29.890> what<00:03:30.130> he<00:03:30.220> meant<00:03:30.400> by<00:03:30.579> that

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
people is exactly what he meant by that

and<00:03:31.150> let's<00:03:31.630> note<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.170> phrase<00:03:32.500> shall<00:03:32.920> we<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
and let's note this phrase shall we the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.310 
and let's note this phrase shall we the
idea<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.090> having<00:03:34.269> nations<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.019> governments

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
idea of having nations and governments

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.560 
idea of having nations and governments
is<00:03:35.650> as<00:03:35.799> foolish<00:03:36.340> as<00:03:36.489> keeping<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:37.060> human<00:03:37.450> and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
is as foolish as keeping the human and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.259 
is as foolish as keeping the human and
spirit<00:03:37.600> realms<00:03:37.959> separate<00:03:38.620> hmm<00:03:39.489> where<00:03:39.730> have<00:03:40.060> I

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
spirit realms separate hmm where have I

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.930 
spirit realms separate hmm where have I
heard<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.660> before<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.980> mean<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.519> idea<00:03:42.880> of

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
heard that before I mean the idea of

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.690 
heard that before I mean the idea of
even<00:03:43.269> having<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.750> queen<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.380> outdated<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
even having a queen is so outdated the

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.130 
even having a queen is so outdated the
world<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.120> evolving<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.690> earth<00:03:46.810> Queen

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
world is evolving and the earth Queen

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.960 
world is evolving and the earth Queen
can<00:03:47.290> evolve<00:03:47.350> with<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.860> it's<00:03:48.310> like<00:03:48.519> that<00:03:48.549> thing

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
can evolve with it it's like that thing

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.759 
can evolve with it it's like that thing
I<00:03:49.180> said<00:03:49.420> last<00:03:49.600> episode<00:03:50.079> is<00:03:50.260> starting<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.650> look

I said last episode is starting to look

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.250 
I said last episode is starting to look
much<00:03:51.100> much<00:03:51.489> much<00:03:51.850> more<00:03:52.120> likely<00:03:52.390> now<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:53.170> to

have said in the comment it would be

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.670 
have said in the comment it would be
really<00:04:04.090> terrible<00:04:04.329> if<00:04:04.660> after<00:04:05.079> all<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.290> Lin's

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
really terrible if after all that Lin's

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.960 
really terrible if after all that Lin's
been<00:04:05.920> through<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.250> reconcile<00:04:06.700> with<00:04:06.820> her

been through to reconcile with her

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.759 
been through to reconcile with her
sister<00:04:07.329> if<00:04:07.510> su<00:04:07.720> turned<00:04:07.989> out<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.380> be<00:04:08.500> on<00:04:08.650> the

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
sister if su turned out to be on the

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.280 
sister if su turned out to be on the
other<00:04:08.890> side<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.489> mean<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.120> su<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.720> want<00:04:11.109> her

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
and Lin to get along I just kind of

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.970 
and Lin to get along I just kind of
think<00:04:13.540> that's<00:04:13.660> what's<00:04:13.930> gonna<00:04:14.019> happen<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.739> if

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
think that's what's gonna happen and if

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.610 
think that's what's gonna happen and if
it<00:04:15.070> doesn't<00:04:15.280> happen<00:04:15.519> well<00:04:16.060> yay<00:04:16.690> for<00:04:16.930> Lin<00:04:17.109> but

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
it doesn't happen well yay for Lin but

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.590 
it doesn't happen well yay for Lin but
in<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.890> end<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.280> episode<00:04:18.760> was<00:04:19.000> essentially

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
in the end this episode was essentially

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.930 
in the end this episode was essentially
a<00:04:19.630> setup<00:04:20.019> for<00:04:20.380> following<00:04:20.919> episodes<00:04:21.549> and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
a setup for following episodes and

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.400 
a setup for following episodes and
really<00:04:22.060> doesn't<00:04:22.330> have<00:04:22.480> too<00:04:22.690> much<00:04:22.840> going<00:04:23.230> for

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
really doesn't have too much going for

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.710 
really doesn't have too much going for
it<00:04:23.530> by<00:04:23.710> itself<00:04:24.160> but<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.640> will<00:04:24.910> say<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.150> have<00:04:25.510> been

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
it by itself but I will say I have been

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.290 
it by itself but I will say I have been
enjoying<00:04:26.110> Bowlin<00:04:26.770> more<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.280> more<00:04:27.520> lately<00:04:27.760> him

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
enjoying Bowlin more and more lately him

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.210 
enjoying Bowlin more and more lately him
interacting<00:04:28.840> with<00:04:28.900> his<00:04:29.110> fans<00:04:29.440> really<00:04:29.980> was<00:04:30.190> a

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
interacting with his fans really was a

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.430 
interacting with his fans really was a
fun<00:04:30.640> moment<00:04:30.880> in<00:04:31.270> fact<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.780> think<00:04:32.110> it's<00:04:32.260> pretty

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
fun moment in fact I think it's pretty

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.960 
fun moment in fact I think it's pretty
likely<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:33.100> was<00:04:33.220> based<00:04:33.460> off<00:04:33.670> a<00:04:33.700> true

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
likely that was based off a true

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.180 
likely that was based off a true
interaction<00:04:34.930> at<00:04:35.050> some<00:04:35.260> point<00:04:35.530> some<00:04:35.950> of<00:04:35.980> his

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
interaction at some point some of his

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.400 
interaction at some point some of his
moments<00:04:36.640> still<00:04:36.910> feel<00:04:37.180> kind<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.570> forced<00:04:38.140> like

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
moments still feel kind of forced like

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.380 
moments still feel kind of forced like
despite<00:04:38.920> having<00:04:39.100> played<00:04:39.520> before<00:04:39.730> he's<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
despite having played before he's the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.180 
despite having played before he's the
comic<00:04:40.660> relief<00:04:40.930> character<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:41.800> he<00:04:41.920> has<00:04:42.040> to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
comic relief character and so he has to

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.460 
comic relief character and so he has to
continually<00:04:42.910> lose<00:04:43.150> at<00:04:43.420> pie<00:04:43.630> show<00:04:43.930> or<00:04:44.260> his

continually lose at pie show or his

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.980 
continually lose at pie show or his
long-winded<00:04:45.100> fake<00:04:45.640> cop<00:04:45.970> backstory<00:04:46.600> which<00:04:46.840> was

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
long-winded fake cop backstory which was

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.020 
long-winded fake cop backstory which was
only<00:04:47.260> redeemed<00:04:47.620> because<00:04:48.010> of<00:04:48.100> Mako's<00:04:48.460> deadpan

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030
