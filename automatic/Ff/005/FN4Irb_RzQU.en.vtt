00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.359
 Hello people my name is Ilya will 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.099
 watched turtles don't know this movie 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.009
 solid bar I even somehow hurt 

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:14.009
 that the 30th anniversary of the franchise came out such r 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:14.009
 now I will take revenge for the kavabanga turtles 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.699
 ninja turtles are fantastic 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.359
 blockbuster directed by jonathan 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.310
 libesman 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.020
 Jonathan Thriller and Horror Lover 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.239
 rise thanks to the success directed 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.039
 on them shortstop calls after that 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.110
 he was noticed by michael bay with his 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.120
 production company platinum games and 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.980
 suggested to put a funny texas 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.960
 Chainsaw massacre in general Jonathan 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.300
 quickly got up and then took off 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.670
 still shitty death room shitty 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 battle for los angeles and tolerable anger 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.220
 titans 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 now under the shaggy hand and the producer 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.480
 would his platinumgames put the turtles 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.940
 in general, from where the legs grow in the movie you 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.680
 do you understand turtles themselves for the first time 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.890
 appeared in black and white graphic 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.960
 a 1984 novel by mirage 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.300
 studios and painted them by two artists 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.190
 self-taught kevin eastman and peter laird 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.560
 which originally wanted to do just 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.429
 parody of popular comics 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.929
 eighties i won't be much 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:11.509
 compare this movie with the old one 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.190
 the cult animated series of the 80s with others 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.770
 attempts to make a decent film 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.350
 attempts more and more to cash in on children 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.580
 memories and so I will smash into light 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.710
 this movie is in chips 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.689
 but for starters, as usual, the plot without 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.970
 spoilers movie begins with the fact that 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.130
 Megan Fox in the role of April O'Neill is trying 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.600
 become a serious successful reporter and 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.400
 accordingly trying to grab 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.200
 interesting stuff and of course 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.640
 material appears as storyline 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.040
 lines with secret fights between 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.470
 turtles and food clan nothing 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.600
 reminiscent of Peter Parker is that you generally have 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.149
 Aipril problems with work and turtles 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.920
 with a shredder you know everything as usual for 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.869
 me this film dummy which i 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.490
 never again look but need 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.590
 clearly understand that he has an audience 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.729
 not designed for my generation that is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.579
 not that which grew by 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.380
 the animated series of the late 80s she's a generation 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.869
 who did not see him and has no idea 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.939
 what cool turtles were before and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.189
 not less if you are good at 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.159
 cinema then you will notice that this film is on duty 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.239
 studio template to start collecting bablische 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.070
 plot spacing 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.780
 he is just disgusting and looks like 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.000
 Cheap copy of the plot of the new 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.280
 spiderman with a garfield seriously 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.380
 shredder try to do the same as lizard 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.329
 that is, spray the toxin even the tower in 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.579
 the end seems to remember that I 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.500
 said at the end of the movie if you go the plot 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.269
 besides the wild the similarity is completely not 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.140
 interesting and all actions absolutely 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.849
 predictable 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.660
 I will not cling to history 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.920
 origin of turtles because 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.750
 that the film as independent 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.560
 the work is entitled to its 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.660
 interpretation 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.880
 now as for actors and characters 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.980
 You can certainly say that the turtles too 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.410
 patterns but you know they were always not 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.720
 especially intricate I think that the film 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 they are the only normal characters yes 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.500
 they are a little gruff in appearance but not 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.660
 do them plush bugs 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.070
 childhood by the way turtles played live 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.320
 actors cast and all on the same technology 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.300
 motion capture about which I already 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.130
 told in a review on the planet of monkeys 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.320
 if anyone has not seen, you can see what 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.010
 As for the rat of the splinter, then I stayed 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.990
 displeased 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.360
 he was somehow very weak 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.640
 a bit even nasty with especially nasty 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.830
 whiskers played splinter melon woodbury 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.890
 a man is a hundred and twenty two centimeters tall 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.290
 Now the most unfortunate character shredder 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.940
 who is angry just because angry for 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.500
 the whole film comes from him somewhat 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.450
 evil standard phrases 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.760
 but basically he does the whole movie here 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.920
 such pathetic movement is all 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.260
 and look like you up to 1 baptized with mega 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.420
 throne hello you would be from but worst of all 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.700
 that he never got any 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.950
 qualities besides malice in a cartoon he had 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.590
 some trick charisma here he 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.780
 clean stamp of one-time villains well 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.050
 now my favorite megan fox 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.550
 the role of april o'nil or more correctly in the role 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.430
 emotionally useful seriously with her 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.650
 the main role she is nikakuschaya she 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.900
 certainly not annoying but playing ate or 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.880
 her main task of the film is to be beautiful 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.080
 little face and and the fifth grade point in 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.520
 frame is all 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.709
 and probably it's not bad for 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.660
 entertainment movie though all the same 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.830
 there was a moment when she played here he 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.350
 I think it is from some other 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.840
 the film is now the most interesting axon 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.460
 effects and directing many say 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.610
 action cool effects 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.980
 I'll tell you a crap action in my opinion 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.110
 wretched eight percent of a movie about god 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.570
 he is due to Jonathan's moronic direction 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:23.940
 libesmana whose favorite directors 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.160
 tricks are a trembling chamber + 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.350
 half and close ups as a result 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.210
 which objects start to put pressure on you 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.370
 lost sequence of actions 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.020
 dull attention and ultimately 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.940
 it all causes a headache and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.250
 there is complete indifference to 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.720
 what is happening is similar to indifference 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.720
 I was present at viewing 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.130
 fourth transformers 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.300
 something like this is the evolution of my 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.300
 faces while watching 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.690
 I remember myself after watching 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.639
 trembling battle for los angeles same 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.590
 libesmana who rewarded me more 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.389
 eye and head by the way yes movie also 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.819
 there are director's handwriting and 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.620
 Himself you can easily notice 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.020
 he just soaks the film with his 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.819
 favorite blue and purple highlights 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.199
 with glare even where it seemed 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.660
 they should not be 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.370
 even in the sewer shorter glare everywhere 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.410
 if I didn't know the libesman's handwriting 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.539
 would say that he himself put the film in 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.910
 the result of such filming and action effects 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.949
 also lose spikes look unnatural 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.080
 divorced from reality and as a result not 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.479
 impress all set 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.610
 fights, too, can hardly be seen well except 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.740
 moments in slow motion i'm not sure 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.860
 really it was impossible to make a clear 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.910
 staging fights but who needs it most 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.500
 snatch the loot 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.330
 but not everything is so bad people are and 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.280
 positive points I think you can 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.409
 carry humor if you remove one crowd 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.120
 farting evil joke it is quite good 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.490
 sometimes even dear to me for example 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.530
 like the scene in the elevator more of the benefits 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.370
 you can recall pleasant references to 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.530
 cartoon series 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.750
 and well-designed and scenery 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.060
 I like the scenery very much 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.460
 turtle lair wall of classic 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.840
 tape recorder can be seen right that people are famous 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.970
 bothered wanted to raise 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.800
 nostalgic memories and this is theirs 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.780
 partly happened even in spite of 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.060
 minus and by the way yes the movie will not be either 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.830
 crank they rokstedi not bebop but not 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.240
 get discouraged as I remember some 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.219
 of characters scheduled for 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.590
 appearance in the sequel hope it will 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.330
 better that we have a good result 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.310
 teenage filmed with normal 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.229
 turtles and pulling michelangelo 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.860
 shitty disposable villains 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.419
 duty template predictable plot 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.070
 tolerable humor and normal fraternal 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.990
 morality the film is not far from 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.240
 fourth transformers but still in 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.830
 much better yet watched noticed that 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.870
 dragged from viewing in the hall only 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.969
 teenagers so their generation is not 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.590
 I advise you to watch people rate 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:39.719
 share your opinion about the movie in 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.070
 comments and always remember from the movies 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.139
 which are worth seeing 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.389
 until 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.430
 By the way, do you know why the turtles are always 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.099
 attacking from the back do not win because 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.949
 that their rat trainer I know not very 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.870
 funny joke this technique applies 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.819
 when a fully drawn character 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.710
 required very realistic and lively 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.689
 interaction with real actors and 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.789
 scenery in general animated 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.379
 character sketched over a man 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.379
 the same technique was used by the euro
