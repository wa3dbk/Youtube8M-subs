how to make our own clasp out of that

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.220 
how to make our own clasp out of that
same<00:00:20.770> wire<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:22.180> wire<00:00:22.330> that<00:00:22.540> I've<00:00:22.660> chosen<00:00:22.960> for

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
same wire the wire that I've chosen for

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.519 
same wire the wire that I've chosen for
this<00:00:23.500> is<00:00:23.740> 18<00:00:24.520> gauge<00:00:24.849> wire<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.869> this<00:00:26.290> is

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
this is 18 gauge wire and this is

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.800 
this is 18 gauge wire and this is
artistic<00:00:26.920> wire<00:00:27.220> you<00:00:27.430> can<00:00:27.550> also<00:00:27.820> use<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.180> German

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
artistic wire you can also use a German

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.870 
artistic wire you can also use a German
style<00:00:29.020> wire<00:00:29.320> it's<00:00:30.099> going<00:00:30.250> to<00:00:30.310> just<00:00:30.460> bend<00:00:30.700> a

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
style wire it's going to just bend a

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.310 
style wire it's going to just bend a
little<00:00:31.000> bit<00:00:31.149> differently<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.810> art<00:00:31.989> wire<00:00:32.169> is

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
little bit differently the art wire is

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.630 
little bit differently the art wire is
going<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.500> be<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> little<00:00:32.770> bit<00:00:32.920> more<00:00:33.010> flexible

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
going to be a little bit more flexible

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.310 
going to be a little bit more flexible
whereas<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.450> German<00:00:34.720> style<00:00:34.870> wire<00:00:35.050> is<00:00:35.200> going

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
whereas the German style wire is going

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.170 
whereas the German style wire is going
to<00:00:35.380> be<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.470> little<00:00:35.649> bit<00:00:35.800> stiffer<00:00:36.160> so<00:00:37.000> I<00:00:37.030> have

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
to be a little bit stiffer so I have

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.180 
to be a little bit stiffer so I have
that<00:00:37.300> an<00:00:37.420> 18<00:00:37.930> gauge<00:00:38.140> you<00:00:38.320> can<00:00:38.350> use<00:00:38.680> eighteen

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
that an 18 gauge you can use eighteen

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.729 
that an 18 gauge you can use eighteen
sixteen<00:00:39.730> fourteen<00:00:40.270> one<00:00:41.110> thing<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.440> keep<00:00:41.590> in

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
sixteen fourteen one thing to keep in

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.130 
sixteen fourteen one thing to keep in
mind<00:00:42.030> depending<00:00:43.030> on<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.570> size<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:43.989> you're

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
mind depending on the size that you're

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.169 
mind depending on the size that you're
using<00:00:44.410> is<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:45.039> eighteen<00:00:45.460> gauge<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.879> great

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
using is that eighteen gauge is a great

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.970 
using is that eighteen gauge is a great
gauge<00:00:46.390> that<00:00:46.480> you<00:00:46.539> can<00:00:46.750> still<00:00:47.170> get<00:00:47.410> beads<00:00:47.739> on

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
gauge that you can still get beads on

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.709 
gauge that you can still get beads on
the<00:00:48.730> other<00:00:48.879> gauge<00:00:49.090> that<00:00:49.239> I'm<00:00:49.359> working<00:00:49.539> with

color this brassy art wire color so that

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.189 
color this brassy art wire color so that
you<00:00:58.149> can<00:00:58.269> see<00:00:58.449> it<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:58.600> little<00:00:58.780> bit<00:00:58.870> better<00:00:58.989> as

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
you can see it a little bit better as

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
just give a little 45 degree angle term

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.630 
just give a little 45 degree angle term
and<00:01:56.320> that's<00:01:56.770> going<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:56.979> make<00:01:57.070> my<00:01:57.189> eye<00:01:57.340> pin

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
and that's going to make my eye pin

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.240 
and that's going to make my eye pin
coming<00:01:57.909> down<00:01:58.119> straight<00:01:58.509> from<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.930> center<00:01:59.320> my

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
Bend on it from when it came off the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.670 
Bend on it from when it came off the
spool<00:02:04.390> because<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.049> going<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.229> be<00:02:05.320> spooled

around<00:02:06.039> so<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.759> do<00:02:07.060> keep<00:02:07.329> that<00:02:07.359> bend<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.140> and

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
around so I do keep that bend in it and

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.410 
around so I do keep that bend in it and
I<00:02:08.350> don't<00:02:08.560> straighten<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.100> out<00:02:09.220> completely<00:02:09.420> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.270 
little bit you're going to go ahead with
your<00:03:07.810> wire<00:03:08.080> cutters<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:08.709> trim<00:03:09.130> down

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
your wire cutters and just trim down

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.650 
your wire cutters and just trim down
that<00:03:09.489> end<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.549> way<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.730> don't<00:03:12.850> have<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
that end so that way you don't have a

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.140 
that end so that way you don't have a
cut<00:03:14.200> end<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.680> I'm<00:03:15.400> going<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.640> push<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.940> up

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
cut end to you I'm going to push that up

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.930 
cut end to you I'm going to push that up
to<00:03:16.360> where<00:03:16.510> I'm<00:03:16.600> working<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.819> then<00:03:18.819> what

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
to where I'm working on it and then what

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.280 
to where I'm working on it and then what
I'm<00:03:19.030> going<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.600> I'm<00:03:19.750> going<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.930> start<00:03:20.110> to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
I'm going to do is I'm going to start to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.289 
I'm going to do is I'm going to start to
add<00:03:20.440> my<00:03:20.739> beads<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.850> again<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.180> you're

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
add my beads so again when you're

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.490 
add my beads so again when you're
looking<00:03:22.330> at<00:03:22.600> your<00:03:22.720> coils<00:03:23.049> there's<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.319> little

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
looking at your coils there's a little

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.890 
looking at your coils there's a little
cheat<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:23.890> do<00:03:24.010> my<00:03:24.880> end<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.299> my<00:03:25.420> coil<00:03:25.630> got<00:03:25.870> a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
cheat that I do my end of my coil got a

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.229 
cheat that I do my end of my coil got a
little<00:03:26.170> spread<00:03:26.500> apart<00:03:26.769> as<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.910> was<00:03:28.030> trying<00:03:28.209> to

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
little spread apart as I was trying to

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.840 
little spread apart as I was trying to
work<00:03:28.450> with<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.630> underneath<00:03:29.049> here<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:30.670> what

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
work with it underneath here and what

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.890 
work with it underneath here and what
I'm<00:03:30.910> going<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.090> do<00:03:31.180> is<00:03:31.269> just<00:03:31.420> take<00:03:31.510> my<00:03:31.570> flat

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
I'm going to do is just take my flat

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.150 
I'm going to do is just take my flat
nose<00:03:31.930> pliers<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.500> kind<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.680> pinch<00:03:32.920> those

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
nose pliers and kind of pinch those

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.190 
nose pliers and kind of pinch those
together<00:03:33.370> that's<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.329> to<00:03:34.390> bring<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.930> coil

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
together that's going to bring that coil

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.520 
together that's going to bring that coil
closer<00:03:35.620> together<00:03:36.930> so<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:37.989> have<00:03:38.019> my<00:03:38.260> coil

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
closer together so I have my coil

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.720 
closer together so I have my coil
attached<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.160> now<00:03:39.220> what<00:03:39.340> I'm<00:03:39.400> going<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.549> do<00:03:39.640> is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
attached and now what I'm going to do is

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.420 
attached and now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:39.970> add<00:03:40.120> my<00:03:40.329> beads<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.010> have<00:03:42.400> a

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
I'm going to add my beads so I have a

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.910 
I'm going to add my beads so I have a
bead<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.000> I'm<00:03:43.120> going<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.329> put<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.570> on<00:03:43.769> slide<00:03:44.769> it

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
bead and I'm going to put it on slide it

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.640 
bead and I'm going to put it on slide it
down<00:03:45.070> into<00:03:45.310> place<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:47.200> what<00:03:47.320> I'm<00:03:47.380> going<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.590> do

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
down into place and what I'm going to do

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.520 
down into place and what I'm going to do
is<00:03:47.769> wrap<00:03:47.980> my<00:03:48.130> wire<00:03:48.400> over<00:03:49.000> top<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.269> my<00:03:49.600> bead<00:03:49.810> so

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
is wrap my wire over top of my bead so

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.990 
is wrap my wire over top of my bead so
the<00:03:50.620> wire<00:03:50.739> is<00:03:50.859> going<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.010> go<00:03:51.130> over<00:03:51.340> top<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.820> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
the wire is going to go over top of the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.090 
the wire is going to go over top of the
bead<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:53.200> you<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.620> as<00:03:53.769> many<00:03:54.010> times

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
bead and you can do that as many times

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.170 
bead and you can do that as many times
as<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:54.730> want

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
as you want

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
the thinner gauge wires like I said I'm

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.160 
the thinner gauge wires like I said I'm
working<00:03:57.130> with<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.280> 22<00:03:57.790> gauge<00:03:57.820> wire<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.900> thinner

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
working with a 22 gauge wire the thinner

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.590 
working with a 22 gauge wire the thinner
gauge<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.560> 24<00:04:00.010> 23<00:04:02.010> 26<00:04:03.010> gauges<00:04:03.609> they'll<00:04:04.150> going

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
gauge the 24 23 26 gauges they'll going

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.759 
gauge the 24 23 26 gauges they'll going
to<00:04:04.660> be<00:04:04.720> really<00:04:04.989> thin<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.380> they're<00:04:05.470> not<00:04:05.560> going

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
to be really thin and they're not going

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.349 
to be really thin and they're not going
to<00:04:05.829> hold<00:04:05.950> around<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> bead<00:04:06.489> as<00:04:06.640> well<00:04:06.820> 20<00:04:07.180> gauge

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
to hold around the bead as well 20 gauge

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.430 
to hold around the bead as well 20 gauge
is<00:04:07.510> actually<00:04:07.780> going<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:07.959> hold<00:04:08.079> around<00:04:08.380> the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
is actually going to hold around the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.650 
is actually going to hold around the
bead<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:09.010> best<00:04:09.250> after<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.180> go<00:04:10.329> around<00:04:10.450> the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
bead the best after I go around the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.840 
bead the best after I go around the
beads<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.930> couple<00:04:11.200> times<00:04:11.380> I'm<00:04:11.650> going<00:04:12.519> to<00:04:12.670> wrap

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
beads a couple times I'm going to wrap
