close battle as well okay so as normal

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.240 
close battle as well okay so as normal
I'm<00:00:12.870> leading<00:00:13.139> off<00:00:13.259> with<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.559> chimp<00:00:13.860> child<00:00:14.099> this

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
I'm leading off with my chimp child this

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.129 
I'm leading off with my chimp child this
time<00:00:14.490> now<00:00:15.059> he's<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.690> Charmander

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
time now he's going with this Charmander

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.109 
time now he's going with this Charmander
so<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> fake<00:00:17.100> out<00:00:17.310> they're<00:00:17.730> getting<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so I get the fake out they're getting a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.939 
so I get the fake out they're getting a
little<00:00:18.240> bit<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.480> damage<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.840> there<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.199> thought

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
little bit of damage on there I thought

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.260 
little bit of damage on there I thought
this<00:00:20.070> would<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> good<00:00:20.460> opportunity<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:21.090> set

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
this would be a good opportunity to set

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.640 
this would be a good opportunity to set
up<00:00:21.359> my<00:00:21.480> stealth<00:00:21.869> rocks<00:00:22.109> as<00:00:22.260> well

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
up my stealth rocks as well

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.320 
up my stealth rocks as well
and<00:00:22.769> considering<00:00:23.460> Charmander<00:00:24.060> isn't

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and considering Charmander isn't

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.320 
and considering Charmander isn't
probably<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> most<00:00:24.840> common<00:00:25.500> lead<00:00:25.949> really<00:00:26.519> he

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
probably the most common lead really he

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.230 
probably the most common lead really he
sets<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.840> D<00:00:27.990> dance<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.000> okay

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
sets up the D dance so I'm like okay

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.880 
sets up the D dance so I'm like okay
that's<00:00:30.449> cool<00:00:30.750> there<00:00:31.320> wasn't<00:00:31.470> really<00:00:31.740> much

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
that's cool there wasn't really much

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.639 
that's cool there wasn't really much
else<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.520> could<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.090> him<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.450> my<00:00:33.780> Chimchar

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
else I could do to him with my Chimchar

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.490 
else I could do to him with my Chimchar

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
did it a couple of damage coats

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.139

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
afterwards but you know that's that's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.220 
afterwards but you know that's that's
life<00:00:51.449> whatever<00:00:51.780> okay<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.120> in<00:00:54.120> comes<00:00:54.449> Ekans<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
probably could have gone for the coil

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.610 
probably could have gone for the coil
there<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.399> whatever<00:01:00.030> yeah<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.440> wanted

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it's a it's a bit of a pain so he's kind

it's a it's a bit of a pain so he's kind
of<00:01:06.630> forces<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.170> staying<00:01:07.619> there<00:01:07.799> because

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
of forces with staying there because

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
of forces with staying there because
that's<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.760> stealth<00:01:09.030> rocks<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> set<00:01:09.570> up

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that's the stealth rocks I set up

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.289 
that's the stealth rocks I set up
earlier<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.700> that's<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.119> rid<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
earlier and that's going to get rid of

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
earlier and that's going to get rid of
that<00:01:12.420> char<00:01:12.630> matter<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.409> comes<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> ANA

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
that char matter so in comes the ANA

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.190 
that char matter so in comes the ANA
roof<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.420> might<00:01:15.600> try<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.869> set<00:01:16.080> up

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
roof I think you might try and set up

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.929 
roof I think you might try and set up
stealth<00:01:16.590> rock<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:16.950> something<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> went<00:01:17.759> for

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
stealth rock or something so I went for

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.719 
stealth rock or something so I went for
a<00:01:18.000> rest<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.310> go<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
a rest here and you actually go to the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700 
a rest here and you actually go to the
rock<00:01:20.939> blast<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.900> hits<00:01:22.170> me<00:01:22.320> three

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
rock blast there which hits me three

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.410 
rock blast there which hits me three
times<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.130> finishes<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.580> off<00:01:23.640> my<00:01:23.850> Ekans<00:01:24.210> which

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
times and finishes it off my Ekans which

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.899 
times and finishes it off my Ekans which
I<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.710> damn<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> try<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.759> my

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909

going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> bring<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.360> Chimchar<00:01:30.840> again<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.439> knew

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
going to bring in Chimchar again I knew

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.880 
going to bring in Chimchar again I knew
he<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:31.979> switch<00:01:32.220> into<00:01:32.930> freely<00:01:33.930> share<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
he would switch into freely share so I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
he would switch into freely share so I
just<00:01:35.159> went<00:01:35.310> straight<00:01:35.430> away<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.119> overheat

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
just went straight away for the overheat

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
just went straight away for the overheat
because<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.110> was<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> strongest<00:01:38.040> move<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
because that was the strongest move I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.260 
because that was the strongest move I
could<00:01:38.729> possibly<00:01:39.119> do<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
could possibly do to to it really and it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.550 
could possibly do to to it really and it
still<00:01:42.509> hits<00:01:42.720> really<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.350> hard

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
still hits really really hard

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.469 
still hits really really hard
considering<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.220> things<00:01:44.579> bulky<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
considering that things bulky is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
considering that things bulky is
and<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.810> got<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.110> V<00:01:46.409> light<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.740> well<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and it's got a V light as well and I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
and it's got a V light as well and I
knew<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.360> ever<00:01:48.509> lives<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.079> mean<00:01:49.380> why

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
knew it have ever lives I mean why

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
knew it have ever lives I mean why
wouldn't<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.460> everyone<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.600> gets<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
wouldn't have everyone so it gets a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.719 
wouldn't have everyone so it gets a
cursed<00:01:52.140> body<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.530> my<00:01:52.619> overheat<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.490> not
