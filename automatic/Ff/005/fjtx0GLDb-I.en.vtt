of frittering his life away and gave him

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.600 
of frittering his life away and gave him
an<00:00:41.199> opportunity<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:42.010> required<00:00:42.309> a<00:00:42.400> lot<00:00:42.520> of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
an opportunity that required a lot of

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
an opportunity that required a lot of
hard<00:00:42.760> work<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:44.020> get<00:00:44.320> into<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.620> fold<00:00:44.860> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
hard work to to get into the fold and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.090 
hard work to to get into the fold and
mentored<00:00:46.870> him<00:00:46.989> at<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.199> same<00:00:47.350> time<00:00:47.410> although<00:00:47.800> I

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
mentored him at the same time although I

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.040 
mentored him at the same time although I
think<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.720> significant<00:00:49.720> part<00:00:49.900> of<00:00:49.930> that

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
think a significant part of that

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.570 
think a significant part of that
mentoring<00:00:50.290> was<00:00:50.470> sort<00:00:50.589> of<00:00:50.620> off-screen<00:00:51.070> but

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
mentoring was sort of off-screen but

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.890 
mentoring was sort of off-screen but
it's<00:00:51.699> implied<00:00:51.910> right<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.210> our<00:00:55.360> love<00:00:55.660> for

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
it's implied right and and our love for

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.189 
it's implied right and and our love for
one<00:00:55.930> another<00:00:56.110> although<00:00:56.559> it's<00:00:56.829> unspoken<00:00:57.579> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
one another although it's unspoken is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.689 
one another although it's unspoken is
abundant<00:00:59.199> and<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.350> think<00:00:59.559> it's<00:00:59.710> pretty<00:01:00.460> clear

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
abundant and I think it's pretty clear

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.450 
abundant and I think it's pretty clear
and<00:01:01.030> then<00:01:01.900> in<00:01:02.019> this<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.980> beginning<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.370> this

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460
