thing is coffee now this is a tricky one

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.860 
thing is coffee now this is a tricky one
some<00:01:51.560> people<00:01:52.010> yes<00:01:52.310> some<00:01:52.610> people<00:01:52.940> know<00:01:53.180> for<00:01:53.810> the

some people yes some people know for the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.170 
some people yes some people know for the
most<00:01:54.049> part<00:01:54.380> when<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.070> saw<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.400> study<00:01:55.729> I<00:01:55.820> think

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
most part when I saw the study I think

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.910 
most part when I saw the study I think
they're<00:01:56.270> referring<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.200> additives<00:01:57.770> in

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
they're referring to the additives in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.890

coffee<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:59.030> majority<00:01:59.270> people<00:01:59.720> don't

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
coffee so because majority people don't

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.810 
coffee so because majority people don't
drink<00:02:00.110> black<00:02:00.320> coffee<00:02:00.380> guess<00:02:00.920> what<00:02:01.159> they<00:02:01.670> add
