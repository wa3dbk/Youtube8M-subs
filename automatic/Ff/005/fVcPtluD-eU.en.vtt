it's<00:02:21.670> a<00:02:21.700> little<00:02:21.940> bit<00:02:22.060> harder<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.360> close

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it's a little bit harder to close

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.890 
it's a little bit harder to close
because<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.580> does<00:02:24.760> take<00:02:25.209> up<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.510> whole<00:02:25.599> screen

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
because it does take up the whole screen

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.009 
because it does take up the whole screen
and<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.230> have<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:26.730> pull<00:02:27.730> down<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.870> it's

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
and you have to like pull down but it's

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.570 
and you have to like pull down but it's
so<00:02:29.140> pretty<00:02:29.470> easy<00:02:30.420> as<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.660> can<00:02:31.810> see<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:33.220> it's

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
so pretty easy as you can see but it's

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.720 
so pretty easy as you can see but it's
just<00:02:34.090> much<00:02:34.330> faster<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.140> pretty<00:02:35.470> much

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
instant I guess you could say and it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.380 
instant I guess you could say and it
does<00:02:38.620> give<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> nice<00:02:39.069> effect<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.360> as<00:02:40.599> well<00:02:40.980> so
