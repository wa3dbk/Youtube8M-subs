00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
don't know what's taking it up this is a

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.470 
don't know what's taking it up this is a
good<00:02:59.540> video<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.380> yeah<00:03:01.070> this<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.430> 360<00:03:02.180> or<00:03:02.300> bytes

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
good video so yeah this is 360 or bytes

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.230 
good video so yeah this is 360 or bytes

but I only I have 477 gigabytes free so
yeah<00:03:08.240> this<00:03:09.230> doesn't<00:03:09.440> really<00:03:09.680> make<00:03:09.830> sense<00:03:10.270> so

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270
