00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.389
 hello people how are they and if we make a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.389
 doll 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.350
 allow me so little 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.490
 old woman 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.670
 I want 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.759
 to 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.420
 we continue first let's clarify a 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.720
 thing and that is a star 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.520
 scientifically a star you are a 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.770
 ball of light that feeds on gas that 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.620
 it is millions of millions of millions 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.690
 of kilometers of our planet 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.000
 now let's clarify that it is a 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.309
 star on earth a star in the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.670
 land is that person that thanks to 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.519
 Your talent or trade is famous for many 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.940
 people like for example a singer 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.920
 even if you listen to rock metal so 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.220
 you want to know who is chente fernández 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.650
 and you know who is juan gabriel and that is 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.170
 Drawer is to win to win 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.810
 so well already clarified this we are going to 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.540
 continue this video not so recently 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.310
 I was listening to comments 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.439
 audio publications on twitter facebook 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.049
 everywhere where many actors from 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.840
 dubbing they threw crap shit 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.340
 they criticized they made fun of the community 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 I walked in general which made me angry 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.350
 a bit because I knew about a very good source 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.600
 that there are many dubbing actors that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.569
 they have not given them work because they said 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.030
 and affirmed that they have left the 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.979
 community fund um and I've also known 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.770
 that many people who study 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.469
 dubbing and in courses in both schools 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.340
 of dubbing have been taken out because they have 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.799
 said that they are fund übers or if they are not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.829
 They grab my cheek, which I do 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.590
 a reverend asshole since it's like 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.110
 tell a sweeper I'm not going to give you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.420
 Intendant job because you're 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.549
 sweeper or because you were sweeper or 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.679
 also as a physiotherapist and 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.160
 tell him I'm not going to give you work because 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.080
 before you were his flag 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.630
 but they understand that the practice is 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.460
 makes the profession or if the sides 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.850
 are doing this is because maybe 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.470
 someday what they did as a hobby or 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.020
 for fun they will do it for 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.880
 good profession also recently I was 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.680
 watching a comment from an actor 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.010
 dubbing which I will not say who is 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.100
 that he mocked laughing at that in 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.340
 the background world had superstars 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.180
 we already clarified that it is a star but 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.410
 well, this guy was making fun of 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.890
 superstars in the world of what background 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.410
 which made me laugh a little and like 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.320
 to bother me in a certain way because 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.600
 Of course it's allowed that a fan of 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.790
 uber feels like a star in the world 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.250
 of the background as well as a dubbing actor 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 it is also very permissible that that actor 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.140
 of dubbing sits the superstar 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.050
 within the world of clear dubbing that 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.690
 is allowed for what reason because 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.970
 they have every right to feel 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.400
 or feel famous inside that world 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.680
 because we know as much as you and I 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.660
 We know that if you leave your house if you 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.580
 dubbing actor or your dubber fan if you 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.640
 you leave your house or the neighbor of the 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.560
 corner recognizes you so with all the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.470
 right of the world we can be famous 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.430
 where the eggs do not swell 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.260
 so I do not understand why the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.120
 load the stick to a fan dúber if the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.520
 uber fan we know what we do 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.500
 It has absolutely nothing wrong beam 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.840
 of account that nothing else take away the voice to 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.930
 something that has been folded and put your 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.510
 voice trying to imitate him or trying to 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.660
 imitate the performance because the funk dúber 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.630
 what you have is the following if your fan 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.060
 dúber if you upload a video truth a 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.890
 asshole I do not need to tell you hey waite 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.130
 missed the performance because because it's 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.460
 comparing your performance with that of the actor 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.020
 of original dubbing and so many people will 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.020
 will be saying you missed it because 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.420
 because it's comparing you to the actor 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.680
 of original dubbing that made the voice that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.719
 you are trying to do 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.900
 at the end of all this you will go back to 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.090
 do the background and what are you going to do 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.040
 exactly the same 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.380
