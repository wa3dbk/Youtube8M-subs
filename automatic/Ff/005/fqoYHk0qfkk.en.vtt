00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649

about right however a little bit
alternative<00:00:44.250> instead<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:45.030> being<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.239> the

alternative instead of being on the

alternative instead of being on the
right-hand<00:00:45.629> side<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.289> left<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
right-hand side it's all on the left but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.170 
right-hand side it's all on the left but
once<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.129> used<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.969> actually

once you get used to it it's actually

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
once you get used to it it's actually
quite<00:00:48.510> clever<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> back<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
quite clever so on the back we have the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
quite clever so on the back we have the
fingerprint<00:00:51.120> scanner<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> actually

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fingerprint scanner but this actually

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.439 
fingerprint scanner but this actually
you<00:00:52.949> initially<00:00:53.430> set<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.090> putting<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you initially set it up by putting a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
you initially set it up by putting a
finger<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.870> five<00:00:55.260> different<00:00:55.289> times<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
finger on it five different times and it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
finger on it five different times and it
fully<00:00:56.520> detects<00:00:56.910> your<00:00:57.030> finger<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.079> be

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
fully detects your finger and to be

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.349 
fully detects your finger and to be
honest<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.590> works<00:00:58.770> extremely<00:00:59.280> well<00:00:59.579> it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
honest it works extremely well it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.849 
honest it works extremely well it
actually<00:01:00.480> detects<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.050> finger<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.590> almost

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
actually detects your finger in almost

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
actually detects your finger in almost
any<00:01:02.160> orientation<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> also<00:01:04.080> have

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
any orientation and then you also have

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
any orientation and then you also have
the<00:01:04.439> 13<00:01:04.799> megapixel<00:01:05.339> camera<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:05.760> protrudes

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the 13 megapixel camera which protrudes

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
the 13 megapixel camera which protrudes
a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:06.869> than<00:01:06.990> I'd<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:07.860> not

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
a little more than I'd like but it's not

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.429 
a little more than I'd like but it's not
a<00:01:08.040> disaster<00:01:08.720> overall<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> build<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.350> this

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
a disaster overall the build on this

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.530 
a disaster overall the build on this
device<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.430> quite<00:01:11.640> spectacular<00:01:12.360> for

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
device is really quite spectacular for

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
device is really quite spectacular for
the<00:01:12.600> money<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.229> quality<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.680> great<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.189> looks

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
the money the quality is great it looks

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.460 
the money the quality is great it looks
great<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> feels<00:01:15.090> great<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.720> hand

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
so when you actually turn on the device

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.870 
so when you actually turn on the device
you'll<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.270> greeted<00:01:21.420> by<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.780> 720p<00:01:22.770> HD<00:01:23.580> panel

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
a reasonable display it gets the job

fairly vibrant and the contrast is
pretty<00:01:45.510> good<00:01:45.920> now<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.400> can<00:01:47.550> see<00:01:47.730> the

and<00:01:49.590> actually<00:01:49.680> makes<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.190> lot<00:01:50.370> nicer<00:01:50.610> to

they<00:02:35.310> actually<00:02:35.340> would<00:02:35.670> be<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:35.910> real<00:02:36.090> life<00:02:36.300> or

they actually would be in real life or

they actually would be in real life or

something like the LG g4 taking a listen

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.840 
something like the LG g4 taking a listen
to<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.800> speakers<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.489> tell<00:02:41.670> they're

actually not very loud bass is muffled

actually not very loud bass is muffled
and<00:02:44.070> detail<00:02:44.550> is<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:45.060> below<00:02:45.209> average

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.020 

so<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.740> device<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.160> running<00:03:01.310> Android<00:03:01.670> 5.0

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
so this device is running Android 5.0

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.780 
so this device is running Android 5.0
lollipop<00:03:02.600> it's<00:03:03.560> good<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:04.340> not<00:03:04.490> great

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
lollipop it's good but it's not great

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.790 
lollipop it's good but it's not great
this<00:03:05.360> thing<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.630> unlikely<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.200> get<00:03:06.380> an<00:03:06.500> update

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
this thing is unlikely to get an update

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.380 
this thing is unlikely to get an update
to<00:03:06.920> android<00:03:07.190> 5.1<00:03:07.730> but<00:03:08.030> it's<00:03:08.150> always<00:03:08.360> a

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
to android 5.1 but it's always a

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.510 
to android 5.1 but it's always a
possibility<00:03:08.680> having<00:03:09.680> said<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.340> is

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
possibility having said that this is

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.610 
possibility having said that this is
still<00:03:10.730> in<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:10.970> sort<00:03:11.210> of<00:03:11.240> top<00:03:11.510> 5%<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:12.260> android

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
still in the sort of top 5% of android

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.500 
still in the sort of top 5% of android

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
phones that actually run lollipop so i

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.660 
phones that actually run lollipop so i
guess<00:03:14.960> is<00:03:15.080> nothing<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.440> complain<00:03:15.680> about<00:03:15.800> the

guess is nothing to complain about the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.220 
guess is nothing to complain about the
settings<00:03:17.030> menu<00:03:17.090> is<00:03:17.360> pretty<00:03:17.630> standard<00:03:17.870> with<00:03:18.200> a

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
settings menu is pretty standard with a

settings menu is pretty standard with a
couple<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.560> extra<00:03:18.890> things<00:03:19.100> thrown<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.580> for

it's<00:04:56.870> hard<00:04:57.169> to<00:04:57.230> complain<00:04:57.530> about<00:04:57.650> performance

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
it's hard to complain about performance

reasonably well with the browser I mean

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.600 
reasonably well with the browser I mean
it's<00:05:07.010> fairly<00:05:07.220> smooth

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
it's fairly smooth

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
images pose little problem but it's not

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:15.550

the<00:05:13.250> fastest<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:14.300> even<00:05:14.509> in<00:05:14.599> an<00:05:14.719> intense<00:05:15.080> 3d

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.149

it's<00:05:17.930> actually<00:05:18.080> playing<00:05:18.469> it<00:05:18.560> extremely<00:05:19.009> well

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
it's actually playing it extremely well

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.279 
it's actually playing it extremely well
now<00:05:19.969> this<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.240> actually<00:05:20.360> unsurprising<00:05:21.259> given

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
now this is actually unsurprising given

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.080 
now this is actually unsurprising given
its<00:05:21.620> 2<00:05:21.800> gigabytes<00:05:22.219> of<00:05:22.370> RAM<00:05:22.580> octa-core

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
its 2 gigabytes of RAM octa-core

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.330 
its 2 gigabytes of RAM octa-core
processor<00:05:23.689> and<00:05:23.930> low<00:05:24.319> 720p<00:05:25.189> resolution

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
processor and low 720p resolution

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.670 
processor and low 720p resolution
because<00:05:25.969> that<00:05:26.599> means<00:05:26.719> is<00:05:26.900> less<00:05:27.080> pixels<00:05:27.560> to

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
because that means is less pixels to

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.950 
because that means is less pixels to
push<00:05:27.969> so<00:05:28.969> I<00:05:29.000> suppose<00:05:29.419> you<00:05:29.569> would<00:05:29.689> kind<00:05:29.930> of

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
push so I suppose you would kind of

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.240 
push so I suppose you would kind of
expect<00:05:30.080> this<00:05:30.439> sort<00:05:30.620> of<00:05:30.740> performance<00:05:30.949> but

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
expect this sort of performance but

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.610 
expect this sort of performance but
nonetheless<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.819> still<00:05:32.000> pleasing<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.539> see

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
nonetheless is still pleasing to see

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.459 
nonetheless is still pleasing to see
basically<00:05:33.620> all<00:05:33.830> 3d<00:05:34.250> 2.5<00:05:35.150> d<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.569> 2d<00:05:35.960> games<00:05:36.199> run

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
basically all 3d 2.5 d and 2d games run

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.129 
basically all 3d 2.5 d and 2d games run
perfectly<00:05:37.039> so<00:05:37.370> yeah<00:05:37.909> that's<00:05:38.120> great<00:05:38.449> and<00:05:38.689> so<00:05:39.050> in

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
perfectly so yeah that's great and so in

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.260 
perfectly so yeah that's great and so in
terms<00:05:39.319> of<00:05:39.469> performance<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:40.310> mci<00:05:40.639> 700

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.390

compares<00:05:41.629> very<00:05:41.719> favorably<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.740> any<00:05:42.949> upper

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.070 
that just sort of rounds off the package
and<00:06:22.699> gives<00:06:23.029> the<00:06:23.180> phone<00:06:23.360> a<00:06:23.389> little<00:06:23.750> bit<00:06:23.960> of
