the bottom I just go ahead and leave
that<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.550> ends<00:05:14.760> up<00:05:14.820> being<00:05:15.620> oops<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:17.550> got

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
that in it ends up being oops you got

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.800 
that in it ends up being oops you got
transferred<00:05:18.180> back<00:05:18.420> in<00:05:18.660> from<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.900> tongs<00:05:19.790> that

transferred back in from the tongs that

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.360 
transferred back in from the tongs that
ends<00:05:21.810> up<00:05:21.900> being<00:05:22.050> kind<00:05:22.260> of<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.470> starter<00:05:22.920> I<00:05:23.070> think

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
ends up being kind of a starter I think

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.790

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
juicing I emptied that container out put

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.360 
juicing I emptied that container out put
it<00:06:09.700> into<00:06:09.910> this<00:06:10.030> bag<00:06:10.300> while<00:06:10.660> I<00:06:10.690> went<00:06:11.140> downstairs

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
it into this bag while I went downstairs

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.160 
it into this bag while I went downstairs
fed<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.810> worm<00:06:13.810> and<00:06:15.060> that's<00:06:16.060> empty<00:06:16.600> except<00:06:16.990> for

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
fed the worm and that's empty except for

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.620 
fed the worm and that's empty except for
the<00:06:17.290> really<00:06:17.920> gross<00:06:18.280> stinky<00:06:19.260> starter<00:06:20.260> rot<00:06:20.650> and

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
the really gross stinky starter rot and

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:39.670 
the really gross stinky starter rot and
so<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:23.110> open<00:06:23.980> up<00:06:24.100> this<00:06:24.250> bag<00:06:26.340> and

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.440 

all<00:06:40.680> right<00:06:40.830> and<00:06:41.250> then<00:06:41.670> I'll<00:06:41.790> just<00:06:41.940> mash<00:06:42.210> that

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
all right and then I'll just mash that

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.620 
all right and then I'll just mash that
down<00:06:42.510> a<00:06:42.750> little<00:06:43.020> bit<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:44.460> get<00:06:44.580> some<00:06:44.820> space<00:06:45.030> so

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
down a little bit to get some space so

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.140 
down a little bit to get some space so
I've<00:06:45.990> already<00:06:46.290> got<00:06:46.440> this<00:06:47.430> container<00:06:47.880> half

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
I've already got this container half

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:55.120 
I've already got this container half
full<00:06:48.660> and<00:06:49.610> I'll<00:06:50.610> probably<00:06:50.910> get<00:06:52.670> another

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
full and I'll probably get another

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.300 
full and I'll probably get another
several<00:06:56.130> days<00:06:56.280> of<00:06:56.490> juicing<00:06:56.940> pulp<00:06:57.360> into<00:06:57.690> that

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
several days of juicing pulp into that

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.640 
several days of juicing pulp into that
to<00:06:59.310> fill<00:06:59.520> it<00:06:59.670> up<00:06:59.760> and<00:07:00.030> it<00:07:00.630> will<00:07:00.780> have<00:07:00.990> a<00:07:01.020> big

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
to fill it up and it will have a big

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.250 
to fill it up and it will have a big
huge<00:07:01.950> hairy<00:07:02.490> glob<00:07:03.000> of<00:07:03.240> mould<00:07:03.510> over<00:07:03.780> the<00:07:03.900> top<00:07:04.080> of
