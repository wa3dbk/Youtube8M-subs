00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
weird I wanted it to be like like in the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.080 
weird I wanted it to be like like in the
rocky<00:02:20.770> movies<00:02:20.980> where<00:02:21.340> if<00:02:21.520> they<00:02:21.670> get<00:02:21.850> punched

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
rocky movies where if they get punched

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.820 
rocky movies where if they get punched
really<00:02:22.270> hard<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:23.230> was<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:23.530> sweat

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
really hard this it was like sweat

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.530 
really hard this it was like sweat
flying<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.310> earth<00:02:24.370> but<00:02:24.670> but<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.240> couldn't

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
flying in the earth but but we couldn't

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.930 
flying in the earth but but we couldn't
duplicate<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.410> effect<00:02:26.740> because<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.370> camera

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
duplicate that effect because the camera

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.590 
duplicate that effect because the camera
is<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.300> not<00:02:28.420> very<00:02:28.480> good<00:02:28.810> quality<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:30.600> I'm

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
is really not very good quality so I'm

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600 
is really not very good quality so I'm
like<00:02:31.750> tackling<00:02:32.200> Sean<00:02:32.770> which<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.160> totally

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
like tackling Sean which is totally

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.750 
like tackling Sean which is totally
against<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> rules<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.480> think<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:36.190> I'm<00:02:36.430> not

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
against the rules I think think I'm not

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.090 
against the rules I think think I'm not
really<00:02:36.910> into<00:02:37.150> boxing<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.540> much<00:02:37.720> sense<00:02:38.100> but

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
really into boxing that much sense but

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.950 
really into boxing that much sense but
i'm<00:02:39.220> pretty<00:02:39.370> sure<00:02:39.550> it's<00:02:39.670> possible<00:02:39.850> yes<00:02:40.570> so

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
i'm pretty sure it's possible yes so

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.550 
i'm pretty sure it's possible yes so
what<00:02:41.800> Sean<00:02:42.070> gets<00:02:42.310> up<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.670> he's<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.290> Jew<00:02:44.290> going
