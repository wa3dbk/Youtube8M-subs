00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 100 one hundred percent result in 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.620
 home fights in another girl 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.820
 Manchester City fails to play 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.430
 departure and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.130
 by result away from the team like 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.669
 write in England and would stand on the flight but 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.590
 due to the great result at home 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.419
 Manchester City is still closer 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.560
 to the upper table whether parts of the table and 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:31.850
 immediately on the ninth second is dangerous when 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 20 seconds before the start of the match Manchester City 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.750
 comes forward 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 rice coped with the first blow but 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.070
 finishing moves are more agile than all agile 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.240
 turned out to be one of the players 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 manchester city didn't even have time to turn 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.770
 attention who was it the worst mistake 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.550
 at the very beginning of the match, such pressure 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 the home team begins with the pressure 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 kick aguero he is a lawyer and he managed 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.309
 has time for this sword 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.200
 at high speed to get from here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.999
 hurried 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.810
 Tottenham defender but did not have time 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:15.630
 make prevent you from attaching to this 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.009
 sword and for such a rather complicated 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.259
 trajectories 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.259
 the ball turns 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.450
 the ball is in the net and the south 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.450
 Ghent and higher 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.650
 moreover, on scored points to allow 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.020
 mean higher manchester 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:45.240
 city in the saber standings we have 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:47.580
 good sword you dangerous yuri slaughter 20 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.560
 drove the ball literally using 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:54.680
 defenders of the Negredo 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.079
 who pantene is somehow very easy rare 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.210
 but aptly Manchester City penetrates that 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.189
 same that gasped more but also here vaunted 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.229
 defense then just look like she 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.140
 looks against really strong a 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.800
 so again ugly lo and ball 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.319
 anywhere unaddressed there wins 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.750
 the ball its where it all starts seemed 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.680
 would both 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.920
 the chapter began a bad sword input very 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.420
 good goalkeeper lawyer here after that i 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.580
 completely different start 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.140
 evaluate this here is the story when 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.239
 coaches talk about what they need 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.040
 goalkeeper who can play like kicked 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.840
 it would seem the goalkeeper's business to save his 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.910
 the team there to play in the frame at the exit 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.130
 hands to put the ball in the game en no here 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.799
 here especially in the championship angie very 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.870
 a lot of games and feet a lot 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.599
 traditionally defenders cast an altar 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:48.230
 under this sword into the game a strong blow 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.209
 on 17 for comparison at an arsenal plus 14 and 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.610
 Liverpool hours + 11 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.739
 Well this is of course at the expense of 7 hammered Norwich 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.530
 admissibility the match will end with somehow 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.810
 more sane account type us 340 all 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.230
 it would be equal to him very seriously on May 3 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.900
 aguero 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.209
 scored with you hearth two she can 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.040
 tell the assists that 100 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.069
 tons of cream in defense entrance yard 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.989
 just today at wards wella that 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.480
 no longer ready the team turned to 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.459
 this game is absolutely very easy city 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.420
 understands watch what a rally ball 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.890
 everything seems to be clear everything is obvious but 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.250
 it's obvious and seemingly a combination 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.080
 the ball draws a complete deadlock 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 defense 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.220
 tutankhamun Jesus Navas transfer of aguero 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.459
 rolls the ball tribute was 30 in the first 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.459
 halftime 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:55.709
 15 balls in petit latest home time 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.709
 let's so 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.200
 define 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.629
 develops 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.560
 attacks but see how easy it is to slowly 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:16.660
 on foot the tour goes 11 by the name of freedom 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.000
 40 disgrace in the city pain yes what is it 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.800
 so but the kids dressing room then guys 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.370
 so how can you play 40 on foot pass 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.639
 backwards 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.169
 there are you here 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.169
 look here is just not serious 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.990
 of course bravo city cool played well 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.870
 how he plays the meters, not only in 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.310
 defense and in general the whole team like her 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.310
 fighting for the ball and 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.099
 40 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.330
 and this team was in ninth place before 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.330
 this tour 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.110
 a team that wins with a score of 40 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.970
 rubbing his hands pellegrini but rubbing 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.729
 hands he will probably be right when on 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.060
 This type of departure will be 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:17.080
 Manchester City is stable without anything 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.080
 can not teams 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.370
 the British love statistics I think that 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.630
 are they any series necessarily 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.630
 mark 50 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.390
 I know one person who set 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.720
 that in the second half there will be more goals 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.230
 than in the first because it will reach 50 for two 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.230
 clogged up 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.330
 by the way you also know this person but 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.330
 it's not me 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.920
 I haven't seen football like that for quite a while 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.750
 be hours there was an offside position it 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.980
 here is something that reminds of a duel 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:09.940
 chisels and washers when one team 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:14.170
 measles in full force and swords 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.150
 the gate fell one after the other but 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.280
 Hottabych and exactly the stadium is not and 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.960
 rods 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.360
 Warrot nobody pushes just full 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.660
 the guard today comes from that team 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.970
 he ham spoiled his all the statistics 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.510
 crossed out one match but manchester 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.080
 City of course is terrible in his field with 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.990
 defense 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.970
 manchester city milner 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.060
 I donâ€™t learn gears 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.990
 Reached error protector output Gennady 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.760
 m6 but 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:48.530
 and Jesus is again the site mail.ru 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.360
 diagonal as you gave one defender 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:55.940
 hello again then this time 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.150
 dawson who was there closer 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.150
 everything 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.439
 Yes 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:12.730
 this grinding vertonen nauchil 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.730
 60 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.520
 13 goals in the last two matches when I'm 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.300
 I tell you when 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:29.449
 5 missed totenhem'a now means 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:29.449
 if I have time to get to this statistics 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.210
 maybe
