if<00:00:23.509> we<00:00:23.660> use<00:00:23.869> explosives<00:00:24.500> for<00:00:24.649> control<00:00:25.039> work<00:00:25.520> to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
if we use explosives for control work to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.880 
if we use explosives for control work to
try<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:25.970> mitigate<00:00:26.269> some<00:00:26.750> of<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.439> avalanche

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
try to mitigate some of the avalanche

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.009 
try to mitigate some of the avalanche
danger<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.519> will<00:00:28.939> never<00:00:29.149> take<00:00:29.419> care<00:00:29.630> of<00:00:29.720> all<00:00:29.869> the

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
danger I will never take care of all the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.479 
danger I will never take care of all the
avalanche<00:00:30.320> danger<00:00:30.559> there's<00:00:30.980> still<00:00:31.160> a<00:00:31.189> risk

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
avalanche danger there's still a risk

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.560 
avalanche danger there's still a risk
out<00:00:31.640> there<00:00:31.880> when<00:00:32.059> you're<00:00:32.180> dealing<00:00:32.419> with

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
out there when you're dealing with

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.170 
out there when you're dealing with
Mother<00:00:32.870> Nature<00:00:33.190> but<00:00:34.190> we<00:00:34.309> use<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.610> explosives

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
Mother Nature but we use the explosives

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.600 
Mother Nature but we use the explosives
to<00:00:35.269> try<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.629> put<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.960> compressive<00:00:36.829> charge<00:00:37.129> onto

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
to try to put a compressive charge onto

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.880 
to try to put a compressive charge onto
the<00:00:37.760> snowpack<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.510> if<00:00:38.839> it's<00:00:39.019> gonna<00:00:39.199> slide

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
the snowpack and if it's gonna slide

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.869 
the snowpack and if it's gonna slide
hopefully<00:00:40.370> it'll<00:00:40.519> slide<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:42.550> it's<00:00:43.550> not<00:00:43.699> the

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
hopefully it'll slide that it's not the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.450 
hopefully it'll slide that it's not the
only<00:00:44.180> technique<00:00:44.720> we<00:00:44.870> use<00:00:45.079> for<00:00:45.320> mitigating<00:00:46.280> the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
only technique we use for mitigating the

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.670 
only technique we use for mitigating the
avalanche<00:00:46.909> danger<00:00:47.089> but<00:00:47.449> it's<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.260> great<00:00:48.500> tool

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
avalanche danger but it's a great tool

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.349 
avalanche danger but it's a great tool
to<00:00:48.739> have<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.219> they<00:00:49.340> work<00:00:49.760> quite<00:00:49.789> well

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
to have and they work quite well

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.680 
to have and they work quite well
we<00:00:51.170> have<00:00:51.500> two<00:00:51.710> explosives<00:00:52.670> cache<00:00:52.879> one<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.660> a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
we have two explosives cache one is a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.660 
we have two explosives cache one is a
storage<00:00:54.109> guess<00:00:54.440> where<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:54.920> keep<00:00:55.250> all<00:00:55.429> of<00:00:55.460> our

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
storage guess where we keep all of our

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.910 
storage guess where we keep all of our
explosives<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.449> then<00:00:56.960> our<00:00:57.140> second<00:00:57.620> building

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
explosives and then our second building

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.560 
explosives and then our second building
if<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:58.280> couple<00:00:58.640> hundred<00:00:58.730> feet<00:00:59.059> apart<00:00:59.179> is

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
if you a couple hundred feet apart is

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.599 
if you a couple hundred feet apart is
our<00:00:59.600> what<00:01:00.079> we<00:01:00.170> call<00:01:00.350> our<00:01:00.500> makeup<00:01:00.859> cache<00:01:01.100> it's

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
our what we call our makeup cache it's

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.759 
our what we call our makeup cache it's
where<00:01:01.850> we<00:01:01.969> keep<00:01:02.120> our<00:01:02.300> fuses<00:01:02.750> in<00:01:03.019> our<00:01:03.260> igniters

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
where we keep our fuses in our igniters

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.740 
where we keep our fuses in our igniters
and<00:01:04.070> that's<00:01:04.550> also<00:01:04.850> where<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:05.149> make<00:01:05.330> everything

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
and that's also where we make everything

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.919 
and that's also where we make everything
up<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:07.700> our<00:01:08.030> storage<00:01:08.330> cache<00:01:08.660> and

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
up so this is our storage cache and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.050 
up so this is our storage cache and
these<00:01:09.050> are<00:01:09.259> all<00:01:09.820> different<00:01:10.820> kinds<00:01:11.000> of

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
these are all different kinds of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.969 
these are all different kinds of
explosives

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
explosives

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.680 
explosives
we're<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.100> taking<00:01:13.280> for<00:01:13.759> two<00:01:13.970> pounders<00:01:14.479> for

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
we're just taking for two pounders for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:26.380 
we're just taking for two pounders for
today<00:01:16.149> so<00:01:17.149> then<00:01:17.300> we<00:01:17.390> sweep<00:01:18.020> out<00:01:25.030> we<00:01:26.030> get<00:01:26.209> what

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
today so then we sweep out we get what

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.820 
today so then we sweep out we get what
we<00:01:26.420> need<00:01:26.569> that<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.080> storage<00:01:27.349> cache<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
we need that in the storage cache and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.669 
we need that in the storage cache and
bring<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.099> over<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.459> makeup<00:01:28.759> cache<00:01:29.000> and

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
bring it over to the makeup cache and

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.979 
bring it over to the makeup cache and
make<00:01:30.679> everything<00:01:30.979> up<00:01:31.190> for<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.520> day<00:01:32.229> yeah<00:01:33.369> I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:34.989 
make everything up for the day yeah I

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:36.850 
make everything up for the day yeah I
couldn't<00:01:35.989> even<00:01:36.140> tell<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.289> what<00:01:36.380> size<00:01:36.649> they

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
couldn't even tell you what size they

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.469 
couldn't even tell you what size they
are<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.069> be<00:01:37.160> honest<00:01:37.399> with<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:37.880> guess<00:01:38.239> what

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
are to be honest with you I guess what

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.359 
are to be honest with you I guess what
he's<00:01:38.690> dug<00:01:38.929> two<00:01:39.140> pounds<00:01:39.729> yeah<00:01:42.130> it's<00:01:43.130> hard<00:01:43.280> to

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
he's dug two pounds yeah it's hard to

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.359 
he's dug two pounds yeah it's hard to
believe<00:01:43.459> it's<00:01:43.940> working<00:01:44.390> I<00:01:45.170> mean<00:01:45.770> it's<00:01:46.069> work

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
believe it's working I mean it's work

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.919 
believe it's working I mean it's work
but<00:01:46.700> it's<00:01:47.030> hard<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:47.270> believe<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.569> get<00:01:47.720> paid

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
but it's hard to believe you get paid

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.229 
but it's hard to believe you get paid
for<00:01:48.170> it<00:01:48.319> Jimmy<00:01:49.220> vanishes<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:49.819> of<00:01:49.910> our<00:01:50.030> first

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:50.239 
for it Jimmy vanishes one of our first

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.850 
for it Jimmy vanishes one of our first
year<00:01:50.360> patrollers<00:01:50.929> I<00:01:51.170> think<00:01:51.440> he's<00:01:51.530> been<00:01:51.709> pretty

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
year patrollers I think he's been pretty

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.499 
year patrollers I think he's been pretty
overwhelmed<00:01:52.520> with<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.819> amount<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.300> training

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
overwhelmed with the amount of training

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.540 
overwhelmed with the amount of training
that<00:01:53.869> we<00:01:54.080> put<00:01:54.319> him<00:01:54.440> through<00:01:54.470> what's<00:01:55.129> up

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
that we put him through what's up

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.240 
that we put him through what's up
he<00:01:55.729> seems<00:01:56.000> really<00:01:56.090> stoked<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.599> be<00:01:56.629> here<00:01:56.989> and

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
he seems really stoked to be here and

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.010 
he seems really stoked to be here and
he's<00:01:58.250> doing<00:01:58.849> a<00:01:59.000> great<00:01:59.090> job<00:01:59.179> and<00:01:59.599> working<00:01:59.720> hard

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
he's doing a great job and working hard

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.050 
he's doing a great job and working hard
but<00:02:00.200> he<00:02:00.289> still<00:02:00.679> has<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:00.920> lot<00:02:01.099> to<00:02:01.160> learn<00:02:01.399> well<00:02:02.030> I

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
but he still has a lot to learn well I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.850 
but he still has a lot to learn well I
moved<00:02:02.209> to<00:02:02.360> Colorado<00:02:02.509> about<00:02:03.020> six<00:02:03.410> years<00:02:03.560> ago

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
moved to Colorado about six years ago

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.619 
moved to Colorado about six years ago
from<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.160> East<00:02:04.310> Coast<00:02:04.610> just<00:02:05.030> love<00:02:05.509> the

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:05.629 
from the East Coast just love the

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.060 
from the East Coast just love the
mountains<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.170> everything

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
mountains and everything

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.920 
mountains and everything
you<00:02:07.550> know<00:02:07.670> I<00:02:07.700> was<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.880> snowboarder<00:02:08.510> realized

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
you know I was a snowboarder realized

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.110 
you know I was a snowboarder realized
that<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.650> on<00:02:09.770> on<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.430> patrol<00:02:10.790> I<00:02:10.820> probably

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
that to get on on the patrol I probably

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.270 
that to get on on the patrol I probably
learn<00:02:11.450> how<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.600> ski<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.230> learn<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.830> ski<00:02:13.040> last

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
learn how to ski so learn to ski last

up use you just want to make sure that
that<00:03:06.290> seats<00:03:06.620> all<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:06.980> way<00:03:07.070> down<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.430> the

that seats all the way down to the
bottom<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:07.940> then<00:03:08.870> from<00:03:09.080> here<00:03:09.110> you<00:03:09.440> kind<00:03:09.590> of

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
bottom and then from here you kind of

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.650 
bottom and then from here you kind of
pull<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.010> down<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.120> tight<00:03:11.390> without

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
pull it down so it's tight without

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.449 
pull it down so it's tight without
kinking<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.410> probably<00:03:13.100> doesn't<00:03:13.250> make<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
kinking it probably doesn't make a

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.190 
kinking it probably doesn't make a
difference<00:03:13.820> but<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.480> don't<00:03:14.840> want<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.050> take<00:03:15.170> a

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
difference but we don't want to take a

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.100 
difference but we don't want to take a
chance<00:03:15.470> because<00:03:15.650> these<00:03:16.130> hit<00:03:16.370> true<00:03:16.580> you<00:03:16.790> know
