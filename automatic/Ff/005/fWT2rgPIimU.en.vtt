for the foster bowlers this one is going
to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.030> problem<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.989> faster

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
to be a bit of a problem for the faster

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
to be a bit of a problem for the faster
bowlers<00:00:43.620> upfront<00:00:43.890> I've<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.670> chance<00:00:44.969> with

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
bowlers upfront I've got a chance with

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.090 
bowlers upfront I've got a chance with
me<00:00:45.329> Shaun<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.110> seems<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.649> very<00:00:46.860> dry

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
me Shaun this seems to be a very dry

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
me Shaun this seems to be a very dry
wicket<00:00:47.430> yeah<00:00:48.329> obviously<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.350> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
wicket yeah obviously but you know it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
wicket yeah obviously but you know it's
with<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> new<00:00:50.340> ball<00:00:50.520> -<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> handful<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
with a new ball - a handful for the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
with a new ball - a handful for the
bowlers<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.840> kids<00:00:52.050> orange<00:00:52.379> comes<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
bowlers it's kids orange comes from the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
bowlers it's kids orange comes from the
bat<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> think<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> new<00:00:54.270> ball<00:00:54.449> beefy<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
bat I think with a new ball beefy can I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
bat I think with a new ball beefy can I
take<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.559> little<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.670> very

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
take a little because I think is very

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.540 
take a little because I think is very
good<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> team<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.800> do<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.340> any

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
good for the team and do you make any

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.920 
good for the team and do you make any
adjustments<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> wicked<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
adjustments for this wicked is it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.549 
adjustments for this wicked is it
something<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.800> wickets<00:01:02.070> back<00:01:02.219> home<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
something like the wickets back home I

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
something like the wickets back home I
think<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> very<00:01:05.040> difficult<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:06.180> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
think it's a very difficult kind of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
think it's a very difficult kind of
wicket<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.409> can't<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
wicket you know it's we can't get this

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
wicket you know it's we can't get this
kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.610> India<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> Asia

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
kind of we get in India not in the Asia

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.230 
kind of we get in India not in the Asia
but<00:01:10.250> we<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> adjust<00:01:11.700> our<00:01:11.850> lands

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
but we have to adjust our lands

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.899 
but we have to adjust our lands
according<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.960> wicket<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.909> but

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
according the wicket I think it's a but

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.490 
according the wicket I think it's a but
this<00:01:15.150> kind<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.600> kid<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> short

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this kind of a kid we have to go a short

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.170 
this kind of a kid we have to go a short
of<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.100> good<00:01:17.460> length<00:01:17.640> ball<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> think<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
of not a good length ball I think it's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789 
of not a good length ball I think it's
short<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> very<00:01:19.200> good<00:01:19.350> ball<00:01:19.560> for

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
short of them is a very good ball for

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.230 
short of them is a very good ball for
for<00:01:20.040> every<00:01:20.250> batsman<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.790> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> bigger

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
for every batsman in this kind of bigger

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
for every batsman in this kind of bigger
I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.860> ball<00:01:23.009> gets<00:01:23.189> slightly

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I think and when the ball gets slightly

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.910 
I think and when the ball gets slightly
older<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> reverse<00:01:24.509> swing<00:01:24.810> comes<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.439> on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
older then the reverse swing comes so on

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.200 
older then the reverse swing comes so on
that<00:01:26.100> you've<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.759> their<00:01:27.000> lengths

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
that you've got to get their lengths

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
that you've got to get their lengths
closer<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> bat<00:01:27.869> yeah<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> think<00:01:28.860> Vicky

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
closer to the bat yeah I think Vicky

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.190 
closer to the bat yeah I think Vicky
this<00:01:29.880> diet<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.479> why<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> ball<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
this diet so that's why the ball is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.730 
this diet so that's why the ball is
getting<00:01:31.369> dry<00:01:32.369> from<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.970> side<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.740> after

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
getting dry from the one side so after

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
getting dry from the one side so after
that<00:01:34.939> 1718<00:01:35.939> thought<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> ball<00:01:36.720> is

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that 1718 thought what the ball is

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.870 
that 1718 thought what the ball is
getting<00:01:36.960> reverse<00:01:37.350> start<00:01:37.740> reversing<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.430> if

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
getting reverse start reversing so if

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
getting reverse start reversing so if
you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:39.930> reverse<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> ball<00:01:40.619> very

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you can if you can reverse the ball very

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.469 
you can if you can reverse the ball very
good<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.670> think<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.909> very<00:01:42.000> good<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
good so if I think is very good for the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.679 
good so if I think is very good for the
team<00:01:42.920> thanks<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> chant<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.820> there's<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
team thanks you chant so there's a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.090 
team thanks you chant so there's a
little<00:01:45.840> bit<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> bowlers<00:01:46.920> but

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
little bit in it for the bowlers but

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
little bit in it for the bowlers but
generally<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> batting<00:01:47.880> track<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.600> slow

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
generally a batting track a little slow

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.330 
generally a batting track a little slow
as<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> game<00:01:49.229> wears<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.189> win<00:01:50.310> the

as the game wears on when you win the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.620 
as the game wears on when you win the
toss<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.880> certainly<00:01:51.060> want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:51.479> here

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
much Shawn Sharma a big boy for starters

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.370 
much Shawn Sharma a big boy for starters
if<00:02:01.500> Shawn<00:02:01.649> Sharma<00:02:02.509> is<00:02:03.509> tall<00:02:03.750> boy<00:02:03.929> that's<00:02:04.200> one

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
if Shawn Sharma is tall boy that's one

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.109 
if Shawn Sharma is tall boy that's one
sometimes<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.369> get<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:05.610> worried<00:02:06.060> about

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
sometimes I get a little worried about

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.850 
sometimes I get a little worried about
him<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:06.719> he's<00:02:07.110> such<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> tall<00:02:07.619> boy

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
him that because he's such a tall boy

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.370 
him that because he's such a tall boy
and<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.099> very<00:02:08.310> skinny<00:02:08.670> also<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.360> you've<00:02:10.259> got

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
and it's very skinny also and you've got

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.830 
and it's very skinny also and you've got
to<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.530> using<00:02:10.920> very<00:02:11.130> carefully<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.630> which

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
to be using very carefully this which

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.990 
to be using very carefully this which
looks<00:02:13.069> definitely<00:02:14.069> different<00:02:14.489> different<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
looks definitely different different to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.490 
looks definitely different different to
the<00:02:15.090> pitch<00:02:15.269> what<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.720> seen<00:02:16.230> it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the pitch what we have seen it's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.870 
the pitch what we have seen it's
probably<00:02:16.830> look<00:02:16.980> from<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.340> angle<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.849> looks

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
probably look from this angle it looks

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.910 
probably look from this angle it looks
the<00:02:18.150> same<00:02:18.360> what<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.690> seen<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.440> last<00:02:19.620> few

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the same what we seen in the last few

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.580 
the same what we seen in the last few
games<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:21.290> understand<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.440> was

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
games but the way I understand I was

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.740 
games but the way I understand I was
standing<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.160> looked<00:02:23.400> pretty<00:02:23.760> dry<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.510> it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
standing it looked pretty dry and it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.900 
standing it looked pretty dry and it
looked<00:02:24.959> no<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.890> much<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.280> moisture<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
looked no not much of a moisture in it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.150 
looked no not much of a moisture in it
so<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.900> will<00:02:28.049> be<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> very<00:02:28.500> very<00:02:28.620> good<00:02:28.830> batting

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
so it will be a very very good batting

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.089 
so it will be a very very good batting
try<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.640> later<00:02:30.599> on<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:31.110> our<00:02:31.319> own<00:02:31.470> suggests<00:02:31.890> is

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
try and later on as our own suggests is

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.289 
try and later on as our own suggests is
going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> slow<00:02:32.579> down<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.239> to

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
going to slow down and it's going to

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.360 
going to slow down and it's going to
start<00:02:33.480> turning<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.019> bit<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.769> all<00:02:34.920> depends<00:02:35.310> on

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
start turning a bit it all depends on

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.520 
start turning a bit it all depends on
the<00:02:35.489> weather<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.970> weather<00:02:36.150> stays<00:02:36.530> cloudy

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the weather if the weather stays cloudy

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.009 
the weather if the weather stays cloudy
it<00:02:37.950> might<00:02:38.190> play<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.880> same<00:02:39.120> throughout<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.780> if

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
it might play the same throughout but if

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.259 
it might play the same throughout but if
Suns<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.620> wavy<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> feel<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> bit<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.060> Sun

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
Suns the wavy so I feel a bit of a Sun

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.630 
Suns the wavy so I feel a bit of a Sun
coming<00:02:42.569> out<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:43.470> might<00:02:43.650> break<00:02:43.950> yeah<00:02:44.519> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
coming out it might break yeah the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.309 
coming out it might break yeah the
weather<00:02:44.819> has<00:02:45.060> been<00:02:45.090> definitely<00:02:45.840> kind<00:02:46.079> on<00:02:46.200> this

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
weather has been definitely kind on this

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.310 
weather has been definitely kind on this
occasion<00:02:46.709> as<00:02:46.799> we<00:02:46.920> could<00:02:47.069> very
