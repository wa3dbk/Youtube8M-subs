00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
gone to the bathroom at this point and a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
gone to the bathroom at this point and a
day<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> predict<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
day so that you can kind of predict it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.389 
day so that you can kind of predict it
down<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> road<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> little<00:00:53.129> bit

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
down the road a little bit

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
down the road a little bit
you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.910> also<00:00:54.030> predict<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.809> dogs

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you can also predict it because dogs

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.439 
you can also predict it because dogs
tend<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> go<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> bathroom<00:00:56.969> after

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
tend to have to go to the bathroom after

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
napped after a good chew session all

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:02.869 
napped after a good chew session all
right<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> tendency<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.699> really

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
right they have a tendency to really

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
right they have a tendency to really
need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.840> their<00:01:03.989> business<00:01:04.140> the

need to do to do their business the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.429 
need to do to do their business the
easiest<00:01:05.129> thing<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> set<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
easiest thing is to set them up with a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
easiest thing is to set them up with a
long<00:01:07.770> term<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.189> short<00:01:08.340> term<00:01:08.430> confinement
