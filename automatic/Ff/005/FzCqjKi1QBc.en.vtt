00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
potential to really um build up ravi

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.459 
potential to really um build up ravi
indian<00:02:33.189> even<00:02:33.430> further<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.000> develop<00:02:34.900> Alberto

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
indian even further and develop Alberto

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.709 
indian even further and develop Alberto
Del<00:02:35.769> Rio<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.459> world<00:02:36.670> champion<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.329> he<00:02:37.540> is

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
Del Rio as the world champion as he is

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.860 
Del Rio as the world champion as he is
as<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.139> heel<00:02:38.439> right<00:02:39.069> now<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.030> think<00:02:40.659> things

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
as the heel right now so I think things

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.270 
as the heel right now so I think things
are<00:02:41.019> working<00:02:41.200> out<00:02:41.409> so<00:02:41.590> far<00:02:41.799> I<00:02:41.859> mean<00:02:42.069> it's<00:02:42.189> only

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
in the beginning stages things haven't

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.899 
in the beginning stages things haven't
been<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:44.829> rough<00:02:45.189> there<00:02:45.430> hasn't<00:02:45.700> been<00:02:45.730> any

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
detour so you know you can't really

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.640

judge<00:02:47.560> too<00:02:48.250> much<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.389> far<00:02:49.659> so<00:02:49.989> good<00:02:50.409> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.470 
judge too much but so far so good and
let's<00:02:50.799> hope<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.099> nothing<00:02:51.430> bad<00:02:51.849> comes<00:02:52.150> out<00:02:52.359> of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480
