you're not you're not hesitant and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.090 
you're not you're not hesitant and
before<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:12.380> know<00:01:12.530> it<00:01:12.590> you're<00:01:12.710> on<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.920> ground

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
before you know it you're on the ground

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.539 
so be precise and be accurate if you're
doing<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:15.560> sloppy<00:01:15.860> you're<00:01:16.100> not<00:01:16.250> doing

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
doing it sloppy you're not doing

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.060 
doing it sloppy you're not doing
anything<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.299> we<00:01:18.170> run<00:01:18.350> different<00:01:18.500> patterns

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
anything so we run different patterns

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.029 
anything so we run different patterns
through<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:19.520> as<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:20.840> get<00:01:21.170> more<00:01:21.380> comfortable

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
through it as you get more comfortable

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.399 
through it as you get more comfortable
doing<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.789> we'll<00:01:23.299> start<00:01:23.539> picking<00:01:23.930> it<00:01:24.020> up<00:01:24.170> and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
doing it we'll start picking it up and

I<00:01:52.640> can<00:01:52.700> do<00:01:52.940> that<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:54.440> paying<00:01:54.710> off

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.260 

the<00:01:59.350> first<00:01:59.619> thing<00:01:59.799> I<00:01:59.920> would<00:01:59.979> have<00:02:00.369> anyone<00:02:00.970> work

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
the first thing I would have anyone work

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.700 
the first thing I would have anyone work
is<00:02:02.110> their<00:02:02.439> core<00:02:02.770> core<00:02:03.399> strength<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:03.939> huge<00:02:04.710> even

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
is their core core strength is huge even

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.499 
is their core core strength is huge even
when<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.009> move<00:02:06.460> one<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.850> your<00:02:06.970> extremities

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
when you move one of your extremities

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.809 
when you move one of your extremities
your<00:02:07.659> arms<00:02:07.899> or<00:02:08.050> legs<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:09.280> core<00:02:09.310> actually

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
your arms or legs your core actually

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.839 
your arms or legs your core actually
activates<00:02:10.950> milliseconds<00:02:11.950> before<00:02:12.130> even<00:02:12.700> your

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
activates milliseconds before even your

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.360 
activates milliseconds before even your
arms<00:02:13.120> or<00:02:13.270> legs<00:02:13.420> would<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.620> even<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> bike

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
arms or legs would and even on the bike

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.600 
arms or legs would and even on the bike
I<00:02:16.060> mean<00:02:16.660> everything<00:02:17.230> comes<00:02:17.260> from<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.830> core<00:02:18.099> to

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
I mean everything comes from the core to

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.250 
I mean everything comes from the core to
the<00:02:18.760> extremities<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.959> want<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.170> have

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the extremities if you want to have

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.630 
the extremities if you want to have
better<00:02:20.410> bike<00:02:20.709> control<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:23.640> overall

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
better bike control and just overall

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.580 
better bike control and just overall
strength<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.330> bike<00:02:25.510> work<00:02:26.019> with<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.319> core

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
strength on the bike work with the core

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.830 
strength on the bike work with the core
first<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:27.099> know<00:02:27.670> when<00:02:27.910> those<00:02:28.090> Moto's<00:02:28.390> get<00:02:28.569> hard

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
first I know when those Moto's get hard

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.740 
first I know when those Moto's get hard
your<00:02:29.410> form<00:02:29.769> starts<00:02:30.190> getting<00:02:30.489> bad<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.420> have

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
your form starts getting bad if you have

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.020 
your form starts getting bad if you have
good<00:02:32.319> core<00:02:32.739> strength<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:33.250> your<00:02:33.370> form<00:02:33.610> won't<00:02:33.819> go

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
good core strength to your form won't go

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.660 
good core strength to your form won't go
so<00:02:34.299> bad<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.720> quick<00:02:35.019> so<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.130> twist

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
who said I like to do a lot of balance

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
balance and just making sure that you

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.920 
balance and just making sure that you
have<00:02:52.200> good<00:02:53.000> stability<00:02:54.000> throughout<00:02:54.630> your<00:02:54.750> body

and that goes into core good core
stability<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:59.040> core<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.400> huge<00:02:59.640> thing<00:02:59.940> it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
stability the core is a huge thing it
