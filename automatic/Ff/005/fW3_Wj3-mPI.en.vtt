00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.950
 I Na soooo I Japan 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:10.710
 Well, I remember overseas this time and still have it, but what is amazing 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.220
 It is a member that becomes commonplace in that Japan 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.100
 It's not as natural as in Japan, but as a Japanese 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.890
 Since the Well has become commonplace 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.270
 I think I don't feel much thank you or something like that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.440
 I said, Well, I thought it this time Vietnam Cambodia 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:32.560
 I felt that way, but now I 'm talking about a little bit of water 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.620
 First of all I Is tap water is not a drink of Japan second place Bell 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.990
 If it is so, it should be a woman of Taiwan 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.790
 After that, Cambodia is also suspicious of Vietnam 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.930
 It seems to be stupid if you drink even the heather 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.680
 It might not be a one-person sigh or something like that, but it's quite dangerous 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.990
 So here in Japan can be as remaining before the morning 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.100
 Water wiped by and a cat Tteyuu tap water Nobu 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:03.230
 Because only I felt once again it is and I'm still referred to in the water around 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.930
 Well Well put it there toilet I'd I went this time Kansai International Airport is 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.100
 I Torearisu of Kansai International Airport 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:13.510
 The bigger the space, the more space there is. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.190
 And is amazing Italeri Tsukuserina you from corner Datte advertising and Molitor to what or successor 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.570
 But Oh So ten prequel seat anymore 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:25.880
 I warm You comes with a funny I though such is the toilet 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.010
 I'm going abroad, but there's no way to tell that at the airport . 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.960
 Oh dear 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:36.670
 What the hell-unlike Japan, it was not natural to have a playful toilet that was 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:42.340
 And I also Ne but I'm doing the norm is quite in Japan 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.370
 Toilet everyone's Masu please if paper or normally this I'm Yo conducts street Once you water 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.000
 It's not like everyone but everyone 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.800
 Vietnam Cambodia already 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 It was so, but it is a toilet paper 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.659
 The most part you do not go to flow while flowing as pushing God out there if there is a trash can next to the What Do 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.409
 I think I have become 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.240
 Naturally get stuck 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.360
 It was a bone in Japan, which is already natural, but the infrastructure in that area 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 And the wonder if not quite developed the Tteyuu 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.480
 It is a feeling 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:15.800
 Will I that I have a the variety is no Akerebakiri here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.540
 That's right, which again felt I was first road conditions between Japan and Do not's Sugen 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.390
 If you go out a little bit like Cambodia 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.560
 And the road has not been paved to is quite common 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:31.020
 There was a road that I did not save when Vietnam was a little off 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.770
 Whether I'm paved quite Ne quality say bad 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.250
 Because there was a video king of attraction or something attractive 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.760
 Hmm 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.060
 This person amazing that was quite feel what the original difference 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.860
 Tteyuu Na Ne is not lost or what I because I I've been working hard my best 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.250
 That's how I felt that 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.230
 By all means people who have never bought one before now 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.239
 one time 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.450
 Somewhere somewhere good Vietnam? 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.989
 It was good yeah Vietnam solder 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.350
 I say or Rutte take a look at the one-time overseas since the good in Vietnam 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.670
 very 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:10.370
 There is a real awareness of what I think is a significant thing . 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.370
 I think that this I want you to seriously in to go by all means year
