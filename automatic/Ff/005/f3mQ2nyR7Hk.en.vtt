cars dot com auto review hi I'm Kelsey Mays for cars dot com

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.370
no matter how many luxuries your car has
any city driver will tell you that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.730
there's

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.730
a familiar pain in the neck you'll
always have to deal with and that's

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.410
parallel parking until now car makers
have

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.689
added cameras to vehicles they don't
just see behind you they can see

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.710
all around you in some cases some cars
even have power steering systems that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.179
work in concert with those cameras and
other sensors

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.210
to help park your car by itself with you
behind the wheel of course

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.320
and it's not just luxury cars that have
these options car makers as ordinary as

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.100
Ford

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.579
offer them we have four subsystems and
we're gonna test them out

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.710
the Nissan Pathfinder around view
monitor

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.390
which kinda shows you a top-down bird's
eye view of what's around the vehicle

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.039
we have three systems that actually self
park the vehicle the Ford Escape

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.399
comes with cords optional active Park
assist which

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.420
self parks while the Land Rover Range
Rover Evoque

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.940
has Park Assist as well as a surround
camera system that

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.619
shows a different angles around the
vehicle finally mercedes-benz brings

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.659
parktronic with

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.770
active parking assist which combines a
surrounding camera view

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.090
with auto parking whether to system that
helps the park the car

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.700
or just gives you a full surround view
seeking parking yourself

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.820
the real challenges how easy it makes
that process

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.340
I'm gonna put them to the test along
with help from James are clearly

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.909
other writer for USA Today and cars dot
com editor in chief Patrick Olson

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.150
the ground rules we have to SUV's part
next to Iraq while that's going to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.470
create our simulated parallel parking
spot

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.880
based on r4 vehicles that were testing
we're gonna give

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.299
each one an additional three feet from
the front bumper and three feet from the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.100
rear bumper

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.820
the park in this spot will give each
editor a few trials

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.880
and take the fastest time will also take
impressions

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.030
which car was easiest to park so from
those two scores will come up with the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.430
winner

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.070
for escape system I is interesting it's
pretty easy to use

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.090
but it seems a little busier does a lot
of backing in four thing and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.380
isn't quite as zip zip as you might
expect

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.709
before sleep at 10 the easiest systems
to use I thought was super quick but

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.840
it had all the instructions overlaid on
the camera and a nice big screen to show

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.150
you where you were gonna go

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.069
but these are expected

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.380
it to be easier so is put in reverse and
see the all-around camera

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.060
but I discovered that the other systems
with the automatic steering was

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.170
way more responsible way faster than
expected to be the Nissan Pathfinder

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.110
system is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.940
cameras it's not and auto part course
ourself Park you do the parking but it

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.099
gives you great view

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.769
it doesn't exactly stitch together a
seamless 360 degree view

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.530
it actually leaves little gaps kinda at
the corners which leaves you guessing as

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.530
you're getting close to that wall

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.920
Mercedes system no surprise shows that
if you pay a lot of money for vehicle

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.160
you get a system with a lot of
technology

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.640
it's pretty quick get you back in the
space doesn't back and forth a lot

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.640
get to where it wants pretty quickly in
with all the tire tracers show you where

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.910
you were gonna go going forward

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.989
and backwards was a pretty seamlessly
stitch together 360 degree view

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.190
it's definitely the most aggressive with
helping you out

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.190
I actually thought did a pretty good job
that too Range Rover as the system I

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.870
know the least about the last I love the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.660
easiest in the fastest want to park with
the Range Rover Evoque

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.750
proved fairly easy although Land Rover
surround camera system is kinda barry in

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.489
the submenus

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.950
it throws out a bunch of different
screens that are supposed to show you

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.290
what's around the vehicle

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.650
and nothing really gave a good sense of
where you were

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.180
evoke is a really good system the the
printing on the instrument panels may be

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.930
a little small for some people but it's
pretty easy to read

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.040
and it does a very good job love zipping
you into the space you want that if

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.810
you're in an urban situation is people
are backing up behind you

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.169
so there's your winter

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.979
