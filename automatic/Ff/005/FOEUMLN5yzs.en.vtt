it seems like it'll take forever and
you'll<00:00:31.779> never<00:00:32.079> get<00:00:32.349> there<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:35.530> gets<00:00:35.710> into<00:00:35.950> your

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
you'll never get there it gets into your

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.690 
you'll never get there it gets into your
blood<00:00:36.330> and<00:00:37.740> there's<00:00:38.740> no<00:00:38.830> getting<00:00:39.250> out<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.400> it<00:00:39.610> I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
blood and there's no getting out of it I

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.640

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.540 
I think what makes us act different is
the<00:00:52.410> act<00:00:52.590> itself<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.310> to<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the act itself is going to have a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.390 
the act itself is going to have a
personality<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.260> beautiful<00:00:55.860> costumes

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
and difficult tricks it takes more than

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.440
