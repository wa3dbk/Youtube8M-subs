four gigs of ram 500 gigabyte hard drive

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.590 
four gigs of ram 500 gigabyte hard drive
with<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.649> 24<00:01:47.399> gigabyte<00:01:47.700> solid<00:01:47.850> state<00:01:48.180> which

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
with a 24 gigabyte solid state which

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.999 
with a 24 gigabyte solid state which
means<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> hybrid<00:01:49.439> drive<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
means it's a hybrid drive and you can

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.410 
means it's a hybrid drive and you can
use<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> solid<00:01:50.490> state<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> cache<00:01:51.030> memory

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
use the solid state as a cache memory

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
use the solid state as a cache memory
and<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.140> got<00:01:52.259> windows<00:01:52.350> 8<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.250> really

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and it's got windows 8 so that's really

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
and it's got windows 8 so that's really
cool<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:53.909> also<00:01:54.329> probably<00:01:54.540> come<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.840> handy

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
cool that's also probably come in handy

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.630 
cool that's also probably come in handy
