so let's just jump right on in ok so

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.350 
so let's just jump right on in ok so
there's<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.500> few<00:00:10.530> things<00:00:10.710> you'll<00:00:11.070> need

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
there's just a few things you'll need

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.629 
there's just a few things you'll need
first<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.750> wooden<00:00:12.990> axe<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.440> just<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.490> few

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
first of all a wooden axe and just a few

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.369 
first of all a wooden axe and just a few
blocks<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:15.120> sort<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.509> place<00:00:15.660> around<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.260> it

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
blocks to sort of place around so it

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.290 
blocks to sort of place around so it
just<00:00:16.500> makes<00:00:16.619> things<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.890> bit<00:00:16.920> easier<00:00:17.039> ok<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
just makes things a bit easier ok so the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.939 
just makes things a bit easier ok so the
way<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.600> works<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.050> place<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.650> plot

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
way that it works is you place to plot

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.330 
way that it works is you place to plot
two<00:00:20.310> blocks<00:00:20.580> down<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.920> creates<00:00:23.160> an

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
two blocks down so that it creates an

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.910 
two blocks down so that it creates an
area<00:00:23.640> around<00:00:23.880> your<00:00:24.150> house<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.750> protect<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.260> one

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
area around your house to protect it one

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
area around your house to protect it one
of<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> blocks<00:00:26.310> will<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.210> sunk<00:00:27.420> into<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
of the blocks will be sunk into the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.450 
of the blocks will be sunk into the
ground<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.109> protect<00:00:28.410> everything<00:00:28.650> below<00:00:29.250> your

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
ground to protect everything below your

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.339 
ground to protect everything below your
house<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.939> our<00:00:30.359> basement<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> floor<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
house as our basement and the floor and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.810 
house as our basement and the floor and
so<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.769> when<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.099> raised<00:00:32.309> up<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> air

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so on and when we raised up in the air

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.030 
so on and when we raised up in the air
to<00:00:33.329> protect<00:00:33.600> things<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> roof<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.739> so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to protect things like the roof and so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.090 
to protect things like the roof and so
on<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:36.450> obviously<00:00:36.809> too<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> work

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
on and obviously too for this to work

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
on and obviously too for this to work
they<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> opposite<00:00:39.239> corners<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
they have to be in opposite corners of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.440 
they have to be in opposite corners of
the<00:00:40.379> house<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.770> each<00:00:40.860> other<00:00:41.090> square<00:00:42.090> buildings

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the house to each other square buildings

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.209 
the house to each other square buildings
are<00:00:42.570> easier<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.070> much

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
are easier but you can do pretty much

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.270 
are easier but you can do pretty much
any<00:00:44.430> shape<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.930> ok<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.590> start<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.920> the
