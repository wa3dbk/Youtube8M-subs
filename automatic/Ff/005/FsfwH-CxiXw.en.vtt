00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
 "What exactly can prolong life from a Mediterranean diet?" 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.114
 How could it be adding a few nuts to a daily diet, in this case about four 

00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:16.854
 walnuts, almonds or hazelnuts, cut someone's risk of stroke almost in half? 

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:21.974
 Olives and nuts are vegetable foods, and as such they are charged with antioxidants. 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.320
 Increase antioxidant levels in the bloodstream 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.974
 resulting in less fat oxidation and less free radical DNA damage 

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:33.534
 but what happens inside human arteries? 

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:38.080
 Researchers measured the amount of atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.400
 leading to the brain in people who have been eating added nuts for several years 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.940
 or extra virgin olive oil - and also for a group that didn't get anything like that. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.640
 In the control group, plaque worsened 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.980
 which is happening when one continues to consume a diet blocking the arteries. 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.794
 There was no significant change in the extra virgin olive oil group 

00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:01.654
 and in the group with added nuts the plaque even improved. 

00:01:01.654 --> 00:01:04.960
 Nuts seem to stimulate the regression of disease 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.054
 or at least significantly slow down its progress. 

00:01:08.093 --> 00:01:12.653
 The group with added nuts still suffered a stroke, but half less. 

00:01:12.653 --> 00:01:16.060
 Perhaps because of the reduction in plaque thickness in the arteries when consuming more nuts 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 indicated plaque stabilization, making the arteries more tear resistant. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.154
 Adding nuts to the diet can also improve endothelial function, 

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:31.714
 thereby improving the ability of the arteries to naturally expand by 30%. 

00:01:31.714 --> 00:01:36.555
 If you look at adhering to the basic principles of the Mediterranean diet 

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.574
 and remove variables like smoking and movement 

00:01:38.574 --> 00:01:44.054
 only two factors were clearly associated with a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.600
 - greater consumption of vegetables and nuts. 

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.633
 No significant link with olive oil or wine 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.440
 with fish or to reduce the consumption of lemonades and biscuits. 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.040
 Of all the individual items of the Mediterranean diet, only nut consumption was increased 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.314
 associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events. 

00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:07.294
 On the one hand, it reduces the risk of stroke 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.140
 half only thanks to a handful of nuts per day amazing, 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.940
 but it didn't seem that these people lived overall a little longer. 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.260
 Other studies suggest that frequent consumption of nuts can indeed 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.674
 prolong life. Examples are Harvard Health Professionals, 

00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:28.694
 which included a vast 3 million subscribers, have been watching for decades. 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.820
 These studies found that increased nut consumption was associated with reduced nutrition 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.240
 cancer mortality, heart disease, respiratory disease 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.120
 and, in particular, a reduced number of deaths overall. 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.100
 These findings were confirmed by all other important follow-up studies (2014), 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.733
 one new being just published. 

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:47.001
 17,000 people were tracked for 5 years 

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.700
 and those who ate nuts had a more than half the risk of death. 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.940
 Maybe it's because people eat nuts 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.720
 instead of meat, eggs and dairy products and therefore live longer? 

00:02:58.773 --> 00:03:02.293
 It's not so. Vegetarians who often eat nuts are much lower 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.500
 risk than vegetarians who don't eat them. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.320
 So what is the difference with the PREDIMED study? Why didn't nuts add life to people? 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.000
 Wasn't the study long enough? 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.234
 The point is that people did not necessarily have to eat more nuts just because 

00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:20.809
 that they were assigned to a group that was expected. 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.769
 In addition, people from other groups did not have to avoid nuts. 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.840
 If you re-analyze the data comparing mortality rates for those 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.320
 who actually ate more nuts and compare them to those who didn't eat much, 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.600
 then the consumption of nuts was actually associated with a significantly reduced risk of death. 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.200
 If you do the same type of reverse analysis in the case of olive oil, 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.880
 so even the extra virgin oil did not help to prolong life. 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.220
 This is in line with what Ancel Keys, 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.720
 also known as the "father of the Mediterranean diet," he expected olive oil. 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.300
 He saw his contribution to the fact that humans would replace animal fats with olive oil. 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.960
 Any way that leads people to consume less fat and butter is good. 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.420
 Which kinds of nuts are the most beneficial? 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.174
 The biggest benefits were attributed to walnuts, 

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:05.475
 in particular to prevent cancer deaths. 

00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:07.915
 People consuming more than three servings of walnuts a week 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.855
 reduce their risk of cancer deaths by half. 

00:04:11.855 --> 00:04:16.154
 Now the point is to get the public out of the research results. All major associations 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.560
 Cancer Promotes Diet with Higher Plant Foods 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.340
 which is remarkably in line with the WHO guidelines. 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.880
 The far-reaching positive effects of plant foods - including walnuts - 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.760
 may be the most important message to the public.
