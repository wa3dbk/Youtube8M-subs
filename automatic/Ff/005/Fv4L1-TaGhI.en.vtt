okay<00:00:09.340> three<00:00:10.179> what<00:00:10.330> we're<00:00:10.450> going<00:00:10.630> to<00:00:10.719> now<00:00:10.900> do<00:00:10.960> is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.140 
okay three what we're going to now do is

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.470 
okay three what we're going to now do is
add<00:00:11.440> some<00:00:11.470> realistic<00:00:12.280> smoothing<00:00:13.180> to<00:00:13.330> our

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
add some realistic smoothing to our

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.839 
add some realistic smoothing to our
models<00:00:13.840> skin<00:00:14.080> and<00:00:14.500> there's<00:00:15.040> a<00:00:15.099> process<00:00:15.340> I<00:00:15.580> use

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
models skin and there's a process I use

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.900 
models skin and there's a process I use
using<00:00:16.299> the<00:00:16.449> vivid<00:00:16.960> light<00:00:17.199> blend<00:00:17.560> mode<00:00:17.800> and<00:00:18.010> the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
using the vivid light blend mode and the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.450 
using the vivid light blend mode and the
high-pass<00:00:19.300> filter<00:00:19.779> so<00:00:20.619> if<00:00:20.859> we<00:00:21.039> just<00:00:21.310> go

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
high-pass filter so if we just go

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.950 
high-pass filter so if we just go
through<00:00:21.489> this<00:00:21.699> process<00:00:21.939> now<00:00:22.179> first<00:00:22.810> thing

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
through this process now first thing

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.509 
through this process now first thing
we're<00:00:23.079> going<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.319> do<00:00:23.589> is<00:00:24.009> we're<00:00:24.310> going<00:00:24.339> to

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.880 
we're going to do is we're going to
duplicate<00:00:25.359> this<00:00:25.539> layer<00:00:25.599> and<00:00:26.560> we're<00:00:26.710> going<00:00:26.829> to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
duplicate this layer and we're going to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.409 
duplicate this layer and we're going to
come<00:00:27.009> over<00:00:27.130> to<00:00:27.220> the<00:00:27.279> layers<00:00:27.460> panel<00:00:27.759> and<00:00:28.329> on

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
come over to the layers panel and on

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.969 
come over to the layers panel and on
this<00:00:28.509> duplicated<00:00:29.199> layer<00:00:29.229> we're<00:00:29.769> going<00:00:29.800> to

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:29.979 
this duplicated layer we're going to

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.490 
this duplicated layer we're going to
change<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.369> blend<00:00:30.609> mode<00:00:30.880> to<00:00:31.119> vivid<00:00:31.899> light<00:00:32.169> and

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
change the blend mode to vivid light and

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.020 
change the blend mode to vivid light and
you'll<00:00:32.590> see<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.829> effect<00:00:33.100> that<00:00:33.190> has<00:00:33.520> is<00:00:33.730> quite

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
you'll see the effect that has is quite

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.540 
you'll see the effect that has is quite
dramatic<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:35.290> we're<00:00:35.410> then<00:00:35.590> going<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.980> do<00:00:36.160> is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
dramatic what we're then going to do is

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.530 
dramatic what we're then going to do is
go<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:36.940> image<00:00:37.590> adjustments<00:00:38.590> and<00:00:38.740> invert<00:00:39.700> which

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
go to image adjustments and invert which

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.540 
go to image adjustments and invert which
makes<00:00:40.750> it<00:00:40.900> look<00:00:40.960> really<00:00:41.290> odd<00:00:41.560> and<00:00:42.190> we're<00:00:42.430> then

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
makes it look really odd and we're then

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.520 
makes it look really odd and we're then
going<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.700> use<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:43.150> high-pass<00:00:43.660> filter<00:00:44.170> so

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
going to use the high-pass filter so

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.480 
going to use the high-pass filter so
we're<00:00:44.620> going<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.770> go<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.190> top<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.400> the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
we're going to go to the top of the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.390 
we're going to go to the top of the
screen<00:00:45.820> and<00:00:46.000> select<00:00:46.240> filter<00:00:46.810> over<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.950> then

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
screen and select filter over and then

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.900 
screen and select filter over and then
high-pass<00:00:49.060> in<00:00:49.900> there<00:00:50.290> we<00:00:50.380> want<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.590> put<00:00:50.920> a

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
high-pass in there we want to put a

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.069 
high-pass in there we want to put a
radius<00:00:52.810> of<00:00:52.990> roughly<00:00:53.530> around<00:00:53.830> about<00:00:54.130> 24<00:00:55.090> pixels

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
radius of roughly around about 24 pixels

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.410 
radius of roughly around about 24 pixels
on<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.680> image<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:57.040> we're<00:00:57.280> using<00:00:58.120> at<00:00:58.329> the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
on the image that we're using at the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.590 
on the image that we're using at the
moment<00:00:58.450> so<00:00:59.200> I<00:00:59.230> forgot<00:00:59.380> for<00:00:59.530> 24<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.040> click<00:01:00.640> OK

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
moment so I forgot for 24 and click OK

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.950 
moment so I forgot for 24 and click OK
the<00:01:02.079> next<00:01:02.470> stage<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.130> go<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.449> filter<00:01:04.809> at

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
the next stage is to go to the filter at

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.230 
the next stage is to go to the filter at
the<00:01:04.989> top<00:01:05.259> and<00:01:05.829> go<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.009> blur<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.700> then<00:01:06.909> Gaussian

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
the top and go to blur and then Gaussian

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.389 
the top and go to blur and then Gaussian
blur<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.229> add<00:01:09.009> a<00:01:09.189> radius<00:01:09.670> about<00:01:09.789> 3<00:01:10.329> pixels<00:01:11.399> so

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
blur and add a radius about 3 pixels so

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.429 
blur and add a radius about 3 pixels so
the<00:01:12.549> stage<00:01:12.759> right<00:01:12.939> at<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.149> moment<00:01:13.509> is<00:01:13.659> we<00:01:14.229> can

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
the stage right at the moment is we can

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.770 
the stage right at the moment is we can
see<00:01:14.679> that<00:01:14.920> we've<00:01:15.069> slightly<00:01:15.880> blurred<00:01:16.210> the<00:01:16.479> skin

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
see that we've slightly blurred the skin

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.779 
see that we've slightly blurred the skin
but<00:01:16.869> we<00:01:16.990> also<00:01:17.109> have<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:17.530> strange<00:01:18.490> kind<00:01:18.700> of

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
but we also have this strange kind of

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.489 
but we also have this strange kind of
glowing<00:01:19.149> effects<00:01:19.509> going<00:01:19.749> on<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.139> the<00:01:20.200> muck<00:01:20.350> in

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
glowing effects going on in the muck in

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.289 
glowing effects going on in the muck in
the<00:01:20.619> models<00:01:21.039> mouth<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.789> the<00:01:21.850> nostrils

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
the models mouth and in the nostrils

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.389

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
models face this over a little bit

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.830 
models face this over a little bit
clearer<00:02:00.189> so<00:02:00.369> we<00:02:00.459> can<00:02:00.579> see<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:00.999> the<00:02:01.119> screen<00:02:01.450> is

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
clearer so we can see in the screen is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.709

there<00:02:22.500> should<00:02:22.890> do<00:02:23.070> as<00:02:23.160> nicely<00:02:24.020> then<00:02:25.020> we're

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
there should do as nicely then we're

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.080 
there should do as nicely then we're
gonna<00:02:25.440> go<00:02:25.710> over<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.730> hand<00:02:26.970> side

nose and there we go and we're gonna
click<00:02:37.440> OK<00:02:37.980> I'm<00:02:38.400> going<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.760> zoom<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.710> we

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
click OK I'm going to zoom out so now we

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.520 
click OK I'm going to zoom out so now we
can<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.040> we've<00:02:41.220> had<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.370> quite<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> nice<00:02:41.940> bit<00:02:42.150> of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
can see we've had a quite a nice bit of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.500 
can see we've had a quite a nice bit of
softening<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.680> our<00:02:43.800> model<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.970> only

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
softening to our model but the only

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.880 
softening to our model but the only
thing<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.110> softening<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.590> around

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
thing is that the softening is around

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.130 
thing is that the softening is around
everything<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> face<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.720> our<00:02:48.870> hair

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
everything is on a face is on our hair

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.170 
everything is on a face is on our hair
it's<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.860> everything<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.490> need<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.760> now<00:02:51.000> add

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
it's on everything so we need to now add

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.000 
it's on everything so we need to now add
a<00:02:51.300> mask<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.290> going<00:02:52.530> out<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.710> our<00:02:52.800> layers

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
a mask so we going out to our layers

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.730 
a mask so we going out to our layers
panel<00:02:53.280> add<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.820> mask<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.600> invert<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.260> math<00:02:55.710> so

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
panel add a mask and invert that math so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.890 
panel add a mask and invert that math so
it's<00:02:56.100> black<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.790> concealing<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.540> effect

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
it's black so it's concealing the effect

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.570 
it's black so it's concealing the effect
and<00:02:58.470> then<00:02:58.560> all<00:02:58.680> we're<00:02:58.800> going<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.100> do<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.460> then

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
and then all we're going to do is then

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.200 
and then all we're going to do is then
just<00:02:59.760> paint<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.360> with<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> white<00:03:00.930> brush<00:03:02.060> in<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
areas on the models face but we want

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.580 
areas on the models face but we want

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.840 
paint over models face so we can paint
in<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.350> softening<00:03:31.860> where<00:03:32.100> we<00:03:32.160> wanted<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.670> be

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
in this softening where we wanted to be

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.480 
in this softening where we wanted to be
so<00:03:33.090> almost<00:03:33.420> being<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> makeup<00:03:35.160> artist

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
so almost being like a makeup artist

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.450 
so almost being like a makeup artist
ourselves<00:03:36.330> as<00:03:36.420> we<00:03:36.540> paint<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.070> effect<00:03:38.070> into

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
ourselves as we paint this effect into

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.940 
ourselves as we paint this effect into
the<00:03:38.550> models<00:03:38.850> skin<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:40.320> again<00:03:40.350> I'm<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.740> going

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
the models skin so again I'm just going

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.120 
the models skin so again I'm just going
around<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.490> entire<00:03:42.120> face<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.950> face

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
around the entire face on the face

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.550 
around the entire face on the face
itself<00:03:44.490> around<00:03:44.820> about<00:03:44.940> 50%<00:03:45.840> reducing<00:03:46.470> the

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
keys painting in this softness there we

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.040 
keys painting in this softness there we
go

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
go

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.830 
go
all<00:03:55.050> around<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.500> model<00:03:55.650> skin<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:57.390> then<00:03:57.690> when

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
all around the model skin and then when

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.110 
all around the model skin and then when
we<00:03:57.930> go<00:03:58.020> down<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.620> main<00:03:59.130> body<00:03:59.430> what<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> tend

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
we go down to the main body what I tend

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.270 
we go down to the main body what I tend
to<00:04:00.209> do<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.930> I'll<00:04:01.200> generally<00:04:01.500> sort<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.830> add<00:04:02.220> a

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
to do is I'll generally sort of add a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.980 
to do is I'll generally sort of add a
little<00:04:02.610> bit<00:04:02.790> more<00:04:02.820> soften<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.660> so<00:04:03.870> I'll

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
little bit more soften to that so I'll

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.810 
little bit more soften to that so I'll
increase<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.440> brush<00:04:04.860> opacity<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.730> around

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
increase the brush opacity to around

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.410 
increase the brush opacity to around
about<00:04:06.150> 80%<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:07.920> we'll<00:04:08.520> just<00:04:08.610> give<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.000> few

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
about 80% and we'll just give that a few

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.199 
about 80% and we'll just give that a few
strokes<00:04:09.720> over<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.230> over<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:10.920> body<00:04:11.160> there<00:04:11.400> so

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
strokes over the over the body there so

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.880 
strokes over the over the body there so
that's<00:04:12.360> all<00:04:12.540> nicely<00:04:12.930> softened<00:04:13.170> as<00:04:13.560> well<00:04:15.890> so

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
that's all nicely softened as well so

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.589 
that's all nicely softened as well so
there<00:04:17.730> we<00:04:17.850> go<00:04:18.000> for<00:04:18.270> just<00:04:18.390> bring<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.720> across

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.909 

zum-zum<00:04:24.660> sorry<00:04:24.990> there<00:04:25.199> we<00:04:25.259> go<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:25.680> now<00:04:25.710> the

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
zum-zum sorry there we go so now the

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.850 
zum-zum sorry there we go so now the
models<00:04:26.250> got<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.400> nice<00:04:26.930> realistic<00:04:27.930> looking<00:04:28.470> sort

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
models got a nice realistic looking sort

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.920 
models got a nice realistic looking sort
of<00:04:28.919> softening<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:29.880> her<00:04:30.000> skin<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.569> presuming

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
of softening to her skin and presuming

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.870 
of softening to her skin and presuming
we<00:04:31.289> could<00:04:31.470> still<00:04:31.710> see<00:04:31.740> we've<00:04:32.099> retained<00:04:32.490> quite

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
we could still see we've retained quite

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.230 
we could still see we've retained quite
a<00:04:32.910> few<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:34.759> pores<00:04:35.759> that<00:04:36.000> are<00:04:36.060> in<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
a few of the pores that are in the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.240 
a few of the pores that are in the
models<00:04:36.479> skin<00:04:36.750> anyway<00:04:37.080> now<00:04:37.710> if<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.889> wanted<00:04:38.160> to

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
models skin anyway now if you wanted to

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.219 
models skin anyway now if you wanted to
add<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.370> little<00:04:38.580> bit<00:04:38.789> more<00:04:39.060> realism<00:04:39.599> to<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.930> what

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
add a little bit more realism to it what

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.129 
add a little bit more realism to it what
we<00:04:40.349> could<00:04:40.560> do<00:04:40.830> is<00:04:41.039> we<00:04:41.669> could<00:04:42.180> then<00:04:42.479> go<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.870> our

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
we could do is we could then go to our

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.710 
we could do is we could then go to our
layers<00:04:43.470> panel<00:04:44.240> click<00:04:45.240> on<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.419> background

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
duplicate the background layer and then

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.350 
duplicate the background layer and then

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.159 
with no softening and that's with
softening<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:32.909> what<00:05:33.030> we<00:05:33.120> can<00:05:33.270> see<00:05:33.570> is<00:05:33.719> that

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
softening and what we can see is that

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.379 
softening and what we can see is that
we've<00:05:34.320> added<00:05:34.620> softening<00:05:35.340> but<00:05:35.880> not<00:05:36.120> something

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
we've added softening but not something

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.060

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
that's over the top and looks to

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.040 
that's over the top and looks to
porcelain<00:05:38.880> if<00:05:39.270> you<00:05:39.360> like<00:05:39.539> we've<00:05:39.780> still
