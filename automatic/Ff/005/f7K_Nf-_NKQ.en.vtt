informal<00:04:41.930> pretty<00:04:42.560> casual<00:04:43.040> but<00:04:43.850> it<00:04:43.940> really<00:04:44.120> is

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
informal pretty casual but it really is

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.670 
informal pretty casual but it really is
the<00:04:44.330> content<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:44.960> these<00:04:45.110> videos<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.590> are
