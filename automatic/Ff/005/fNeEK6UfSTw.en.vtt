00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
the bed and it could break so I adjust

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.789 
the bed and it could break so I adjust

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
get to the end of the mortise which I

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.160 
get to the end of the mortise which I
outlined<00:03:03.220> earlier<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:04.569> cutting<00:03:04.959> noise

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
outlined earlier the cutting noise

outlined earlier the cutting noise
subside<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:06.099> know<00:03:06.519> I'm<00:03:06.790> done<00:03:06.970> with<00:03:07.180> this<00:03:07.299> pass

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
subside I know I'm done with this pass

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.970 
subside I know I'm done with this pass
next<00:03:10.329> I<00:03:10.480> adjust<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.140> turret<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.680> middle

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
next I adjust the turret to the middle

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.190 
next I adjust the turret to the middle
step<00:03:12.250> which<00:03:12.970> allows<00:03:13.269> me<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.599> plunge<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.959> little

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
step which allows me to plunge a little

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.059 
step which allows me to plunge a little
deeper<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.890> make<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> second<00:03:15.730> pass<00:03:19.859> finally<00:03:20.859> I

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
deeper and make a second pass finally I

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.190 
deeper and make a second pass finally I
adjust<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.879> turret<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.329> lowest<00:03:22.750> step<00:03:22.959> and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
adjust the turret to the lowest step and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:34.980 
adjust the turret to the lowest step and
make<00:03:23.650> my<00:03:23.829> final<00:03:24.250> pass

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.440 

before<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.950> move<00:03:36.130> on<00:03:36.310> I'll<00:03:36.700> do<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.180> quick

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
before I move on I'll do a quick

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.410 
before I move on I'll do a quick
