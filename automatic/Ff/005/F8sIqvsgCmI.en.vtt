00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello youtuber I'm me your friend Naruto 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.220
 today I come doing another criticism to a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.500
 cell phone company that in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.469
 the year of 2007 was one of the best 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.480
 companies but that currently 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.480
 he has made a shit for his system 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.420
 operative if I'm talking neither more nor 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.420
 less from the Finnish company Nokia 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.010
 it hurts me to have to make a 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.620
 criticism of this company since I am a 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.720
 admire her but I will tell you the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.950
 reasons why it is no longer the same 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.500
 successful from before 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.150
 good let's start nokia is a company 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.309
 Finnish multinational 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.640
 communications and technology based in 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.070
 the district of keilaniemi in is for this 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.230
 company what it was in 2007 was the most 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.660
 successful in the market but after the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.550
 arrival of android and windows phone this one 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.739
 it was dull since android and windows 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.110
 phone have better compatibility with 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.930
 the applications of today in 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.729
 this video we will analyze what is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.159
 hardware operating system applications 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.040
 and I will give the pros and cons that each 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.040
 one of the aforementioned also 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.560
 I will give my opinion about this company 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.479
 I will start with the Nokia hardware from its 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.729
 beginnings has given very little hardware to its 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.920
 phones the most powerful to date 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.110
 with the symbian operating system is the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.440
 Nokia 808 with a broadcom bcm processor 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.820
 2,763 with 128 mb of video and 512 megabytes of 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.620
 RAM 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.540
 I want to clarify that I do not want that 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.470
 hardware because the symbian system does not 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.070
 asks for many resources with 434 megahertz and 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.200
 128 of ram that will run fast that's a 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.060
 advantage that symbian consumes much less 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.119
 energy than an android because the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.979
 hardware does not demand much to the battery what 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.270
 bad is that so little power does not 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.220
 you can have many open 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.200
 applications because it's slow or it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 hang that is a little against 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 power remains nokia in conclusion yes 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.039
 you want a fast phone buy yourself a 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.630
 Android or one with windows phone now 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.840
 We'll talk about the system 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.900
 operative nokia has managed the system 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.780
 symbian since 1998 as it offered a 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.940
 better graphical user interface is very 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.010
 easy to use it you did not have to be a 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.860
 expert because in a week you already knew 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.660
 how to use it completely I want 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.300
 mention that there was a time when 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.190
 it was the most used of the whole world a 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.310
 of the disadvantages was that symbian was 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.209
 very little customizable nokia tried to 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.290
 change it creating symbian belle 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 unfortunately he could not beat the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.870
 Android system since it is much more 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.360
 personal 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.980
 that this operating system now 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.659
 we will talk about the applications 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.459
 nokia has a decline of 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.489
 applications that are currently 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.110
 occupy in the smartphone world and this 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.819
 it's because thanks to nokia that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.459
 wants to update the operating system 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.349
 google android since in the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.420
 Android is the king of the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.430
 applications while to symbian already 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.470
 there are very few developers that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.780
 they make applications so bad is that nokia 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.790
 has decided to opt for windows phone as 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.510
 high-end operating system and symbian 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.459
 s40 as mid-low range but not everything is 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.920
 bad in symbian there are very applications 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.920
 good as for example chat whatsapp 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.959
 among others the bad thing that for symbian not 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.569
 there are applications like in android a 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.239
 example the antivirus to bats emulator 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.159
 ps x that although they wanted to do it would be 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.859
 something meaningless since the hardware of 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.989
 Nokia mobile is weak and the one that 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.109
 It hurt more Nokia users is that they do not 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.090
 there is the line application but what 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.579
 shed the drop of the glass was that 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.079
 they did the line application for symbian 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.860
 s40 and symbian s60 not good that would be 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.290
 all for this one 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.690
 Small criticism if you liked to like it or 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.790
 subscribe to my channel that would help a lot 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.410
 good see you until the next video 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.410
 goodbye wing eloy
