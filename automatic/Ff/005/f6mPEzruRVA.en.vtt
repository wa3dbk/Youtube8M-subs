00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
it's all around it's an amazing gameplay

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.050 
it's all around it's an amazing gameplay
this<00:01:59.260> is<00:01:59.320> definitely<00:01:59.650> better<00:01:59.860> than<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.159> double

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
this is definitely better than a double

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.910 
this is definitely better than a double
a<00:02:01.180> triple<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.659> quad<00:02:01.930> nuke<00:02:02.200> anything<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.740> can

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
a triple a quad nuke anything you can

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.710 
a triple a quad nuke anything you can
really<00:02:03.130> get<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.550> think<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.180> definitely<00:02:04.330> it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
really get I think this is definitely it

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.380 
really get I think this is definitely it
takes<00:02:04.900> more<00:02:05.110> talent<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.560> more<00:02:06.000> awareness<00:02:07.000> and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
takes more talent and more awareness and

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.719 
takes more talent and more awareness and
just<00:02:07.540> being<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:08.229> all-around<00:02:08.860> great<00:02:09.369> player

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
just being that all-around great player

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.300 
just being that all-around great player
because<00:02:10.200> technically<00:02:11.200> he<00:02:11.440> if<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:11.980> guys<00:02:12.069> see

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
because technically he if you guys see

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.039 
because technically he if you guys see
you'll<00:02:13.030> show<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.360> scoreboard<00:02:13.750> he<00:02:13.810> had<00:02:13.900> like

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
you'll show the scoreboard he had like

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.660 
you'll show the scoreboard he had like
50<00:02:14.379> kills<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.890> random<00:02:15.190> going<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.370> use<00:02:15.489> with

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
50 kills in the random going to use with

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.520 
50 kills in the random going to use with
have<00:02:15.849> like<00:02:16.000> seven<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.629> basically<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.319> one

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
have like seven so basically it's a one

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.259 
have like seven so basically it's a one
be<00:02:17.739> four<00:02:18.040> hundred<00:02:18.959> 100<00:02:19.959> kills<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.620> league<00:02:21.040> play

be four hundred 100 kills in league play
running<00:02:22.269> only<00:02:22.480> he'll<00:02:22.840> storm<00:02:23.170> lightning<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.769> a

stealth<00:02:24.159> chopper<00:02:24.340> by<00:02:25.120> energize<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.110> just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
stealth chopper by energize that is just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.440 
stealth chopper by energize that is just
insane<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.890> me<00:02:27.069> I<00:02:27.220> can't<00:02:27.760> even<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.209> get

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
insane to me I can't even just like get

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.270 
insane to me I can't even just like get
that<00:02:28.569> through<00:02:28.720> my<00:02:28.810> head<00:02:28.990> I've<00:02:29.620> even<00:02:29.950> tried<00:02:30.100> to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
that through my head I've even tried to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.870 
that through my head I've even tried to
drop<00:02:30.459> 100

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
drop 100

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.580 
drop 100
with<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.540> know<00:02:31.660> at<00:02:31.840> least<00:02:31.990> three<00:02:32.260> or<00:02:32.440> four

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
with you know at least three or four

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.070 
with you know at least three or four
people<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.940> league<00:02:34.210> play<00:02:34.240> and<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.870> hard

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
people and in league play and it's hard

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.240 
people and in league play and it's hard
I<00:02:35.230> think<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.470> most<00:02:35.650> I've<00:02:35.770> only<00:02:35.890> gotten<00:02:36.100> is

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
I think the most I've only gotten is

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.520 
I think the most I've only gotten is
like<00:02:36.400> 65<00:02:37.030> or<00:02:37.330> something<00:02:37.480> like<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.080> is

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
like 65 or something like it is

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.750 
like 65 or something like it is
definitely<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.220> hard<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.550> drop<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
definitely really hard to drop a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.940 
definitely really hard to drop a
hundred-plus<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.420> league<00:02:40.600> play<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.960> these

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
hundred-plus in league play and these

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.500 
hundred-plus in league play and these
kids<00:02:42.190> aren't<00:02:42.340> stupid<00:02:42.580> they<00:02:42.970> sit<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.360> hill

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
kids aren't stupid they sit on the hill

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.940 
kids aren't stupid they sit on the hill
they<00:02:43.720> they<00:02:43.900> are<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:44.170> rotating<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.830> know

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
they they are there rotating you know

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.990 
they they are there rotating you know
they're<00:02:45.430> average<00:02:45.760> players<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.360> leap<00:02:46.540> place<00:02:46.780> so

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
they're average players in leap place so

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.150 
they're average players in leap place so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
like 19 deaths and he just turns up for

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.810 
like 19 deaths and he just turns up for
the<00:02:59.500> team<00:02:59.710> definitely<00:02:59.920> comes<00:03:00.250> up<00:03:00.400> big<00:03:00.550> at<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
the team definitely comes up big at the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.640 
the team definitely comes up big at the
end<00:03:00.850> these<00:03:01.810> stealth<00:03:02.050> choppers<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.530> these

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
end these stealth choppers in these

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.350 
end these stealth choppers in these
scorestreaks<00:03:03.190> really<00:03:03.700> help<00:03:03.880> him<00:03:04.030> out<00:03:04.120> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
scorestreaks really help him out and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.120 
scorestreaks really help him out and
that's<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.260> only<00:03:05.410> way<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.710> really<00:03:05.950> win

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
that's the only way you can really win

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.670 
that's the only way you can really win
so<00:03:06.760> they<00:03:07.630> really<00:03:07.930> helped<00:03:08.350> him<00:03:08.440> get<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.590> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
so they really helped him get on the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.110 
so they really helped him get on the
hill<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.220> think<00:03:09.460> you<00:03:09.520> can<00:03:09.670> hold<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.940> hill

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
hill and I think you can hold the hill

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.420 
hill and I think you can hold the hill
to<00:03:10.720> catch<00:03:11.200> up<00:03:11.410> but<00:03:11.560> he<00:03:11.620> had<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.860> huge<00:03:12.100> comeback

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
to catch up but he had a huge comeback

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.970 
to catch up but he had a huge comeback
like<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.820> hundred<00:03:13.150> point<00:03:13.390> comeback<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:13.990> he

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
like a hundred point comeback and he

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.320 
like a hundred point comeback and he
ends<00:03:15.160> up<00:03:15.220> coming<00:03:15.490> up<00:03:15.550> rope<00:03:15.760> clutch<00:03:15.970> at<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.210> end

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
ends up coming up rope clutch at the end

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.460
