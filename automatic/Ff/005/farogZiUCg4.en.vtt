00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.340 

I've<00:00:07.950> got<00:00:08.190> some<00:00:08.430> stains<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.570> cultured

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
I've got some stains in this cultured

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.100 
I've got some stains in this cultured
Mount<00:00:11.120> cultured<00:00:12.120> marble<00:00:12.389> countertop<00:00:14.960> I'm<00:00:15.960> not

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
Mount cultured marble countertop I'm not

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.420 
Mount cultured marble countertop I'm not
super<00:00:16.500> bad<00:00:17.300> but<00:00:18.300> they're<00:00:18.450> there<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.250> can<00:00:20.250> see

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
super bad but they're there you can see

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.929 
super bad but they're there you can see
here<00:00:20.670> maybe<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.750> cigarette<00:00:22.170> burn

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
here maybe a cigarette burn

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.429 
here maybe a cigarette burn
the<00:00:23.939> next<00:00:24.180> thing<00:00:24.329> about<00:00:24.360> cultured<00:00:24.930> marble<00:00:25.079> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the next thing about cultured marble is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.870 
the next thing about cultured marble is
it's<00:00:25.619> all<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:25.800> same<00:00:26.099> material<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:26.790> way

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it's all the same material all the way

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.479 
it's all the same material all the way
through<00:00:27.270> so<00:00:27.540> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:28.099> sand<00:00:29.099> this

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
through so you can actually sand this

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.240 
through so you can actually sand this
out<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.329> have<00:00:30.599> here<00:00:30.930> is<00:00:31.140> some<00:00:31.250> aluminum

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
out what I have here is some aluminum

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.639 
out what I have here is some aluminum
oxide<00:00:32.669> sandpaper<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.510> lot<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> time<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.470> is

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
oxide sandpaper a lot of time this is

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.670 
oxide sandpaper a lot of time this is
used<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.190> buffing<00:00:35.610> cardboard<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.620> it's<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
used for buffing cardboard and it's a

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.900 
used for buffing cardboard and it's a
wet<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:37.920> dry<00:00:38.160> sandpaper

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.810 

this<00:00:41.910> one's<00:00:42.180> wet<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.650> bit<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> can

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this one's wet a little bit but you can

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.320 
this one's wet a little bit but you can
see<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.270> took<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.750> took<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.380> stain<00:00:49.740> right<00:00:50.010> out

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
see it took the took the stain right out

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.870 
see it took the took the stain right out
so<00:00:51.330> here's<00:00:51.510> another<00:00:51.720> one<00:00:51.930> I'll<00:00:52.080> show<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
so here's another one I'll show you is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.490 
so here's another one I'll show you is
this<00:00:53.880> won't<00:00:54.120> clean<00:00:54.360> off<00:00:54.570> doesn't<00:00:55.110> matter<00:00:55.260> what

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
this won't clean off doesn't matter what

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
this won't clean off doesn't matter what
kind<00:00:55.650> of<00:00:55.770> cleaner<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.820> looks

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
kind of cleaner you use it's a looks

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
kind of cleaner you use it's a looks
like<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.810> cigarette<00:00:58.260> burn<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.040> we'll<00:00:59.190> put<00:00:59.490> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
like a cigarette burn so we'll put a

like a cigarette burn so we'll put a
cigarette<00:00:59.790> on<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.030> end<00:01:00.440> left<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:01.770> maybe

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
cigarette on the end left it there maybe

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.789 
cigarette on the end left it there maybe
something<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.660> anyway<00:01:05.600> little<00:01:06.799> that

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
something like that anyway little that

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.749 
something like that anyway little that
it's<00:01:07.950> wet<00:01:08.159> or<00:01:08.280> dry<00:01:08.430> sandpaper<00:01:13.429> and<00:01:14.429> it's<00:01:14.579> good

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
it's wet or dry sandpaper and it's good

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's wet or dry sandpaper and it's good
as<00:01:14.850> new

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
as new

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.340 
as new
really<00:01:16.020> doesn't<00:01:16.319> take<00:01:16.469> take<00:01:17.429> too<00:01:17.609> much<00:01:21.350> Thank

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
really doesn't take take too much Thank

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
really doesn't take take too much Thank
You<00:01:22.409> PETA<00:01:22.619> elbow<00:01:22.950> grease<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.399> if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
You PETA elbow grease and if you want to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.730 
You PETA elbow grease and if you want to
you<00:01:24.149> can<00:01:24.359> follow<00:01:24.569> this<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.109> a<00:01:25.289> cultured

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you can follow this up with a cultured

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.419 
you can follow this up with a cultured
marble<00:01:25.950> polish<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.679> seals<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.219> and

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
marble polish so that it seals it and

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.090 
marble polish so that it seals it and
it's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.909> less<00:01:30.179> like<00:01:30.420> leader<00:01:30.859> to<00:01:31.859> race

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it's a little less like leader to race

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.370 
it's a little less like leader to race
team<00:01:34.789> but<00:01:35.789> it<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.270> pretty<00:01:36.689> resilient

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
team but it is pretty resilient

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.830 
team but it is pretty resilient
stuff<00:01:37.679> anyway<00:01:38.100> most<00:01:38.909> likely<00:01:39.329> wouldn't<00:01:39.630> Racine

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
stuff anyway most likely wouldn't Racine

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.919 
stuff anyway most likely wouldn't Racine
anyway<00:01:42.840> here's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:44.209> another<00:01:45.209> little<00:01:45.569> darker

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
anyway here's a another little darker

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:55.650 
anyway here's a another little darker
spot

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.090 

anyway<00:01:56.770> there<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:57.890> go<00:01:58.390> good<00:01:59.390> as<00:01:59.510> new

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
anyway there we go good as new

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.930 
anyway there we go good as new
it's<00:02:01.430> cultured<00:02:01.820> mobile<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:04.340> also<00:02:04.610> works

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
it's cultured mobile this also works

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.130 
it's cultured mobile this also works
going<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.080> basin

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
going in the basin

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:20.880 
going in the basin
to<00:02:08.289> use<00:02:08.470> coverage

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.190 

you
