00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
simple operation to get a little class

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.679 
simple operation to get a little class
and<00:01:12.830> that<00:01:13.830> class<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.430> likely<00:01:14.729> excellent

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and that class is likely excellent

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.570

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.090 

there's<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.580> 55<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.689> 80<00:01:26.720> millimeter<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:27.890> it's

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
there's a 55 to 80 millimeter so it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.539 
there's a 55 to 80 millimeter so it's
ultra<00:01:28.850> white<00:01:29.180> through<00:01:29.600> wine<00:01:30.220> but<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.310> fact

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
ultra white through wine but the fact

00:01:31.549 --> 00:02:05.460 
ultra white through wine but the fact
that<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.850> can<00:01:32.060> clip<00:01:32.299> it<00:01:32.450> off<00:01:32.649> something<00:01:33.649> else

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:16.240 

and<00:02:06.470> then<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:14.319> don't<00:02:15.319> have<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.530> very<00:02:15.920> aware

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
and then you don't have it very aware

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.650 
and then you don't have it very aware
that<00:02:16.310> programmer<00:02:17.769> we<00:02:18.769> just<00:02:19.040> accept<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.660> video
