00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
was very little bit of madness involved

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.830 
was very little bit of madness involved
here<00:00:09.610> when<00:00:09.760> you<00:00:09.850> said<00:00:10.030> we<00:00:10.660> can<00:00:10.840> do<00:00:10.900> this

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
here when you said we can do this

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.510 
here when you said we can do this
well<00:00:13.840> if<00:00:14.170> that's<00:00:14.410> what<00:00:14.590> they<00:00:14.920> say<00:00:15.279> we've

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
well if that's what they say we've

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.450 
well if that's what they say we've
proved<00:00:15.879> them<00:00:16.090> all<00:00:16.209> wrong<00:00:17.100> because<00:00:18.100> you<00:00:18.340> know<00:00:18.430> I

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
proved them all wrong because you know I

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.909 
proved them all wrong because you know I
think<00:00:18.550> we<00:00:18.820> we<00:00:19.660> did<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:19.840> good<00:00:20.050> job<00:00:20.109> in<00:00:20.560> terms<00:00:20.589> of

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
think we we did a good job in terms of

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.370 
think we we did a good job in terms of
reinterpreting<00:00:21.759> the<00:00:21.910> classic<00:00:22.449> I<00:00:22.660> think<00:00:23.140> James

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
reinterpreting the classic I think James

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.300 
reinterpreting the classic I think James

us that we might be on the eve of
self-destruction<00:00:55.289> yeah<00:00:56.289> I<00:00:56.320> mean<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:57.010> it's

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940

self-destruction yeah I mean it's it's
part<00:00:58.239> of<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.420> reason<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:58.899> did<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.260> you<00:00:59.410> know

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
part of the reason I did it you know

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.369 
part of the reason I did it you know
and<00:01:00.609> I<00:01:00.940> thought<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.300> was<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> good<00:01:01.690> why<00:01:01.960> why

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
and I thought that was a good why why

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.989 
and I thought that was a good why why
make<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.829> remake<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.519> was<00:01:03.640> scott

you know let's start with that you know
here's<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:08.020> big<00:01:08.170> idea<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.770> what<00:01:08.920> we're

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
here's the big idea this is what we're

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.140 
here's the big idea this is what we're
gonna<00:01:09.310> base<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.850> film<00:01:10.150> around<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.850> are<00:01:13.000> on

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
gonna base the film around and we are on

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.030 
gonna base the film around and we are on
a<00:01:13.180> precipice<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:14.470> know<00:01:14.560> it's<00:01:14.680> not<00:01:14.799> even<00:01:14.920> a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
a precipice you know it's not even a

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.219 
a precipice you know it's not even a
question<00:01:15.460> it's<00:01:15.640> like<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.909> fact<00:01:16.180> but<00:01:16.810> not<00:01:16.990> only

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
question it's like a fact but not only

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.800 
question it's like a fact but not only
are<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.409> but<00:01:17.860> also<00:01:18.009> so<00:01:18.400> many<00:01:18.490> other<00:01:18.729> species<00:01:19.119> on

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
