however we wanted to warn it is and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.420 
however we wanted to warn it is and
you're<00:00:29.789> gonna<00:00:29.880> start<00:00:30.269> by<00:00:30.539> lacing<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
you're gonna start by lacing up on you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.139 
you're gonna start by lacing up on you
oh<00:00:32.460> when<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.940> lace<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.809> shoe<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.200> always

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
start with the inside lace because

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.660 
start with the inside lace because
that's<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.960> makes<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> easier<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that's just it makes it easier to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.750 
that's just it makes it easier to
remember<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.739> you're<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.890> having<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.399> both

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
remember and you're not having like both

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.619 
remember and you're not having like both
the<00:00:45.000> shoes<00:00:45.210> start<00:00:45.510> off<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:47.239> or<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:48.420> she's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the shoes start off with or when she's

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.790 
the shoes start off with or when she's
starting<00:00:48.870> off<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> inside<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.620> she

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
starting off by the inside and when she

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680 
starting off by the inside and when she
do<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.340> she's<00:00:50.550> starting<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:50.969> outside<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
do when she's starting off outside and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
do when she's starting off outside and
just<00:00:51.930> looks<00:00:52.140> weird<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> always<00:00:53.640> start<00:00:53.820> with

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
just looks weird so I always start with

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.880 
just looks weird so I always start with
the<00:00:54.059> inside<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:55.469> factory

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the inside and that's how they factory

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
the inside and that's how they factory
license<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.969> guess<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> right<00:00:58.050> way

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
license so I guess it's the right way

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.049 
license so I guess it's the right way
now<00:00:59.250> you're<00:00:59.399> gonna<00:00:59.489> start<00:00:59.850> by<00:01:00.000> putting<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.449> in

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
now you're gonna start by putting it in

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.730 
now you're gonna start by putting it in
down<00:01:03.059> through<00:01:04.250> not<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.570> down<00:01:06.630> through<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
down through not up but down through the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.609 
down through not up but down through the
first<00:01:07.950> eyelet<00:01:08.930> you're<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.110> gonna<00:01:10.229> pull<00:01:10.500> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
first eyelet you're just gonna pull it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.730 
first eyelet you're just gonna pull it
through<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:15.360> personally<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.500> keep

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
through and I personally like to keep

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.850 
through and I personally like to keep
them<00:01:17.100> straight<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.200> they're<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.619> all

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
them straight so that they're not all

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
them straight so that they're not all
like<00:01:20.070> twist<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.960> look

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
like twist it up and don't really look

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.570 
like twist it up and don't really look
too<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.590> twisted<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.189> think<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.430> look

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
too good twisted up I think they look

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
too good twisted up I think they look
better<00:01:23.700> straight<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.930> try<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.200> keep<00:01:25.409> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
better straight so try to keep it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.760 
better straight so try to keep it
straight<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.750> you're<00:01:28.350> gonna<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.650> with

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
straight and then you're gonna go with

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.080 
straight and then you're gonna go with
the<00:01:28.860> outside<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.610> you're<00:01:29.729> gonna<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the outside one and you're gonna do the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.840 
the outside one and you're gonna do the
same<00:01:30.270> thing<00:01:31.340> you're<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.460> gonna<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.820> through

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
same thing you're just gonna go through

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.929 
same thing you're just gonna go through
the<00:01:34.159> outside<00:01:35.159> eyelet<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.900> outside<00:01:37.939> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the outside eyelet from the outside and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.609 
the outside eyelet from the outside and
if<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.939> twist<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.290> lace<00:01:43.290> then

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
if you get like a twist in lace then

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.639 
if you get like a twist in lace then
it's<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:43.950> hard<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.220> fix<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.439> after<00:01:46.619> that

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it's not hard to fix so then after that

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.660 
it's not hard to fix so then after that
you're<00:01:46.890> gonna<00:01:46.979> start<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you're gonna start with the one that you

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.870 
you're gonna start with the one that you
just<00:01:47.700> did<00:01:48.060> which<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.140> gonna<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.220> flat<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
just did which was gonna be flat and you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.719 
just did which was gonna be flat and you
just<00:01:51.060> take<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.450> through<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.310> next<00:01:53.310> aisle<00:01:53.520> it

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
just take it through the next aisle it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.179 
just take it through the next aisle it
up<00:01:56.479> then<00:01:57.479> you're<00:01:57.630> gonna<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> same<00:01:59.040> with

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
up then you're gonna do the same with

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
up then you're gonna do the same with
the<00:01:59.280> opposite<00:01:59.640> side<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.810> really<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the opposite side it's really not that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.969 
the opposite side it's really not that
hard<00:02:01.350> how<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:02.670> factory<00:02:03.090> lace<00:02:03.360> is

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
hard how they do it in factory lace is

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.029 
hard how they do it in factory lace is
they<00:02:04.979> bring<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.399> up<00:02:05.579> through<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:08.190> inside

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
they bring it up through the inside

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.729 
they bring it up through the inside
of<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:11.030> eye<00:02:11.709> light<00:02:12.709> but<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.459> take<00:02:13.879> them<00:02:14.739> down

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
of the eye light but I take them down

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.399 
of the eye light but I take them down
through<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.629> outside<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.140> makes<00:02:21.290> it

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
through the outside and it makes it

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.399 
through the outside and it makes it
easier<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.239> laces<00:02:23.569> form<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> way

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
easier to have the laces form to the way

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.140 
easier to have the laces form to the way
that<00:02:24.560> you're<00:02:24.680> gonna<00:02:25.209> lace<00:02:26.209> them<00:02:26.390> up<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.849> you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
that you're gonna lace them up and you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.330 
that you're gonna lace them up and you
just<00:02:29.209> keep<00:02:29.750> doing<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.170> until<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:31.610> are<00:02:31.640> up<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
just keep doing that until you are up to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.550 
just keep doing that until you are up to
the<00:02:34.340> right<00:02:34.760> after<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.329> plastic<00:02:35.989> eyelids<00:02:36.349> and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the right after the plastic eyelids and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.930 
the right after the plastic eyelids and
to<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.890> normal<00:02:37.159> one<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.430> don't<00:02:37.579> want<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> go

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
to the normal one you don't want to go

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.330
