 or the triplist of the welcome to band 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.080
 for three today I have the pleasure of 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.510
 interview william jimÃ©nez 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.790
 presenter and narrator of the nba in 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.210
 channel + welcome william how about how 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.369
 these 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.020
 well, look at the first question 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.390
 What do I have to do to you? 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.640
 our profession because journalism 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.950
 sports 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.780
 that's what everybody asks me 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.000
 the people that as a child we like the 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.700
 sport we think that a good way to 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.490
 earn your living without much effort and 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.920
 also without getting up early is to study 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.870
 sports journalism around the world you 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.570
 try to convince otherwise there is no 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.489
 exits tell you they tell you all that 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.130
 kind of things but if one persists then 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.790
 in the end I ended up in this now we're not going 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.860
 to focus a little more on the nba 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.170
 in the sport they are narrating now 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.109
 same in channel + 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.420
 do you think the nba fan here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.830
 in Spain and in Europe is more crazy than 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.119
 the US simply because of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.480
 watch the matches at that time of the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.170
 night 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.050
 because it may be because here is the nba 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.810
 directs to a kind of 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.880
 of people of citizens who do not carry 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.710
 a normal life like most 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.299
 people who are late 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.880
 Many people do not madruga the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.440
 students are asked for afternoon shift 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.900
 the university to be able to follow the nba 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.630
 I house my case I must also say 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.909
 and if you see it a lot of people from the hospitality industry 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.759
 actors people who do not have the typical 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.159
 work from 9 to 13 exact many people 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.390
 also young like me now 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.369
 that we are studying and that by 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.259
 tomorrow he does not have great things that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.460
 do then we seem crazy but there 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.140
 we are at three and four in the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.200
 tomorrow watching matches but we are more than 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.850
 what people think if the truth is 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.880
 that we are enough more than there 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 speaking now of nba I know you love 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.550
 the nba and yes you love it too much 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.340
 the music you are passionate about 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.630
 music so if I 'm going to make you a 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.860
 game is worth I'll put you here 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.750
 some little songs I'm going to put a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.290
 song four songs agree and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.239
 I want that 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.840
 relations with some player of the nba 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.219
 so so depending on the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.480
 title as it sounds what I stayed 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:30.500
 in the most interesting time it 's good 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.500
 Well, we talked to the first 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.790

 tree 'year 87 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.990
 to see here we may seem if I 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.170
 with you or without you reminds me of pau gasol 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.850
 this comes to our pau yes because the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.880
 Angels franchise bears 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.280
 asking yourself that question two or three years 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.640
 We continue with you or without you and what we do 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.560
 with you are the only uncle who is worth 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.270
 something in the market that prestige that 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.520
 can be placed to many rumors of 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.310
 transfers and is the player that continue in 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.140
 reality arising after spending very 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.480
 well pau gasol with those rumors of 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.800
 transfer with you or without you with 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.320
 angels lakers with heart beats audio and 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.190
 second song let's see here we 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.190
 remember this song 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.960
 it's a cry of bruce philadelphia 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.760
 springsteen 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.970
 soundtrack of a movie 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.740
 bodyguards instead of backs 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.430
 Philadelphia iverson 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.350
 it sounds allen iverson to you then if you 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.560
 I'm going to buy it because it's also a 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.390
 slow sad depressive song and alan 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.100
 iverson has finished his career in addition 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.140
 this week has narrated 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.060
 officially its withdrawal 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.700
 not in economic ruin but almost 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.440
 having thrown over 100 overboard 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.110
 million dollars problems 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.480
 marriage and of all kinds if you have not 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.790
 finished how the face could have finished 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.550
 bitter of allen iverson the good face of 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.380
 allen iverson why I remind you is 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.390
 streets of philadelphia streetball 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.740

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.510

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.459
 interests to me this song reminds me 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.650
 to which is the last time philadelphia 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.320

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.970

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.970
 we go there with the third song 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:34.539
 piece of song 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.980

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.660
 ready face value 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.040
 this song does not really remind me 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.640
 a basketball game reminds me of a 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.330
 Boxer reminds me of Mike Tyson because 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.030

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.030
 that the gift was me to me reminds me 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.920
 a lot especially for the letter in the air 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.670

 oh mister michael jordan yes currently 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.330

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.240
 play jordan equal blake griffin no 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.420
 because the photos that you hit are tremendous 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.100
 they fly over the people we go with 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.100
 the fourth and last song 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.450
 it's a song 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.450
 that I think we're going to give 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.940
 manny formation of the kings 3 exact 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.060
 for an information before you have spoken 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.460
 of the fun of money that now 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.240
 they walk low hours we could say some 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.030
 player 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.070
 some player 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.680
 well we could talk about many 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.150
 players who are only looking for the 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.889
 pasta because that song what it talks about is 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.050
 of the people what 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.699
 that does not touch what composes what it 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.409
 leaves the soul but what he thinks 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:58.110
 have to do to earn money 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.200
 and there is a lot in all 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:06.180
 soccer teams of primates of the nba 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:08.460
 by howard for example a lot 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.400
 dwight howard we say by howard and then 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.990
 we will see our viewers already 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.540
 They will say to see who they think is 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.060
 song or another and I said four but the 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.460
 fifth is a special song this 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.970
 song will all sound to us only to 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.970
 one thing 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.440
 until they succeeded 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.890
 the song 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.750
 it's the typical song that right now 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.940
 you value a lot but when you leave 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.380
 everyone retires and goes fishing 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.370
 it will bring many memories the harmony 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.200
 with which we started the retransmissions 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.420
 of the nba every night for 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.150
 Many years already remember me from 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.640
 comes to the head of jordan jordan that 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.140
 this has fallen off in three mountains and 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.310
 Antonio from mails reminds me and then to 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.110
 all the others that we have followed 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.510
 making snow these years the nights 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.790
 it started with the slow music and 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.830
 biglieri and we already got the skin of 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.840
