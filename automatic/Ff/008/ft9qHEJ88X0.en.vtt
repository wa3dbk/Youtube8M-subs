00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:09.719
 this one knows that it was known if 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.429

 imagine if they are remember instead 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.250
 attention to customers and here in my opinion 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 their musical life is shared with 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.250
 this song 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.109

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.109
 public reaction are already alone 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.930
 graziano overflows they will appoint fi non 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.300

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.960

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.910
 already 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.910
 reality 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.470
 solutions that someone 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.360
 good 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.360
 or that I am already alone 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.730
 come back 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.750

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.750

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.280
 I feel more actresses feel 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.280
 all is not there 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.549
 because I know I don't know when you like it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.780
 bad 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.780
 a small bar because I am immediately 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.780
 racist 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.579
 always keep having your memories 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.850
 we have it 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.040
 marmaris 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.290
 Hello 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.439
 brenda 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.439
 6 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.660
 that's enough 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.660
 let's go like this 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.970
 most bitter 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.970
 rain 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.579
 it cannot be that they are already up 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.980
 well right up to the last so i was 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.590
 curious to hear it with the orchestra with 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.110
 all this must say that it was 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.370
 very hard for everyone to sit still 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.270
 because we remember it since we are 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.770
 at the Verona arena 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.380
 the seats are with you sitting feel this 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.100
 it's the noise your feet make 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.110
 but all the superintendence is down 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:04.900
 will be glad to viggiÃ¹ the last piece 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:08.380
 of arena is also not robust enough 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.560
 seen so many years of performances by 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.580
 great concert music that resists the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.580
 our beautiful arena
