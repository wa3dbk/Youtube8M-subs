00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.730
 Hi, people, the bitch complained today. I'm going. 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.000
 show you how to make a 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.670
 loaf of fork and not even bonbon 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.709
 Actually, this is not even you. 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.470
 can use it in many ways 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.230
 It's what we did here on the package or 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.080
 can put a gift tag is a 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.180
 Cute touch is for the wrapping to stay 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.280
 a little more interesting and 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.220
 same time it's super easy to do with 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.430
 things you have at home and let's go 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.239
 I will teach to make a good fork 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:44.600
 You will need wool or string is 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.700
 scissors a fork is only the first you 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.700
 cut a piece of wool from more or less 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.980
 15 centimeters and put aside is 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.860
 then you'll get another piece of 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.320
 there was something long that gave 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.399
 for you to pass around the fork 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.990
 more or less between 45 and 50 turns 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.819
 okay so I took a very long is 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.369
 anything you cut the excess 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:16.819
 We 'll start later. 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:21.289
 placing the line in the middle of the fork 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:23.149
 It 's important to hold well and get well. 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.060
 in the middle of the car so you have a space 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.990
 upstairs available after you 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.779
 will see why 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:37.609
 and then it's 45 to 50 turns and it's cool 

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:40.249
 is the line because it will stay 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:45.039
 very perfect then it 's harder to 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:51.429
 to perceive overlapping is 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.429
 two three four five six 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.380
 49 50 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.260
 So I wrapped here 50 turns 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.500
 now you're going to get this piece of 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.070
 The line you cut in says will put 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.660
 here in the middle of the fork and this 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.240
 It's the coolest part. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.020
 and then you will get another tip and it will 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.980
 stay here in the middle 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.360
 underneath to see 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.360
 Get it out of here. 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.440
 It's over there. 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.450
 then you will tie a knot that means and that 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.600
 important part to do well tight 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:57.730
 a very tight for your good stay 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:03:17.360
 very plump with a tight grip 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:19.870
 and gives a knot made it to scissors threading 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:31.060
 that on the tip 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:31.060
 and then you 're going to miss two sides like this 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.170
 so it's going to be on the other side 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:28.389
 And there it is just you and pressing and you 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.570
 go hacking around so that all landu 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.460
 Good to be about the same size 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.460
 and then you can cut it even with desire 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:44.550
 The shorter, but your good. 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.550
 stay uniform 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.820
 saw then this is you have a roll 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.310
 beautiful made with the car you can 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.310
 Use to decorate any gift
