quick<00:00:07.109> demo<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:08.069> digital<00:00:08.400> game<00:00:08.639> table<00:00:09.059> did

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
quick demo of the digital game table did

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.480 
quick demo of the digital game table did
this<00:00:09.570> whole<00:00:09.780> game<00:00:09.990> table<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.980> how<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.160> use<00:00:11.250> it

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
this whole game table and how we use it

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.629 
this whole game table and how we use it
to<00:00:11.519> interface<00:00:11.969> when<00:00:12.509> we're<00:00:12.599> playing<00:00:12.719> D&amp;D<00:00:13.639> what

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
to interface when we're playing D&amp;D what

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.820 
to interface when we're playing D&amp;D what
I've<00:00:14.759> done<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.120> adult<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.630> opaque<00:00:16.590> plastic

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
I've done is adult a opaque plastic

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
I've done is adult a opaque plastic
surface<00:00:17.490> using<00:00:18.109> number<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.199> different

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
surface using number of different

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.929 
surface using number of different
materials<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.010> projector<00:00:20.520> which<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:20.789> have

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
materials in a projector which we have

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700 
materials in a projector which we have
an<00:00:21.029> innate<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> table<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:22.050> she's<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.410> mirror

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
an innate the table but she's a mirror

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.640 
an innate the table but she's a mirror
and<00:00:23.130> projects<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> surface<00:00:23.910> onto<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.240> table

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
and projects the surface onto the table

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.830 
and projects the surface onto the table
this<00:00:25.650> allows<00:00:25.949> us<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.609> school<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.240> called<00:00:27.660> map

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
this allows us in school on called map

GM interface so the gym can move around
off<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> screen<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.309> another

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
off the screen and we have another

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.069 
off the screen and we have another
computer<00:00:35.880> dedicated<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> game<00:00:36.719> table

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
computer dedicated for the game table

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.889 
computer dedicated for the game table
and<00:00:38.000> basically<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.629> know

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and basically what you can see it's know

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.880 
and basically what you can see it's know
it's<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> watch<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.469> you're<00:00:40.620> gonna<00:00:40.710> how

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
hard I'm seeing the actual hi hi 30 we

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.080 
hard I'm seeing the actual hi hi 30 we
have<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.489> it's<00:00:44.610> actually<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:44.940> nice

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

have here but it's actually really nice
we<00:00:45.210> got<00:00:45.329> our<00:00:45.420> good<00:00:45.539> grid<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.800> tables

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
we got our good grid we have like tables

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.950 
we got our good grid we have like tables
and<00:00:47.550> characters<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.360> things<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.690> stuff<00:00:48.780> like

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and characters and things and stuff like

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660 
and characters and things and stuff like
that<00:00:49.020> they're<00:00:49.590> represented<00:00:50.070> by<00:00:50.129> tokens<00:00:50.579> on

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that they're represented by tokens on

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
that they're represented by tokens on
the<00:00:50.760> bums<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> map<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.590> allows<00:00:52.829> us<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the bums on the map and it allows us to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.610 
the bums on the map and it allows us to
actually<00:00:53.219> grab<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.940> move<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> tokens

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
actually grab and move the tokens

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
actually grab and move the tokens
wherever<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.160> even<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.510> board<00:00:57.780> now

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
wherever we even to go on the board now

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.799 
wherever we even to go on the board now
that's<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> cool<00:01:00.030> benefits<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that's one of the cool benefits but the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's one of the cool benefits but the
really<00:01:01.199> does<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> best<00:01:01.770> part<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.460> is

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
really does the best part about it is is

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.420 
really does the best part about it is is
that<00:01:03.390> when<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.559> thought<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.890> wars<00:01:05.129> which

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
that when we have thought of wars which

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700 
that when we have thought of wars which
is<00:01:05.580> enabled<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> player<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:07.470> see

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
is enabled so when a player can see

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.980 
is enabled so when a player can see
around<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.010> corner<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.790> lights<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
around the corner it lights up down the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960 
around the corner it lights up down the
hallway<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.380> example<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.760> walk

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
hallway for example or when they walk

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.300 
hallway for example or when they walk
into<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.689> room<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.170> one<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
into a room like this one over here it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
into a room like this one over here it
lights<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> only<00:01:15.090> shows<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:15.869> they

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
lights up and only shows just what they

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.539 
lights up and only shows just what they
can<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.130> few<00:01:17.159> slivers

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
can see like that just a few slivers

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700 
can see like that just a few slivers
here<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.450> feckin<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.840> hear<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> lights<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
here the feckin I hear it lights up the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
here the feckin I hear it lights up the
whole<00:01:19.740> hallway<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:20.939> into

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
whole hallway and all the way down into

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.230 
whole hallway and all the way down into
the<00:01:21.270> other<00:01:21.420> room<00:01:22.820> one<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the other room one of the one of the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
the other room one of the one of the
really<00:01:24.600> neat<00:01:24.869> parts<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> DM<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
really neat parts for the DM is that it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.730 
really neat parts for the DM is that it
actually<00:01:26.250> hides<00:01:27.020> automatic<00:01:28.020> behind<00:01:28.320> some<00:01:28.560> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
actually hides automatic behind some on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.710 
actually hides automatic behind some on
setup<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> monster<00:01:29.759> right<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
setup it's a monster right here and it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.480 
setup it's a monster right here and it
automatically<00:01:31.229> hides<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.770> monster<00:01:32.189> when

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
automatically hides this monster when

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
automatically hides this monster when
you<00:01:32.640> can't<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.090> monster<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.079> i<00:01:34.170> run

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you can't see that monster so if i run

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.249 
you can't see that monster so if i run
around<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> corner<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:36.000> monster<00:01:36.259> decides

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
around the corner and a monster decides

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.249

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
line across here which will actually

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.110 
line across here which will actually
obscure<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.099> view<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.519> if<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.670> player<00:02:42.880> walked

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
obscure the view so if the player walked

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.699 
obscure the view so if the player walked
up<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.360> door<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.630> they<00:02:44.170> said<00:02:44.380> I'm<00:02:44.560> going

a trap see important point of light and
with<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> simple<00:03:32.079> program<00:03:32.440> i<00:03:32.560> can<00:03:32.709> actually

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
with a simple program i can actually

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.670 
with a simple program i can actually
click<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.880> drag<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.299> select<00:03:34.389> by<00:03:34.750> user<00:03:35.410> rights

click and drag and select by user rights

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.289 
click and drag and select by user rights
like<00:03:35.859> I<00:03:36.010> can<00:03:36.160> actually<00:03:36.190> pan<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.880> whole<00:03:37.060> map

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
like I can actually pan the whole map

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.390 
like I can actually pan the whole map
around<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.989> I<00:03:38.530> can<00:03:38.709> look<00:03:38.829> around<00:03:38.950> where<00:03:39.310> we've

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
around and I can look around where we've

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.059 
around and I can look around where we've
been<00:03:39.609> where<00:03:39.910> we're<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.420> things<00:03:40.690> like<00:03:40.840> that

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
been where we're going things like that

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.710 
been where we're going things like that
and<00:03:42.069> then<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.519> also<00:03:42.639> switch<00:03:43.269> back<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.450> left

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
and then I can also switch back to left

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.420 
and then I can also switch back to left
foot<00:03:43.900> code<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.349> grab<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.590> token<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.160> lose<00:03:45.310> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
foot code and grab a token and lose the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.990 
foot code and grab a token and lose the
token<00:03:45.730> around<00:03:46.019> with<00:03:47.019> damn<00:03:47.500> Fred<00:03:47.769> 10<00:03:48.010> directly

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
token around with damn Fred 10 directly

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.550 
token around with damn Fred 10 directly
with<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.150> table<00:03:49.510> so<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.959> player<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.230> may

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
with a table so it's a player I may

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.259 
with a table so it's a player I may
actually<00:03:50.680> want<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.130> use<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.340> fig<00:03:51.700> on<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.000> board

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
actually want to use a fig on the board

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.030 
actually want to use a fig on the board
and<00:03:52.900> its<00:03:53.019> really<00:03:53.169> nice<00:03:53.380> too<00:03:53.500> bad<00:03:53.680> because<00:03:53.859> all

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
and its really nice too bad because all

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.309 
and its really nice too bad because all
you<00:03:54.160> do<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.400> I'm<00:03:54.579> going<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:55.090> move<00:03:55.209> over<00:03:55.480> here<00:03:55.510> so

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
you do is I'm going to move over here so

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.820 
you do is I'm going to move over here so
I<00:03:56.380> grab<00:03:56.590> my<00:03:56.620> token<00:03:57.190> I

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
I grab my token I

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.200 
I grab my token I
digital<00:03:58.830> token<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.400> move<00:03:59.610> my<00:03:59.700> real<00:03:59.880> token

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
digital token and I move my real token

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.900 
digital token and I move my real token
and<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.450> still<00:04:00.870> use<00:04:01.050> my<00:04:01.230> speed<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:02.370> found<00:04:02.610> that

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
and I still use my speed we found that

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.480 
and I still use my speed we found that
for<00:04:03.330> tracking<00:04:03.570> monsters<00:04:04.170> it's<00:04:04.860> better<00:04:05.100> to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
for tracking monsters it's better to

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.910 
for tracking monsters it's better to
just<00:04:06.270> use<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.170> Watchers<00:04:07.500> on<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.650> board

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
just use the Watchers on the board

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
just use the Watchers on the board
because<00:04:08.070> again<00:04:08.370> they<00:04:08.490> kind<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.700> hide<00:04:08.910> and

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
because again they kind of hide and

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.780 
because again they kind of hide and
shows<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.900> could<00:04:10.290> use<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.710> I<00:04:11.280> could<00:04:11.640> use

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
shows that I could use the I could use

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.300 
shows that I could use the I could use
the<00:04:11.850> figs<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:13.020> be<00:04:13.140> honest<00:04:13.500> it's<00:04:13.710> easier<00:04:14.190> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
the figs but to be honest it's easier to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.680 
the figs but to be honest it's easier to
track<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.730> without<00:04:15.090> using<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.480> things

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
track it without using the things

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.870 
track it without using the things
because<00:04:15.990> I<00:04:16.079> can<00:04:16.260> apply<00:04:16.500> states<00:04:16.920> like<00:04:17.220> math

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
because I can apply states like math

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.400 
because I can apply states like math
tools<00:04:18.120> allows<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.630> apply<00:04:18.690> bloodied

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
tools allows you to apply bloodied

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.140 
tools allows you to apply bloodied
state's<00:04:19.739> ongoing<00:04:20.040> damage<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.850> things<00:04:21.030> like

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
state's ongoing damage and things like

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.630 
state's ongoing damage and things like
that<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.390> track<00:04:21.720> them<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:22.560> it's<00:04:23.130> easier<00:04:23.430> for<00:04:23.460> me

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
that to track them so it's easier for me

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.780 
that to track them so it's easier for me
you<00:04:24.420> know<00:04:24.450> now<00:04:24.840> using<00:04:25.140> figures<00:04:25.410> but<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:26.700> know

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
you know now using figures but you know

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.840 
you know now using figures but you know
I<00:04:26.820> made<00:04:27.060> an<00:04:27.330> eye<00:04:27.450> for<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.750> big<00:04:27.930> bad<00:04:28.170> guys<00:04:28.850> yeah

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
I made an eye for the big bad guys yeah
