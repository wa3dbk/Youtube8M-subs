00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.220
 running lugs running lights on 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.519
 LEDs are Chinese LEDs 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.889
 Internet write that 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.669
 metal to replace because you are sweetheart 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.669
 is necessary 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.760
 the remains after porn 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.810
 but now because the principle can 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.699
 do without the attention lights 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.570
 on the left side and first your country 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.570
 so you can 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:36.809
 air filter cover a bit and 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.219
 bend back and principle can get to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:48.690
 dad covers catalogs 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:48.690
 Now I will answer all kinds no one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.269

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.829
 don't just pull out just fancy 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.740
 critics 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.570
 and turning down the filter side so that he would 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.090
 did not interfere with performing operations with a light bulb 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.320
 so he cover 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.920
 from the bulb deal again 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.270
 unscrew lightly to the right 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.270
 neatly pulled out of here 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.820
 here is the cover 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.820
 how not to us very zamu light bulb 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.950
 there is a crack there is a little market 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.979
 pull up 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.979
 and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 pull up mommy can holiday for 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.220
 wire try 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.090
 it means my finger is pressing the narrow 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.090
 fit qeder to tent 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.120
 that's a little by myself 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.549
 So 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.549
 not a boy 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.790
 it leaves neatly 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.640
 check now works 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 so passionately in love and turn on 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.810
 so here is the design here 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.019
 such for slits them so you are pressed 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.360
 deliver inside the ceiling there is a slot 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.700
 which yes yes should 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.620
 latch go now neatly 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.200
 refuel 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.379
 it's our trouble our our file so all this 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.629
 does we set 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.629
 lid neatly fill a couple 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.360
 on goal the right side of the left side 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.690
 who is ready 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.810
 what's the filter back 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.760
 open the lid ready to buy 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.560
 Well, we twist 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.540
 so mean here with us 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.500
 blooms and ok. to put on shoes 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.500
 wish 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.570
 block rest 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.570
 dosochki 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.760
 also 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.760
 neatly open the lid 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:11.360
 itâ€™s more difficult for me here because 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.360
 o die worth closer 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.549
 We also get the lamp itself first 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.549
 right flow 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.660
 rounding 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.660
 draw the antennae 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.639
 not organza right 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.319
 Bragin we get 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.940
 change year 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.940
 and so 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.330
 held 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.890
 he shook 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.860
 is burning 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.590
 how do we reverse 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.160
 refuel 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.160
 cartridge 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.839
 So 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:48.159
 She precisely put the slots start at the expense 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.159
 so what's their roof 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.090
 so wire there cover the position 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.340
 You can sometimes pepper 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.449
 we are going in the reverse order 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.309
 and wet burn 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.820
 both hooks 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.860
 agila 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.849
 does not matter 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.849
 finally comes about
