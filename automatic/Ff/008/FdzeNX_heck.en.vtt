00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:11.880
 that he presents you the reception on the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.570
 phone of the n2 gift of the day on 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.570
 can see the altitude 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 up there with the coordinates 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.640
 the position of the radio probe that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.920
 correspond I look and interested 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:33.660
 currently I 'm doing on manosque 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:37.730
 this is the altitude currently sixteen 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.670
 unspoken thousand 1637 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.780
 actually I have almost the same thing 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:53.520
 here I go back slowly I'll even 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:55.460
 better than the 1700 arrives a little bit more 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.699
 high but that's the correction 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:03.260
 gps correction i think we can 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.260
 zoom in I will try to do it alone 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:18.770
 I look a little here is currently good 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.759
 dyed on the bluetooth phone in 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.080
 real time 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:27.530

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.660
 aubenas sud-ouest aubenas online at dc 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 it's an autonomous system on which I 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.310
 am working on software 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.540
 exist on android I did not invent anything 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.540
 we can find the coordinates here 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.540
 here I am connected to a 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.360
 bluetooth device called f4 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:56.670
 I put my callsign it's a module 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:00.050
 like these it's the h60 5 a little 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.050
 bluetooth module that is very well done 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:09.530
 is so much I'm listening with a proxy 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.270
 simply rock in charge in addition 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.310
 here for the infos 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.910
 the software i will find you the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.780
 name I move slowly 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.250
 the balloon will not be long in arriving at 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.030
 11000 meters above sea level so I do not know 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.860
 not why but at 6 g and tramain then 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.860
 people only see trams 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.530
 I can see it 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.200
 we impose status on it I do not know 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.470
 too much we have but it's not necessarily 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 useful the most useful page so have 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:02.190
 possibly the trams nme has as well as 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:05.160
 the map here is very convenient for a 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.300
 use in portable decoder 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.010
 possibly who can be in the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.709
 car and we walk around the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.090
 car with the phone 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.090
