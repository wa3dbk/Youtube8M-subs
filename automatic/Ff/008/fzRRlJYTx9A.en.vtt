00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:19.552
 Now I see things for what they are. 

00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:24.505
 Arrived in Khaduras from the eastern lands of Sanctuarium 

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:26.994
 together with the forces of the Zakarum faith 

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:29.314
 Leoric settled in the village of Tristram. 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.859
 Victim of attempts at possession by Diablo 

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.954
 he went mad, starting to execute all those 

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:41.306
 who he believed guilty of treason, including his wife. 

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:46.954
 His knights confronted him and killed him. His last words 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.587
 they were a curse against his murderers. 

00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:56.467
 Thus, King Leoric resources like the Skeleton King. 

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:05.451
 Leoric can infest the battlefield even after death. 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.866
 Leoric's hallmark is Non-Death. When he is killed 

00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:16.122
 returns as a ghost, slows down enemies and reduces the duration of his death. 

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:21.099
 When he rises, Leoric appears where his ghost is. 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.259
 Leoric's first ability is Skeletal Strike. 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.242
 Inflicts massive damage and slows enemies in a wide front arc. 

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:33.666
 Damage to minions has doubled. 

00:01:34.553 --> 00:01:37.434
 In ghost form, Leoric can continue to use 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.563
 Skeletal Strike to slow down opponents without inflicting damage. 

00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:44.693
 With Hope's Subtraction Leoric grabs 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.715
 the soul of an enemy hero, inflicting periodic damage and healing. 

00:01:51.195 --> 00:01:55.315
 Meanwhile, he can continue to attack and use his abilities. 

00:01:55.585 --> 00:02:00.385
 As a ghost, the Subtraction of Hope diminishes the duration of his death. 

00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:04.585
 The last basic skill is Ghostly Path. 

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:08.394
 Becoming unstoppable and abandoning one's body 

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:11.418
 Leoric can move in the form of a spectrum for a short time. 

00:02:11.926 --> 00:02:16.905
 When the ability ends, his body appears in the spectrum position. 

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:21.081
 Tumulation is Leoric's first heroic option. 

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:27.073
 As for the Barrier from Diablo affix, it raises a grave in the target area 

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:29.921
 blocking heroes and enemy servants. 

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:35.626
 Finally, Marcia del Re Nero allows Leoric 

00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:39.233
 to proceed in a straight line, striking furiously 

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:45.177
 and damaging anything, caring for every enemy hero struck. 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.409
 Leoric's abilities allow him to control the space around him. 

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:57.729
 Try to optimize them to contribute to the fight even from the dead 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.802
 slowing down an enemy on the run, saving a retiring partner 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.393
 or contributing to a glorious team combo. 

00:03:09.393 --> 00:03:13.505
 In the early stages of a game, Leoric can rule the lanes. 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.498
 Skeletal Strike inflicts heavy damage on waves of minions 

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:21.385
 and his trait and his mobility allow him an aggressive style. 

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:25.865
 Remember that despite his death he does not put Leoric out 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.249
 still gives the opponents full experience for a kill. 

00:03:30.652 --> 00:03:35.129
 Leoric excels on battlefields that include control of an area. 

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:39.665
 In the early stages of a game in the Cursed Valley, for example 

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:43.577
 it exploits its ability to sustain the damage of the enemies and to disturb them. 

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:47.642
 After death, Leoric can position himself strategically 

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:50.946
 to resurrect and ensure his team the tribute. 

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:56.050
 March of the Black King excels in the destruction of enemies 

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:58.453
 grouped and with poor mobility. 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.233
 But be careful: the most agile enemies can easily avoid 

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:06.874
 this blow and punish Leoric, if his blows are not well directed. 

00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:11.505
 Tumulation is excellent for ensuring the killing. 

00:04:12.475 --> 00:04:15.033
 When enemies try to escape from a fight 

00:04:15.058 --> 00:04:18.665
 block them and allow your allies to hit them. 

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.744
 Timing and accuracy are essential to optimize the use of this skill 

00:04:22.778 --> 00:04:27.505
 so be cautious or you could condemn your partner. 

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:35.833
 I am the Skeleton King. Let the massacre begin. 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.449
