traveling<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.840> way<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> back<00:00:22.680> of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
traveling all the way from the back of

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
traveling all the way from the back of
her<00:00:23.189> baby<00:00:23.789> suite<00:00:24.269> all<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.500> way<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
her baby suite all the way up to the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.189 
her baby suite all the way up to the
front<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> room<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.300> take<00:00:27.510> her<00:00:27.720> bottle

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
front of the room to take her bottle

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.890 
front of the room to take her bottle
through<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> front<00:00:29.340> from<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> keeper<00:00:30.179> so

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
through the front from a keeper so

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
through the front from a keeper so
that's<00:00:31.140> an<00:00:31.289> important<00:00:31.830> step<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.369> GLaDOS

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that's an important step for GLaDOS

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370 
that's an important step for GLaDOS
before<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.450> ever<00:00:33.600> put<00:00:33.870> her<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
before we can ever put her in with a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.110 
before we can ever put her in with a
surrogate<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.130> she's<00:00:35.370> doing<00:00:35.850> quite<00:00:36.059> well

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
surrogate and she's doing quite well

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.510 
surrogate and she's doing quite well
with<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:36.989> point<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.950> about<00:00:38.160> every

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
with that at this point just about every

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.299 
with that at this point just about every
model<00:00:38.910> we<00:00:39.329> bring<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.750> her<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.890> bring<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
model we bring to her now we bring it to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.160 
model we bring to her now we bring it to
her<00:00:41.520> from<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.760> front<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> room<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:45.170> she

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
her from the front of the room but she

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
her from the front of the room but she
travels<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.100> from<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> back<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
travels all the way from the back and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.490 
travels all the way from the back and
comes<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> front<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.200> going

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
comes up to the front so that's going

00:00:49.500 --> 00:01:10.110 
comes up to the front so that's going
really<00:00:49.710> well

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:18.080 

but<00:01:10.660> it's<00:01:10.900> hard<00:01:11.320> being

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 

we've<00:01:18.659> hit<00:01:18.840> another<00:01:19.110> milestone<00:01:19.530> with

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
we've hit another milestone with

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.030 
we've hit another milestone with
Gladys's<00:01:20.909> gorilla<00:01:21.689> fication<00:01:22.079> and<00:01:22.560> that's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
Gladys's gorilla fication and that's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.889 
Gladys's gorilla fication and that's
where<00:01:23.399> we're<00:01:23.790> taking<00:01:24.000> her<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.570> into<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
where we're taking her out into the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:47.149 
where we're taking her out into the
gorilla<00:01:25.380> habitat<00:01:25.680> now<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.950> oh<00:01:31.880> my<00:01:46.159> we

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
gorilla habitat now you think oh my we

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.460 
gorilla habitat now you think oh my we
did<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> couple<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.360> days<00:01:48.570> once<00:01:49.289> she

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
did that for a couple of days once she

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.870 
did that for a couple of days once she
gets<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.190> comfortable<00:01:50.580> out<00:01:50.850> here

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.930 
the feel of the dirt initially she was a
little<00:03:02.260> nervous<00:03:02.709> about<00:03:02.859> that<00:03:03.190> texture<00:03:03.730> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
little nervous about that texture so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.539 
little nervous about that texture so
she's<00:03:04.180> kind<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.810> been<00:03:04.959> staying<00:03:05.410> on<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.859> furs<00:03:06.340> a

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
she's kind of been staying on the furs a

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.309 
she's kind of been staying on the furs a
little<00:03:06.849> bit<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:07.540> she'll<00:03:07.750> get<00:03:07.900> more<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.260> more

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
little bit but she'll get more and more

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.080 
little bit but she'll get more and more
used<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:08.920> as<00:03:09.129> we<00:03:09.250> do<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.579> more<00:03:09.819> and<00:03:09.940> more

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
used to that as we do it more and more

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.479 
used to that as we do it more and more
so<00:03:10.359> going<00:03:10.810> extremely<00:03:11.410> well<00:03:11.769> with<00:03:11.950> Gladys<00:03:12.340> at

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489
