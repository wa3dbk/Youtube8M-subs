00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
talk about is the Gatorade water bottle
and<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.580> Gatorade<00:03:18.030> water<00:03:18.239> bottle<00:03:18.600> or<00:03:18.750> just

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and the Gatorade water bottle or just

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.560 
and the Gatorade water bottle or just
regular<00:03:19.320> water<00:03:19.470> bottle<00:03:19.800> slot<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.220> um<00:03:20.489> as<00:03:20.910> you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
regular water bottle slot so um as you

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.240 
regular water bottle slot so um as you
can<00:03:21.630> see<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.900> fits<00:03:22.020> really<00:03:22.200> nicely<00:03:22.500> um<00:03:22.920> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
can see it fits really nicely um the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.650 
can see it fits really nicely um the
only<00:03:23.370> downside<00:03:23.790> about<00:03:23.820> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
only downside about this is the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.620 
only downside about this is the
insulated<00:03:25.650> part<00:03:25.890> right<00:03:26.040> here<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:27.420> water

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
insulated part right here on the water

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.630 
insulated part right here on the water
bottle<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.080> think<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.470> no<00:03:28.739> matter<00:03:28.920> what<00:03:29.430> water

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
bottle I think that no matter what water

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.250 
bottle I think that no matter what water
bottle<00:03:29.910> or<00:03:30.090> anything<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:31.020> there

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
bottle or anything you have in there

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.009 
bottle or anything you have in there
well<00:03:31.709> actually<00:03:31.860> like<00:03:32.540> as<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.840> see<00:03:33.930> it

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
well actually like as you can see it

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.930 
well actually like as you can see it
kind<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.200> juts<00:03:34.440> into<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.830> which<00:03:35.070> makes<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.850> so

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
kind of juts into this which makes it so

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.210 
kind of juts into this which makes it so
you<00:03:36.030> can't<00:03:36.090> put<00:03:36.480> mine<00:03:37.170> as<00:03:37.350> much<00:03:37.620> stuff<00:03:37.980> as<00:03:38.100> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
you can't put mine as much stuff as you

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.460

compartment has Jordan Superfly threes I

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.870 
compartment has Jordan Superfly threes I
think<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:27.050> we're<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.500> there<00:04:27.770> these<00:04:28.730> are

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
think that we're in there these are

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.630 
think that we're in there these are
pretty<00:04:29.720> nice<00:04:29.900> shoes<00:04:30.230> they're<00:04:30.830> brand<00:04:31.550> new

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
pretty nice shoes they're brand new

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.600 
pretty nice shoes they're brand new
basically<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.780> as<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.620> can<00:04:33.740> see<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.130> the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
basically and as you can see the the

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.460 
basically and as you can see the the
ball<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.240> basketball<00:04:35.630> actually<00:04:36.320> does

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
ball the basketball actually does

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.800 
ball the basketball actually does
jutting<00:04:36.830> edge<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.400> lot<00:04:37.640> actually<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:38.330> it's<00:04:38.480> kind

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
jutting edge a lot actually so it's kind

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.410 
jutting edge a lot actually so it's kind
of<00:04:38.840> difficult<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.320> put<00:04:39.470> these<00:04:39.620> shoes<00:04:39.650> in<00:04:40.040> here

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
of difficult to put these shoes in here

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
of difficult to put these shoes in here
I'm<00:04:41.420> not<00:04:41.450> going<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.750> put<00:04:41.870> them<00:04:41.990> back<00:04:42.110> in<00:04:42.290> here

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
I'm not going to put them back in here

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.010 
I'm not going to put them back in here
it<00:04:42.560> will<00:04:42.650> probably<00:04:43.190> take<00:04:43.310> me<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.460> while<00:04:43.720> but<00:04:44.720> as

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
it will probably take me a while but as

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.180 
it will probably take me a while but as
you<00:04:45.200> can<00:04:45.290> see<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.560> does<00:04:45.740> stret<00:04:45.950> in<00:04:46.070> there

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
you can see it does stret in there

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.290 
you can see it does stret in there
that's<00:04:46.310> one<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.610> our<00:04:46.730> downsides
