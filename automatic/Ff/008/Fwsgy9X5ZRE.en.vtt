00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 it was a few months 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.530
 a scuffle 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.530
 why 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 to make 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.290
 this is a 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.290
 that red card was with the previous horses 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 it has been said for 36 years 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.350
 what we look at first 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.520
 front teeth 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.600
 then it is already 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 a lot that is all still has 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 what you do see is that bad 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.620
 the closure is very crooked 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 at the top right are the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.440
 pandev delange as above left indicates this 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.150
 one-sided 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
 unilateral ranges of mountains 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.170
 look in the mouth 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 6 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.680
 psv 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.950
 rinse mouth with those older horses 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.579
 you have because there are often missing teeth 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.880
 put that stuffed more often with 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880
 all leftover food 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.380
 that comes from the pasture on the terraces remains of a ball on the ground 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 something up 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 those are now further 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.779
 go in the mouth then 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.900
 lacking various zip elements 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.339
 me up 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.529
 I do think it is incredibly large to harvest the remaining ones 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:27.559
 on 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.159
 in racing upstairs choose anyway here and choose 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.829
 In addition, it is true that 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.319
 the by the deviating calle probably originated by it 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.950
 missing because of multiple molars with this horse are already missing multiple molars 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.979
 there are also terribly high points on these choices 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.829
 and I do not know if it is good to portray but 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.790
 in the middle choose that is still in it has such points as well 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.239
 the cheek mucosa damaged 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.730
 by feeling over the cheek mucosa I actually feel a crater in it 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.739
 sit caused that point on who chooses this is a horse that just 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.739
 absolutely none 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.879
 function has more with regard to the grinding of the vehicle this is purely on a lake 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.340
 cold what the horse can still do a bit, this is boosted with demolition otherwise 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.299
 would that 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.299
 Even thinner, his condition is not great though 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.099
 with this horse it is still possible to get rid of it, also in reasonable condition 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.079
 hold 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.949
 with this horse deviations are such that 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.249
 to improve the old function 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.469
 the only thing i know is 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.119
 but I meant that is sharp points 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.269
 have been rejected hoping that way 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.609
 the damage in the mouth in the mouth and in the mucous membrane of the mouth remains limited 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.609
 and that he will in any case be less affected by this 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 anp 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.599
 These extreme points can actually only arise because of various 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.390
 places are missing 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.809
 and the opposite molars can continue to grow freely 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.770
 therefore you get that extreme 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 height changes to choose between 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.740
 sharp edges do not leave 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.740
 the sharpest points are gone and I can't do much more for that time 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.770
