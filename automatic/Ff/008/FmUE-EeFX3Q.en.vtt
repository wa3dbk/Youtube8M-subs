00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.939
 Good afternoon, or good afternoon to everyone. 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 to mtv video this time day 17 of 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:38.949
 August 2012 will present a new 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:43.989
 theme that is the introduction of 4g technology 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:49.600
 of mobile telephony because it is the network 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:53.199
 4g of cellular telephony the 4g network is a 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.280
 new telecommunications telecinco network in 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.309
 Brazil 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.370
 in mobile telephony in practice is a 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.210
 evolution of current 3G network is in 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:09.610
 operation and which received the technician's mind 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.980
 the name of lt long term evolution 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.850
 as can be seen in the diagram that 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.850
 we are showing now 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:40.070
 the 4g network technology was designed 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 to work with the ip protocol 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.870
 Internet protocol that facilitates 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.970
 communication between different 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.980
 electronic devices such as 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.700
 example smartphone tablets and tablets 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.670
 computer modems or several 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.380
 electronic devices and that in 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.550
 already exists technology 4G technology 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.970
 4g 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.060
 it is already known in the world in about 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.290
 more than 50 countries it is already deployed 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.090
 north america europe middle east 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.840
 and asia 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.730
 many countries already have this installed 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.970
 4g that is working and what are the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.030
 advantages of the 4g network 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.860
 looks the main advantage is a 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.930
 communication at the speed of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.680
 data communication increases 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.380
 that significantly for example 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.360
 theoretically the reception of the antenna to the 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.360
 device can reach the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.760
 speed of 100 megabits per second and 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.160
 from cell to antenna can reach the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.950
 half of that value is 50 megabits 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.690
 per second theoretically however the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.810
 operating companies will work with 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.700
 lower rates or speeds that right 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.060
 the world is varying between is 5 megabits 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.980
 up to 12 megabits from the antenna to 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.250
 device or a signal 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.989
 downlink and uplink half that value 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.980
 which is going to be between 2 or 6 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.380
 megabits per second plus frequency goes 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.750
 to operate the 4g network in brazil 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.500
 the government has set for the network 4g 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.440
 frequency of 2.5 ghz in the areas 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.160
 the city is not the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.700
 frequency of 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.650
 450 megahertz for rural areas 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.950
 these frequencies have been defined in the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.510
 auction of June 12, 2012 and where 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:51.060
 It will be deployed the network 4g Union 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.190
 anatel held on June 12 th 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.630
 the license of the frequencies to a 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.040
 investment by companies 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.100
 operators 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.890
 together with the schedule to meet 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.390
 sporting events are not foreseen 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.160
 for 2013 and 2014 and 2016 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.750
 let's look at and on the schedule that was 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.750
 defined by anatel 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.220
 very well 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.300
 the deployment schedule as you can 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.030
 to be seen in it is too short 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.210
 then it is due to this schedule that we 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.970
 we are seeing what is coming 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.680
 that the operating company has to do the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.500
 its project of hiring the 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.450
 equipment and this but a project and does 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.560
 the hiring because that the company 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.590
 operator 2 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.510
 the manufacturer does not have to make the 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.160
 orders abroad most of the 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.620
 equipment is produced outside the 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.630
 Brazil has to make say orders 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.920
 nathasha let's say a slot for the 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.250
 right manufacturing 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.100
 then has the delivery and after the 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.590
 installation of these equip- 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.340
 3ยบ the operating company has to make the 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.030
 acceptance and test equipment 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.460
 installed as well as put into operation 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.810
 Very well, then, to do all this with 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.410
 quality is not 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.410
 look calmly you would need the 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.420
 less than nine to 12 months 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.520
 Okay to do it quietly if 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.150
 you have a very very short deadline 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.640
 increases the cost and the quality falls 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.980
 It is important to do it in peace and 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.590
 necessary time would be what at least 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.680
 from nine to 12 months 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.480
 from hiring to the commissioning 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.120
 equipment operation is that you 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.000
 is referring to the first step 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.090
 the first step is exactly the one that 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.780
 is scheduled for April April 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.390
 2003 and 2003 exactly sometimes 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.540
 playing grass is short and we think that 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:13.320
 delay should occur yes 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:16.140
 this is our view now the null in the 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.640
 next video recording 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.430
 continuing this video here we go 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.350
 talk about our revenge practically 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.410
 position with them the implantation of 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.680
 4g network and also what are the 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.139
 inter recommendations was the old 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.039
 Many thanks for your 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.889
 explanation and forced to 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:39.729
 everyone watching in this video 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.729
 thank you
