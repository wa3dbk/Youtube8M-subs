years<00:00:01.860> ago<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.490> dug<00:00:03.060> out<00:00:03.270> with<00:00:03.300> some<00:00:03.659> friends

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
years ago I dug out with some friends

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.579 
years ago I dug out with some friends
some<00:00:05.160> Bramley<00:00:05.670> trees<00:00:06.000> which<00:00:06.330> were<00:00:06.440> just<00:00:07.440> not

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
some Bramley trees which were just not

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.259 
some Bramley trees which were just not
working<00:00:07.980> out<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.610> reasons<00:00:09.000> I've<00:00:09.120> written

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
working out for reasons I've written

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.629 
working out for reasons I've written
elsewhere<00:00:09.570> employed<00:00:10.559> some<00:00:10.800> pairs<00:00:11.040> instead

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
elsewhere employed some pairs instead

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.539 
elsewhere employed some pairs instead
these<00:00:12.179> were<00:00:12.360> very<00:00:12.509> young<00:00:12.840> pear<00:00:13.380> trees<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
these were very young pear trees and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.109 
these were very young pear trees and
they<00:00:14.700> were<00:00:14.759> planted<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.109> winter<00:00:16.680> before<00:00:17.369> last

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
they were planted the winter before last

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.060 
they were planted the winter before last
winter<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.080> they<00:00:19.230> really<00:00:19.410> don't<00:00:19.500> quite<00:00:19.770> well

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
winter and they really don't quite well

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310 
winter and they really don't quite well
these<00:00:21.029> brushes<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.779> quite<00:00:21.960> upright

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
these brushes are going quite upright

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.410 
these brushes are going quite upright
but<00:00:22.710> next<00:00:23.189> year<00:00:23.580> they're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.060> get<00:00:24.210> some

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
but next year they're going to get some

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.640 
but next year they're going to get some
fruit<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.750> them<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.990> hope<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:25.500> they've

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
fruit on them I hope because they've

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.599 
fruit on them I hope because they've
matured<00:00:25.890> lots<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.730> fruit<00:00:27.539> buds<00:00:28.369> even<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.460> this

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
matured lots of fruit buds even on this

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.160 
matured lots of fruit buds even on this
current<00:00:30.029> year's<00:00:30.210> Ward<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.929> load

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
current year's Ward and there's a load

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.850 
current year's Ward and there's a load
of<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.679> really<00:00:32.579> good<00:00:32.940> fruit<00:00:33.710> systems<00:00:34.710> use

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
of really really good fruit systems use

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
of really really good fruit systems use
it<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> fruit<00:00:35.489> spur<00:00:36.270> there<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.870> fruit

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
it as a fruit spur there there's a fruit

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.540 
it as a fruit spur there there's a fruit
spur<00:00:37.410> there<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.160> what's<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> happen

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
spur there so what's going to happen

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
spur there so what's going to happen
next<00:00:38.910> year<00:00:39.090> these<00:00:39.329> very<00:00:39.840> upright<00:00:40.140> branches

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
next year these very upright branches

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.979 
next year these very upright branches
though<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> should<00:00:41.730> hopefully<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.600> some<00:00:42.750> fruit

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
though I should hopefully get some fruit

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.690 
though I should hopefully get some fruit
on<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> fruit<00:00:44.160> will<00:00:44.309> pull<00:00:44.520> them

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
on them the way the fruit will pull them

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
on them the way the fruit will pull them
down<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.000> set<00:00:45.570> them<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.559> suitable

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
down and set them in a more suitable

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
down and set them in a more suitable
position<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.610> sound<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
position so that sound are going to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.060 
position so that sound are going to
become<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:49.200> these<00:00:49.350> sort<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> pyramids

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
become because these sort of pyramids

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.330 
become because these sort of pyramids
and<00:00:50.300> I<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.690> advise<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> first<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and I do advise in the first and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.529 
and I do advise in the first and
probably<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.610> second<00:00:54.000> year<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> planting<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
probably the second year of planting a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.299 
probably the second year of planting a
new<00:00:54.570> tree<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> good<00:00:55.680> thing<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> take<00:00:56.070> all

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
new tree it's a good thing to take all

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.760 
new tree it's a good thing to take all
the<00:00:56.430> fruit<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.960> allow<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.199> tree<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.590> put

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the fruit off to allow the tree to put

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.619 
the fruit off to allow the tree to put
its<00:00:58.920> energy<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.430> growth<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.390> did

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
its energy into growth but we did

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.490 
its energy into growth but we did
overlook<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.469> few<00:01:01.800> pairs<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.879> here's<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
overlook a few pairs and here's a

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.539 
overlook a few pairs and here's a
conference<00:01:04.500> pair<00:01:05.240> just<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> show<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.320> that

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
conference pair just to show you that

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.120 
conference pair just to show you that
you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:09.060> fruit<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> second<00:01:10.860> year

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you can get fruit in the second year

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.130 
you can get fruit in the second year
after<00:01:11.520> planting<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.689> tree<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.210> III<00:01:15.210> cut<00:01:15.900> loads

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
after planting a tree and III cut loads

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.600 
after planting a tree and III cut loads
and<00:01:16.290> loads<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> loads<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.830> fruit<00:01:17.100> buds<00:01:17.250> off<00:01:17.460> we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and loads and loads of fruit buds off we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
and loads and loads of fruit buds off we
could<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.880> carried<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.330> reasonably<00:01:18.930> good

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
could have carried a reasonably good

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
could have carried a reasonably good
crop<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:20.009> absolutely<00:01:20.310> determined<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
crop if you're absolutely determined to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
crop if you're absolutely determined to
get<00:01:21.330> through<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> second<00:01:22.229> year<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.530> really

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
get through in the second year I really

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.050 
get through in the second year I really
cannot<00:01:23.040> recommend<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.580> try<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.000> in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
cannot recommend you try and do it in

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.289 
cannot recommend you try and do it in
first<00:01:24.360> year<00:01:24.659> then<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> support<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
first year then if you support that and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.569 
first year then if you support that and
support<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> tree<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.950> put<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> build<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> big

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
support the tree they put a build a big

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.399 
support the tree they put a build a big
stake<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.180> hold<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> hold<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> fruit<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.259> I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
stake up and hold it hold the fruit up I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.310 
stake up and hold it hold the fruit up I
hold<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> branches<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.450> irrigate<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
hold the branches up and irrigate it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.810 
hold the branches up and irrigate it
then<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.619> maybe<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.430> where

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
then you maybe can do it but where

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.130 
then you maybe can do it but where
there's<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> couple<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.329> these<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.600> us<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.930> few

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
there's a couple of these with us a few

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.630 
there's a couple of these with us a few
on<00:01:37.290> next<00:01:38.009> year<00:01:38.130> we're<00:01:38.250> hoping<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> get

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
on next year we're hoping to get

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.120 
on next year we're hoping to get
reasonably<00:01:39.030> decent<00:01:39.240> amounts<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
reasonably decent amounts so just to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.749 
reasonably decent amounts so just to
write<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> point<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.490> unless<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
write a point that you know unless you

flavor is good I can see another one
there<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.700> it's<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.910> very<00:02:29.090> reliable<00:02:29.390> pair<00:02:29.960> it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
there but it's a very reliable pair it

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.350 
there but it's a very reliable pair it
will<00:02:30.320> manage<00:02:30.620> in<00:02:30.980> conditions<00:02:31.940> which<00:02:32.060> are<00:02:32.210> not
