00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hey people because of you, viacom is back 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.299
 here on youtube we are back on 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.630
 start new video and forth 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.969
 who would have thought the tfh efsm am 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.370
 While start playing not all 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.520
 until tomorrow comes out to property for it 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.500
 but people honestly you want that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.010
 tough gangster in front of the corner 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 his 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.890
 then you are exactly right here 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.170
 I always wanted to introduce myself here 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.680
 which has placed itself on the legs and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 Although a gts crew and although the lost 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.430
 underdog redevelops the possibility here 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 to be at the start as you can see 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.910
 we already have a few things with us here 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.579
 at the start, for example, the t-shirt design 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 I arrested the rebels here 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.550
 I honestly do not know if you are 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.379
 later in the later course own 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.760
 he may want to insert symbols 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.320
 the game already gambled on the console 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 You can deny that saying 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.020
 enroll under the comments ob 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.449
 that will be so you can do it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.680
 different challenges then 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.000
 complete accordingly and with it 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.100
 just as things as here for example 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.780
 the color for cars or crew 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.129
 We switch challenges free 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.410
 of course, currently no points 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.570
 because the game is not out at all 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.619
 all this here on ps3 law man 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.119
 can xbox 360 xbox and the ps4 as well as ps3 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.070
 in the select but currently, of course 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.080
 not yet pc was not the whole thing 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.420
 release of our motto here of course 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.369
 keep our goal always in the goal 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.869
 At the moment we see six members of a couple 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.180
 People already made it outside 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.030
 my moderator the group 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.939
 to search accordingly to find and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.960
 then enter there too because there is 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.920
 currently no limit there are none 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.900
 restriction to get in there everyone 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.900
 anyone can enter the group 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.119
 be in the crew with us and start 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.200
 You can take a quick look at this 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.939
 when we look at the administration 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.649
 We currently have six members 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.770
 Of course you can do it here like you 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.920
 maybe knows from the social club of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.990
 rockstar here different ranks more 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.549
 or less to the people and to order 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.899
 of course my presenter has the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.420
 geckos with the start know if it is there 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.399
 and you have it currently further 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.770
 we still counter the status of his 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.899
 already done and will be here 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 different possibilities just that 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.909
 whole people then with a start too 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.079
 bring 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.929
 of course the possibility for me 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.510
 Maybe they will try ours 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.420
 Of course that's our crude hectare 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.829
 nico color is our red and here too 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.180
 the different titles are different 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.560
 after which level man had mine 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.730
 Cruise has different ranks 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.170
 they can do that a bit more 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.140
 to be adjusted when going down lonely 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.409
 wolf check in easter fanboy underdog good 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.700
 underdog party can be without zombie killer 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.040
 professional army handstand profi and am 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.060
 finish the lost boy we have here 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.379
 he also the possibility of either 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.269
 action 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.579
 I'm really on the bird 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.260
 was very classic but hey 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.909
 yes we just take it 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.000
 neat the middle finger first 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.400
 we show in the state namely as rebels 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.950
 as I said here as a symbol and you can 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.629
 its just people doing this group 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.829
 I'm looking for the whole 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.760
 left and again down in the 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.139
 wrap description 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.060
 but it is also lost up here 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:59.180
 underscored underdogs in the social 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.040
 media in the social club of rockstar 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.329
 the man at the start when you go to cruz 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 I have the different cruise 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.169
 but this is where underdogs get lost if they are whole 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.389
 just find there you can join 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.560
 you do not have any as I said 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.730
 restriction to get there 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.959
 Maybe over time 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.699
 maybe another one too 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.419
 come if we should be too many 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.739
 I do not know yet how many people 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.590
 are feasible but here you see 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.949
 here at the one's forces 974 people on 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.540
 we start at 974 people 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.069
 record each case so synonymous 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.079
 hold on people are with you 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.449
 tomorrow at 1 o'clock in the night instead of the 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.609
 ag 25 I would probably be there now 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:33.829
 not streaming 108 because the servers 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.359
 but these will crashing me first 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.470
 I think I will start relatively early 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.859
 but still in the course of today 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.509
 day came probably evening after 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.639
 my motto today is my live stream 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:46.430
 I will still announce a lot of monday 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.900
 when will tomorrow be member states? 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.549
 but will now will be relatively early 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.310
 most likely because I just 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.840
 I have to get up early and myself 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.889
 then just put it can people 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.060
 in that sense, instead of tomorrow the 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.560
 comments what you think of the action 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.229
 does we act with both others? 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.949
 start as a crew if he takes the tf off and on 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.209
 if you have the game 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.699
 I have a look with mine 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.099
 knee partner.com after the link to it 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.509
 below in the video description and with 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.979
 you get rid of the kot then 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.519
 three percent discount so just look 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.139
 over 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.639
 there's definitely cool 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.019
 cheap top games i'm looking forward to 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.989
