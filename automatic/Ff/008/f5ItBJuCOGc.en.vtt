00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
defending his life in sin and pretty

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.170

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
life and then the day he should be

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.530 
life and then the day he should be
charged<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:05.760> because<00:04:06.060> that's<00:04:06.239> pretty

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
charged with this because that's pretty

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.120 
charged with this because that's pretty
much<00:04:06.720> what<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.230> would<00:04:07.530> think<00:04:07.709> would<00:04:07.920> happen

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
much what I would think would happen

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.070 
much what I would think would happen
that<00:04:09.000> seems<00:04:09.300> like<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.570> most<00:04:09.690> realistic

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
that seems like the most realistic

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.960 
that seems like the most realistic
scenario<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:11.010> this<00:04:11.280> whole<00:04:11.489> thing<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.790> mean

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
scenario in this whole thing I mean

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.610 
scenario in this whole thing I mean
people<00:04:12.300> doing<00:04:12.690> rounds<00:04:13.020> about<00:04:13.260> people

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
but a should get second-degree

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.330 
but a should get second-degree
manslaughter<00:04:17.880> that's<00:04:18.180> what<00:04:18.330> he<00:04:18.419> should<00:04:18.630> get

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
manslaughter that's what he should get

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.890 
manslaughter that's what he should get
