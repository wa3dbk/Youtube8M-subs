00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
so Moss stitch is really fun and renders

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.930 
so Moss stitch is really fun and renders
a<00:00:08.429> really<00:00:09.330> beautiful<00:00:10.019> like<00:00:10.650> deeply<00:00:11.340> textured

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
a really beautiful like deeply textured

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.089 
a really beautiful like deeply textured
fabric<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.870> looks<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.320> lot<00:00:13.530> more<00:00:13.679> complicated

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
fabric that looks a lot more complicated

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.400 
fabric that looks a lot more complicated
than<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.540> does<00:00:15.660> require<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.049> little

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
than it is but it does require a little

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
than it is but it does require a little
bit<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.619> explaining<00:00:16.940> so<00:00:18.740> essentially<00:00:19.740> what

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
bit of explaining so essentially what

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.609 
bit of explaining so essentially what
we're<00:00:20.580> doing<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:21.119> knit<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:22.020> purl<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.410> knit

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
we're doing is knit one purl one knit

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.679 
we're doing is knit one purl one knit
one<00:00:23.010> purl<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.880> way<00:00:24.000> across<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
one purl one all the way across and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.870 
one purl one all the way across and
we're<00:00:25.320> gonna<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.590> doing<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.130> two<00:00:26.519> rows

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
we're gonna be doing it for two rows

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.179 
we're gonna be doing it for two rows
high<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.689> time<00:00:27.930> instead<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
high this time instead of one like a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.040 
high this time instead of one like a
regular<00:00:29.369> seed<00:00:29.849> stitch<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:30.810> you've<00:00:30.929> ever

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
regular seed stitch so if you've ever

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.630 
regular seed stitch so if you've ever
worked<00:00:31.320> seed<00:00:31.710> stitch<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.189> know<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.520> you've

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
worked seed stitch you know that you've

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.549 
worked seed stitch you know that you've
switched<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.270> pattern<00:00:33.630> every<00:00:34.050> single<00:00:34.410> row

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
switched your pattern every single row

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.889 
switched your pattern every single row
and<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.550> moss<00:00:35.760> stitch<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.450> sort<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and in moss stitch it's sort of like a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.530 
and in moss stitch it's sort of like a
double<00:00:37.230> high<00:00:37.559> seed<00:00:37.920> stitch<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.210> can

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
double high seed stitch so if you can

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.920 
double high seed stitch so if you can
look<00:00:39.780> only<00:00:40.170> at<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.920> top<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.520> rows<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.360> this

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
look only at the top two rows of this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.040 
look only at the top two rows of this
Moss<00:00:43.230> stitch<00:00:43.440> sample<00:00:43.980> you'll<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.899> that<00:00:45.899> I've

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
Moss stitch sample you'll see that I've

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.950 
Moss stitch sample you'll see that I've
got<00:00:46.230> knit<00:00:46.590> stacked<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.070> top<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.309> knits<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
got knit stacked on top of knits and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.529 
got knit stacked on top of knits and
purl<00:00:48.960> stacked<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> top<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.770> pearls<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
purl stacked on top of pearls so if you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.380 
purl stacked on top of pearls so if you
can<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:52.020> see<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:53.039> top<00:00:53.129> portion<00:00:53.879> you'll

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
can just see the very top portion you'll

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.069 
can just see the very top portion you'll
see<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.809> looks<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.559> by<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:55.980> ribbing

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
see what looks like one by one ribbing

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
see what looks like one by one ribbing
however<00:00:58.079> after<00:00:58.350> those<00:00:58.890> two<00:00:59.190> rows<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.579> been

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
however after those two rows have been

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389 
however after those two rows have been
achieved<00:01:00.120> we're<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.289> switch<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
achieved we're going to switch the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.670 
achieved we're going to switch the
pattern<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.629> seed<00:01:03.870> stitch<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
pattern just like in seed stitch to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.310 
pattern just like in seed stitch to
begin<00:01:04.979> our<00:01:05.100> checkerboard<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.810> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
begin our checkerboard so here I have a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
begin our checkerboard so here I have a
knit<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.920> top<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> knit<00:01:08.580> which<00:01:09.150> means<00:01:09.390> it's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
knit on top of a knit which means it's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
knit on top of a knit which means it's
time<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.020> switch<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> pattern<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
time to switch the pattern I'm going to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.840 
time to switch the pattern I'm going to
be<00:01:12.180> purling<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.229> top<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.100> those<00:01:14.189> knits<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
be purling now on top of those knits and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.990 
be purling now on top of those knits and
knitting<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:16.020> top<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.470> those<00:01:16.560> pearls<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.880> I'm

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
knitting on top of those pearls so I'm

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.390 
knitting on top of those pearls so I'm
going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> work<00:01:18.630> knit<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.439> purl<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:19.770> across

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
going to work knit one purl one across

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.170 
going to work knit one purl one across
this<00:01:20.729> row<00:01:22.159> remembering<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.369> switch<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.939> yarn

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
this row remembering to switch my yarn

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.899 
this row remembering to switch my yarn
every<00:01:24.930> single<00:01:25.259> time<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.549> doing<00:01:26.580> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
every single time so what I'm doing is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.350 
every single time so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:27.090> knitting<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> moving<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> yarn<00:01:29.360> purling

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
I'm knitting and moving the yarn purling

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.050 
I'm knitting and moving the yarn purling
and<00:01:30.570> moving<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> yarn<00:01:32.570> I'm<00:01:33.570> going<00:01:34.049> fast<00:01:35.060> just

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and moving the yarn I'm going fast just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.100 
and moving the yarn I'm going fast just
so<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> end<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> row<00:01:39.110> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so we can get to the end of the row so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.899 
so we can get to the end of the row so
what<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:40.380> doing<00:01:40.619> right<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.400> breaking

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
what I'm doing right now is I'm breaking

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.100 
what I'm doing right now is I'm breaking
the<00:01:42.030> pattern<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.600> had<00:01:42.810> established

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the pattern that I had established

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.530 
the pattern that I had established
previously<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.520> last<00:01:44.729> two<00:01:44.909> rows<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
previously on the last two rows but

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.289 
previously on the last two rows but
we're<00:01:45.720> setting<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> new<00:01:46.619> pattern<00:01:47.299> for

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
we're setting up the new pattern for

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.230 
we're setting up the new pattern for
these<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.200> row<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.060> come

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
these for this row and the one to come

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.050 
these for this row and the one to come
after<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.950> switching<00:01:53.280> our<00:01:53.520> pattern<00:01:53.850> after

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
after it so switching our pattern after

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.350 
after it so switching our pattern after
every<00:01:54.899> other<00:01:55.170> row<00:01:55.640> so<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.790> I've<00:01:57.030> worked

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
every other row so now I've worked

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.740 
every other row so now I've worked
across<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> see<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.390> above<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
across and you can see that above the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.200 
across and you can see that above the
two<00:02:00.960> knit<00:02:01.560> stitches<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> purl<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
two knit stitches I now have a purl and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.450 
two knit stitches I now have a purl and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
above the two purl stitches I now have a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.839 
above the two purl stitches I now have a
knit<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.110> work<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> back<00:02:07.700> this<00:02:08.700> is

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
knit so when we work the back this is

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.380 
knit so when we work the back this is
where<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.149> get<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.300> put<00:02:09.629> in

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
where we get to put in

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.710 
where we get to put in
that<00:02:10.690> second<00:02:11.170> row<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:12.610> time<00:02:12.940> because

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
that second row and this time because

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.960 
that second row and this time because
we're<00:02:13.900> stacking<00:02:14.200> them<00:02:14.560> for<00:02:14.830> two<00:02:14.980> rows<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.790> get

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
we're stacking them for two rows we get

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.180 
we're stacking them for two rows we get
to<00:02:16.180> what<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.569> call<00:02:16.930> knit<00:02:17.380> um<00:02:17.500> as<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.860> see<00:02:18.069> them

to what I call knit um as you see them
so<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.880> looks<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.300> purl

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
so that looks like a purl

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.480
