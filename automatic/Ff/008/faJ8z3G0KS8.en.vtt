00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.779
 before starting this tutorial I 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 would like to thank you first 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.449
 after graduation 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.280
 frankly it made me great pleasure to 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.760
 see that you liked the work that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.320
 I was able to do 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.090
 so frankly thank you very much for 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 all those nice comments that got me 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 really touched that really made me 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.640
 very pleased to see that a lot of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.800
 people supported me and before the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.269
 diploma and after thank you very much 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.860
 now I'm on vacation 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.540
 and I can enjoy it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 we know that lately I have not 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.449
 does a lot of tutorials since I 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.800
 went to london and then I got 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.019
 some little worries that do not have 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.790
 allowed to do so for the moment I 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.890
 will try to continue time in 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.869
 time do so once a week 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.189
 then I will try to keep 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.110
 the rhythm during the holidays 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.000
 which may not be possible given 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.890
 that I will work then I risk 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.970
 to leave at certain times but do not 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.830
 do not worry, there will always be 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.140
 some tutorials from time to time because I 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.369
 do not expect to stop chewing today 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.259
 I decided to make you a little 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.659
 sewing tutorial that's going to be rather 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.210
 simple I decided to show how 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.159
 create envelope envelopes where it's going 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.299
 to be very easy to achieve and in a 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.200
 first time I want to show the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.200
 accessories we will use 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.560
 as it's been more than a week since 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.570
 I did not post tutorial I wanted 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.280
 resume sewing by doing something 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.350
 simple thing so by a garment 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.540
 but rather a little accessory that goes 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.700
 to be perfect for the summer which is very 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.440
 feminine you will see I explain to you 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.450
 step by step there should not be any 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.540
 big difficulties according to this tutorial 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.370
 so I started we immediately 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.680
 repeat the same habits I'm going 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.630
 spread my cloth all the way down my 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.850
 table then come pinned on the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.140
 boss of my envelope pouch before 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.140
 cut everything around this one 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.270
 I'm going to fold my fabric like a 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.880
 envelope and come to position 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.930
 pins on the sides of those above for 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.930
 then be able to sew 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.049
 I start sewing by both 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.489
 places where I positioned the pins 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.760
 ie both sides of my 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.760
 envelope 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.610
 I will then continue sewing 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.590
 in ledges inward of my 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.959
 envelope at the level of the party 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.600
 triangular duo is at the level of the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.830
 inner part of the envelope that will 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.830
 allow to close it 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.240
 I now return my envelope to 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.190
 the place and will take my pair of 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.660
 scissors to cut out all the bits of 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.660
 fabrics and threads that protrudes 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.010
 my envelope sleeve is finally over 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.360
 I'll go and filmed it under all 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.020
 angles so you can see 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.020
 all the details 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.030
 you saw that he has nothing very 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.320
 complicated in this tutorial but if 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.970
 never have any questions to me 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.680
 ask do not hesitate to leave me a 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.630
 small comment to find well 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.880
 obviously the boss of this envelope 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.130
 at the bottom of my video in the description 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.080
 of this one of course there is no 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.800
 mandatory size to achieve 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.300
 your envelope 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.430
 I decided to make it a size 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.680
 average may return including who 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.570
 spreads paper but also why 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.400
 no keys and a cell phone 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.620
 after you can very well adapted this 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.080
 talent for example to make a cover 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.889
 for your ipad or for example outright 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.539
 your phone 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.949
 so it's up to you to choose you can 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.750
 from the boss you find in the 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.160
 description either enlarge it or the 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.110
 reduce according to what you 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.610
 want to put in this angle if you 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.440
 have other questions that concern 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.449
 painting or whatever else you can 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.400

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.260

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.940

 do not know it will allow you 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.470

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.210
