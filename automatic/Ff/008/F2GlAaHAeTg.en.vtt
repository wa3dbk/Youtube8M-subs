00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.540
 it's facing suddenly it's the last 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.390
 big game of ps vita so that's 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.660
 supervised by inafune the designer coc of 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.120
 mega man is an action game in arena a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.739
 little to the monster hunter who promises 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.220
 to be quite effective especially in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.220
 multiplayer 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
 so how's it going on the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 sacrifice it's happening in arena that's at 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 to say that we are thrown into action two 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 minutes after having to start the game and 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.949
 so we choose his character on 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.180
 dress it as we want and we launched 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.050
 give up in art and in small 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.239
 arenas actually 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 knowing that each mission will last in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.710
 between a minute and a quarter 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.000
 maximum time and so it's a game 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 3d action ie we have the whole 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.470
 range of games now so 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.280
 dodge rolls shot loaded small combo 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.820
 loch possibilities on the enemies 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.500
 to find your way around 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.130
 of the particularity of the game is that we 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.990
 will be able to access only his choices on the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.310
 sacrifice or on the contrary the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.009
 resurrection ie if a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.170
 enemy when about to perish one 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.750
 can choose to end his days 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.240
 which brings us magic or 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.149
 opposite 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.970
 to bring it back to life and there we 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.640
 recover from health and week choice of 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.220
 blow applies to the allies also each 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.740
 of the four allies when there is someone 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.289
 who dies suddenly we can choose or not 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.080
 to resuscitate him or on the contrary to the 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.179
 kill for if we kill it it triggers a 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.210
 magic and if on the contrary we do not kill 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.740
 it brings more life and it makes more 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.740
 presence also on the screen 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.950
 we are big asset of the game also it is the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.780
 management have made offerings them the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.250
 offerings being the boom in the game so 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 we have two two rows of three 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.110
 offerings and we can swing so if 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.060
 fate whether it's offensive spells 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.640
 defensive or stuff a little more a 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.170
 little more complex than recovering gradually 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.970
 and as the adventures by 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.570
 interests is that we will have the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.310
 possibility to mix them for having 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.070
 again or improve them 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.290
 to have more panoply of 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.170
 blows or pear thrown jean 10 10th or 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.980
 the run eight at the base etc and all 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.500
 boom of the blow we want to be 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.860
 manage with the five elements of the game so 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.299
 water fire land electricity keita and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.250
 knowing that we will be able to develop 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.290
 combos compared to that for example 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.879
 if we have an enemy we can freeze 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.530
 we will eventually be able to swing 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.780
 a big hour of electricity to make 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.129
 really a lot of damage there is any 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.170
 a panoply like that of costs to 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.910
 know to reveal because the game does 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.500
 does not tell us at the beginning what is it 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.910
 must do whatever it is 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.040
 chained on what kind of enemies it is 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.440
 really to us to discover by our 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.640
 own means and that's really what 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.730
 does the wealth of wants also to have 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.290
 stopped going out his shots we're supposed to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.700
 apply the right way actually 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.950
 compared to the bestiary that in front of 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.569
 we have all the positives 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.060
 should be mentioned there is still 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.459
 some points on which we issue 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.000
 reservations and starting with the party 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.349
 technical 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.750
 then on one side we have a direction 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.840
 artistic that is really neat it's 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.819
 work the armor design of the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.549
 weapons in general even enemies is 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.590
 rather well done though against on the 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.370
 strictly technical plan textures 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.989
 they are not fabulous 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.170
 we are clearly thinking more about 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.890
 psp boosted version that case of ps 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.040
 vita and the second the second point 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.659
 on which we would have liked to have more 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.330
 more variety just for the 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.489
 arenas it's the bestiary knows them 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.440
 arena his little there is as one 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.530
 said a mission a big dozen 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.090
 a big fortnight maximum and they 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.670
 really struggle to renew what 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.260
 does that gameplay empathize a little bit and 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.410
 the bestiary of the coup it's exactly 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.810
 same thing I think so for that we 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.130
 had to abandon because who announced 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.229
 we must have the enemies 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.600
 renews more than what the 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.520
 basic game play in this case it's 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.050
 nice we would have liked it anyway 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.729
 clearly have more to put themselves 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.729
 under the tooth in terms of variety 1 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.120
 in the end his bag and flaws his stakes 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.680
 we advise certainly still there 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.500
 some flaws so we said it the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.140
 technical part that is not optimal and 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.450
 the inevitably repetitive aspect of the month on 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.920
 the long term and despite all that it remains 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.370
 a big game of support 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.430
 it's very pleasant to take in hand and 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.580
 especially if we have friends as well in 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.140
 local online concon the soft must 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.810
 not hesitate a second it's really 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.340
 this is where the interest of the game is taken 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.470
 really its full extent is 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.240
 really very pleasant and their 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.240
 orders still warmly in the end
