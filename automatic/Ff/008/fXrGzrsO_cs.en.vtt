00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.909
 the web bar and is already open Saturday 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.400
 and there great quiet tribe that cricket 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380
 and bringing you now 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
 the teaser that so far I'm this afternoon 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.390
 with a title of all history has a 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 At first I'll go there and you'll 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 speculation or even speculation 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.559
 is rolling in the simple community there. 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.750
 whole world then following the first 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.269
 image that I'll show you there 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.340
 nate d antónio this image seems very 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.019
 with that first zombie map that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.470
 came in hotel op 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.930
 that image there of moon bush that 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.879
 Picture mit sombria who played and that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.219
 first map will identify a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.379
 bit with this image then this is 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.289
 My speculation for this photo is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.539
 second image I would be betting that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.920
 would see what you can come for a 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.380
 one piece and metal spring but it looks like it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.350
 that this part of metal is with 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.470
 any pk pant design even from the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.590
 first is the first map of the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.459
 first maps exit the zombie in the other 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.580
 orde the third image I would say 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.220
 what would be the chino in a council reminds 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.520
 have some elite straw shares on the map 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.399
 China at a time that is what it would be 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.229
 a speculation for this one for that image 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.190
 It's showing right now to you. 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.649
 ok the next image looks like a face 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.530
 that would be one where you put 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.270
 your weapon and I would say that image 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.209
 would be real 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.239
 Ok this speculation for this image 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.899
 for the next would be that of a 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.429
 Touch 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.819
 I would say that this image would be 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.099
 right there where you put the 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.649
 film roll up there where you go 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.149
 backup before always on this as 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.340
 I'm telling you this is a 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.319
 speculation about this image I do not 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.690
 I'm saying that I'm right, okay? 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.200
 then this would be speculation to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.280
 this image and it would perhaps of cno 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.860
 yesterday 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.709
 Okay, the next picture would be something 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.989
 related and with koff that I do not know 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.080
 say exactly what this is about 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.830
 image but cerato kicking it 'coffee 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.030
 dead 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.640
 the other certainly image 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.459
 I 'm almost 100% sure that 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.709
 would be one of the doors here we have there 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.400
 without rain we see these symbols of 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.819
 numbers and scattered and voice fills and neither 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.150
 the entire map and the last image would be 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.330
 shangrilá this wheel and it seems or if it is not 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.400
 really that customer's wheel uses 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.250
 nor do an Easter egg in the shangri there 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.250
 so that would be my opinions and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.820
 about the images that were taken there is 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.290
 were brought there for us by tva 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.690

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.450

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.840
 You may have seen something that is 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.910

 the subject of these images is in the course of 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.670
