00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.710
 we continue with this adventure this map 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.809
 job 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.640
 Thanks for finding that object 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.079
 I thank you here 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.910
 I give another map to locate the 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.230
 helicopter application is a rocket grad 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.110
 and with three actually the other side of the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.689
 river says just behind my house almost from 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.689
 search well and because it is open here 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.160
 I do not think it takes the map does not 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.580
 here you do not know where we are but well 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.580
 I did not have friends 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 the favor there he has seen me 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.520
 because it does not appear in said suns 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.520
 normal 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.120
 we will go 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 it feels like peking trading 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.030
 let's see helicopters I think so 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 let's see I guess in this chapter of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.940
 we will finish although I still have to play 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 a little more 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.020
 to make the day a little higher 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.260
 55 is that I do not understand what life will be 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.440
 of the bugs simply 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.880
 i do not know is possible the safest 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.760
 who knows is a life of the npcs n 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.870
 fishes 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.870
 bar downstairs bar 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.670
 to drink 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.420
 the helicopter go to antarctica 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.780
 but all are over 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.380
 it turns out that the map was very short 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 73 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:10.209
 one 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.209
 fuck like the helicopter that fast 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.790
 let's remove everything 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.660
 party story he just said he had 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.370
 information if there is more than 35 I 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.030
 passed the bill since it is a map go and 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.220
 we solve 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.110
 well we had not finished with agreed 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.880
 you already antarctica you meet with your family 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.030
 the armed base the entire country of states 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.070
 united that I was looking for was what it was that 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.960
 his wife told him that cojones no 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.200
 I understand nothing was very worried and 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.660
 terrified their children very contexts be 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.580
 who to instruct vigo the captain 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.510
 that amounts to general and celebrants 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:56.360
 you're alive and well 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.190
 for 15 dollars a trainee 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.810
 20 savings are more advanced in that 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.670
 you learned different from gold is very 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.599
 raised I have 22 I have no more 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.599
 you had so much 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.939
 fuck 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.780
 and it's already serious I expected that 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.780
 out longer than this 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.140
 good good 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.480
 in short let's look for gossip not 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 I can remember 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.380
 and even there is something something gold seems that 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.640
 do not 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.300
 it gives me that no 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.300
 but good 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.530
 It seems that we have finished it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.780
 I expected it to be so short 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.400
 but good 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.040
 there's nothing more left to say 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.140
 let's see if there is nothing not 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.530
 instead of everything I do not want to be 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.530
 night 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.580
 and not 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.580
 I do not give 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.360
 Well especially the latter video 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.050
 of cojones 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.880
 but good we liked live favorites 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.859
 who mounted a map you just have to put 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.380
 here in the comments it is possible 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.380
 some so that nobody 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.340
 cool 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.770
 but good 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.440
 the truth 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.060
 to see if next time I investigate a 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.040
 little more the map I do not like to look at them 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.550
 before playing them 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.520
 the truth I like a little that I caught 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.770
 more by surprise 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.870
 but it is that this fact as always 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.110
 by surprise and results is pretty 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.110
 short but good 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.340
 Thank you
