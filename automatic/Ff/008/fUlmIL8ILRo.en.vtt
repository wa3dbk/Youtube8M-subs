00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:10.670
 the irrigation has not come out good practice 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.670
 a little more and at the end it will come out 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.950
 he likes he likes 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.790
 the way to make tickets well 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.890
 look tony sometimes people ask me 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.960
 since when have I done magic and the truth 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.880
 it's good that I have not always done 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.309
 magic before doing magic I tried to do 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.650
 many other things and being good 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.860
 the typical pizza deli not pivot 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.630
 of basketball 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.030
 public not caught 1 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.110
 and even and I even tried to be a bartender 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.350
 good on waiter rule but for the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.150
 case gives equal and clear so much time 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.920
 time ago a bar one has to 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.510
 do something to entertain and otherwise 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.460
 can win the smile of the girls 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.280
 much better when you want you can put 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.010
 the music here you will see seals so no 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.640
 look after a long time of 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.740
 practice I was able to make travel a 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.470
 cup and a battery only with the power 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.500
 from the mind that you do not believe 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.500
 Well, look, observe, let's cover the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.120
 cup and we're going to 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.490
 good 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.770
 apologize is that it is always to have a 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.540
 more bottle just in case but good 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.560
 good it will come out going to leave it or be 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.450
 if we simply cover the cup and 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.850
 we cover the bottle and concentrate 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.980
 much 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.490
 and it is already 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.210
 yes yes yes here is the bottle 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 what is 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.470
 this is the easy part the hard part 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.470
 is to return them to the original site 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.840
 believe it or not it is very easy to make 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.840
 the glass and the bottle change place 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.829
 much more difficult 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.260
 much more difficult is to make them come back 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.260
 to the original site 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:40.600
 and look to do it with a tube we cover 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.910
 the bottle and with another tube also good 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.980
 and to apologize like that is that I always bring 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.650
 one more bottle just in case you saw 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.170
 then two or three we just do 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.440
 like this and the glass and the bottle change 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.440
 of place 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.020
 to come back you just have to 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.530
 catch with a tube you cover the bottle and 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.090
 with the other good tube also man 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.280
 caution is worth two but we are 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.100
 happening already with so many I think and now if 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.630
 we just cover each other and the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.630
 glass and a bottle change place 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.930
 the same thing we can achieve using 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.760
 only a single tube in this case the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.260
 cup is transformed into a bottle and the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.260
 bottle is transformed into a cup 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.140
 but we always try to have a 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.140
 extra bottle 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.120
 backwards imagine what you want 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.100
 to do is the cup will be the bottle the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.780
 bottle are transformed into a cup but if 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.940
 try in their homes always remember 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.940
 have an extra bottle 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.430
 Look, I still think we're already 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.770
 here rolling with so many bottles I think 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.840
 that it will be much better if we mark the 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.060
 bottle that you have to travel with a 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.720
 handkerchief so it will be clear which one is which 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.720
 it will be very good 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.530
 so look carefully now it's marked with 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.210
 we cover the handkerchief over and over and the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.210
 bottle and the glass changes place 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.509
 this is the easy part the hard part 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.280
 is to return them to the original site 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.770
 well you know that the best is always 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.689
 have a couple of extra bottles and with 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:51.580
 all these bottles what we can 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:51.580
 to always do is to test its content
