00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
so we were fighting the GCR for the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.970 
so we were fighting the GCR for the
first<00:00:06.480> time<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> condition<00:00:07.620> unit<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
first time is a condition unit for the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.470 
first time is a condition unit for the
drivers<00:00:08.370> trying<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> help<00:00:08.910> put<00:00:09.090> them<00:00:09.240> cool

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
drivers trying to help put them cool

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.259 
drivers trying to help put them cool
inside<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.019> car<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:11.160> car<00:00:11.370> would<00:00:11.550> normally<00:00:12.090> at

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
inside the car the car would normally at

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.370 
inside the car the car would normally at
this<00:00:12.450> time<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.719> year<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:12.900> divisor<00:00:13.170> you

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
this time of year and divisor you

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.870 
this time of year and divisor you
running<00:00:13.679> somewhere<00:00:13.920> between<00:00:14.070> 40<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.549> 50

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
running somewhere between 40 and 50

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.849 
running somewhere between 40 and 50
degrees<00:00:14.910> inside<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.690> cockpit<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:16.680> quite

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
degrees inside the cockpit so it's quite

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.300 
degrees inside the cockpit so it's quite
hot

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
hot

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.099 
hot
there<00:00:17.550> wasn't<00:00:17.730> very<00:00:17.880> very<00:00:18.180> simple<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> got<00:00:19.080> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
there wasn't very very simple and got a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.380 
there wasn't very very simple and got a
sealed<00:00:19.439> plastic<00:00:19.800> unit<00:00:20.400> around<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> top<00:00:21.270> of

bit<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> flex<00:00:52.620> basically<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.489> any<00:00:53.640> part<00:00:53.909> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
bit of flex basically so any part of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.969 
bit of flex basically so any part of
their<00:00:54.089> body<00:00:54.239> gets<00:00:54.480> hot<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.199> emit<00:00:55.559> revenue

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
their body gets hot it can emit revenue

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.579 
their body gets hot it can emit revenue
once<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.489> into<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:56.850> footwell<00:00:57.780> feet<00:00:58.229> legs

once down into the footwell feet legs
keep<00:00:58.890> some<00:00:59.070> cool<00:00:59.309> onto<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> chest<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> lot

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
keep some cool onto the chest or a lot

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
keep some cool onto the chest or a lot
and<00:01:01.079> we'll<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.949> aim<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> inside<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
and we'll do actually aim it inside the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.609 
and we'll do actually aim it inside the
buzzer<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> blaster<00:01:04.140> call<00:01:04.350> they're

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
buzzer to get a blaster call they're

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.499 
buzzer to get a blaster call they're
over<00:01:05.159> their<00:01:05.309> face<00:01:05.549> which<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.210> help<00:01:06.299> keep

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
over their face which will help keep

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.450 
over their face which will help keep
them<00:01:06.689> cool<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:07.110> well<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.950> normally<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.369> you

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
them cool as well so normally if you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.859 
them cool as well so normally if you
haven't<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.789> your<00:01:08.820> condition<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.360> 50<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
haven't got your condition in 50 the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
haven't got your condition in 50 the
only<00:01:10.049> cool<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.500> have<00:01:10.619> inside<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> car<00:01:11.310> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
only cool and you have inside the car is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.029 
only cool and you have inside the car is
the<00:01:11.909> air<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:12.960> forced<00:01:13.439> through<00:01:13.649> the<00:01:13.680> vents

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
the air that's forced through the vents

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.320 
the air that's forced through the vents
basically<00:01:14.429> the<00:01:14.490> cold<00:01:14.759> air<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.000> comes<00:01:15.090> from

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
basically the cold air that comes from

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
basically the cold air that comes from
and<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> air<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.780> forced<00:01:16.110> through<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and that air is forced through from the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
and that air is forced through from the
front<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> car<00:01:17.310> doesn't<00:01:18.090> provide

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
front of the car doesn't provide

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
front of the car doesn't provide
sufficient<00:01:18.780> cooling<00:01:19.110> ends<00:01:19.649> we<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> air

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
sufficient cooling ends we have the air

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
sufficient cooling ends we have the air
conditioning<00:01:20.729> unit<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.289> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
conditioning unit what they have got is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
conditioning unit what they have got is
a<00:01:22.770> dial<00:01:23.130> inside<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> car<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.210> control<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
a dial inside the car to control the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.600 
a dial inside the car to control the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
temperature of the air from the reason

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.010 
temperature of the air from the reason
you<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.149> would<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.390> how<00:01:27.840> in

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
you have that you would think how in

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.449 
you have that you would think how in
turbine<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.440> middle<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.709> desert<00:01:28.920> you're

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
turbine the middle of the desert you're

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:30.859 
turbine the middle of the desert you're
going<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.909> four<00:01:30.090> calls<00:01:30.390> actually

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
going to want on four calls actually

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.779 
going to want on four calls actually
during<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> night<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:32.190> temperature<00:01:32.220> drops

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
during the night the temperature drops

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.399 
during the night the temperature drops
down<00:01:32.970> quite<00:01:33.270> low<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.080> therefore<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
down quite low and therefore the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.169 
down quite low and therefore the
temperature<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.830> cockpit<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.909> becomes

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
temperature in the cockpit also becomes

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.029 
temperature in the cockpit also becomes
law<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.869> drive<00:01:37.080> will<00:01:37.259> actually<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.530> too<00:01:37.740> cold

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
law the drive will actually get too cold

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.219 
law the drive will actually get too cold
so<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.880> point<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.720> either<00:01:39.869> turn<00:01:40.080> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so at that point you can either turn the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.870 
so at that point you can either turn the
temperature<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> air<00:01:40.679> conditioning<00:01:41.190> up<00:01:41.369> or

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
temperature of air conditioning up or

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.130 
temperature of air conditioning up or
he's<00:01:42.000> actually<00:01:42.119> got<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.390> opportunity<00:01:42.450> air

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
he's actually got the opportunity air

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.280 
he's actually got the opportunity air
conditioning<00:01:43.619> off<00:01:43.799> altogether

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290

the<00:01:45.680> unit<00:01:45.980> weighs<00:01:46.130> about<00:01:46.340> 30<00:01:46.730> kilos<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.840> there

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
the unit weighs about 30 kilos so there

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.300 
the unit weighs about 30 kilos so there
was<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> little<00:01:48.230> bit<00:01:48.410> of<00:01:48.500> extra<00:01:48.680> weight<00:01:48.950> room<00:01:49.220> to

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
was a little bit of extra weight room to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.130 
was a little bit of extra weight room to
carry<00:01:49.520> around<00:01:49.580> inside<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.180> car<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.080> have

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
carry around inside the car but you have

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.380 
carry around inside the car but you have
to<00:01:51.320> weigh<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.680> against<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.310> fatigue<00:01:53.150> of<00:01:53.300> the
