headphones<00:00:05.069> with<00:00:05.540> microphone<00:00:07.580> you'll<00:00:08.580> wear

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
headphones with microphone you'll wear

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.740 
headphones with microphone you'll wear
the<00:00:08.940> headphones<00:00:10.700> like<00:00:11.700> such<00:00:12.030> their<00:00:12.269> overhead

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the headphones like such their overhead

the headphones like such their overhead
I<00:00:13.490> kind<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.549> prefer<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.880> behind<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> head

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
I kind of prefer the behind the head

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.830 
I kind of prefer the behind the head
style<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:17.039> those<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.730> guess<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.690> some

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
style but those I guess for some

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.240 
style but those I guess for some
companies<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.320> didn't<00:00:19.529> catch<00:00:19.710> on<00:00:19.920> or<00:00:20.100> just

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
companies I didn't catch on or just

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.620 
companies I didn't catch on or just
didn't<00:00:20.460> catch<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.789> at<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.330> some<00:00:21.359> odd

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
didn't catch on at all for some odd

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
didn't catch on at all for some odd
reason<00:00:21.800> but<00:00:22.800> here's<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> microphone<00:00:23.340> itself

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
reason but here's the microphone itself

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.660 
reason but here's the microphone itself
it's<00:00:24.300> adjustable<00:00:24.830> move<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.250> down<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it's adjustable move it up and down the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.519 
it's adjustable move it up and down the
weird<00:00:27.240> part<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.050> actually

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
weird part about this is you actually

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.250 
weird part about this is you actually
move<00:00:28.769> slide<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.550> up<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.390> down<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.869> turn<00:00:31.080> on

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
move slide this up and down to turn on

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.590 
move slide this up and down to turn on
and<00:00:31.439> turn<00:00:31.590> off<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.099> actual<00:00:32.399> microphone<00:00:32.880> which

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and turn off the actual microphone which

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.440 
and turn off the actual microphone which
i<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.350> strange<00:00:34.649> feature

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
i think is a really strange feature

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.299 
i think is a really strange feature
comes<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.780> 10<00:00:37.050> 6<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.530> 10<00:00:37.710> feet<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:38.010> cord

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
comes with about 10 6 to 10 feet of cord

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
comes with about 10 6 to 10 feet of cord
that's<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:39.149> than<00:00:39.329> enough<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:39.690> me<00:00:39.840> because

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
that's more than enough for me because

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.150 
that's more than enough for me because
I'm<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.230> really<00:00:40.469> gonna<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.649> using<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.980> too

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I'm not really gonna be using this too

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.560 
I'm not really gonna be using this too

a<00:03:34.680> while<00:03:34.890> now<00:03:35.510> interesting<00:03:36.510> design<00:03:36.840> had<00:03:37.680> them

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
a while now interesting design had them

them eventually I will upgrade and I'll
have<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.890> pretty<00:03:47.430> decent<00:03:47.580> collection<00:03:47.940> of

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
have a pretty decent collection of

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.110 
have a pretty decent collection of
headphones<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.040> that's<00:03:50.040> really<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.850> for<00:03:51.000> this

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
headphones so that's really it for this

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.520

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
video I can't really think of anything

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
video I can't really think of anything
more<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.850> say<00:03:53.880> about<00:03:54.360> him<00:03:55.100> colorings<00:03:56.100> good<00:03:56.340> and
