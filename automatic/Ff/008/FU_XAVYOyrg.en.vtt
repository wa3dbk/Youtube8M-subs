wizardry to give you an extra couple of
positions<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.270> also<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:31.280> coil<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:33.250> realize<00:01:34.250> I

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
positions and also the coil I realize I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.309 
positions and also the coil I realize I
said<00:01:34.819> that<00:01:34.970> I've<00:01:35.090> done<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.689> video<00:01:35.929> I<00:01:35.990> had

here<00:02:03.700> we<00:02:03.790> go<00:02:03.930> one<00:02:04.930> and<00:02:05.110> two<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:07.420> are<00:02:07.780> your

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
here we go one and two these are your

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.109 
here we go one and two these are your
push-pull<00:02:08.440> pots<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:09.220> pot<00:02:09.430> part<00:02:09.729> is

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
push-pull pots the pot part is

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.390 
push-pull pots the pot part is
completely<00:02:10.720> separate<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.860> switch

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
completely separate to the switch

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.790 
completely separate to the switch
although<00:02:12.880> they're<00:02:13.060> connected<00:02:13.680> they're<00:02:14.680> not

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
although they're connected they're not

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.430 
although they're connected they're not
integral<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.910> all<00:02:16.570> on<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> bottom<00:02:17.230> these<00:02:17.380> are

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
integral so all on the bottom these are

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.400 
integral so all on the bottom these are
is<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.310> standard<00:02:18.730> switch<00:02:19.510> much<00:02:20.020> like<00:02:20.260> we

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
is just a standard switch much like we

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230 
is just a standard switch much like we
already<00:02:20.680> put<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.070> here<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.550> could<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.030> put

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
already put in here I could have put

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.820 
already put in here I could have put
another<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.750> here<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:23.320> simple<00:02:23.620> terms

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
another one in here but for simple terms

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.790 
another one in here but for simple terms
I<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.100> put<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> switch<00:02:24.640> in<00:02:25.590> what<00:02:26.590> we're<00:02:26.680> going

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
I just put a switch in what we're going

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.780 
I just put a switch in what we're going
to<00:02:26.830> do<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.010> we're<00:02:27.130> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.280> replace<00:02:27.400> these

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
to do is we're going to replace these

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.080 
to do is we're going to replace these
one<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.480> two<00:02:28.840> as<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.830> tone<00:02:30.040> pots<00:02:30.340> which<00:02:30.880> I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
one and two as the tone pots which I

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.360 
one and two as the tone pots which I
want<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.570> two<00:02:32.020> here<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.740> wire<00:02:33.130> them

going to go into it too much here but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.770 
going to go into it too much here but
take<00:02:45.850> one<00:02:46.090> part<00:02:46.360> off

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
take one part off

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.170 
take one part off
do<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.770> soldiering<00:02:48.190> on<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.580> one<00:02:48.820> one

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
do you soldiering on to this one one

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.150 
do you soldiering on to this one one
wire<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.840> another<00:02:50.020> way<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.410> put<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.100> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
wire on to another way so put it in the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.220 
wire on to another way so put it in the
same<00:02:51.340> orientation<00:02:51.840> first<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.990> all<00:02:53.050> you're

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
same orientation first of all you're

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.840 
same orientation first of all you're
just<00:02:53.260> gonna<00:02:53.500> wire<00:02:53.770> up<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.040> pot<00:02:54.250> not<00:02:54.700> the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
just gonna wire up the pot not the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.540 
just gonna wire up the pot not the
switch<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:56.020> if<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> look<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.650> green<00:02:57.340> wire

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
switch so if you look the green wire

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.250 
switch so if you look the green wire
which<00:02:58.000> goes<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.480> middle<00:02:58.600> goes<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.170> the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
which goes to the middle goes to the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.850 
which goes to the middle goes to the
middle<00:02:59.500> and<00:03:00.330> vice-versa<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:02.230> we're<00:03:02.560> gonna<00:03:02.680> do

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
middle and vice-versa so we're gonna do

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.260 
middle and vice-versa so we're gonna do
that<00:03:03.070> now<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.520> then<00:03:03.580> we'll<00:03:03.760> place<00:03:03.940> them<00:03:04.150> in

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
that now and then we'll place them in

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.970 
that now and then we'll place them in
and<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.600> we'll<00:03:04.750> deal<00:03:05.050> with<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.560> switches

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
and then we'll deal with the switches

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.930 
and then we'll deal with the switches
one<00:03:06.520> last<00:03:06.760> thing<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.239> notes<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:09.250> parts<00:03:09.790> are

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
one last thing to notes all parts are

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.210 
one last thing to notes all parts are
slightly<00:03:10.180> different<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.959> is<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.170> 500<00:03:11.980> part

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
slightly different this is a 500 part

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.580 
slightly different this is a 500 part
that's<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.670> 500<00:03:13.239> part<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.780> one's<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.080> 500

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
that's a 500 part and this one's a 500

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.770 
that's a 500 part and this one's a 500
as<00:03:14.680> well<00:03:14.830> actually<00:03:15.010> there<00:03:15.520> are<00:03:15.640> 500<00:03:16.209> some

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
as well actually there are 500 some

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.979 
as well actually there are 500 some
stratocasters<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> 250<00:03:18.130> some<00:03:18.730> west<00:03:18.940> pals<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.390> 500

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
stratocasters a 250 some west pals a 500

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.290 
stratocasters a 250 some west pals a 500
250<00:03:20.380> just<00:03:20.830> depends<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.370> model<00:03:21.640> if<00:03:21.970> you're

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
250 just depends on the model if you're

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.530 
250 just depends on the model if you're
going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.510> replace<00:03:22.810> these<00:03:23.140> try<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.160> get<00:03:24.540> 500

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
going to replace these try and get 500

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.479 
going to replace these try and get 500
like<00:03:25.900> I've<00:03:26.140> done<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:26.950> replace<00:03:27.070> like

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
like I've done so if you replace like

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.300 
like I've done so if you replace like
for<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.930> sounds<00:03:29.230> quite<00:03:29.380> simple<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.130> it

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
for like it sounds quite simple and it

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.220 
for like it sounds quite simple and it
really<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.209> let's<00:03:31.570> get<00:03:31.690> cracking

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
really is so let's get cracking

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.390 
really is so let's get cracking
I'm<00:03:32.350> not<00:03:32.530> going<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.709> show<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.040> wiring

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
I'm not going to show you the wiring

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.699 
I'm not going to show you the wiring
because<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:34.750> copy<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.170> wire<00:03:35.290> into<00:03:35.560> some

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
because just copy the wire into some

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:36.620 
because just copy the wire into some
yogurt<00:03:36.010> cell

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
yogurt cell

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.860 
yogurt cell
okay<00:03:37.630> guys<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.560> as<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.130> can<00:03:39.280> see<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.970> pots<00:03:40.450> in

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
okay guys so as you can see the pots in

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.280 
okay guys so as you can see the pots in
oh<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:42.790> was<00:03:42.910> quick<00:03:43.180> well<00:03:43.510> quick<00:03:43.750> for<00:03:43.959> you<00:03:44.050> not

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
oh that was quick well quick for you not

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
for me but anyway let's try and get a

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.140 
for me but anyway let's try and get a
better<00:03:47.560> view<00:03:47.769> for<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.220> though<00:03:48.340> here<00:03:48.580> right

better view for you though here right

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.479 
better view for you though here right
the<00:03:49.269> pots<00:03:49.510> are<00:03:49.720> in<00:03:50.019> don't<00:03:50.920> worry<00:03:51.010> about<00:03:51.250> being

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
the pots are in don't worry about being

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.310 
the pots are in don't worry about being
a<00:03:51.550> little<00:03:51.910> bit<00:03:52.000> scraggily<00:03:52.420> at<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.870> moment

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
a little bit scraggily at the moment

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.770 
a little bit scraggily at the moment
there's<00:03:53.680> not<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.860> lot<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.190> can<00:03:54.220> do<00:03:54.730> because<00:03:55.630> I'm

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
there's not a lot I can do because I'm

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.650 
there's not a lot I can do because I'm
still<00:03:56.019> wiring<00:03:57.000> let<00:03:58.000> me<00:03:58.090> see<00:03:58.209> if<00:03:58.300> I<00:03:58.390> can<00:03:58.510> get

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
still wiring let me see if I can get

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.410 
still wiring let me see if I can get
this<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.900> focus<00:03:59.080> for<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.560> right<00:03:59.920> now<00:04:00.420> this

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
this in focus for you right now this

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.980 
this in focus for you right now this
stray<00:04:01.870> wire<00:04:02.140> here<00:04:03.090> okay<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.480> coil<00:04:04.720> tap

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
stray wire here okay is the coil tap

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.170 
stray wire here okay is the coil tap
wire

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
wire

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.930 
wire
now<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:09.350> can<00:04:09.530> put<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.770> to<00:04:09.890> any<00:04:10.070> of<00:04:10.190> these<00:04:10.430> it

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
now you can put it to any of these it

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.270 
now you can put it to any of these it
doesn't<00:04:11.270> really<00:04:11.420> matter<00:04:11.800> because<00:04:12.800> literally

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
doesn't really matter because literally

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.700 
doesn't really matter because literally
all<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:14.000> doing<00:04:14.210> is<00:04:14.540> either<00:04:15.020> breaking<00:04:15.410> the

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
all this is doing is either breaking the

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.610 
all this is doing is either breaking the
circuits<00:04:16.160> one<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.610> coils<00:04:16.820> or<00:04:17.780> joining<00:04:18.350> it

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
circuits one of the coils or joining it

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.380 
circuits one of the coils or joining it
depending<00:04:18.980> on<00:04:19.040> what<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.280> want<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.489> do<00:04:19.670> now

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
depending on what you want to do now

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.910 
depending on what you want to do now

for the bridge pickup that's where I'm

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.130 
for the bridge pickup that's where I'm
gonna<00:04:25.310> choose<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.760> put<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:28.360> nice<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.660> quick

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
gonna choose to put it nice and quick

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.050 
gonna choose to put it nice and quick
and<00:04:30.440> simple<00:04:30.770> with<00:04:31.610> this

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.700 
and simple with this
really<00:04:34.300> I'll<00:04:35.300> put<00:04:35.570> wiring<00:04:35.960> diagram<00:04:36.350> on<00:04:36.500> at<00:04:36.620> the

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
really I'll put wiring diagram on at the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.920 
really I'll put wiring diagram on at the
end<00:04:36.830> anyway<00:04:37.070> there<00:04:37.430> are<00:04:37.580> six<00:04:37.910> terminals<00:04:38.210> on

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
end anyway there are six terminals on

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.570 
end anyway there are six terminals on
here<00:04:43.510> there<00:04:44.510> we<00:04:44.660> go

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
here there we go

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:53.320 
here there we go
six<00:04:46.580> terminals<00:04:50.020> there<00:04:51.040> right<00:04:52.040> now<00:04:52.880> basically

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
six terminals there right now basically

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.240 
six terminals there right now basically
it<00:04:53.720> doesn't<00:04:54.020> matter<00:04:54.170> what<00:04:54.410> these<00:04:54.560> do<00:04:54.830> at<00:04:55.100> this

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
it doesn't matter what these do at this

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.390 
it doesn't matter what these do at this
moment<00:04:55.460> in<00:04:55.760> time<00:04:55.790> one<00:04:56.390> two<00:04:56.780> three<00:04:57.380> one<00:04:58.130> two

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
moment in time one two three one two

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.140 
moment in time one two three one two
three<00:04:58.660> okay<00:04:59.680> you<00:05:00.680> can<00:05:00.860> use<00:05:01.010> either<00:05:01.310> side<00:05:01.490> for

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
three okay you can use either side for

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.290 
three okay you can use either side for
the<00:05:02.210> on/off<00:05:02.570> okay<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.740> got<00:05:03.890> one<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.340> two

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
the on/off okay so you got one and two

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.480 
the on/off okay so you got one and two
or<00:05:05.630> one<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.200> two<00:05:06.350> on<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.590> other<00:05:06.680> side<00:05:06.980> it's<00:05:07.280> up

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
or one and two on the other side it's up

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.380 
or one and two on the other side it's up
to<00:05:07.670> you<00:05:07.790> whichever<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:08.660> decide<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:09.380> use<00:05:10.390> all

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
to you whichever you decide to use all

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.140 
to you whichever you decide to use all
this<00:05:11.660> basically<00:05:11.930> denote<00:05:12.530> this<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:14.120> I

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
this basically denote this is that I

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.800 
this basically denote this is that I
want<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.870> when<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.740> pot<00:05:15.950> is<00:05:15.980> up<00:05:16.400> right<00:05:17.240> or<00:05:17.450> flat

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
want it when the pot is up right or flat

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.190 
want it when the pot is up right or flat
down<00:05:18.050> should<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.440> say<00:05:19.630> flat<00:05:20.630> down<00:05:20.780> against<00:05:21.140> the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
down should I say flat down against the

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.680 
down should I say flat down against the
front<00:05:21.470> against<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.130> actual<00:05:22.250> pickguard<00:05:22.690> that

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
front against the actual pickguard that

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.980 
front against the actual pickguard that
we<00:05:23.840> have<00:05:23.990> humbucker<00:05:24.440> all<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.310> time<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:26.660> if<00:05:26.840> we

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
we have humbucker all the time and if we

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.610 
we have humbucker all the time and if we
pull<00:05:27.230> it<00:05:27.260> up<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.400> switch<00:05:28.640> up<00:05:29.620> basically

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
pull it up the switch up basically

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.230 
pull it up the switch up basically
that's<00:05:30.919> gonna<00:05:31.130> split<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.550> coil<00:05:31.790> and<00:05:31.970> turn<00:05:32.120> it

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
that's gonna split the coil and turn it

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.610 
that's gonna split the coil and turn it
into<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.450> single<00:05:32.690> coil<00:05:32.990> because<00:05:33.320> that's<00:05:33.530> the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
into a single coil because that's the

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.150 
into a single coil because that's the
way<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:33.740> want<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.100> do<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.230> top<00:05:36.530> two

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
way I want to do it so it's the top two

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.040 
way I want to do it so it's the top two
that<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.730> want<00:05:37.910> to<00:05:38.030> do<00:05:38.180> so<00:05:38.360> you're<00:05:38.510> to<00:05:38.750> spare

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
that you want to do so you're to spare

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.730 
that you want to do so you're to spare
wires<00:05:39.320> I'm<00:05:39.740> gonna<00:05:39.890> go<00:05:40.070> one<00:05:40.520> two<00:05:40.550> that<00:05:40.880> terminal

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
wires I'm gonna go one two that terminal

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.890 
wires I'm gonna go one two that terminal
this<00:05:42.740> terminal<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.460> that's<00:05:44.240> literally<00:05:44.630> it

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
this terminal and that's literally it

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.190 
this terminal and that's literally it
you<00:05:45.290> know<00:05:48.850> instead<00:05:49.850> so<00:05:50.330> yeah<00:05:50.540> as<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.780> can<00:05:51.050> see

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
you know instead so yeah as you can see

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.960 
you know instead so yeah as you can see
that<00:05:51.440> several<00:05:51.680> there<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.310> that<00:05:52.460> terminal

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
that several there and that terminal

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.620 
that several there and that terminal
flare<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.780> that's<00:05:53.960> just<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.320> basic<00:05:54.680> on/off

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
flare and that's just a basic on/off

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.300 
flare and that's just a basic on/off
situation<00:05:56.630> if<00:05:57.020> you<00:05:57.470> wanted<00:05:57.830> it<00:05:57.950> so<00:05:57.980> you've<00:05:58.220> got

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
situation if you wanted it so you've got

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.130 
situation if you wanted it so you've got
single<00:05:58.669> coil<00:05:58.910> all<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.240> time<00:05:59.450> then<00:05:59.780> you<00:05:59.810> do<00:06:00.050> it

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
single coil all the time then you do it

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.080 
single coil all the time then you do it
so<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.350> bottom<00:06:00.590> ones<00:06:00.770> that<00:06:01.520> one<00:06:01.669> and<00:06:01.910> that<00:06:01.940> one

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
so the bottom ones that one and that one

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.370 
so the bottom ones that one and that one
that<00:06:02.360> means<00:06:02.570> you'd<00:06:02.690> have<00:06:02.810> single<00:06:03.169> coil

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
that means you'd have single coil

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.310 
that means you'd have single coil
normally<00:06:04.160> and<00:06:04.400> then<00:06:04.550> if<00:06:04.669> you<00:06:04.790> pull<00:06:05.000> them<00:06:05.320> you

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
normally and then if you pull them you

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.320 
normally and then if you pull them you
have<00:06:06.500> home<00:06:06.680> bucket<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.340> that's<00:06:07.640> as<00:06:07.820> simple<00:06:08.210> as

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
have home bucket and that's as simple as

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.890 
have home bucket and that's as simple as
that<00:06:08.480> so<00:06:08.690> that's<00:06:08.870> switch<00:06:09.169> number<00:06:09.440> one<00:06:10.250> okay<00:06:11.210> so

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
that so that's switch number one okay so

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.010 
that so that's switch number one okay so
that's<00:06:12.110> it

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.890 

there<00:06:16.020> we<00:06:16.110> go<00:06:16.470> sold<00:06:17.460> it<00:06:17.580> in<00:06:17.700> on<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.420> top<00:06:18.630> two

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
there we go sold it in on the top two

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.100 
there we go sold it in on the top two
one<00:06:19.350> do<00:06:20.180> okay<00:06:21.180> I'm<00:06:21.240> gonna<00:06:21.360> do<00:06:21.540> a<00:06:21.570> bit<00:06:21.750> I'd<00:06:21.960> you

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
one do okay I'm gonna do a bit I'd you

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.250 
one do okay I'm gonna do a bit I'd you
know<00:06:22.170> so<00:06:22.410> that's<00:06:22.530> now<00:06:22.770> he<00:06:22.830> coiled<00:06:23.250> up<00:06:23.370> in<00:06:23.610> done

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
know so that's now he coiled up in done

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.960 
know so that's now he coiled up in done
