00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
recommended to figure out what those

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
recommended to figure out what those
processes<00:01:23.790> are<00:01:23.970> before<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> actually<00:01:24.659> do

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
processes are before you actually do

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
processes are before you actually do
that<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:27.409> proceed<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.590> i<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.040> i<00:01:29.150> configured

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that and proceed as i see i configured

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
that and proceed as i see i configured
mine<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.320> click<00:01:31.470> apply<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> then

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
mine and we just click apply and then

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
mine and we just click apply and then
that's<00:01:32.100> about<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> also

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079

to<00:01:39.840> use<00:01:40.020> fraps<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.340> does<00:01:42.210> not

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to use fraps because it it does not

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.100 
to use fraps because it it does not
compress<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.200> might<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.619> compress<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110
