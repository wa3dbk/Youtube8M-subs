their lot but this one I like this one
and<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.600> noticed<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.350> absolutely<00:00:40.680> no

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and I noticed that there's absolutely no

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.209 
and I noticed that there's absolutely no
rust<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.840> except<00:00:42.840> for<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.050> tiny<00:00:43.829> spot<00:00:44.190> on

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
rust on it except for one tiny spot on

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.400 
rust on it except for one tiny spot on
the<00:00:44.399> other<00:00:44.550> quarter<00:00:44.879> panel<00:00:45.180> which<00:00:45.410> apparently

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the other quarter panel which apparently

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.170 
the other quarter panel which apparently
always<00:00:46.829> happens<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> legacy<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:47.969> this

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
always happens to legacy is because this

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.720 
always happens to legacy is because this
being<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.510> 2002<00:00:49.200> I've<00:00:49.710> seen<00:00:50.070> several<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.579> these

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
being a 2002 I've seen several of these

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.569 
being a 2002 I've seen several of these
fail<00:00:51.090> inspection<00:00:51.680> just<00:00:52.680> due<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> rust<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
fail inspection just due to rust up the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.950 
fail inspection just due to rust up the
wheel<00:00:53.730> well<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.510> you're<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.780> allowed<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
wheel well because you're not allowed to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
wheel well because you're not allowed to
have<00:00:55.079> sharp<00:00:55.379> edges<00:00:55.670> because<00:00:56.670> someone<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.360> cut

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
have sharp edges because someone can cut

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.479 
have sharp edges because someone can cut
themselves<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.079> tetanus<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.190> here's<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
themselves and get tetanus so here's the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.240 
themselves and get tetanus so here's the
only<00:00:59.640> spot<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> rust<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.980> even<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
only spot of rust and even then it's

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.020 
only spot of rust and even then it's
still<00:01:02.430> solid<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:04.339> guess<00:01:05.339> they<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.729> rot<00:01:05.880> out

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
still solid I guess they like to rot out

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.640 
still solid I guess they like to rot out
around<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> dogleg<00:01:06.720> area

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
around the dogleg area

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
around the dogleg area
that<00:01:08.220> one's<00:01:08.369> solid<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> other<00:01:09.479> one

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that one's solid and so is the other one

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.710 
that one's solid and so is the other one
the<00:01:10.530> interior<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.950> pretty<00:01:11.010> clean<00:01:11.570> it's<00:01:12.570> got

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the interior is pretty clean it's got

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.090 
the interior is pretty clean it's got
light<00:01:12.900> interior<00:01:13.140> um

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
light interior um

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
light interior um
it<00:01:14.760> doesn't<00:01:14.970> look<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.420> every<00:01:15.600> anyone

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it doesn't look like really every anyone

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.840 
it doesn't look like really every anyone
ever<00:01:16.110> set<00:01:16.350> back<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:19.310> slow<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> work<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
ever set back here slow got the work to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
ever set back here slow got the work to
slip<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> cuz<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.720> brought<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> home

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
slip on it cuz I just brought it home

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320 
slip on it cuz I just brought it home
yesterday<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.979> did<00:01:23.520> they<00:01:23.610> let<00:01:23.729> me<00:01:23.850> demo<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> for

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
yesterday I did they let me demo it for

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.950 
yesterday I did they let me demo it for
a<00:01:24.479> few<00:01:24.689> days<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.960> make<00:01:25.080> sure<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.259> liked<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
a few days to make sure I liked it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.030 
a few days to make sure I liked it
basically<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.650> care<00:01:28.890> what

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
basically because they don't care what

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.890 
basically because they don't care what
happens<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> car<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.210> long<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.630> back

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
happens to this car as long as it's back

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.440 
happens to this car as long as it's back
in<00:01:31.079> time<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> auction<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.490> they

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in time to go to the auction and they

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.179 
in time to go to the auction and they
can<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.810> somewhat<00:01:34.320> close<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:34.979> paid

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
can get somewhat close to what they paid

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.130 
can get somewhat close to what they paid
for<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
for it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
for it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290

what's<00:03:03.739> wrong<00:03:03.890> with<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:05.709> all<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.800> noticed<00:03:06.950> the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
what's wrong with it all I noticed the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.420 
what's wrong with it all I noticed the
compressor<00:03:07.520> runs<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.850> nothing<00:03:08.090> else<00:03:08.209> happens

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
compressor runs and nothing else happens

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.560 
compressor runs and nothing else happens
maybe<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.670> pressure<00:03:10.880> switch<00:03:11.150> or

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
maybe it's a pressure switch or

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.520 
maybe it's a pressure switch or
condenser<00:03:12.080> or<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.380> honestly<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.130> no<00:03:13.280> idea<00:03:14.530> but

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
condenser or I honestly have no idea but

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.340

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
do that you do the timing belt and when

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.710 
do that you do the timing belt and when
you<00:04:33.640> do<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.820> timing<00:04:34.000> belt<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.360> do<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.570> water

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
you do the timing belt you do the water

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.960 
you do the timing belt you do the water
pump<00:04:34.990> because<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:36.130> water<00:04:36.340> comes<00:04:36.520> driven<00:04:36.850> by

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
pump because the water comes driven by

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:45.480 
pump because the water comes driven by
the<00:04:37.030> timing<00:04:37.330> belt<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:43.290> cup<00:04:44.290> holders<00:04:44.590> got<00:04:45.220> fixed

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
the timing belt so cup holders got fixed

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.159 
the timing belt so cup holders got fixed

because it's becoming winter and then it

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.990 
because it's becoming winter and then it

this car and they also overpaid me for
my<00:05:48.430> trades<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.860> that<00:05:50.950> means<00:05:51.070> they<00:05:51.130> gonna<00:05:51.280> need

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
my trades so that means they gonna need

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.770 
my trades so that means they gonna need
a<00:05:51.400> better<00:05:51.610> price<00:05:51.880> in<00:05:52.060> this<00:05:52.150> car<00:05:54.600> came<00:05:55.600> with<00:05:55.630> a

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
a better price in this car came with a

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.400 
a better price in this car came with a
half<00:05:55.900> tank<00:05:56.140> of<00:05:56.229> gas<00:05:56.380> but<00:05:56.590> I<00:05:56.620> burned<00:05:58.410> probably

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
half tank of gas but I burned probably

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.740 
half tank of gas but I burned probably
about<00:05:59.500> 1/4<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.950> it<00:06:00.010> that<00:06:01.000> seems<00:06:01.240> to<00:06:01.360> go<00:06:01.450> up<00:06:01.600> and

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
about 1/4 of it that seems to go up and

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.000 
about 1/4 of it that seems to go up and
down<00:06:01.900> is<00:06:02.140> probably<00:06:02.410> a<00:06:02.470> little<00:06:02.530> bit<00:06:02.710> less<00:06:02.860> than

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
down is probably a little bit less than

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.350 
down is probably a little bit less than
half<00:06:03.070> when<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.430> got<00:06:03.580> it<00:06:03.729> I<00:06:03.880> can't<00:06:04.210> remember

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360

vehicles<00:06:33.580> and<00:06:33.699> I'm<00:06:33.759> never<00:06:33.969> real<00:06:34.449> crazy<00:06:34.689> but

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
vehicles and I'm never real crazy but

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.679 
vehicles and I'm never real crazy but
spinning<00:06:36.580> Tower<00:06:36.789> was<00:06:36.999> annoying<00:06:37.240> because<00:06:37.539> that

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
spinning Tower was annoying because that

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:43.559 
spinning Tower was annoying because that
got<00:06:37.839> expensive<00:06:38.319> quick<00:06:41.039> but<00:06:42.039> uh<00:06:42.300> the<00:06:43.300> remotes

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:43.569 
got expensive quick but uh the remotes

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.739 
got expensive quick but uh the remotes
also<00:06:43.869> pretty<00:06:44.050> nice<00:06:44.229> being<00:06:44.619> able<00:06:44.709> to<00:06:44.800> do<00:06:44.919> this

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:45.749 
also pretty nice being able to do this

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:51.389 
also pretty nice being able to do this
and<00:06:47.699> the<00:06:48.699> security<00:06:49.089> system<00:06:49.360> does<00:06:49.599> work<00:06:49.899> and<00:06:50.399> it

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:51.399 
and the security system does work and it

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:52.949 
and the security system does work and it
does<00:06:51.580> disable<00:06:52.119> the<00:06:52.240> vehicle<00:06:52.569> it's<00:06:52.779> pretty

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
does disable the vehicle it's pretty

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:54.119 
does disable the vehicle it's pretty
cool<00:06:53.110> actually<00:06:53.319> because<00:06:53.529> if<00:06:53.740> you<00:06:53.830> arm<00:06:54.039> it

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.129 
cool actually because if you arm it

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:55.290 
cool actually because if you arm it
while<00:06:54.309> you're<00:06:54.429> inside<00:06:54.729> then<00:06:54.939> you<00:06:55.029> open<00:06:55.240> the

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
while you're inside then you open the

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.689 
while you're inside then you open the
door<00:06:55.509> the<00:06:56.439> alarm<00:06:56.469> goes<00:06:56.889> off<00:06:57.039> and<00:06:57.249> if<00:06:57.369> you<00:06:57.459> stick

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
door the alarm goes off and if you stick

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:58.949 
door the alarm goes off and if you stick
the<00:06:57.819> key<00:06:57.999> in<00:06:58.029> it<00:06:58.240> and<00:06:58.360> try<00:06:58.449> to<00:06:58.509> start<00:06:58.749> it<00:06:58.839> while

00:06:58.949 --> 00:06:58.959 
the key in it and try to start it while

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:59.639 
the key in it and try to start it while
the<00:06:59.050> alarms<00:06:59.289> go<00:06:59.439> off

00:06:59.639 --> 00:06:59.649 
the alarms go off

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:03.209 
the alarms go off
it<00:06:59.889> doesn't<00:07:01.529> which<00:07:02.529> naturally<00:07:02.979> that's<00:07:03.069> what

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:03.219 
it doesn't which naturally that's what

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:04.559 
it doesn't which naturally that's what
it's<00:07:03.339> supposed<00:07:03.459> to<00:07:03.729> do<00:07:03.909> but<00:07:04.179> I<00:07:04.300> don't<00:07:04.479> have

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:04.569 
it's supposed to do but I don't have

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.149 
it's supposed to do but I don't have
another<00:07:04.809> vehicle<00:07:05.080> with<00:07:05.259> an<00:07:05.349> alarm<00:07:05.649> system<00:07:05.979> so

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:06.159 
another vehicle with an alarm system so

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.670 
another vehicle with an alarm system so
it's<00:07:06.699> pretty<00:07:06.819> cool

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.390 

stop<00:07:11.189> the<00:07:11.310> Saturn<00:07:12.229> and<00:07:13.229> I<00:07:13.560> do<00:07:13.620> have<00:07:13.830> a<00:07:13.889> 96
