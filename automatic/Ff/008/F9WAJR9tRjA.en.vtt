00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
didn't work out it's pretty much what

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830 
didn't work out it's pretty much what
we're<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.060> just<00:01:54.060> paper<00:01:54.390> mache

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
we're going to do is just paper mache

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.430 
we're going to do is just paper mache
the<00:01:55.050> whole<00:01:55.230> thing<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:57.950> make<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> slide<00:01:59.400> and

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the whole thing and make the slide and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.460 
the whole thing and make the slide and
things<00:02:01.440> like<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.650> so<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.420> reason<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:04.440> I

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
things like that so the reason like I

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.280 
things like that so the reason like I
said<00:02:04.740> before<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.310> reason<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.290> cutout

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
said before the reason for this cutout

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.710 
said before the reason for this cutout
here<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.369> find<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.850> whenever<00:02:09.570> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
here is because I find that whenever I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.340 
here is because I find that whenever I
make<00:02:09.930> a<00:02:09.990> magazine<00:02:10.560> release<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.040> goes<00:02:11.990> too<00:02:12.990> far

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
make a magazine release it goes too far

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.070 
make a magazine release it goes too far
into<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.860> handle<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:14.940> create<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
into the handle so I just create like a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.980 
into the handle so I just create like a
little<00:02:17.270> holder<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.090> second<00:02:21.480> line<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> up

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
little holder just a second line it up

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.040 
little holder just a second line it up
as<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.220> see<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.820> still<00:02:24.390> moves<00:02:24.570> freely

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
as you can see it still moves freely

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.360 
as you can see it still moves freely
under<00:02:25.820> under<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> grip<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
under under the grip so I put the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.890 
under under the grip so I put the
magazine<00:02:29.580> in<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.590> press<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> button<00:02:32.900> still

it<00:02:39.170> so<00:02:40.170> um<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.070> up<00:02:41.220> there<00:02:41.430> too<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.030> I'll

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
it so um this is up there too and I'll

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
it so um this is up there too and I'll
keep<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.080> posted<00:02:43.110> i'll<00:02:43.620> probably<00:02:43.830> only<00:02:44.190> be

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
keep you posted i'll probably only be

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.970 
keep you posted i'll probably only be
about<00:02:44.730> three<00:02:45.030> or<00:02:45.060> four<00:02:45.150> updates<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:46.380> total

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
about three or four updates in total

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.940 
about three or four updates in total
maybe<00:02:47.610> five<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.890> don't<00:02:49.890> know<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.220> yeah<00:02:51.120> it's

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
maybe five I don't know that yeah it's

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.390 
maybe five I don't know that yeah it's
really<00:02:52.950> good<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.310> fits<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.820> hand<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.690> well

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
really good it fits in hand really well

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.479 
really good it fits in hand really well
it's<00:02:56.400> uh<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:58.350> lot<00:02:58.560> thinner<00:02:58.950> I'd<00:02:59.190> enough

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
it's uh it's a lot thinner I'd enough

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.280 
it's uh it's a lot thinner I'd enough
you<00:02:59.670> could<00:02:59.790> tell<00:03:00.060> last<00:03:00.360> updates<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.050> lot

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
you could tell last updates a lot

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.760 
you could tell last updates a lot
thinner<00:03:01.650> than<00:03:02.209> my<00:03:03.209> first<00:03:03.600> 1911<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:04.590> this

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
thinner than my first 1911 in this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.380 
thinner than my first 1911 in this
because<00:03:06.380> 1911's<00:03:07.380> are<00:03:07.709> quite<00:03:08.160> thin<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
because 1911's are quite thin in the

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.500 
because 1911's are quite thin in the
frame<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:10.980> didn't<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:11.970> last<00:03:12.030> time<00:03:12.360> but

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
frame so I didn't do that last time but

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.190 
frame so I didn't do that last time but
this<00:03:13.290> time<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.590> did<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.900> that's<00:03:15.900> why<00:03:16.050> it's

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
this time I did and that's why it's

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.260 
this time I did and that's why it's
looking<00:03:16.470> awesome<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.980> yeah<00:03:17.850> i<00:03:17.880> forgot<00:03:18.090> to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
looking awesome and yeah i forgot to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.680 
looking awesome and yeah i forgot to
mention<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.720> trigger<00:03:19.110> that's<00:03:20.090> looking<00:03:21.090> more

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
mention the trigger that's looking more

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.270 
mention the trigger that's looking more
like<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> real<00:03:22.230> one

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.560 

because<00:03:27.280> my<00:03:27.460> last<00:03:27.610> one<00:03:27.820> was<00:03:28.000> this<00:03:28.180> year<00:03:28.300> like

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
because my last one was this year like

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.210 
because my last one was this year like
flat<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:30.340> wasn't<00:03:30.640> very<00:03:30.670> good<00:03:30.850> but<00:03:32.220> yeah

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
flat that wasn't very good but yeah

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.190 
flat that wasn't very good but yeah
that's<00:03:34.180> pretty<00:03:35.110> much<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.380> slide<00:03:36.220> stop<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:37.200> made

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
that's pretty much it slide stop I made

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.620 
that's pretty much it slide stop I made
a<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.740> did<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.610> wrong<00:03:39.760> thing<00:03:39.820> drilling<00:03:40.510> i

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
a I did the wrong thing drilling i

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.840 
a I did the wrong thing drilling i
drooled<00:03:40.930> on<00:03:41.050> an<00:03:41.200> angle<00:03:41.590> see<00:03:42.370> what<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:42.520> do<00:03:42.610> when<00:03:42.790> I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
drooled on an angle see what I do when I

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.120 
drooled on an angle see what I do when I
drilled<00:03:43.180> these<00:03:43.360> two<00:03:43.720> frame<00:03:44.440> bit<00:03:44.650> since<00:03:44.860> i<00:03:44.980> had

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
drilled these two frame bit since i had

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.740 
drilled these two frame bit since i had
them<00:03:45.310> next<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.730> each<00:03:45.790> other<00:03:46.000> like<00:03:46.180> clamped

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
them next to each other like clamped

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.460 
them next to each other like clamped
together<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.010> slightly<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:50.110> know<00:03:50.230> like

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
together but I slightly you know like

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.190 
together but I slightly you know like
not<00:03:50.860> perfectly<00:03:51.310> straight<00:03:51.690> so<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.990> holes

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
not perfectly straight so the holes

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.700 
not perfectly straight so the holes
aren't<00:03:53.860> perfectly<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:54.910> line<00:03:54.940> that's<00:03:55.480> why<00:03:55.720> the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
aren't perfectly in line that's why the

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.500 
aren't perfectly in line that's why the
slide<00:03:57.700> stocks<00:03:58.060> got<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.450> be<00:03:58.510> on<00:03:58.630> an<00:03:58.720> angle<00:03:59.460> but

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
slide stocks got to be on an angle but

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.350 
slide stocks got to be on an angle but
that<00:04:01.510> doesn't<00:04:01.870> affect<00:04:02.520> its<00:04:03.520> movement<00:04:04.030> in<00:04:04.180> any

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
that doesn't affect its movement in any

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.470 
that doesn't affect its movement in any
way<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:06.010> it's<00:04:06.130> fine<00:04:07.230> yeah<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:09.400> thanks<00:04:10.360> for

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
way so it's fine yeah so thanks for

way so it's fine yeah so thanks for
