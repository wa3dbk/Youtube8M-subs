think that everybody's capable but it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.930 
think that everybody's capable but it
takes<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.680> lot<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:27.860> focus<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.340> lot<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.460> dedication

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
takes a lot of focus a lot of dedication

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.300 
takes a lot of focus a lot of dedication
it's<00:01:29.570> not<00:01:29.840> easy<00:01:30.170> it's<00:01:30.470> not<00:01:30.650> as<00:01:30.770> easy<00:01:30.980> as<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
it's not easy it's not as easy as it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.040 
it's not easy it's not as easy as it
looks<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:32.180> it's<00:01:32.300> something<00:01:32.480> you<00:01:32.630> know<00:01:32.900> if<00:01:32.960> you

two feet yeah everything everything that

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.130 
two feet yeah everything everything that
we<00:02:04.100> do<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:04.430> calculated<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.270> have<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.450> full<00:02:05.720> safety

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
we do is calculated I have a full safety

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.510 
we do is calculated I have a full safety
crew<00:02:06.380> there's<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.710> lot<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.979> mathematics

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
crew there's a lot of mathematics

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.540 
crew there's a lot of mathematics
involved<00:02:07.929> all<00:02:08.929> my<00:02:09.200> ramps<00:02:09.619> are<00:02:09.739> built<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.280> spec

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
involved all my ramps are built to spec

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.430 
involved all my ramps are built to spec
with<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.910> computer<00:02:11.300> program<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.930> we<00:02:12.080> have<00:02:12.260> an

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
with a computer program so we have an

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.640 
with a computer program so we have an
idea<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.110> come<00:02:15.260> up<00:02:15.290> with<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
idea and then I have to come up with the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.470 
idea and then I have to come up with the
other<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:16.670> know<00:02:16.790> million<00:02:17.150> things<00:02:17.330> that

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
other you know million things that

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.300 
other you know million things that
possibly<00:02:18.380> could<00:02:18.590> go<00:02:18.680> wrong<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.070> we<00:02:19.160> hope

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
possibly could go wrong that we hope

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.040 
possibly could go wrong that we hope
doesn't<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:19.940> there<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.660> there's<00:02:20.900> definitely

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
doesn't so there is there's definitely

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.810 
doesn't so there is there's definitely
science<00:02:21.620> behind<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.670> shot

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
science behind it it's not just a shot

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.470 
science behind it it's not just a shot

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
no absolutely so kids be safe so how do

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.810 
no absolutely so kids be safe so how do
we<00:02:26.750> top<00:02:27.020> that<00:02:27.050> well<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.190> time<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.489> more
