00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
cool concept this one in particular is a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
cool concept this one in particular is a
little<00:00:51.300> more<00:00:51.420> opaque<00:00:51.660> than<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> other<00:00:52.110> stain

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

glosses<00:00:52.829> I've<00:00:52.980> tried<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
glosses I've tried and it's just kind of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
glosses I've tried and it's just kind of
a<00:00:54.390> creamy<00:00:54.629> beige<00:00:54.899> color<00:00:55.260> which<00:00:55.469> would<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.710> kind

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
a creamy beige color which would be kind

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
a creamy beige color which would be kind
of<00:00:56.070> good<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.219> nudes<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.300> say<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of good for nudes I will say that it is

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
of good for nudes I will say that it is
a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:58.170> more<00:00:58.289> opaque<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> does<00:00:59.160> kind<00:00:59.579> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
a little more opaque so it does kind of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.959 
a little more opaque so it does kind of
gather<00:00:59.910> into<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> lines<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.719> lips<00:01:01.820> next<00:01:02.820> up

which<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.920> definitely<00:01:26.189> an<00:01:26.580> interesting<00:01:26.729> color

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
which is definitely an interesting color

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.539 
which is definitely an interesting color
this<00:01:28.229> could<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.470> great<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.799> Halloween<00:01:29.100> I

lips<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.140> wouldn't<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.890> recommend

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
lips so I wouldn't really recommend

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730
