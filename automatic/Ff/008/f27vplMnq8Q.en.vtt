00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
doing a terrible job snipe that's what I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
doing a terrible job snipe that's what I
do<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.570> entire<00:00:30.869> game<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.500> haven't

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
do the entire game if you haven't

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
do the entire game if you haven't
figured<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.009> yet<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:35.510> there's<00:00:36.510> four

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
figured that out yet so there's four

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
figured that out yet so there's four
upgrade<00:00:37.350> categories<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> gun<00:00:38.910> yeah

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
upgrade categories for the gun yeah

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.610 
upgrade categories for the gun yeah
there<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.230> grow<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.090> there<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.620> handling

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there is a grow and there is handling

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.610 
there is a grow and there is handling
and<00:00:43.770> precision<00:00:44.280> handling<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.820> precision<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
and precision handling and precision and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.240 
and precision handling and precision and
damage<00:00:46.620> mm-hmm<00:00:47.539> now<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:49.200> not<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:50.129> hundred

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
damage mm-hmm now I'm not one hundred

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.410 
damage mm-hmm now I'm not one hundred
percent<00:00:50.430> sure<00:00:50.700> what<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> difference<00:00:51.120> between

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
percent sure what the difference between

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.860 
percent sure what the difference between
handling<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.170> precision<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:52.920> i<00:00:52.980> believe

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
handling and precision is but i believe

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.680 
handling and precision is but i believe
handling<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.149> you<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
handling right about this you I be I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.130 
handling right about this you I be I
believe<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.289> handling<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> amount<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
believe that handling is the amount of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.270 
believe that handling is the amount of
recoil<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.030> gun<00:01:03.300> has<00:01:04.100> when<00:01:05.100> you're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
recoil that your gun has when you're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.630 
recoil that your gun has when you're
like<00:01:05.430> holding<00:01:05.670> down<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> trigger<00:01:06.330> mm-hmm<00:01:07.110> so

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
like holding down the trigger mm-hmm so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.690 
like holding down the trigger mm-hmm so
hmm<00:01:09.140> what<00:01:10.140> did<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.670> know

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
hmm what did you think it was I you know

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
hmm what did you think it was I you know
how<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.210> guns<00:01:12.510> seem<00:01:12.810> more<00:01:12.990> wobbly<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.770> thought

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
how some guns seem more wobbly I thought

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
how some guns seem more wobbly I thought
that<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:14.820> precision<00:01:15.450> oh<00:01:15.890> okay<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.159> i

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that was precision oh okay that's all i

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.520 
that was precision oh okay that's all i
care<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.610> even<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.180> scoped<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
care so even if you're scoped in with a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
care so even if you're scoped in with a
sniper<00:01:19.770> rifle<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.850> very<00:01:21.030> high

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
sniper rifle and you have a very high

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
sniper rifle and you have a very high
precision<00:01:21.479> thing<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.979> yeah<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
precision thing right kind of yeah the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490 
precision thing right kind of yeah the
high<00:01:23.880> precision<00:01:24.299> will<00:01:24.689> be<00:01:24.780> much<00:01:24.960> easier<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
high precision will be much easier to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.569 
high precision will be much easier to
aim<00:01:25.880> whereas<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.479> handling<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.290> an<00:01:29.250> assault

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
aim whereas the handling on an assault

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.990 
aim whereas the handling on an assault
rifle<00:01:30.439> is<00:01:31.439> important<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
rifle is important but it all but the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.399 
rifle is important but it all but the
precision<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.600> also<00:01:33.840> important<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.170> sniper

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
precision is also important on sniper

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.350 
precision is also important on sniper
rifle<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.159> assault<00:01:35.759> rifle<00:01:35.970> too<00:01:36.090> because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
rifle or on assault rifle too because

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.050 
rifle or on assault rifle too because
later<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.900> game<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.470> some<00:01:38.060> 2

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
later on in the game when you get some 2

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.510 
later on in the game when you get some 2
x<00:01:39.270> optical<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.869> 3x<00:01:40.170> optical<00:01:40.350> scopes<00:01:40.920> mm-hmm

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
x optical and 3x optical scopes mm-hmm

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.929 
x optical and 3x optical scopes mm-hmm
then<00:01:42.500> you're<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.740> scoped<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
then you're going to be scoped in like a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.999 
then you're going to be scoped in like a
sniper<00:01:45.240> rifle<00:01:45.420> most<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> time<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.799> when<00:01:46.920> you

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
sniper rifle most the time and when you

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.289 
sniper rifle most the time and when you
can<00:01:47.250> buy<00:01:47.460> those<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.820> definitely<00:01:48.090> recommend

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
can buy those I definitely recommend

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.380 
can buy those I definitely recommend
that<00:01:48.689> they<00:01:48.840> make<00:01:49.020> them<00:01:49.729> much<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.939> effective

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that they make them much more effective

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.920 
that they make them much more effective
weapons<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.680> keep<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.009> range<00:01:53.280> from

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
weapons and you can keep your range from

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.260 
weapons and you can keep your range from
the<00:01:54.930> bad<00:01:55.110> guys<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.890> lot<00:01:56.189> longer<00:01:56.399> yeah<00:01:57.060> which

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the bad guys for a lot longer yeah which

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.569 
the bad guys for a lot longer yeah which
is<00:01:57.299> always<00:01:58.020> helpful<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> does<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.430> any

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
is always helpful so I does not get any

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.690 
is always helpful so I does not get any
game<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.240> mean<00:02:01.159> what<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.579> got

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
to be revived oh and this took me a

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.830 
to be revived oh and this took me a
little<00:03:51.780> bit<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.020> figure<00:03:52.170> out<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.500> hold<00:03:53.010> down<00:03:53.840> RB

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
little bit to figure out to hold down RB

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.600 
little bit to figure out to hold down RB
I<00:03:55.050> believe<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.860> throw<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.130> grenade<00:03:56.250> and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
I believe it is to throw a grenade and

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.160 
I believe it is to throw a grenade and
when<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.420> hold<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.690> down<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.500> get<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.710> little

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170
