bike fit if all we want to do is get

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.680 
bike fit if all we want to do is get
your<00:00:05.430> sample<00:00:05.759> in<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.910> right<00:00:06.089> place<00:00:06.330> that's

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
your sample in the right place that's

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.629 
your sample in the right place that's
not<00:00:06.930> actually<00:00:07.170> necessary<00:00:07.950> here<00:00:08.429> are<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.610> few

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
not actually necessary here are a few

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.430 
not actually necessary here are a few
simple<00:00:09.120> steps<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.540> will<00:00:09.809> mean<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.170> can

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
simple steps that will mean that you can

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.169 
simple steps that will mean that you can
get<00:00:10.530> your<00:00:10.679> several<00:00:11.040> position<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:12.000> right

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
get your several position in the right

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.970 
get your several position in the right
place<00:00:12.540> now<00:00:13.080> at<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> end<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.500> video<00:00:13.710> also

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
place now at the end of the video also

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.099 
place now at the end of the video also
compare<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.150> current<00:00:15.420> saddle<00:00:15.929> height

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
compare it to my current saddle height

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.960 
compare it to my current saddle height
and<00:00:16.440> position<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.160> then<00:00:17.490> we'll<00:00:17.580> see<00:00:17.789> whether

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and position and then we'll see whether

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.550 
and position and then we'll see whether
or<00:00:18.119> not<00:00:18.210> these<00:00:18.420> methods<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:19.109> actually<00:00:19.380> got

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
or not these methods have actually got

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.439 
or not these methods have actually got
me<00:00:19.680> close<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.189> where<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> need<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> be

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
me close to where I need to be

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.240 
me close to where I need to be
we'll<00:00:21.810> start<00:00:22.020> by<00:00:22.199> adjusting<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.859> saddle

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
we'll start by adjusting the saddle

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.920 
we'll start by adjusting the saddle
height<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> great<00:00:23.939> way<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.119> doing<00:00:24.240> this<00:00:24.570> is

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
height now a great way of doing this is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
height now a great way of doing this is
to<00:00:25.019> put<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.380> bike<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:25.980> indoor<00:00:26.189> trainer

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
to put your bike on an indoor trainer

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.800 
to put your bike on an indoor trainer
but<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.060> actually<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.570> out<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
but you can actually do it out on the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.620 
but you can actually do it out on the
road<00:00:27.990> as<00:00:28.109> well<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.680> careful<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.670> jump<00:00:30.539> on

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
road as well just be careful so jump on

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.659 
road as well just be careful so jump on
your<00:00:30.750> bike<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.349> want<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> put<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> heel<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
your bike you want to put the heel of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.030 
your bike you want to put the heel of
your<00:00:32.820> foot<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.050> pedal<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.559> at<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.829> point

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
your foot on the pedal and at this point

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
your foot on the pedal and at this point
your<00:00:35.340> legs<00:00:35.550> should<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.760> locked<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.020> we're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
your legs should be locked out but we're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.500 
your legs should be locked out but we're
also<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:38.850> try<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.059> pedal

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
also now going to actually try and pedal

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.440 
also now going to actually try and pedal
to<00:00:40.140> make<00:00:40.320> sure<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.460> pelvis<00:00:41.730> isn't

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to make sure that your pelvis isn't

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.090 
to make sure that your pelvis isn't
rocking<00:00:42.930> from<00:00:43.110> side<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.379> side<00:00:43.559> it's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
rocking from side to side it's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
rocking from side to side it's
remarkably<00:00:44.579> difficult<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
remarkably difficult so you can see that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.959 
remarkably difficult so you can see that
my<00:00:46.200> leg<00:00:46.469> isn't<00:00:46.710> quite<00:00:47.250> locked<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
my leg isn't quite locked out at the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.690 
my leg isn't quite locked out at the
bottom<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> stroke<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.559> perhaps<00:00:50.129> please

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
bottom of the stroke so I perhaps please

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.860 
bottom of the stroke so I perhaps please
put<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.000> seat<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.539> bit

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
put my seat up a little bit

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.389 
put my seat up a little bit
I<00:00:53.420> think<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.570> ballpark<00:00:55.190> right<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
I think that's ballpark right with a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.700 
I think that's ballpark right with a
saddle<00:00:56.730> height<00:00:56.940> roughly<00:00:57.390> ballpark<00:00:58.140> we're<00:00:58.590> now

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
saddle height roughly ballpark we're now

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.490 
saddle height roughly ballpark we're now
going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> look<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.699> for<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.539> after<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.199> seat

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
going to look how for or after your seat

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
going to look how for or after your seat
is<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.059> adjustment<00:01:03.510> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
is now to do that the adjustment is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
is now to do that the adjustment is
normally<00:01:03.870> made<00:01:04.049> by<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.500> loosening<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.100> or

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
normally made by just loosening one or

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
normally made by just loosening one or
two<00:01:05.460> bolts<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.390> seat<00:01:06.630> post<00:01:06.840> here

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
two bolts on the seat post here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
two bolts on the seat post here
depending<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> design<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.119> before

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
depending on the design of it and before

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
depending on the design of it and before
we<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:09.600> start<00:01:10.229> i've<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> stress

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
we actually start i've got to stress

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.310 
we actually start i've got to stress
that<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.729> bike<00:01:11.970> must<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.330> completely<00:01:12.960> leveled

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that the bike must be completely leveled

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
that the bike must be completely leveled
so<00:01:13.500> we've<00:01:13.619> already<00:01:13.799> been<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so we've already been at it with a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.120 
so we've already been at it with a
spirit<00:01:15.450> level<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:16.020> sure<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.920> is

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
spirit level to make sure that this is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.940 
spirit level to make sure that this is
going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> work<00:01:17.659> then<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.350> case<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> using

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
going to work then it's a case of using

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.140 
going to work then it's a case of using
a<00:01:20.250> plumb<00:01:21.000> line<00:01:21.170> hmm<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.830> your<00:01:22.950> feet<00:01:23.220> in

a plumb line hmm with your feet in
normal<00:01:24.540> riding<00:01:24.840> position<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.670> want<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
normal riding position now you want to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.020 
normal riding position now you want to
have<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.420> cranks<00:01:27.869> horizontal<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
have your cranks horizontal and then you

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.870 
have your cranks horizontal and then you
need<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.270> drop<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.810> plumb<00:01:31.259> line<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.880> the

that<00:01:36.600> should<00:01:37.909> bisect<00:01:38.909> your<00:01:39.840> pedal<00:01:40.259> axle<00:01:40.650> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that should bisect your pedal axle so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.580 
that should bisect your pedal axle so
this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.000> called<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> cops<00:01:42.750> method<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this is called the cops method and it

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.109 
this is called the cops method and it
does<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.829> its<00:01:43.950> critics<00:01:44.369> we'd<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> first

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
does have its critics we'd be the first

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.580 
does have its critics we'd be the first
to<00:01:45.479> admit<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.780> fact<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.409> got<00:01:46.560> its

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to admit in fact that it's got its

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.649 
to admit in fact that it's got its
limitations<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:48.450> need<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
limitations so you will need to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.289 
limitations so you will need to
fine-tune<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.979> depending<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.520> what<00:01:51.060> sort

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
fine-tune kind of depending on what sort

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
fine-tune kind of depending on what sort
of<00:01:51.329> rider<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.439> ride<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.979> quite<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
of rider you are if you ride in quite a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
of rider you are if you ride in quite a
stretched<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.790> position<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.689> you'll

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
stretched out position then you'll

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.060 
stretched out position then you'll
probably<00:01:54.990> find<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> need<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> move<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
probably find that you need to move the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
probably find that you need to move the
saddle<00:01:56.399> forward<00:01:56.729> slightly<00:01:56.939> whereas<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.780> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
saddle forward slightly whereas if you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.389 
saddle forward slightly whereas if you
ride<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> very<00:01:58.469> relaxed<00:01:58.740> position<00:01:58.979> with

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
ride in a very relaxed position with

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.429 
ride in a very relaxed position with
upright<00:01:59.880> handlebars<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.810> shorter<00:02:01.200> stem

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
upright handlebars and a shorter stem

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.429 
upright handlebars and a shorter stem
then<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.829> may<00:02:02.009> need<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.369> backwards<00:02:03.439> next

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
then you may need to go backwards next

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.050 
then you may need to go backwards next
it's<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:05.040> important<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> make<00:02:05.759> sure<00:02:05.790> your

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it's really important to make sure your

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.779 
it's really important to make sure your
saddle<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.659> level<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:08.099> it's<00:02:08.280> tilted<00:02:08.670> up

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
saddle is level if it's tilted up

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.520 
saddle is level if it's tilted up
slightly<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.599> put<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.319> bit<00:02:10.410> too

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
slightly it can put a little bit too

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.290 
slightly it can put a little bit too
much<00:02:10.679> pressure<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.310> some<00:02:11.550> rather<00:02:11.700> sensitive

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
much pressure on some rather sensitive

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.460 
much pressure on some rather sensitive
areas<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.840> if<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
areas and if it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.920 
areas and if it
pointed<00:02:13.770> too<00:02:14.190> far<00:02:14.400> down<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.570> puts<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> lot

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
pointed too far down then it puts a lot

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.270 
pointed too far down then it puts a lot
more<00:02:16.110> weight<00:02:16.320> through<00:02:16.590> your<00:02:16.620> hands<00:02:17.130> and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
more weight through your hands and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.190 
more weight through your hands and
you'll<00:02:17.550> find<00:02:17.880> yourself<00:02:18.210> constantly<00:02:18.420> sliding

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you'll find yourself constantly sliding

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.100 
you'll find yourself constantly sliding
forward<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.860> saddle<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:21.690> think<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
forward on the saddle so we think the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.140 
forward on the saddle so we think the
horizontal<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.920> best<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.460> you're<00:02:23.700> racing<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
horizontal is best if you're racing the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.730 
horizontal is best if you're racing the
UCI<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:24.690> tell<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:25.590> it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
UCI I tell you you have to have it

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.040 
UCI I tell you you have to have it
horizontally<00:02:26.220> anyway<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:27.210> check<00:02:27.450> all<00:02:27.810> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
horizontally anyway and to check all it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.320 
horizontally anyway and to check all it
is<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.470> case<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.950> getting<00:02:29.520> your<00:02:29.610> trusty<00:02:30.060> spirit

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
is is case of getting your trusty spirit

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.850 
is is case of getting your trusty spirit
level<00:02:30.540> out<00:02:30.630> again<00:02:30.900> making<00:02:31.200> sure<00:02:31.350> your<00:02:31.500> bike<00:02:31.650> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
level out again making sure your bike is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.830 
level out again making sure your bike is
on<00:02:31.920> level<00:02:32.430> ground<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:33.270> adjusting<00:02:33.720> it

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
on level ground and then adjusting it

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.460 
on level ground and then adjusting it
accordingly

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
accordingly

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.890 
accordingly
so<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.190> need<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> pull<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.580> slightly<00:02:36.300> nose

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
so we need to pull that slightly nose

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.630 
so we need to pull that slightly nose
down<00:02:37.320> once<00:02:37.500> you've<00:02:37.650> performed<00:02:37.950> those<00:02:38.280> three

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
down once you've performed those three

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.010 
down once you've performed those three
measurements<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.210> then<00:02:39.360> need<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.540> jump<00:02:39.810> back

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
measurements you then need to jump back

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.660 
measurements you then need to jump back
on<00:02:40.200> your<00:02:40.320> bike<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.740> go<00:02:40.920> through<00:02:41.130> all<00:02:41.190> again

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
on your bike and go through all again

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.830 
on your bike and go through all again
because<00:02:41.820> obviously<00:02:42.270> if<00:02:42.480> you've<00:02:42.750> adjusted

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
because obviously if you've adjusted

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.780 
because obviously if you've adjusted
your<00:02:43.140> saddle<00:02:43.530> height<00:02:43.710> after<00:02:44.160> you've<00:02:44.580> done

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
your saddle height after you've done

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.550 
your saddle height after you've done
forward<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.420> backward<00:02:45.780> then<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.200> will<00:02:46.380> have

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
forward and backward then that will have

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.680 
forward and backward then that will have
a<00:02:46.590> bearing<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.130> where<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.550> seat<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.970> placed<00:02:48.300> if

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a bearing on where the seat is placed if

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.080 
a bearing on where the seat is placed if
you<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:49.080> get<00:02:49.500> someone<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> film<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.820> whilst

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
you can get someone to film you whilst

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.030 
you can get someone to film you whilst
you're<00:02:51.300> riding<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.080> turbo<00:02:52.470> trainer<00:02:52.770> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
you're riding on the turbo trainer and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
you're riding on the turbo trainer and
then<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.430> can<00:02:53.550> get<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.700> real<00:02:54.000> idea<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.480> how<00:02:54.750> you

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
then you can get a real idea of how you

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
then you can get a real idea of how you
look<00:02:55.080> when<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.350> ride<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.800> particularly<00:02:56.400> want

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
look when you ride you particularly want

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
look when you ride you particularly want
to<00:02:57.150> pay<00:02:57.240> close<00:02:57.510> attention<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.680> pelvis

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
to pay close attention to your pelvis

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.530 
to pay close attention to your pelvis
you<00:02:59.430> don't<00:02:59.640> want<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.820> rocking<00:03:00.240> at<00:03:00.360> all

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
you don't want that rocking at all

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.699 
you don't want that rocking at all
because<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.050> get<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:01.350> quite

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
because that can get really quite

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.580 
because that can get really quite
uncomfortable<00:03:02.120> now<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.570> also<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.410> say

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
uncomfortable now do also have to say

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.190 
uncomfortable now do also have to say
that<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:05.400> get<00:03:05.610> your<00:03:06.000> really<00:03:06.330> personal<00:03:06.990> bike

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
that to get your really personal bike

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.690 
that to get your really personal bike
fit<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.160> do<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.520> take<00:03:08.640> into

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
fit then you do have to take into

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.860 
fit then you do have to take into
account<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.270> number<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.540> other<00:03:09.690> different

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
account a number of other different

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.960 
account a number of other different
factors<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.620> your<00:03:11.130> flexibility<00:03:11.670> for

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
factors that your flexibility for

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.699 
factors that your flexibility for
example<00:03:12.420> or<00:03:12.600> perhaps<00:03:12.990> more<00:03:13.230> importantly

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
example or perhaps more importantly

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.020 
example or perhaps more importantly
whether<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.190> pedal<00:03:14.550> with<00:03:14.640> your<00:03:14.760> toe<00:03:15.000> down

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
whether you pedal with your toe down

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.390 
whether you pedal with your toe down
where<00:03:15.720> your<00:03:15.840> heel<00:03:16.050> down<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.530> has<00:03:16.709> quite

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
where your heel down and that has quite

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.220 
where your heel down and that has quite
significant<00:03:18.030> bearing<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.660> your<00:03:18.840> saddle

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
significant bearing on your saddle

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.320 
significant bearing on your saddle
height<00:03:19.410> for<00:03:19.560> example<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:20.250> once<00:03:20.970> you've<00:03:21.120> got<00:03:21.300> it

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
height for example so once you've got it

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.630 
height for example so once you've got it
ballpark<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.709> fine-tune<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.459> to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
ballpark then you can fine-tune it to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.280 
ballpark then you can fine-tune it to
make<00:03:23.790> sure<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.360> are<00:03:24.480> comfortable<00:03:24.840> and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
make sure that you are comfortable and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.449 
make sure that you are comfortable and
powerful<00:03:26.600> powerful<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.010> set<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.280> very

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
powerful powerful so you set at the very

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.340 
powerful powerful so you set at the very
beginning<00:03:29.820> there<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.060> some<00:03:30.300> debate<00:03:30.630> as<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.050> how

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
beginning there is some debate as to how

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.040 
beginning there is some debate as to how
you<00:03:31.410> find<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.100> exact<00:03:32.519> saddle<00:03:33.300> height<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.810> you

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
you find the exact saddle height for you

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.930 
you find the exact saddle height for you
but<00:03:34.890> here<00:03:35.310> are<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.400> couple<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.670> other<00:03:35.760> methods

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
but here are a couple of other methods

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.460 
but here are a couple of other methods
that<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.300> might<00:03:36.450> want<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.660> try<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.170> see

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that you might want to try to see

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.750 
that you might want to try to see
whether<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.769> can<00:03:37.890> get<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.370> bit<00:03:38.400> more

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
whether you can get it a bit more

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.000 
whether you can get it a bit more
fine-tuned<00:03:39.360> now<00:03:39.989> first<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.380> all<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.769> have

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
fine-tuned now first of all do you have

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.780 
fine-tuned now first of all do you have
a<00:03:41.250> goniometer<00:03:42.470> no<00:03:43.470> no<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.220> didn't<00:03:44.489> think<00:03:44.580> so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
a goniometer no no I didn't think so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.729 
a goniometer no no I didn't think so
neither<00:03:45.330> do<00:03:45.510> we<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.720> fact<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.290> can<00:03:46.530> pick

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
neither do we in fact but you can pick

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.979 
neither do we in fact but you can pick
them<00:03:46.830> up<00:03:46.980> for<00:03:47.459> not<00:03:47.580> too<00:03:47.700> much<00:03:47.730> money<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.420> if

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
them up for not too much money and if

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.720 
them up for not too much money and if
you<00:03:49.350> get<00:03:49.560> one<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:50.010> what<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.220> does<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.430> it

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
you get one then what it does is it

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
you get one then what it does is it
allows<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.330> do<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.600> Holmes<00:03:51.959> method<00:03:52.560> now

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
allows you to do the Holmes method now

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.940 
allows you to do the Holmes method now
essentially<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:54.570> allows<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.200> measure<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
essentially it allows you to measure the

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.190 
essentially it allows you to measure the
angle<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.580> your<00:03:57.090> shin<00:03:57.360> bone<00:03:57.570> in<00:03:57.810> relation<00:03:58.170> to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
angle of your shin bone in relation to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.470 
angle of your shin bone in relation to
your<00:03:58.350> thigh<00:03:58.650> bone<00:03:58.970> Holmes<00:03:59.970> worked<00:04:00.239> out

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
your thigh bone Holmes worked out

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.570 
your thigh bone Holmes worked out
through<00:04:00.630> quite<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.900> lot<00:04:00.989> of<00:04:01.410> research<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.160> the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
through quite a lot of research that the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.020 
through quite a lot of research that the
optimum<00:04:03.060> angle<00:04:03.239> for<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.560> bit<00:04:04.799> here<00:04:05.070> was<00:04:05.340> 25

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
optimum angle for this bit here was 25

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.270 
optimum angle for this bit here was 25
to<00:04:06.660> 30<00:04:06.930> degrees<00:04:07.470> when<00:04:07.830> you're<00:04:07.950> at<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.070> bottom

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
to 30 degrees when you're at the bottom

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.590 
to 30 degrees when you're at the bottom
of<00:04:08.519> your<00:04:08.580> pedal<00:04:09.150> stroke

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
of your pedal stroke

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.050 
of your pedal stroke
another<00:04:10.290> method<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:11.010> measure<00:04:11.190> your<00:04:11.370> inside

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
another method is to measure your inside

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.880 
another method is to measure your inside

leg and I'm going to apologize at this
point<00:04:14.100> we're<00:04:14.700> trying<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.330> way<00:04:15.480> of

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
point we're trying to think of a way of

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.060 
point we're trying to think of a way of
doing<00:04:15.600> this<00:04:15.870> without<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.500> looking<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:16.830> weird

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
doing this without it looking so weird

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.659 
doing this without it looking so weird
but<00:04:17.790> we<00:04:18.239> can't<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.680> best<00:04:19.859> way<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.609> a

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
but we can't so the best way is to get a

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.480 
but we can't so the best way is to get a
long<00:04:20.880> spirit<00:04:21.209> level<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.919> put<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.039> between<00:04:23.160> your

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
the sensation of a saddle and then

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.470 
the sensation of a saddle and then
measure<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.250> distance<00:04:30.700> from<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.210> end<00:04:31.330> of

your spinnable I'm not joking to the

anyone they don't want to measure it we

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.500 
anyone they don't want to measure it we

take<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.570> note<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.970> right<00:04:51.970> going<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.720> this

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
take a note of that right going to this

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
take a note of that right going to this
my<00:04:53.500> inseam<00:04:54.160> is<00:04:56.250> well<00:04:58.710> 875<00:04:59.730> millimeters<00:05:01.890> then

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
my inseam is well 875 millimeters then

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.570 
my inseam is well 875 millimeters then
the<00:05:03.550> next<00:05:03.790> CD<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:05.380> take<00:05:05.920> away<00:05:06.100> 10

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
the next CD is you take away 10

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.850 
the next CD is you take away 10
centimeters<00:05:07.240> from<00:05:07.390> that<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:08.050> that<00:05:08.500> gives<00:05:08.740> you

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
centimeters from that and that gives you

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.500 
centimeters from that and that gives you
your<00:05:08.890> saddle<00:05:09.430> height<00:05:09.550> value<00:05:09.910> when<00:05:10.120> measured

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
your saddle height value when measured

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.030 
your saddle height value when measured
from<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:11.290> center<00:05:11.320> of<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.740> bottom<00:05:11.890> bracket

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.270 
from the center of the bottom bracket
axle<00:05:12.640> to<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.450> top<00:05:13.690> of<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.020> saddle<00:05:14.440> in<00:05:14.590> line

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
axle to the top of the saddle in line

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.050 
axle to the top of the saddle in line
with<00:05:15.640> your<00:05:15.730> seat<00:05:15.970> post<00:05:17.160> complicated<00:05:18.160> so<00:05:18.850> there

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
with your seat post complicated so there

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.850 
with your seat post complicated so there
we<00:05:19.150> have<00:05:19.300> three<00:05:19.630> methods<00:05:19.930> for<00:05:20.650> calculating

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
we have three methods for calculating

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.680 
we have three methods for calculating
your<00:05:21.310> saddle<00:05:21.640> height<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:22.150> one<00:05:22.450> of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
your saddle height and one of

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.750 
your saddle height and one of
calculating<00:05:23.440> how<00:05:23.530> forward<00:05:24.040> or<00:05:24.190> backward<00:05:24.670> it

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
calculating how forward or backward it

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.670 
calculating how forward or backward it
needs<00:05:24.940> to<00:05:25.150> be<00:05:25.360> but<00:05:25.990> we<00:05:26.080> said<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.260> beginning

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
needs to be but we said the beginning

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.620 
needs to be but we said the beginning
the<00:05:26.740> video<00:05:26.980> that<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.490> test<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.180> see<00:05:28.210> how<00:05:28.600> it

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
the video that I test it to see how it

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.930 
the video that I test it to see how it
relates<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.200> my<00:05:29.500> own<00:05:29.650> personal<00:05:29.890> position<00:05:30.580> that

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
relates to my own personal position that

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.940 
relates to my own personal position that
I've<00:05:31.060> honed<00:05:31.330> over<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:32.020> years<00:05:32.260> so<00:05:32.620> first

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
I've honed over the years so first

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.680 
I've honed over the years so first
things<00:05:33.130> first<00:05:33.190> this<00:05:33.700> is<00:05:33.970> currently<00:05:34.240> set<00:05:34.480> up

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
things first this is currently set up

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.320 
things first this is currently set up
for<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.110> heel<00:05:35.350> method<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:36.100> I'll<00:05:37.060> measure

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
for the heel method and I'll measure

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.390 
for the heel method and I'll measure
from<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.750> center<00:05:37.930> button<00:05:38.440> bracket<00:05:38.860> up<00:05:39.100> to<00:05:39.280> the

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
from the center button bracket up to the

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.710 
from the center button bracket up to the
top<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.670> a<00:05:39.730> saddle<00:05:40.090> and<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.630> comes<00:05:40.870> out<00:05:41.050> at<00:05:42.720> 760

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
top of a saddle and it comes out at 760

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.660 
top of a saddle and it comes out at 760
millimeters<00:05:44.410> now<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:45.070> is<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.370> quite

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
millimeters now that is a quite

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.870 
millimeters now that is a quite
significant<00:05:46.420> 15<00:05:47.020> millimeters<00:05:47.710> below<00:05:48.190> where<00:05:48.850> I

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
significant 15 millimeters below where I

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.300 
significant 15 millimeters below where I
think<00:05:49.390> I<00:05:49.540> should<00:05:49.780> be<00:05:49.810> which<00:05:50.170> is<00:05:50.310> 775

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
think I should be which is 775

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.520 
think I should be which is 775
millimeters<00:05:51.850> but<00:05:52.360> interestingly<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:53.110> final

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
millimeters but interestingly the final

millimeters but interestingly the final
method<00:05:53.860> of<00:05:54.100> measuring<00:05:54.400> my<00:05:54.550> inseam<00:05:54.730> actually

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
method of measuring my inseam actually

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.600 
method of measuring my inseam actually
gave<00:05:55.810> me<00:05:55.930> exactly<00:05:56.050> that<00:05:56.770> figure<00:05:57.160> seven

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
gave me exactly that figure seven

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.980 
gave me exactly that figure seven
hundred<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:57.940> seventy<00:05:58.180> five<00:05:58.300> millimeters<00:05:58.840> now

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
hundred and seventy five millimeters now

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.380 
hundred and seventy five millimeters now
that<00:05:59.710> doesn't<00:05:59.950> really<00:06:00.130> mean<00:06:00.430> anything<00:06:00.460> for

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
that doesn't really mean anything for

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.300 
that doesn't really mean anything for
the<00:06:01.450> general<00:06:01.750> population<00:06:02.260> but<00:06:02.560> perhaps<00:06:02.920> in

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
the general population but perhaps in

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.310 
the general population but perhaps in
this<00:06:03.490> instance<00:06:03.910> for<00:06:04.000> me<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.510> inseam<00:06:04.930> method

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
this instance for me the inseam method

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.760 
this instance for me the inseam method
was<00:06:05.440> better<00:06:05.760> however<00:06:06.760> I<00:06:07.240> do<00:06:08.140> have<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.530> say

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
was better however I do have to say

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.920 
was better however I do have to say
neither<00:06:09.730> of<00:06:09.940> them<00:06:10.060> take<00:06:10.270> into<00:06:10.510> account<00:06:10.720> the

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
neither of them take into account the

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.540 
neither of them take into account the
length<00:06:11.140> of<00:06:11.290> my<00:06:11.380> cranks<00:06:11.800> so<00:06:12.100> in<00:06:12.220> this<00:06:12.310> instance

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
length of my cranks so in this instance

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.090 
length of my cranks so in this instance
I'm<00:06:12.910> riding<00:06:13.300> one<00:06:13.450> seven<00:06:13.810> two<00:06:13.930> point<00:06:13.960> five<00:06:14.440> but

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
I'm riding one seven two point five but

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.400 
I'm riding one seven two point five but
I<00:06:15.160> normally<00:06:15.460> ride<00:06:15.640> one<00:06:16.000> seven<00:06:16.420> five<00:06:16.630> but<00:06:17.290> then

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
I normally ride one seven five but then

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.980 
I normally ride one seven five but then
what<00:06:17.620> happens<00:06:18.010> if<00:06:18.130> I<00:06:18.250> was<00:06:18.370> on<00:06:18.660> 167.50<00:06:19.660> it's<00:06:19.900> a

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
what happens if I was on 167.50 it's a

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.710 
what happens if I was on 167.50 it's a
fairly<00:06:20.260> big<00:06:20.560> variation<00:06:21.520> there<00:06:21.730> and<00:06:21.970> also<00:06:22.360> it

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
fairly big variation there and also it

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.910 
fairly big variation there and also it
doesn't<00:06:22.990> take<00:06:23.110> into<00:06:23.260> account<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.620> stack

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
doesn't take into account the stack

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.400 
doesn't take into account the stack
height<00:06:24.160> both<00:06:24.520> of<00:06:24.670> my<00:06:24.790> shoe<00:06:25.060> and<00:06:25.270> of<00:06:25.900> the<00:06:26.020> pedal

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
height both of my shoe and of the pedal

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.650 
height both of my shoe and of the pedal
which<00:06:26.650> is<00:06:26.860> can<00:06:27.700> be<00:06:27.790> quite<00:06:28.000> a<00:06:28.030> significant

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
which is can be quite a significant

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.990 
which is can be quite a significant
value<00:06:28.780> there<00:06:29.110> so<00:06:29.740> the<00:06:30.370> lesson<00:06:30.610> from<00:06:30.700> all<00:06:30.820> of

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
value there so the lesson from all of

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.850 
value there so the lesson from all of
this<00:06:31.090> is<00:06:31.390> that<00:06:31.750> all<00:06:31.900> these<00:06:32.170> methods<00:06:32.350> will<00:06:32.680> get

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
this is that all these methods will get

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.040 
this is that all these methods will get
you<00:06:32.980> ballpark<00:06:33.580> but<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.300> have<00:06:34.570> to<00:06:34.780> fine<00:06:35.020> tune

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
you ballpark but you have to fine tune

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.860 
you ballpark but you have to fine tune
it<00:06:35.470> for<00:06:35.620> yourself<00:06:36.160> to<00:06:36.610> find<00:06:36.850> which<00:06:37.210> is<00:06:37.240> most

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
it for yourself to find which is most

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.770 
it for yourself to find which is most
comfortable<00:06:38.110> and<00:06:38.530> most<00:06:38.890> powerful<00:06:39.100> make<00:06:40.090> any

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
comfortable and most powerful make any

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.379 
comfortable and most powerful make any
it's<00:06:41.050> your<00:06:41.200> position<00:06:41.410> then<00:06:42.160> do<00:06:42.430> so<00:06:42.670> gradually

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
it's your position then do so gradually

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.390 
it's your position then do so gradually
because<00:06:43.690> actually<00:06:44.230> you<00:06:44.350> can<00:06:44.500> end<00:06:44.650> up<00:06:44.830> injuring

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
because actually you can end up injuring

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.879 
because actually you can end up injuring
yourself<00:06:45.760> more<00:06:46.000> by<00:06:46.510> changing<00:06:46.990> to<00:06:47.020> the<00:06:47.500> correct

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
yourself more by changing to the correct

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:49.680 
yourself more by changing to the correct
position<00:06:48.070> than<00:06:48.610> you<00:06:48.730> would<00:06:48.910> do<00:06:49.060> if<00:06:49.240> you<00:06:49.389> kept

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
position than you would do if you kept

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.390 
position than you would do if you kept
with<00:06:50.050> your<00:06:50.139> old<00:06:50.320> position<00:06:50.440> and<00:06:50.950> it's<00:06:51.190> always<00:06:51.280> a

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
with your old position and it's always a

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.100 
with your old position and it's always a
good<00:06:51.520> idea<00:06:51.610> to<00:06:51.970> make<00:06:52.300> a<00:06:52.330> note<00:06:52.630> of<00:06:52.660> where<00:06:52.990> you

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
good idea to make a note of where you

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.500 
good idea to make a note of where you
started<00:06:53.680> so<00:06:54.130> that<00:06:54.160> you<00:06:54.730> can<00:06:54.850> always<00:06:55.000> go<00:06:55.210> back

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
started so that you can always go back

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.210 
started so that you can always go back
to<00:06:55.750> original<00:06:56.260> position<00:06:56.290> so<00:06:56.710> take<00:06:57.190> a

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
to original position so take a

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.560 
to original position so take a
measurement<00:06:57.610> from<00:06:57.850> the<00:06:58.120> center<00:06:58.210> of<00:06:58.510> the

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
measurement from the center of the

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.390 
measurement from the center of the
bottom<00:06:58.750> bracket<00:06:58.870> to<00:06:59.530> the<00:06:59.560> top<00:06:59.650> of<00:06:59.950> the<00:07:00.040> saddle

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
bottom bracket to the top of the saddle

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.159 
bottom bracket to the top of the saddle
and<00:07:00.520> from<00:07:00.790> the<00:07:00.970> nodes<00:07:01.180> of<00:07:01.240> the<00:07:01.360> saddle<00:07:01.660> to<00:07:01.780> the

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:02.169 
and from the nodes of the saddle to the

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:03.930 
and from the nodes of the saddle to the
handlebars<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:03.100> that<00:07:03.250> pretty<00:07:03.460> much<00:07:03.550> tells

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
handlebars and that pretty much tells

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.810 
handlebars and that pretty much tells
