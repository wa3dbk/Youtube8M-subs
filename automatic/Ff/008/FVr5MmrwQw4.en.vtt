00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
should take you want to make sure the

should take you want to make sure the
charcoal<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> red-hot<00:01:14.159> through<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.670> through

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.090 

it<00:01:20.100> takes<00:01:20.280> about<00:01:20.400> 25<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.150> 30<00:01:21.420> minutes<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.470> then

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it takes about 25 to 30 minutes and then

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.149 
it takes about 25 to 30 minutes and then
you<00:01:23.189> dump<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:24.680> that's<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.920> thing's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you dump it out that's what this thing's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.460 
you dump it out that's what this thing's
for<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> dumper<00:01:26.970> handle

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.660 

you<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.560> Terkel<00:01:34.890> really<00:01:35.130> does<00:01:35.280> impart

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you know Terkel really does impart

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.090 
you know Terkel really does impart
flavor<00:01:35.940> especially<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> real<00:01:37.530> wood<00:01:37.740> charcoal

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
flavor especially the real wood charcoal

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.040 
flavor especially the real wood charcoal
and<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.910> problem<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> gas<00:01:39.600> grill<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
and the problem with the gas grill is

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.560 
and the problem with the gas grill is
it's<00:01:40.260> just<00:01:40.320> sort<00:01:40.620> of<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.330> homogenous<00:01:42.330> flame

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it's just sort of a homogenous flame

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200 
it's just sort of a homogenous flame
that<00:01:42.690> really<00:01:42.900> doesn't<00:01:43.229> add<00:01:43.440> much<00:01:44.160> more<00:01:44.610> flavor

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that really doesn't add much more flavor

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.810 
that really doesn't add much more flavor
wise<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.690> food<00:01:45.870> so<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> real<00:01:47.670> wood

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
wise to the food so the real wood

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.990 
wise to the food so the real wood
charcoal<00:01:48.120> is<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> way<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.740> it's<00:01:49.970> second<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
charcoal is the way to go it's second to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
charcoal is the way to go it's second to
cooking<00:01:51.360> over<00:01:51.810> wood<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.800> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
cooking over wood and I think it's a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.260 
cooking over wood and I think it's a
close<00:01:53.100> second<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:56.970> gonna<00:01:57.060> let<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
close second so so we're gonna let this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.680 
close second so so we're gonna let this
charcoal<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.460> for<00:01:59.460> about<00:01:59.670> 25<00:02:00.119> minutes<00:02:00.150> or

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
charcoal go for about 25 minutes or

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.530 
charcoal go for about 25 minutes or
until<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.080> start<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.410> see<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:02.300> nice<00:02:03.300> red

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
until you start to see it nice red

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.510 
until you start to see it nice red
embers<00:02:03.720> right<00:02:04.350> below<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> surface<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.160> then

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
embers right below the surface and then

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.980 
embers right below the surface and then
we're<00:02:05.610> gonna<00:02:05.700> dump<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.030> into<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> little

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
we're gonna dump it into the little

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.669 
we're gonna dump it into the little
holder<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> indirect<00:02:08.640> cooking
