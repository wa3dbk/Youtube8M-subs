she'll<00:00:25.949> get<00:00:26.130> through<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.880> it'll<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
she'll get through but it'll be a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
she'll get through but it'll be a
three-set<00:00:27.930> it'll<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> tight<00:00:28.680> tussle<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
three-set it'll be a tight tussle and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.640 
three-set it'll be a tight tussle and
she'll<00:00:30.119> struggle<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.630> there<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> time<00:00:31.289> Sam

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
think it'll be tougher match them maybe

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.560 
think it'll be tougher match them maybe
what<00:00:50.129> he's<00:00:50.250> been<00:00:50.430> looking<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> tough

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
what he's been looking for a tough

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.869 
what he's been looking for a tough
baseliner<00:00:52.230> Montaigne's<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:53.579> plenty<00:00:53.789> of

baseliner Montaigne's got plenty of
experience<00:00:54.090> behind<00:00:54.449> him<00:00:54.840> it'll<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> four

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
experience behind him it'll be a four

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
experience behind him it'll be a four
center<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.160> Roger<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the inaction in the third center court

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.720 
the inaction in the third center court
match<00:01:00.840> its<00:01:01.050> Casey<00:01:01.350> Dellacqua<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.370> very

yeah tough ass for Casey I think Venus

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
is going to win this one she's going to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.160 
is going to win this one she's going to
do<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:08.970> straight<00:01:09.270> sets<00:01:09.330> she's<00:01:09.900> been<00:01:10.080> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
do it in straight sets she's been in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.690 
do it in straight sets she's been in
good<00:01:10.350> form<00:01:10.409> coming<00:01:11.040> through<00:01:11.189> these<00:01:11.369> early

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
good form coming through these early

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.820 
good form coming through these early
rounds<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.630> Casey<00:01:12.900> Dellacqua<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.710> she's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
rounds as is Casey Dellacqua but she's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
rounds as is Casey Dellacqua but she's
had<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> long<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.490> from<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.820> game<00:01:15.030> niazi

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
had a long way off from the game niazi

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.330 
had a long way off from the game niazi
and<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.409> she<00:01:16.560> might<00:01:16.680> struggle<00:01:16.979> against

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and I think she might struggle against

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
and I think she might struggle against
the<00:01:17.430> mind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> Venus<00:01:18.090> Williams<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:19.140> at

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the mind of Venus Williams and then at

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.469 
the mind of Venus Williams and then at
7pm<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> night<00:01:20.250> session<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> epic<00:01:21.390> a

7pm it's the night session and epic a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.940 
again probably not because the matches
are<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.259> Roger<00:01:31.500> Federer

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
are one back now we have Roger Federer

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.710 
are one back now we have Roger Federer
we've<00:01:32.250> got<00:01:32.460> Venus<00:01:32.850> Williams<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> we've<00:01:33.540> got

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
we've got Venus Williams and we've got

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.929 
we've got Venus Williams and we've got
Layton<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.229> Michael's<00:01:34.680> together<00:01:35.189> again<00:01:35.700> like

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
Layton and Michael's together again like

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.310 
Layton and Michael's together again like
we<00:01:36.119> did<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.329> couple<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.689> years<00:01:36.780> ago<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.200> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
we did a couple of years ago with that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980 
we did a couple of years ago with that
early<00:01:37.650> finish<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.579> won't<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.090> it'll<00:01:39.600> still<00:01:39.840> be

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
early finish it won't be it'll still be

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.899 
early finish it won't be it'll still be
a<00:01:40.020> thriller<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.070> it'll<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.280> four<00:01:41.579> sets

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
a thriller I think it'll be four sets

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.530 
a thriller I think it'll be four sets
and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.180> think<00:01:42.540> Layton<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:44.180> don't<00:01:45.180> quote<00:01:45.360> me

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and I think Layton just don't quote me

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240 
and I think Layton just don't quote me
on<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.659> though<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.259> lot<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.680> focus<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
on that though a lot of focus on the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.499 
on that though a lot of focus on the
men's<00:01:47.430> match<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.060> women's<00:01:48.360> match

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
men's match I think the women's match

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.300 
men's match I think the women's match
tonight<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> beauty<00:01:49.829> Caroline

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
tonight is going to be a beauty Caroline

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
tonight is going to be a beauty Caroline
Wozniacki<00:01:51.030> taking<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.450> shahar<00:01:51.899> pair<00:01:52.170> of

Wozniacki taking on shahar pair of
Israel<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.240> an<00:01:54.360> upset<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
Israel I think this could be an upset a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749 
Israel I think this could be an upset a
very<00:01:55.140> experienced<00:01:55.829> player<00:01:56.130> Shahar<00:01:56.729> Peer
