00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.060
 this work that I'm going to do is 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.330
 taking advantage of a plate of a shelf 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.310
 stainless steel and once drawn by 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 where the cuts have to go 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:40.470
 with the measurements and all this with a disk 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.340
 thin metal to make less water is 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.300
 short and also for the part of 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.150
 mentioned with the same radial and with a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.480
 fine disk also I make a small 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:59.739
 mark where the folds will go 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.600
 ok with a wrench and locked 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:08.770
 how do you say just enough to do the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.119
 sheet or the thickness of the sheet metal has 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.119
 been soft little by little 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.670
 near where the fold 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.460
 so that it goes folding this is a way 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.070
 well as you can see to have this 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.040
 small recess 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.300
 which is simply what it does is mark 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.100
 once what 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.930
 the achap is forced a little bit towards a 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.810
 side or towards the other this one yields without 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.659
 problem 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:43.020
 good and little by little the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.020
 tabs so that you are doing 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.820
 the structure well already with the last 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.620
 past of the sheet 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 I already know what is the 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.670
 small structure 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.670
 or small and wiggle it's own thank you 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:21.610
 and finally some rivets to fix it 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.440
 well this little one is already done 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.770
 accessory for the oven but now I have 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.819
 to put this tube on him and make him 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.340
 the hole 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.760
 well then with a disc now very thin 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.769
 I mean in the thickness and also 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.079
 small so that we do not get out of what 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.079
 what is the diameter d 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.340
 a hole that we have to make 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.670
 with our protections as always 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.670
 Y 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:31.070
 well then 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:34.180
 this is the one made by a link but 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.180
 these 60 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:46.190
 and ready to go over it a bit of this same 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.950
 aluminum tube cut a piece in addition 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.840
 I make him 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.819
 a cut 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.150
 longitudinally so that you can 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.330
 reduce in diameter and also every two 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.060
 centimeters and peak more or less short 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.890
 also a piece so that these are 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.540
 as a kind of tab in this way 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.189
 this form will be anchored in what is 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.090
 that kind of chimney that I'm 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:16.600
 doing well done is already ready 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.760
 rivet to hold it and the idea is that 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.810
 this between 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.810
 inside the tube 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.920
 and also with the idea of ​​entering here 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:37.380
 there is the hole 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.380
 and you are single step 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.740
 pieces that are left over with the radial 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.740
 the short d 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.909
 to 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.389
 put it by the bottom 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.389
 what is involved 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.750
 by the top
