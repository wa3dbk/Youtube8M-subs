color in the pitcher Kristin should add

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.889

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
a little bit of brown shadow peeping up

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.240 
a little bit of brown shadow peeping up
through<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> black<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.800> I<00:02:04.830> thought<00:02:05.100> this

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
through the black so I thought this

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.770 
through the black so I thought this
would<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.550> great<00:02:05.820> shade<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.600> not

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
would be a great shade because it's not

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359 
would be a great shade because it's not
too<00:02:06.990> dark<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.740> works<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.190> great

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
too dark and it works with a great

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.210 
too dark and it works with a great
transition<00:02:09.179> shade<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:16.140> using<00:02:16.620> my<00:02:16.650> highlight

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
transition shade then using my highlight

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.740 
transition shade then using my highlight

to be using Mac's funding games blush

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.929 
to be using Mac's funding games blush
because<00:05:20.439> in<00:05:20.589> the<00:05:20.710> picture<00:05:21.039> Kristin<00:05:21.550> didn't

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:21.939 
because in the picture Kristin didn't

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.629 
because in the picture Kristin didn't
have<00:05:21.969> very<00:05:22.960> pink<00:05:23.379> cheek<00:05:23.800> she<00:05:23.830> just<00:05:24.279> had<00:05:24.430> a<00:05:24.460> very

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
have very pink cheek she just had a very

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.749 
have very pink cheek she just had a very
nice<00:05:24.939> glow<00:05:25.419> so<00:05:25.779> I<00:05:25.869> figured<00:05:26.349> using<00:05:27.339> a<00:05:27.460> peach

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
nice glow so I figured using a peach

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.109 
nice glow so I figured using a peach
blush<00:05:27.999> would<00:05:28.389> be<00:05:28.479> perfect<00:05:28.930> I'm<00:05:29.110> using<00:05:29.319> a<00:05:29.469> Mac

00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:30.119 
blush would be perfect I'm using a Mac

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:38.270 
blush would be perfect I'm using a Mac
129<00:05:31.119> brush

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.890 

and<00:05:39.280> that's<00:05:39.639> pretty<00:05:39.820> much<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:40.330> for<00:05:40.360> the<00:05:40.600> cheeks

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
and that's pretty much it for the cheeks

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.810 
and that's pretty much it for the cheeks
and<00:05:41.560> for<00:05:41.800> the<00:05:41.889> lips<00:05:42.130> her<00:05:42.550> lips<00:05:44.280> were<00:05:45.280> very<00:05:45.490> new

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
and for the lips her lips were very new

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.029
