00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
when you write a book you're doing a lot

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.799 
when you write a book you're doing a lot
of<00:00:50.190> research<00:00:50.430> you're<00:00:50.969> also<00:00:51.120> using<00:00:51.629> your

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

of research you're also using your
accumulated<00:00:52.260> knowledge<00:00:52.969> but<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.329> very

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
accumulated knowledge but it's very

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
accumulated knowledge but it's very
important<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.219> bottom<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
important that you get to the bottom of

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
important that you get to the bottom of
everything<00:00:56.870> because<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> write

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
everything because when you write

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.930 
everything because when you write
something<00:00:58.739> down<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.949> are<00:00:59.370> committing

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
something down you are committing

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.689 
something down you are committing
history<00:01:00.949> other<00:01:01.949> people<00:01:02.309> are<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.609> be

history other people are going to be
reading<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.030> stuff<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> repeating<00:01:03.960> you

when they're doing their research so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
when they're doing their research so
it's<00:01:05.760> very<00:01:06.030> important<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.560> don't<00:01:07.650> just

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

internet in a book in a magazine but you
follow<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.170> back<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.590> find<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> origin<00:01:14.750> so

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
follow it back to find the origin so

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.200 
follow it back to find the origin so
that<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> history<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> commit<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.729> truth

down and write it no that's the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
down and write it no that's the
beginning<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.780> gives<00:01:45.990> you're<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.259> only

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
