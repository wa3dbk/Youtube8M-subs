00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.420
 and good all this new big video 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.910
 online photo in which I bring you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 information and news but rather a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.930
 analysis on the new information that 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.430
 has left the tlc of disney sub days that 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.300
 it would be like the update of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.710
 business 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.330
 we know that changing the name since 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 I used to call the business pack 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.900
 dangerous and good this would be the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 1.11 update that is going to be done 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.920
 the next March 4th, which is this 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.330
 Tuesday of next week 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.800
 but before the video starts I 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.829
 I would like to ask you not to forget 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.719
 likes and you like it with nothing more to add 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.940
 we started well to tell you first of all 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.710
 I took a video a few days ago 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.269
 talking about what was going to come out of this from 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.800
 that they were going to leave these vehicles in 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.989
 weapons there was not anything information but 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.179
 if the vehicles and something related to 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.159
 business and good the truth is that it 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.140
 has fulfilled that is to say that 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.390
 whenever you upload content this type of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.429
 the plains if I tell you dates about 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.079
 everything if I believe it, it came out I always give 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.339
 the tests that I use to do 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.019
 those videos is to say that also 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.429
 considering you and the tests the 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.479
 go and enough or not but let's go in 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.830
 Any case I would like to make a 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.950
 small summary before you start 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.170
 analyze and that is to say that this new dlc 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.710
 only business would be based 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.509
 so I would include cinca yesterday 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.150
 As for cars the link to and this they do 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.009
 and alpha and the long-awaited tourism grotti 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.110
 tourism in this case a variant that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.360
 would call tourism r is also included the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.670
 best tra that would be a new light aircraft 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.159
 but not very large include the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.830
 heavy gun and the special carbine and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.409
 clothes of all kinds hairstyles and tattoos 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.140
 as well as many new masks and everything 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.759
 this we would say again that it is 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 related to the theme of the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.240
 business we know will be available 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.009
 both for the story mode and for the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.020
 online and also at the end of the news 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.880
 remind us and announce that we are 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.009
 prepared for the already well- known of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 lcd bank robberies the creator of 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.030
 capture missions and this is already us 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.380
 there'd put that we are going to get those 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.539
 directly captures not only the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.459
 normal missions but the one to be able 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.750
 create capture and also that we are 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.759
 attentive for the new missions of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.560
 murder and flight school those that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 I also spoke a few months ago 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.250
 Well, the time has come to analyze 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.750
 all the news and starting with the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.519
 cars we should know that none is 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.190
 new all have come out in previous gt 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.319
 for example in albany and alpha came out in 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.730
 san andreas gta is a sporty 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.769
 kind to sultan that's why it's pretty 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.590
 square has a very large resemblance to 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.120
 shot of gta 5 and always from gta 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.969
 san andreas as a car with a lot 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.409
 class as very nice very manorial and if 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.329
 we remember we could only find in 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.980
 the rich areas of the plant saints 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.959
 san andreas with guess which here 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.579
 the spa will still be in that area too 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.079
 in second place the cinca ya esther 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.239
 he also came out in gta san andreas 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.639
 belongs to the category of coupes and 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.919
 in gta san andreas so we knew that 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.959
 It was very customizable from the most 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.629
 customizable games and we hope 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.280
 very much that here it is we have seen 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.889
 images of both the alpha as 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.139
 r tourism in the news but not the 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.359
 tester and do not know why wait 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.799
 that is because they have not prepared 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.079
 some kind of surprise with this vehicle 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.849
 and let's hope that that surprise is a lot 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.530
 personalization and in the last place of 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.870
 the cars we would have the trot and tourism 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.849
 r that would be the novelty that ere put 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.760
 that we already saw in gta san andreas 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.590
 in gta 4 and in saint a town was but 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.359
 if the erre is a new version 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.969
 maybe we would be talking about a car 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.099
 even faster than gta 4 and we see 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.810
 that in matters of aesthetics changes 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.650
 very much with which for me it is a little 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.849
 disappointment 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.010
 next to that is not the true 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.689
 tourism is another different car that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.299
 they have put the name but it is different 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.739
 but I also like it a lot and it's not 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.230
 disappointment but it's a joy because 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.819
 it's a very nice car that is not the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.010
 tourism grand theft auto 4 that all 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.140
 We knew but it's a very good car 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.540
 this aesthetically speaking about the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.250
 plane yes we know that the best brings 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.109
 again this one is absolutely new 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.849
 It has a great resemblance to seeing a gta 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.920
 5 although I would describe it as a 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.769
 improved version of this is because it does not 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.390
 has propellers carries turbines and is a 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.489
 little smaller with which he 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.989
 we assume that it will be a little faster in 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.930
 how much the weapons are in the carbine 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.879
 special that is based on 36 to 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.159
 except that seems like this gun novel 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.920
 heavy that is is very modern although not 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.750
 you see a clear real reference for this 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.000
 gun we know that both are going to have a 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.040
 great damage finally if you remember my 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.199
 video also talked about the other handley 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.180
 vehicle an SUV that has not been 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.310
 added to the update and for that 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.079
 I can only think of two things because I do not 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.370
 the handling is added well the 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.990
 first of all is that I am 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.639
 reserving for another next 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.990
 update maybe within a month of 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.789
 two months 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.440
 when but maybe they are reserving 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.419
 and the second theory is that you're 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.060
 discarded since there are very cars 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.919
 similar already in gta 5 I do not know which of the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.240
 two theories will be the real one but in 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.310
 Any case is not a vehicle either 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.860
 I really want the vehicle that 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.000
 he wished is the tourism that they have added 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.949
 different than what should be but good 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.090
 they have added it and that is what counts and 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.410
 let's go anyway I'm 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.940
 quite happy for this new 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.800
 update that again is again 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.330
 free sent a congratulations to rockstar 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.160
 from here and the question I want 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.870
 to make you in this video is what you want 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.759
 make it the next update that 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.919
 come out is not to say that of bank robberies 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.599
 and since we all know that in 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.639
 that you would like other than that 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.080
 come out in a next update without 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.050
 But I trust that you liked you do not know 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.830
 leave your comment and greetings and 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.639
 until next time 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.639
 goodbye
