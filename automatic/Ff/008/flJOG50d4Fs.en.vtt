00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.629
 He cracked even if he would accept you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.329

 little friends are disagreeing 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.469
 It must be hard for you to stay in the middle. 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.789
 making everything is so difficult to make decisions. 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.250

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.189
 grateful for the decisions I made 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.250
 decisions like dilma appears on television 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.680
 more to my face and you grabbed the 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.370
 opportunity 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:20.099
 poor and 14 will miss a decision 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.410
 very difficult to choose to invest there 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.470
 but it was right thing to do is 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.470

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:53.349
 so I did not say I want you to know that 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.060

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.980
 Belt let a second war

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.919
 me this is the right thing to take 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.719
 when it's time to pull the trigger 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.719

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:13.230
 like endless drug plantations 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.120
 suicide networks in cities 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:19.920
 where men and women are 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.810

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.160
 an opportunity to land for all in

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.850
 coffee 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.900
