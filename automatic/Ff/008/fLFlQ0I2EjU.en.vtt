called Keith's style as well so a

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:17.230 
called Keith's style as well so a
pattern<00:01:08.090> such<00:01:08.420> as<00:01:15.610> would<00:01:16.610> have<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.910> be<00:01:17.030> played

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
pattern such as would have to be played

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.550 
pattern such as would have to be played
single<00:01:17.660> string<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.140> Don<00:01:18.290> Rena<00:01:18.530> would<00:01:18.770> play

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.940 

play<00:01:24.560> single<00:01:24.950> string<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.340> play<00:01:25.460> those<00:01:25.700> notes

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
play single string to play those notes

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.380 
play single string to play those notes
so<00:01:27.950> what<00:01:28.160> Bobby<00:01:28.369> Thompson<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.970> Bill<00:01:29.119> Keith

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
so what Bobby Thompson and Bill Keith

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.660 
so what Bobby Thompson and Bill Keith
did<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.810> likely<00:01:30.259> because<00:01:30.619> they<00:01:30.920> had<00:01:31.250> probably

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
did and likely because they had probably

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.140 
did and likely because they had probably
old<00:01:31.820> records<00:01:32.210> from<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.170> 1900s<00:01:33.890> of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
old records from like the 1900s of

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.830 
old records from like the 1900s of
classical<00:01:35.150> banjo<00:01:36.050> style<00:01:36.290> Fred<00:01:36.650> Van<00:01:36.830> absent

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.390 

they<00:01:41.840> realized<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.530> what<00:01:42.920> they<00:01:43.070> could<00:01:43.250> do

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
they realized that what they could do

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:51.990 
they realized that what they could do
instead<00:01:43.790> of<00:01:43.850> going

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.510 

so<00:01:53.000> it's<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.390> combination<00:01:53.660> of<00:01:54.170> higher<00:01:54.980> fretted

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so it's a combination of higher fretted

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.190 
so it's a combination of higher fretted
strings<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:01.600> combining<00:02:02.600> those<00:02:02.810> with<00:02:02.870> open

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
strings and combining those with open

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200 
strings and combining those with open
strings<00:02:03.530> including<00:02:04.130> your<00:02:04.250> fifth<00:02:04.490> string<00:02:04.730> so

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
strings including your fifth string so

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.450 
strings including your fifth string so
instead<00:02:05.480> of<00:02:05.540> doing<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:09.340> where<00:02:10.340> you're

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
instead of doing this where you're

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.130 
instead of doing this where you're
basically<00:02:10.640> playing<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.240> melody<00:02:11.450> every<00:02:11.900> two

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
basically playing the melody every two

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.710 
basically playing the melody every two
or<00:02:12.410> even<00:02:12.440> sometimes<00:02:13.100> four<00:02:13.430> notes<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:14.360> each

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
or even sometimes four notes you each

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.650 
or even sometimes four notes you each
note<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:16.010> note<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.730> melody<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.240> that's

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
note is is a note the melody and that's

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.730 
note is is a note the melody and that's
what<00:02:18.170> makes<00:02:18.800> Milotic<00:02:19.220> banjo<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.990> this<00:02:21.500> song

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
what makes Milotic banjo so this song

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.650 
what makes Milotic banjo so this song
starts<00:02:22.070> off<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:23.090> actually<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> pretty

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
starts off and this is actually a pretty

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.910 
starts off and this is actually a pretty
good<00:02:23.840> song<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.220> delve<00:02:25.490> into<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:26.920> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
good song to to to delve into that it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.740 
good song to to to delve into that it
starts<00:02:28.370> with<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:35.150> two<00:02:35.300> notes<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.660> you're

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
starts with the two notes that you're

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.110 
starts with the two notes that you're
playing<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.170> instead<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.590> play<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.890> fifth

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:54.100 

minutes

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:02.360 

so<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> position<00:02:56.160> 9:10<00:03:01.370> seventh

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
so this is that position 9:10 seventh

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:12.980 
so this is that position 9:10 seventh
here<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.880> pattern<00:03:12.120> it's<00:03:12.420> four<00:03:12.780> by

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
here this is this pattern it's four by

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.920 
here this is this pattern it's four by
four<00:03:15.260> with<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.440> finger

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
four with this finger

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:26.240 
four with this finger
the<00:03:18.930> fist<00:03:19.260> finger<00:03:19.590> drop<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:20.040> down<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:26.100> then

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the fist finger drop it down and then

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.010 
the fist finger drop it down and then
this<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.880> only<00:03:27.000> single<00:03:27.330> string<00:03:27.600> because

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
this is the only single string because

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.790 
this is the only single string because
you're<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.709> low<00:03:28.950> on<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.970> can't<00:03:30.300> find

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
you're so low on this you can't find

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:46.610 
you're so low on this you can't find
other<00:03:31.800> strings<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.670> be<00:03:32.790> able<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.030> fret<00:03:33.270> so<00:03:33.540> it's

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:04:11.130 

so<00:03:47.620> together<00:03:47.740> dots<00:04:09.690> now<00:04:10.690> this<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:10.960> no

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
so together dots now this is no

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.720 
so together dots now this is no
important<00:04:11.860> pattern<00:04:12.130> because<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.400> actually

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
important pattern because it actually

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:55.409 
important pattern because it actually
comes<00:04:12.940> up<00:04:13.060> again<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:54.580> then<00:04:55.270> the

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
comes up again so it's and then the

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.530 
comes up again so it's and then the
second<00:04:55.810> part<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.350> B<00:04:56.470> part<00:04:56.770> is<00:05:00.210> then<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.360> is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
second part the B part is then this is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.530 
second part the B part is then this is
just

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:25.640 

see<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:07.800> spreaded<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:24.960> it's<00:05:25.140> back<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.530> that

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
see so spreaded and it's back to that

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.020 
see so spreaded and it's back to that
pattern<00:05:25.920> that<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.280> just<00:05:26.460> talked<00:05:26.670> about<00:05:26.760> that

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
pattern that I just talked about that

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:55.940 
pattern that I just talked about that
was<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.270> important<00:05:53.900> yeah<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.170> that's<00:05:55.350> kind<00:05:55.860> of

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
was so important yeah so that's kind of

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.150 
was so important yeah so that's kind of
the<00:05:56.490> very<00:05:56.730> first<00:05:57.060> intro<00:05:57.720> into<00:05:58.140> the<00:05:58.830> loaded

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
the very first intro into the loaded

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.010 
the very first intro into the loaded
banjo<00:05:59.610> I<00:05:59.940> think<00:06:00.270> that<00:06:00.420> was<00:06:00.540> the<00:06:00.630> first<00:06:00.870> song

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
banjo I think that was the first song

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.290 
banjo I think that was the first song
that<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.230> learned<00:06:01.530> as<00:06:02.100> melodic<00:06:02.670> a<00:06:02.880> lot<00:06:03.180> of

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
that I learned as melodic a lot of

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.230 
that I learned as melodic a lot of
people<00:06:03.540> will<00:06:03.690> teach<00:06:03.900> her<00:06:04.080> blackberry<00:06:04.290> blossom

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.380 

and<00:06:09.240> I<00:06:10.230> think<00:06:10.920> I<00:06:11.010> do<00:06:11.070> have<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.700> portion<00:06:12.240> of<00:06:12.300> a

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
and I think I do have a portion of a

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.970 
and I think I do have a portion of a
lesson<00:06:12.570> on<00:06:12.750> that<00:06:12.960> I'll<00:06:13.110> probably<00:06:13.470> do<00:06:13.740> a<00:06:13.770> full

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
lesson on that I'll probably do a full

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.590 
lesson on that I'll probably do a full
lesson<00:06:14.310> later<00:06:14.430> but<00:06:15.030> it's<00:06:15.150> a<00:06:15.240> little<00:06:15.450> more

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
lesson later but it's a little more

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.570 
lesson later but it's a little more
complicated<00:06:15.930> this<00:06:16.320> one<00:06:16.560> is<00:06:16.890> you<00:06:17.190> can<00:06:17.370> play<00:06:17.550> a

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
complicated this one is you can play a

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.210 
complicated this one is you can play a
little<00:06:17.760> slower<00:06:18.150> and<00:06:18.560> there's<00:06:19.560> some<00:06:19.710> breaks<00:06:19.980> in

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
little slower and there's some breaks in

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.030 
little slower and there's some breaks in
it<00:06:20.420> now<00:06:21.420> the<00:06:21.480> problem<00:06:21.900> with<00:06:22.020> melodic<00:06:22.410> banjo<00:06:22.800> is

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
it now the problem with melodic banjo is

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.090 
it now the problem with melodic banjo is
when<00:06:23.670> you<00:06:23.820> miss<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.120> note<00:06:24.450> it's<00:06:24.840> pretty<00:06:25.470> hard<00:06:25.830> to

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
when you miss a note it's pretty hard to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.390 
when you miss a note it's pretty hard to
make<00:06:26.790> a<00:06:26.820> comeback<00:06:27.650> not<00:06:28.650> like<00:06:28.890> Scruggs<00:06:29.310> style

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
make a comeback not like Scruggs style

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.370 
make a comeback not like Scruggs style
where<00:06:29.850> if<00:06:29.970> you<00:06:30.150> do<00:06:30.300> a<00:06:30.330> quick<00:06:30.720> flub<00:06:31.020> it's<00:06:31.200> easy

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
where if you do a quick flub it's easy

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.950 
where if you do a quick flub it's easy
to<00:06:31.530> get<00:06:31.710> back<00:06:31.890> into<00:06:32.130> the<00:06:32.280> rhythm<00:06:32.430> we<00:06:33.090> say<00:06:33.270> like

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
to get back into the rhythm we say like

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.780 
to get back into the rhythm we say like
songs<00:06:34.230> like<00:06:34.470> sailor's<00:06:34.800> hornpipe<00:06:34.950> or<00:06:35.550> even

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
blackberry blossom it's a little more

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.360 
blackberry blossom it's a little more
tougher<00:06:38.600> to<00:06:39.600> to<00:06:40.050> improvise<00:06:40.880> banjo<00:06:41.880> so<00:06:42.320> but
