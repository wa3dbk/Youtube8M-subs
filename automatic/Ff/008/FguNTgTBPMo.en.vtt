00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello people are here I'm a teacher 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.010
 adriana a note today at the garden clinic 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.420
 or in são josé dos campos and today it is 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.740
 with a patient who has even 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:18.029
 put invisible aligners and she 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.980
 is using and today she will give a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.080
 smile for us, we'll see you there 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.099
 just does what she's 56 minutes 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.039
 using apparatus is higher and lower than 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.679
 in this case this model that we are 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 using is for small drives 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.520
 dental implants 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.550
 So we can if we can. 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.870
 to note that she already has a smile 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.640
 More accurate some 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.210
 improvements in 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.010
 Lower smile is to speak at the beginning. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 A bit strange, we'll see you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:58.640
 nor to stephanie is she a foreigner but 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.590
 She speaks Portuguese well, for example. 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:11.250
 stephanie University who is listening 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:15.979
 Did you study there in the United States and in the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:25.070
 Brazil, not nine years ago 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:27.600
 It's hurting a lot now that it's still up to the cup. 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.100
 appeared that initial pain of the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 orthodontic appliance 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.909
 It's but then it is and my technical part 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.640
 but a personal smile then comes that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.590
 replace the digital device or 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.110
 transparent then there is the new generation 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 garden at the door and there are already offers 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.799
 practically almost eight years nine 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.970
 This type of appliance is only 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.910
 more invisible 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.060
 every time better and there we are 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.950
 sharing with you this experience 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.320
 of the patient who was using and 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.550
 first time thanks for 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.920

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.179
 end there was a little rainy alarm 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.180
 less to open a little was there 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.700

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.500
 bit more to the vignette an excellent and if 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.780
 you can not use this unit to 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.420
 small movements which, since the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.370
 to use an adult patient for sure 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.220
 device to be treated 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.390
