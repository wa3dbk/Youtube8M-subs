this I've got this studio backplane that

this I've got this studio backplane that

I've imported to the maximum in the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
it over in my camera parameters I'm also

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.580 
it over in my camera parameters I'm also
using<00:00:38.610> quite<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> high<00:00:39.329> f-stop<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.020> reduce<00:00:40.379> any

depth of field and in render options

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.180 
depth of field and in render options
I've<00:00:42.600> got<00:00:42.750> deviating<00:00:43.290> turned<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> way<00:00:44.040> up

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I've got deviating turned all the way up

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
I've got deviating turned all the way up
so<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.730> there's<00:00:45.000> no<00:00:45.090> darkening<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
so that there's no darkening in the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
so that there's no darkening in the
corners<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> image<00:00:46.289> however<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.489> look

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
corners of the image however if I look

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.040 
corners of the image however if I look
at<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.820> interactive<00:00:48.120> preview<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> moment

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
at my interactive preview at the moment

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080 
at my interactive preview at the moment
I<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.680> studio<00:00:50.100> backplane<00:00:50.670> isn't

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I can see that my studio backplane isn't

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
I can see that my studio backplane isn't
pure<00:00:51.420> white<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.649> still<00:00:52.890> looks<00:00:52.920> slightly

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
pure white and it still looks slightly

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
pure white and it still looks slightly
grey<00:00:53.820> especially<00:00:54.449> compared<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> white

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
grey especially compared to the white

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.439 
grey especially compared to the white
plastic<00:00:55.649> parts<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> camera<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
plastic parts on the camera now what I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.240 
plastic parts on the camera now what I
could<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.469> wanted<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> render<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
could do if I just wanted to render the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
could do if I just wanted to render the
shadows<00:00:59.609> under<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.239> composite<00:01:00.750> those

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
shadows under here and composite those

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
shadows under here and composite those
into<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> image<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.129> could<00:01:02.309> enable<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
into the image is I could enable the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.880 
into the image is I could enable the
shadow<00:01:03.239> option<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> material<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
shadow option on the material of the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.590 
shadow option on the material of the
backplane<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> could<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.150> over<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> my

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
backplane so I could go over to my

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.570 
backplane so I could go over to my
studio<00:01:06.900> backplane<00:01:07.439> material<00:01:07.920> double<00:01:08.430> click

to<00:01:08.610> open<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.240> enable<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> shadow

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to open it up and enable the shadow

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.560 
to open it up and enable the shadow
option<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.549> another<00:01:11.909> way<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
option but there is another way to get a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
option but there is another way to get a
very<00:01:12.840> similar<00:01:13.200> result<00:01:13.500> which<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> usually

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
very similar result which is usually

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.429 
very similar result which is usually
easier<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> work<00:01:15.930> with

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
easier to work with

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
easier to work with

the<00:01:32.159> material<00:01:32.640> ID<00:01:32.820> channel<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> render

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the material ID channel in the render

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
the material ID channel in the render
options<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.369> render<00:01:35.640> you'll<00:01:36.060> get

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
options and when you render you'll get

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
options and when you render you'll get
something<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.780> looks<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:38.130> is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
something that looks like this this is

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.160 
something that looks like this this is
the<00:01:38.430> final<00:01:38.579> image<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the final image and if you go to the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840 
the final image and if you go to the
bottom<00:01:40.320> left<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> hover<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.610> mouse<00:01:41.670> over

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
bottom left and hover your mouse over

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.480 
bottom left and hover your mouse over
the<00:01:42.299> M<00:01:42.420> icon<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.530> view<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:43.920> change<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the M icon the view will change to the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.550 
the M icon the view will change to the
material<00:01:44.970> ID<00:01:45.149> Channel<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> as<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.380> see

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
material ID Channel and as you can see

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.550 
material ID Channel and as you can see
the<00:01:46.710> studio<00:01:47.040> backplane<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.759> black<00:01:48.030> RGB<00:01:48.840> 0<00:01:48.869> 0<00:01:49.290> 0

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the studio backplane is black RGB 0 0 0

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.630 
the studio backplane is black RGB 0 0 0
but<00:01:50.490> every<00:01:51.030> other<00:01:51.240> material<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.259> white<00:01:52.890> RGB

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
but every other material is white RGB

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.289 
but every other material is white RGB
255<00:01:54.060> 255<00:01:54.780> 255<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.280> I've<00:01:56.399> done<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.939> made

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
255 255 255 and what I've done is made

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.840 
255 255 255 and what I've done is made
an<00:01:57.450> alpha<00:01:57.990> layer<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> material

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
an alpha layer out of all the material

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.330 
an alpha layer out of all the material
IDs<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:01.020> means<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.040> save

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
IDs and that means that you can save

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.850 
IDs and that means that you can save
this<00:02:02.579> mxi<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.450> open<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.110> Photoshop<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
this mxi and open it up in Photoshop and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
this mxi and open it up in Photoshop and
here<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.640> mxi<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.090> Photoshop<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.110> my

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
here is the mxi in Photoshop and in my

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
here is the mxi in Photoshop and in my
layers<00:02:07.590> window<00:02:07.770> I've<00:02:08.099> got<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> original

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
layers window I've got the original

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.940 
layers window I've got the original
render<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.479> well<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.410> material<00:02:10.830> ID

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
render as well as the material ID

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
render as well as the material ID
channel<00:02:11.250> what<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.300> select<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
channel what I can do is select the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.940 
channel what I can do is select the
material<00:02:12.989> ID<00:02:13.110> Channel

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
material ID Channel

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.040 
material ID Channel
that's<00:02:14.099> all<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.400> image<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.849> copy<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:15.569> go

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
that's all the image and copy it then go

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.050 
that's all the image and copy it then go
back<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.530> render<00:02:16.920> make<00:02:17.459> an<00:02:17.640> alpha<00:02:17.910> layer

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
back to the render make an alpha layer

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.660 
back to the render make an alpha layer
then<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.410> channels<00:02:19.769> make<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.489> mask

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
then go to my channels make the mask

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.640 
then go to my channels make the mask
visible<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.360> paste<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.989> then<00:02:22.349> make<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
visible and paste it in then make it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.869 
visible and paste it in then make it
invisible<00:02:22.860> again<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> go<00:02:23.550> back<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.790> the

invisible again and go back to the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.059 
invisible again and go back to the
layers<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.780> need<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.050> make<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> copy<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.860> my

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
layers then I need to make a copy of my

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.040 
layers then I need to make a copy of my
render<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.060> I'm<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.330> drag<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.720> render

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.990 
render so I'm going to drag the render
onto<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.470> new<00:02:28.620> layers<00:02:28.920> icon<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.849> need

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
onto the new layers icon and then I need

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.850 
onto the new layers icon and then I need
to<00:02:30.120> delete<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.630> mask<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.110> bottom<00:02:31.470> render

right click delete now what I can do is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.430 
right click delete now what I can do is
make<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.970> new<00:02:36.209> exposure<00:02:36.630> adjustment<00:02:36.900> layer

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
make a new exposure adjustment layer

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.280 
make a new exposure adjustment layer
lock<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.550> layer<00:02:38.819> below<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.450> increase

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
lock it to the layer below and increase

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.259 
lock it to the layer below and increase
the<00:02:40.470> exposure<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.610> increasing<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
the exposure this is increasing the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.050 
the exposure this is increasing the
exposure<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.019> entire<00:02:43.590> image<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.580> because

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
exposure of the entire image but because

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.570 
exposure of the entire image but because
I've<00:02:45.420> got<00:02:45.660> another<00:02:45.810> layer<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.380> top<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:47.459> an

adjustment to the exposure of the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.750 
adjustment to the exposure of the
subject<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.620> what<00:02:52.829> you're<00:02:52.980> seeing<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.670> just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
subject so what you're seeing is just

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.270 
subject so what you're seeing is just
the<00:02:54.569> exposure<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> batplane<00:02:55.620> increasing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the exposure of the batplane increasing

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.850 
the exposure of the batplane increasing
and<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:57.660> one<00:02:57.989> way<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.170> getting<00:02:58.319> pure

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and that is one way of getting pure

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.500 
and that is one way of getting pure
