dries<00:01:00.210> very<00:01:00.420> quickly<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.239> you're

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
dries very quickly so this one you're

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.609 
dries very quickly so this one you're
just<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.670> put<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
just going to put it on now I like to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
just going to put it on now I like to
apply<00:01:07.979> my<00:01:08.010> lacquer<00:01:09.049> from<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> base<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.330> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
apply my lacquer from the base to the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.770 
apply my lacquer from the base to the
top<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.220> that's<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
top and that's so that you don't have a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
top and that's so that you don't have a
very<00:01:16.320> thick<00:01:16.890> coat<00:01:17.780> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.770> cuticle<00:01:20.490> area<00:01:22.189> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
very thick coat on the cuticle area so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
very thick coat on the cuticle area so
we're<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> apply<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> kiss<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:29.840> don't

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
we're going to apply the kiss just don't

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.910 
we're going to apply the kiss just don't
forget<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.380> edges

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.470 

and<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.130> that<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.520> first<00:01:39.820> cut<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.240> only

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
and so that is the first cut you only

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.710 
and so that is the first cut you only
really<00:01:40.840> need<00:01:41.140> one<00:01:41.170> coat<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.180> color<00:01:43.450> to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
really need one coat for the color to

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.830 
really need one coat for the color to
shine<00:01:44.020> through<00:01:44.290> so<00:01:45.220> once<00:01:45.760> that's<00:01:46.060> done<00:01:46.480> now

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
shine through so once that's done now

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.790 
shine through so once that's done now
it's<00:01:47.530> time<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:48.010> actually<00:01:48.220> apply<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.910> wrap<00:01:49.800> for

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
it's time to actually apply the wrap for

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.720 
it's time to actually apply the wrap for
this<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.490> actually<00:01:51.870> would<00:01:52.870> use<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.590> wrap<00:01:54.460> that

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
this you actually would use a wrap that

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.200 
this you actually would use a wrap that
is<00:01:54.910> clear<00:01:55.540> or<00:01:55.870> has<00:01:56.080> a<00:01:56.110> transparent<00:01:58.830> background

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210

the<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:05.800> know<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.130> can<00:02:06.280> see<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:07.210> one<00:02:07.480> is<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the you know you can see this one is the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that is also unclear so we're going to

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.890 
that is also unclear so we're going to
use<00:02:17.710> this<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.730> put<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.300> top<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.780> I'm
