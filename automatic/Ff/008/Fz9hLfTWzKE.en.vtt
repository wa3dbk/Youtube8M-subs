okay we prepared the tissue for the

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.690 
okay we prepared the tissue for the
Soyuz<00:00:03.270> release<00:00:03.659> now<00:00:03.929> we're<00:00:04.140> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.520> do<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
Soyuz release now we're going to do the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.680 
Soyuz release now we're going to do the
deep<00:00:05.970> type<00:00:06.810> fiber<00:00:07.200> release<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.450> iliacus

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
deep type fiber release of the iliacus

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.070 
deep type fiber release of the iliacus
and<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.860> Soyuz<00:00:11.280> both<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.269> which<00:00:12.420> function<00:00:12.929> as

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
and the Soyuz both of which function as

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.650 
and the Soyuz both of which function as
one<00:00:13.320> muscle<00:00:13.769> there<00:00:14.519> are<00:00:14.700> hip<00:00:14.910> flexors<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> very

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
one muscle there are hip flexors a very

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.840 
one muscle there are hip flexors a very
strong<00:00:16.020> hip<00:00:16.289> flexor<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:20.340> I'm<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
strong hip flexor so I'm just going to

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.400 
strong hip flexor so I'm just going to
sink<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.570> first<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.020> will<00:00:22.199> be<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
sink in the first one will be the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.460 
sink in the first one will be the
iliacus<00:00:24.019> here<00:00:25.019> again

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
iliacus here again

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.220 
iliacus here again
slow<00:00:25.800> slow<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.849> key<00:00:27.240> word<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.480> can't<00:00:27.960> rush

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
slow slow is the key word you can't rush

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.110 
slow slow is the key word you can't rush
muscles<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> got<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.250> very<00:00:29.580> slow<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:32.420> when

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
muscles you got going very slow and when

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.090 
muscles you got going very slow and when
you<00:00:36.120> tell<00:00:36.420> me<00:00:36.660> when<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.620> point<00:00:37.829> where

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
you tell me when we get to a point where

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.920 
you tell me when we get to a point where
you<00:00:38.190> don't<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.760> any<00:00:38.940> deeper<00:00:39.090> ng

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.340 

everybody<00:00:42.930> has<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> different<00:00:44.809> tolerance<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
everybody has a different tolerance to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.610 
everybody has a different tolerance to
pressure<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.420> muscle<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.320> very

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
pressure and if that muscle is very very

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.430 
pressure and if that muscle is very very
tight<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:51.210> won't<00:00:51.420> let<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.230> deep

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
tight you won't let me go in very deep

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
tight you won't let me go in very deep
but<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.800> did<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> not<00:00:53.520> too<00:00:53.730> long<00:00:53.940> ago<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.270> we

but we did this not too long ago so we
can<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.350> deep<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.399> going

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
can get in very deep so I'm just going

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.970 
can get in very deep so I'm just going
to<00:00:56.640> at<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.840> point<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> pinch<00:00:58.770> it

back of your knee is perfectly flat on
the<00:01:20.700> table<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.700> important<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.330> down

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the table and it's important to get down

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
the table and it's important to get down
as<00:01:24.720> far<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> times

as far as you can because a lot of times

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.249 
as far as you can because a lot of times
that<00:01:26.790> release<00:01:27.150> doesn't<00:01:27.450> happen<00:01:27.750> till<00:01:28.080> you're

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.280 
that release doesn't happen till you're
there<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> felt<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> right<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
there I felt it right there so then you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.590 
there I felt it right there so then you
can<00:01:31.470> bring<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.829> knee<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
can bring that knee back up I'm going to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.550 
can bring that knee back up I'm going to
be<00:01:33.689> coming<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.110> slowly

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.039 

so<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> iliacus<00:01:38.670> part<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so that's the iliacus part of the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.210 
so that's the iliacus part of the
iliopsoas<00:01:41.540> next<00:01:42.540> muscle<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.649> soaz

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
iliopsoas next muscle will be the soaz

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.690 
iliopsoas next muscle will be the soaz
which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.909> part<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:46.369> little<00:01:47.369> different

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
which is part of that a little different

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.240 
which is part of that a little different
angle<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.590> same<00:01:49.590> muscle<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:52.250> again

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
angle here same muscle so as again

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.270 
angle here same muscle so as again
sinking<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.119> slowly<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.040> client

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
sinking in slowly and when the client

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.139 
sinking in slowly and when the client
tells<00:01:59.759> me<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:01.310> deep<00:02:02.310> enough<00:02:04.880> how's<00:02:05.880> that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
tells me it's deep enough how's that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.690 
tells me it's deep enough how's that
feel

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
feel

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
feel
