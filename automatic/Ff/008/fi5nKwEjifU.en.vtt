00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
particularly interesting way of finger

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.100 
particularly interesting way of finger
picking<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.400> strings<00:01:19.700> with<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.509> thumb<00:01:20.869> being

picking the strings with a thumb being

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.530 
picking the strings with a thumb being
used<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.530> pluck<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.950> bass<00:01:22.130> notes<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.729> index

used to pluck the bass notes and index

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.109 
used to pluck the bass notes and index
middle<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.050> ring<00:01:24.170> fingers<00:01:24.800> used<00:01:25.400> to<00:01:25.580> grab<00:01:25.880> the

middle and ring fingers used to grab the

middle and ring fingers used to grab the
upper<00:01:26.450> strings<00:01:26.720> in<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.200> strum<00:01:27.560> like<00:01:27.770> pick<00:01:28.100> like

upper strings in a strum like pick like
this

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.650 

because<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.190> this<00:01:37.280> approach<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:38.300> fingers

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
because of this approach the fingers

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.480 
because of this approach the fingers
don't<00:01:38.840> always<00:01:39.350> hit<00:01:39.530> exactly<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.280> same

don't always hit exactly the same
strings<00:01:40.910> as<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.810> would<00:01:42.020> if<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:42.320> were<00:01:42.500> picking

strings as you would if you were picking
