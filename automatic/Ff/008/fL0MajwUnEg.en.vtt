00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.439
 Nine people welcome to the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.740
 angel today I want you the 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.540
 imagine spirulina montage 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.389
 it looks like a bombarde 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.670
 I have already told you last time 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.670
 but first the intro 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:59.380
 I want to start like that before the election 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:01.840
 once I show it all the way 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.000
 especially because some are small 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.530
 people are more scared that they are theirs 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.869
 choose fish with rauskriegen because of it 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.140
 she shows extra small ponds earlier 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:15.520
 We always wanted to show it 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.010
 I like the whole thing with fish 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.140
 an angle pk good with a whole 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:29.320
 fine tips you can see here then 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:31.080
 a 2 gram bread alien pose looks like this 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.290
 the whole thing out 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:39.700
 with two controllers pose then here 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.990
 inter-vert down through hole remains that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.660
 is not with glass but and now 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.899
 Lead was therefore faster than 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.490
 glass and then here as I said what I 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.060
 explained you last time 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.869
 there you see that's old 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.190
 in front of the skin in front of the hook 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.580
 Here I have it in my hand with it 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:07.140
 just do not fly away here and two dare 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.140
 price then as far upstream 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.470
 so that's it now I'll show you now 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:27.400
 once again, here you fall 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:29.500
 on it 1 and 2 we hung like that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.840
 Now I'll show you the ban montage 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.580
 I like that best with the thieves 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.580
 The measured clock is 8 grams and weighs 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.110
 has a mediocre role on deep klopps 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.900
 if it was one meter, that's it 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:51.270
 color-coded here this 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:56.680
 industry not orange but bronze caught 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.620
 So how do we start on the knot I have 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.810
 last time again 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.540
 video linked that I have to believe now 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.709
 I do not do it again so we deliver 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.430
 Here are our main only from 0 8 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:16.620
 counter or 0 20 he thick the bombarde 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.900
 So it goes from the stick to the body 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.450
 the capital drawn to them here 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.489
 front through is the first time we lay 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.629
 down 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:31.200
 the bomb is just there to relatively far 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.840
 then come out again and again 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.129
 snore rubber 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.920
 Today, let's take another ride 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.160
 always green or if you again 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.870
 I think I know she is too elegant 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.420
 that means elegant or looks better 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.420
 out as any browns or something 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.940
 it goes on again once again 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:02.459
 quite normal here the white on the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.769
 moved to secondary school and then again so 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.769
 bow hold then form again by 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.739
 pow 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.329
 and the spirulina montage is just for 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.329
 see big ones 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.960
 then we have this on it 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.030
 we're up to now we need 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.900
 once whirl here the normal 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.120
 triple whirl 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.100
 she also uses it for various and the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.960
 small substances as stop there because the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.090
 bombarde is already eight grams would be 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.780
 probably up to 60 70 meters 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.990
 thrown 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.450
 if you are a good rudhart and then 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.220
 It's a bit problematic 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.030
 if once properly on the knot or 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.550
 in the vortex 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.080
 the bombarde pops then have it 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.210
 sometime later break me and twine 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.980
 Of course, the bombarde also suffers this way 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.130
 And that was not our stuff 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.720
 That's why we turn off the stopper 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.730
 Of course there is something extra 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.070
 I just do not have any stopper anymore 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.120
 sunday is why today 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.690
 i just do not now others 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.960
 drive business to stop the stopper 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.900
 to buy 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.950
 I'll do that next time 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.880
 video is guaranteed with stopper hole 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.590
 I'll knot it tomorrow 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.910
 also firmly stared at me moistened 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.020
 We can similarly use the assembly 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.510
 does not matter how far are we now 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.090
 have our bombarde here with the stick 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.900
 and down here the whirl so the the 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.330
 whole so far so now as 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.020
 Finally, it's just what we do 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.000
 always do 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.440
 a hook on it normal 12 hook it 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.729
 Of course, what matters with what 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.880
 I fish if I'm normal 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:56.630
 the same fisherman always hooks these 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.280
 Exotic are quite normal I have you 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.750
 already know my questioning done 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.450
 Although no link would have just in 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:07.210
 internet search infiniti is here and there 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.350
 a very important thing that we go back to 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.030
 piece before that I unfortunately switched 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.270
 also no small piece more hole 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.500
 I'll do it tomorrow, too 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:20.630
 so we have this here 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:24.420
 here again 60 70 cm hook up here and 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.970
 finished the bomb on assembly says mine 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.450
 friends, of course, if you still here 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:33.360
 there are other versions of the 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.190
 Bomb not only recommend that you all 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:42.210
 You could be fishing fast 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:44.400
 then rebuild other longwall assembly 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.820
 which are built exactly the same is here 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.530
 The long throw pose will be easy too 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.490
 just pulled up here by the chopsticks 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.630
 can you imagine like one 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.970
 little bombarde but they are not 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.250
 matched around on the surface there can 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.500
 you just drag along the surface 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.420
 then the ghost that is a mini 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.380
 bombarde for not throwing it so soon 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:07.140
 Can you imagine that? 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:11.700
 that's what the whole thing looks like 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.370
 just raised and that's it 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.170
 you need that's something very much 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.450
 for example , slowly presented again 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.430
 been made or so that 's it 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.140
 of course, it looks like hall when it's off 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.830
 It does not sink that way down 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.510
 is torn 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.190
 that's just when we see that 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.830
 fisherman stands in the middle water 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.350
 Leave it in spring or autumn 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.420
 slowly fall off and then ball 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.460
 always as always and so we can stop 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.070
 the be made very well present so 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.500
 My friends all first with the 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.820
 next assembly at trout next 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.400
 I'll give you the three plantations 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:49.020
 with trout corner and pilot ball 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.700
 and that probably means it 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.150
 feather quill therefore almost the same as 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.810
 nico 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:57.680
 so must see you again next time 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.680
 look clean
