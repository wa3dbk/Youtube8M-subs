00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:10.499
 I'm afraid to give you a review on the silicon keyboard from now on. 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:14.849
 At the library, 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:17.430
 For the purpose of typing without sound in the library 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.370
 I bought a silicone keyboard 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.210
 But uh adventure that comes less scary but in fact not a voice 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.939
 It's quiet. 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:35.379
 Then Ying Keyboard 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:38.379
 I 'll test it to see if it's actually available in the library. 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.379
 first 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.110
 I 'll try typing on my laptop. 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.539
 Now I am now 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.060
 I will put up the presentation on the keyboard of the old 2 volumes 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.180
 I'll try typing a silicon keyboard now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:33.780
 If it's a disadvantage to the silicon keyboard 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.630
 Uh uh So it does not kill bad smell just exactly the boogie board 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.409
 Geuljja ought to say is human flesh 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 This keyboard is slow to type 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:49.159
 Of course, the sound is small. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.159
 If you type the keyboard quickly, the sound becomes louder. 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.750
 To use this keyboard as a library 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:11.900
 I think it can be used if you type 2 slowly and slowly 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:17.590
 It seems to still be a lot more noise than a standard notebook keyboard 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.590
 I'll finish reviewing the beans keyboard
