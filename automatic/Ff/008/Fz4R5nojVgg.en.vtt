00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
flooring the nice thing about this

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.630 
flooring the nice thing about this
system<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.230> air<00:00:46.440> gap<00:00:46.649> will<00:00:46.920> allow<00:00:47.219> for

are you standing on top of a tile that's
freezing<00:00:54.660> cold<00:00:54.960> there's<00:00:55.469> an<00:00:55.649> air<00:00:55.829> gap<00:00:56.070> which

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
freezing cold there's an air gap which

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.459 
freezing cold there's an air gap which
serves<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.910> an<00:00:57.030> insulator<00:00:57.480> which<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.350> know

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
serves as an insulator which you know

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.959 
serves as an insulator which you know
will<00:00:58.680> raise<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> temperature<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.699> floor

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
will raise the temperature of the floor

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.549 
will raise the temperature of the floor
make<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> much<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:00.629> comfortable<00:01:01.199> if

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
make it much more comfortable if

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.470 
make it much more comfortable if
anything<00:01:01.980> ever<00:01:02.070> happens<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> damage<00:01:03.210> a
