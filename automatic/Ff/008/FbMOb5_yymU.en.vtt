difference between the rest and families

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.049 
difference between the rest and families
is<00:00:53.579> quite<00:00:54.270> simple<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:55.320> may<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:56.370> increased

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is quite simple one may be for increased

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.060 
is quite simple one may be for increased
memory<00:00:57.329> another<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.320> focus<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
memory another one for focus and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.840 
memory another one for focus and
concentration

another<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.750> may<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.960> has<00:01:01.500> better<00:01:01.739> delivery

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
another one may be has better delivery

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.219 
another one may be has better delivery
system<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.510> question<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> have

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
system so the first question is you have

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
system so the first question is you have
to<00:01:04.320> find<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.159> goals<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to find out what your goals are do you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.179 
to find out what your goals are do you
want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> increase<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.140> memory<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
want to increase your memory or do you

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
want to increase your memory or do you
want<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.549> increase<00:01:08.970> speed<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.900> your<00:01:10.290> brain<00:01:10.530> or

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
want to increase speed of your brain or

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.130 
want to increase speed of your brain or
do<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.159> spatial<00:01:11.810> increase<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:12.960> there's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
do you want spatial increase so there's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
do you want spatial increase so there's
so<00:01:13.229> many<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.830> areas<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> focus

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so many different areas you got to focus

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
so many different areas you got to focus
on<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.390> highly<00:01:15.689> recommend<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> first

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
on so highly recommend that you first

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
on so highly recommend that you first
figure<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.400> area<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.240> want<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
figure out the area that you want to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
figure out the area that you want to
focus<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:19.110> now<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> second<00:01:20.430> difference<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
focus on now the second difference is

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.109 
focus on now the second difference is

the<00:02:02.630> reason<00:02:02.930> why<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.140> love<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.830> actually

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
the reason why I love it it actually

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.370 
the reason why I love it it actually
really<00:02:04.880> good<00:02:05.090> at<00:02:05.180> delivering<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.990> your<00:02:06.170> brain

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
really good at delivering to your brain

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.859 
really good at delivering to your brain
so<00:02:06.650> by<00:02:06.980> it<00:02:07.280> passes<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.060> blood-brain<00:02:08.479> barrier

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
so by it passes the blood-brain barrier

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.220 
so by it passes the blood-brain barrier
it<00:02:09.710> actually<00:02:10.009> increases<00:02:10.490> ATP<00:02:11.330> which<00:02:11.600> what<00:02:12.110> you

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
it actually increases ATP which what you

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.080 
it actually increases ATP which what you
need<00:02:12.380> adenosine<00:02:13.040> triphosphate<00:02:13.370> for

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
need adenosine triphosphate for

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.570 
need adenosine triphosphate for
mitochondria<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.680> it's<00:02:16.010> good<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.460> brain

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
mitochondria so one it's good for brain

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.190 
mitochondria so one it's good for brain
health<00:02:16.640> -<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.330> good<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:17.510> mitochondria

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
health - it's good for mitochondria

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.980 
health - it's good for mitochondria
health<00:02:18.380> but<00:02:18.980> here's<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.310> caveat<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.000> always<00:02:20.720> care

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
health but here's a caveat I always care

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.740 
health but here's a caveat I always care
about<00:02:21.130> delivering<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.340> substances<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.570> your

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
about delivering the substances to your

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.770 
about delivering the substances to your
brain<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.530> I'll<00:02:24.740> couple<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:25.760> alpha<00:02:26.540> GPC

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
brain so I'll couple that with alpha GPC

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.200 
brain so I'll couple that with alpha GPC
which<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> choline<00:02:28.120> acetyl<00:02:29.120> l-carnitine

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
which is a choline acetyl l-carnitine

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.920 
which is a choline acetyl l-carnitine
which<00:02:29.990> is<00:02:30.140> shown<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.590> shuttle<00:02:31.630> molecules<00:02:32.630> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
which is shown to shuttle molecules and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.450 
which is shown to shuttle molecules and
shuttle<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.350> vitamins<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.980> nutrients<00:02:34.340> with

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
shuttle the vitamins and nutrients with

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.520 
shuttle the vitamins and nutrients with
inside<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:34.970> mitochondria<00:02:35.270> such<00:02:35.959> as<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> taxi

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
inside the mitochondria such as a taxi

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.280 
inside the mitochondria such as a taxi
driver<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.090> also<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.120> highly<00:02:38.570> recommend<00:02:39.230> that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
driver and also I highly recommend that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.400 
driver and also I highly recommend that
you<00:02:39.410> add<00:02:39.680> methyl<00:02:40.580> methyl<00:02:41.209> cobalamin<00:02:41.750> b12<00:02:42.260> with

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
you add methyl methyl cobalamin b12 with

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.170 
you add methyl methyl cobalamin b12 with
some<00:02:42.560> folate<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.190> conjunction<00:02:43.910> with

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
some folate in conjunction with

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.870 
some folate in conjunction with
liposomal<00:02:44.750> magnesium<00:02:45.500> now<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.490> is<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> good

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
liposomal magnesium now this is a good

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.670 
liposomal magnesium now this is a good
stock<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.360> take<00:02:47.570> out<00:02:47.870> experiment<00:02:48.590> with

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
stock to take out experiment with

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190 
stock to take out experiment with
different<00:02:48.860> dosages<00:02:49.610> timing<00:02:50.420> wise<00:02:50.570> maybe<00:02:50.990> take

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
different dosages timing wise maybe take

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.720 
different dosages timing wise maybe take
it<00:02:51.350> right<00:02:51.470> away<00:02:51.680> when<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:51.920> wake<00:02:52.100> up<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.580> right

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
it right away when you wake up and right

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.210 
it right away when you wake up and right
before<00:02:53.000> bed<00:02:53.300> also<00:02:53.690> it's<00:02:54.470> really<00:02:54.800> important

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
before bed also it's really important

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.110 
before bed also it's really important
considering<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:55.880> are<00:02:55.910> water<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:56.780> are<00:02:56.810> h2o<00:02:57.440> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
considering we are water we are h2o and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.699 
considering we are water we are h2o and
for<00:02:59.120> your<00:02:59.300> brain<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.810> function<00:02:59.989> properly<00:03:00.350> you

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
for your brain to function properly you

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.710 
for your brain to function properly you
need<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.040> be<00:03:01.160> hydrated<00:03:01.820> intracellularly

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
need to be hydrated intracellularly

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.900 
need to be hydrated intracellularly
hydrated<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:03.739> highly<00:03:04.160> recommend<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.790> you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
hydrated so I highly recommend that you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.570 
hydrated so I highly recommend that you
drink<00:03:05.390> structured<00:03:06.260> water<00:03:06.440> trace<00:03:07.190> mineral

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
drink structured water trace mineral

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.580 
drink structured water trace mineral
water<00:03:07.790> with<00:03:08.239> lemon<00:03:08.630> all<00:03:08.900> day<00:03:09.080> maybe<00:03:09.320> some

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
water with lemon all day maybe some

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.410 
water with lemon all day maybe some
baking<00:03:09.920> soda<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.489> deliver<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.940> better<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
baking soda to deliver it better and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.530 
baking soda to deliver it better and
combine<00:03:12.050> this<00:03:12.200> all<00:03:12.410> together<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.239> I'm<00:03:14.239> pretty

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
combine this all together and I'm pretty

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.000 
combine this all together and I'm pretty
sure<00:03:14.630> they<00:03:14.900> can<00:03:15.019> feel<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> million<00:03:15.709> dollars

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
sure they can feel a million dollars

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.220 
sure they can feel a million dollars
better<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.700> Nathan<00:03:17.330> I<00:03:17.480> really<00:03:17.780> hope<00:03:17.989> that<00:03:18.019> I
