00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
it's kind of sealed off on the sides you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:51.430 
it's kind of sealed off on the sides you
get<00:02:38.210> a<00:02:38.270> knife<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:39.050> cut<00:02:39.290> through<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:50.440> so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
get a knife so I can cut through that so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.430 
get a knife so I can cut through that so
inside<00:02:52.240> it<00:02:53.240> certainly<00:02:53.570> doesn't<00:02:53.810> need<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.290> be

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
inside it certainly doesn't need to be

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.830 
inside it certainly doesn't need to be
necessarily<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.190> big<00:02:55.550> but<00:02:56.210> these<00:02:56.480> kinds<00:02:56.780> of

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840

probably say that these are more
designed<00:03:24.200> for<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.770> making<00:03:25.430> rings<00:03:25.820> just

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
designed for the making rings just

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.790 
designed for the making rings just
because<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.630> consistency<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.590> paper

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
because the consistency the paper

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.640 
because the consistency the paper
doesn't<00:03:28.100> hold<00:03:28.850> good<00:03:29.120> for<00:03:29.150> writing<00:03:29.570> wishes<00:03:29.930> but

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
doesn't hold good for writing wishes but

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.030 
doesn't hold good for writing wishes but
um<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.370> then<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.000> paper<00:03:32.570> for<00:03:32.990> that<00:03:33.170> nice

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
um and then the paper for that nice

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.460 
um and then the paper for that nice
little<00:03:34.220> moon<00:03:34.550> made<00:03:35.330> out<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.690> good<00:03:35.900> oh<00:03:36.110> that's
