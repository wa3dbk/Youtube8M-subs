00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
core chip and hit the 86 60 and as you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.830 
core chip and hit the 86 60 and as you
know<00:00:42.780> snapdragon<00:00:43.710> 80<00:00:44.610> 660<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> dual

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840

core<00:00:46.309> CPU<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.850> brand<00:00:48.180> new<00:00:48.270> GPU

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
core CPU in there we have brand new GPU

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.150 
core CPU in there we have brand new GPU
so<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:50.129> show<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.370> guys<00:00:50.579> some<00:00:51.180> our<00:00:51.300> graphics

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
so to show you guys some our graphics

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.100 
so to show you guys some our graphics
demos<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.329> take<00:00:54.510> advantage<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
demos and how we take advantage of the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.099 
demos and how we take advantage of the
new<00:00:55.230> GPU<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:56.430> well<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.820> obviously<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
new GPU as well as obviously we have the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.660 
new GPU as well as obviously we have the
video<00:00:58.350> engine<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:59.039> capable<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.460> doing

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
video engine we're capable of doing

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.229 
video engine we're capable of doing
1080p<00:01:00.210> video<00:01:00.510> 2d<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> stereo<00:01:02.340> 3d<00:01:02.520> video<00:01:03.059> as

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
1080p video 2d and stereo 3d video as

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.530 
1080p video 2d and stereo 3d video as
well<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.840> let<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.739> start<00:01:05.040> off<00:01:05.339> by<00:01:05.700> showing<00:01:06.330> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
well so let me start off by showing you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.410 
well so let me start off by showing you
guys<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:07.460> cool<00:01:08.460> thing<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
guys a little cool thing with it this is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
guys a little cool thing with it this is
a<00:01:09.450> fully<00:01:10.140> functional<00:01:10.820> 3<00:01:11.820> D<00:01:11.970> UI<00:01:12.380> they<00:01:13.380> were<00:01:13.500> do

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a fully functional 3 D UI they were do

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
a fully functional 3 D UI they were do
we<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.310> top<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> Android<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> idea<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
we have on top of Android so the idea is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.700 
we have on top of Android so the idea is
you<00:01:16.500> know<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> GPU<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:18.710> obviously

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
you know the GPU you can obviously

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
you know the GPU you can obviously
gaming<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> big<00:01:20.490> deal<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
gaming is a big deal but you also can

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440 
gaming is a big deal but you also can
use<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.170> GPU<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.740> things<00:01:23.340> other<00:01:23.580> than<00:01:23.670> our

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
use the GPU for things other than our

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
use the GPU for things other than our
than<00:01:24.630> gaming<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> 3d<00:01:26.520> UI

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
than gaming so this is a 3d UI

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
than gaming so this is a 3d UI
there's<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> elements<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.100> here

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
there's a lot of elements going on here

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.399 
there's a lot of elements going on here
why<00:01:29.700> are<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> depths<00:01:30.180> going<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> go

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
why are the depths going on as you go

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.800 
why are the depths going on as you go
down<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> light<00:01:32.729> rays<00:01:33.000> kind<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> get

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
down you know the light rays kind of get

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.429 
down you know the light rays kind of get
into<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.820> depth<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> sea<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.290> we

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
into the depth of the sea and then we

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.350 
into the depth of the sea and then we
have<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> whole<00:01:38.040> sea<00:01:38.340> monster<00:01:38.759> tries<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.180> bite

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
have a whole sea monster tries to bite

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.899 
have a whole sea monster tries to bite
your<00:01:39.570> finger

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.719 

so<00:01:45.049> again<00:01:46.049> volumetric<00:01:46.560> fog<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> water

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
so again volumetric fog is the water

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.010 
so again volumetric fog is the water
blob

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
blob

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.580 
blob
so<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.770> shows<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.149> where<00:01:52.140> we're<00:01:52.290> going

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
so just shows you that where we're going

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.399 
so just shows you that where we're going
in<00:01:52.770> terms<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.130> UI<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:54.060> terms<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.200> take

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
in terms of UI in terms of how you take

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.770 
in terms of UI in terms of how you take
advantage<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.920> GPU<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:56.640> smooth<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.630> this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
advantage of GPU is very smooth and this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.039 
advantage of GPU is very smooth and this
can<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.140> done<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> Drina<00:01:59.280> 220<00:02:00.049> another

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
can all be done on the Drina 220 another

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.389 
can all be done on the Drina 220 another
demo<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:04.399> so

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
demo that we have for you this is a so

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.419 
demo that we have for you this is a so
so<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> idea<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> console

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
so the idea here is this was a console

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.180 
so the idea here is this was a console
game<00:02:08.700> prior<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> mobile<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.259> performance

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
game prior to mobile and performance

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.170 
game prior to mobile and performance
level<00:02:11.520> is

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
level is

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.899 
level is
phenomenon<00:02:12.719> so<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.489> can<00:02:14.700> really

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
phenomenon so you know you can really

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.000 
phenomenon so you know you can really
have<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.780> kind<00:02:16.079> of<00:02:16.170> console<00:02:16.859> quality

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
have the kind of console quality

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.849 
have the kind of console quality
graphics<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.969> your<00:02:18.480> mobile<00:02:18.750> device<00:02:19.019> as<00:02:19.799> a

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
graphics on your mobile device as a

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.440 
graphics on your mobile device as a
matter<00:02:20.159> of<00:02:20.250> fact<00:02:20.519> they<00:02:20.760> turn<00:02:20.969> around<00:02:21.120> this

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
matter of fact they turn around this

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.179 
matter of fact they turn around this
game<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:21.959> now<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.319> available<00:02:22.409> on<00:02:23.159> the

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
game and now it's available on the

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.610 
game and now it's available on the
Windows<00:02:23.400> 7<00:02:23.939> phones<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.599> you<00:02:24.719> can<00:02:24.840> go<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.319> and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
Windows 7 phones so you can go out and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.259 
Windows 7 phones so you can go out and
actually<00:02:25.739> get<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> phone<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.370> has<00:02:26.640> even<00:02:27.060> metal

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
actually get a phone that has even metal

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.800 
actually get a phone that has even metal
on<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.780> play<00:02:28.260> xbox<00:02:28.530> live<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.579> let<00:02:30.569> me<00:02:30.629> play

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
on it and play xbox live so let me play

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.229 
on it and play xbox live so let me play
a<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.430> demo<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.790> you

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
a little demo for you

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.170 
a little demo for you
just<00:02:33.689> to<00:02:33.870> show<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:35.129> level<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.819> graphics

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
just to show you the level of graphics

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.250 
just to show you the level of graphics
that<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:37.819> possible<00:02:38.819> this<00:02:39.689> is<00:02:39.750> running<00:02:40.109> close

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that is possible this is running close

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:50.800 
that is possible this is running close
to<00:02:40.409> 60<00:02:40.680> frames<00:02:40.920> per<00:02:40.980> second<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.299> device

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.520 

so<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.349> lot<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:53.810> complex<00:02:54.810> stuff<00:02:55.109> going<00:02:55.379> on

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
so just a lot of complex stuff going on

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:04.740 
so just a lot of complex stuff going on
there<00:02:55.799> rich<00:02:56.040> environment

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.750 

and<00:03:06.510> I've<00:03:07.510> talked<00:03:07.870> about<00:03:08.020> dual<00:03:08.350> core<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.580> was

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
and I've talked about dual core so I was

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.010 
and I've talked about dual core so I was
going<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.060> show<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.270> guys<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.450> little<00:03:10.630> dual

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
going to show you guys a little dual

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:19.680 
going to show you guys a little dual
core<00:03:11.200> demo<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.920> we're<00:03:18.070> going<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.570> mirror<00:03:19.570> the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
core demo so we're going to mirror the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.420 
core demo so we're going to mirror the
UI<00:03:19.900> over<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.670> TV<00:03:21.910> over<00:03:22.150> there<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:24.280> is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
done here is we have basically three

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.790 
done here is we have basically three
browser<00:03:54.670> tabs<00:03:55.120> going<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:55.990> here

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
browser tabs going on here

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.350 
browser tabs going on here
those<00:03:57.310> two<00:03:57.610> are<00:03:59.010> browsing<00:04:00.010> experience<00:04:00.610> and

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
those two are browsing experience and

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.970 
those two are browsing experience and
show<00:04:01.630> you<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.230> scrolling<00:04:02.560> up<00:04:02.800> and<00:04:02.890> down

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
show you the scrolling up and down

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.010 
show you the scrolling up and down
there's<00:04:03.730> lots<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.060> stuff<00:04:04.270> going<00:04:04.300> on<00:04:04.660> the<00:04:04.840> page

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
there's lots of stuff going on the page

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.310 
there's lots of stuff going on the page
you<00:04:05.770> know<00:04:05.890> this<00:04:06.160> is<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.760> Java<00:04:07.450> Script<00:04:07.840> as<00:04:08.050> a

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
you know this is a Java Script as a

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.060 
you know this is a Java Script as a
WebGL<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:10.030> it's<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.239> rendering<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:11.070> animated

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
WebGL so it's a rendering of animated

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.390 
WebGL so it's a rendering of animated
fish<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.140> these<00:04:14.380> are<00:04:14.590> your<00:04:14.830> frames<00:04:15.190> per

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
fish so and these are your frames per

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.330 
fish so and these are your frames per
second<00:04:15.820> with<00:04:16.299> one<00:04:16.780> court<00:04:17.080> active<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:18.100> what<00:04:18.280> I'm

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
second with one court active so what I'm

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.070 
second with one court active so what I'm
gonna<00:04:18.459> do<00:04:18.730> is<00:04:19.090> I'm<00:04:19.209> gonna<00:04:19.269> go<00:04:19.480> ahead<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.840> turn

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and turn

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.050 
gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and turn
the<00:04:20.350> second<00:04:20.890> court<00:04:21.130> on<00:04:21.310> oh<00:04:23.850> wow

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.210 

so<00:04:28.060> if<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.510> see<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.840> fish<00:04:29.110> went<00:04:29.740> from<00:04:29.919> about

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
so if you see the fish went from about

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.909 
so if you see the fish went from about
eight<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.760> nine<00:04:30.790> frames<00:04:31.150> per<00:04:31.330> second<00:04:31.750> close<00:04:32.680> to

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
eight to nine frames per second close to

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.100 
eight to nine frames per second close to
some<00:04:33.669> point<00:04:33.880> I<00:04:33.970> think<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.240> were<00:04:34.360> touching<00:04:34.630> 20

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
some point I think we were touching 20

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.070 
some point I think we were touching 20
with<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.290> fish<00:04:35.590> and<00:04:36.160> then<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.610> browser

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
with the fish and then the browser

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.570 
with the fish and then the browser
experience<00:04:38.080> goes<00:04:38.530> from<00:04:38.740> 20<00:04:39.070> 30<00:04:39.100> frames<00:04:39.520> per

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
experience goes from 20 30 frames per

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.719 
experience goes from 20 30 frames per
second<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.120> close<00:04:40.390> to<00:04:40.570> 60<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:41.710> lot<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.550> times

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
second to close to 60 a lot of times

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.390 
second to close to 60 a lot of times
we're<00:04:42.940> seeing<00:04:43.320> linear<00:04:44.320> scaling<00:04:44.800> terms<00:04:45.250> of

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
we're seeing linear scaling terms of

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.909 
we're seeing linear scaling terms of
performance<00:04:45.850> so<00:04:46.419> with<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.200> second<00:04:47.560> coat<00:04:47.680> on

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
performance so with the second coat on

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.940 
performance so with the second coat on
we're<00:04:48.640> able<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:49.060> double<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.600> performance

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
we're able to double the performance

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
we're able to double the performance
which<00:04:50.950> is<00:04:51.070> pretty<00:04:51.280> impressive

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970

experience or just a mobile experience

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.040 
experience or just a mobile experience
is<00:04:56.830> getting<00:04:57.100> richer<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.640> second<00:04:58.330> core<00:04:58.600> is

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
is getting richer the second core is

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.719 
is getting richer the second core is
really<00:04:59.350> going<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.680> be<00:04:59.830> making<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.610> big

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
really going to be making a big

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.580 
really going to be making a big
