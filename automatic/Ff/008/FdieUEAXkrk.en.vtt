00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.550
 6 what can happen to you yes one says so by game offer on Steam 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.410
 and stumbles over the multiplayer shooter called Political 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.850
 the toughest battlefields in the world economy with the destroyer 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.440
 high 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.580
 and then you will curiously raise your head to the fun you get with it 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.770
 Battlefield Bad Company 2 had and probably still buys in the Amazon 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.119
 finally in a kind of skip action of this Brit 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.149
 and then 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.849
 tremendous 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.220
 okay we explain 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.489
 the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.499
 Jarque destructible buildings are in the letter 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:41.059
 However, this helps more or less than 2 likes in the campaign 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.799
 be on the map climb at least so many mosquitoes are around 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:47.460
 as likely throughout Sweden fields 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.500
 you can shoot some things already 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.200
 and then there are the bridges 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.770
 Loerrach 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.520
 in fact, the available final elements and the coverage system 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.460
 the only Klose who can post with us politically otherwise it is 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.910
 in the multiplayer shooter to a single big annoyance 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.340
 Although you can as in current multiplayer titles more of the climber 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.960
 and get deserved points better weapons or more 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.090
 Buy equipment such as Kettler Westen 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.960
 but also the learning or the points earned the comparatively 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.470
 Finance finance lamb and what's up to the game 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.600
 most of the matches are hosted by players on their machines 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.460
 There will only be a few dedicated servers 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.350
 on which the games, however, do not run much better than those on 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.600
 private firm 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 the budget then in case of doubt go astray while the rest of the 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.710
 Player suffers partial underground transmission error 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.579
 No here is the highest in can 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.820
 or the game may be off right away 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.149
 There is an incredibly spongy control 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.520
 if you then like to fraction of the professional team on tightness like something 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.679
 slow market share you have in politically no second joy because even 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.530
 if you have the mouse speeds windows linux and mac os a game off 

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.849
 Yemen flies and on the input devices even the lowest 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:08.930
 Sensitivity b 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.309
 you still never have the feeling to be master of his gun 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:15.469
 Minimal movements of the bearing will still be too early 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.589
 relatively huge brother into the game 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:23.229
 Although Fried played with Team Deathmatch in Westphalian convoy recovery and 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.769
 However, five of the surviving game modes will be through the net 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.829
 offers fake and convoy games 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.650
 we did not have a single one in the lessons we spent with the title 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.649
 Metz in the sense that I can do it all 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.500
 or survive game feeling 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.109
 the latter is the classic Last Man Standing Ovation 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.839
 why do you see much more play money is obvious the deeds are big 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:46.960
 Time was just a year old grief 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.400
 because they have too much free space and comparatively little money and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.659
 In addition, they are simply too big 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.030
 Connoisseurs of both markets only two players running around then should be the image 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.029
 to be a Chilean seeker 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.130
 1 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.760
 As mentioned earlier, people are never anything but 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.510
 Super in sight Lex nerves just as frustrating as the fact that you 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 Also, do not enter a game instead election result in the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.360
 loading screen 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.299
 and then it comes out again when you completely miss the game 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.599
 graphically Bob Dietz also nobody the resolution can be regulated 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.629
 and house are on or off but that's about it 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.149
 and all the time 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.149
 now he has fallen and accompanies him for his 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.879
 Reach set does not cost 5 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.489
 the pro a but even that is still too expensive 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.209
 the multiplayer-shooter only for people who have a penchant for 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.580
 Self-help sharks have 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.530
 that should not be so many 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.040
 In any case, they do not belong to this and then leave them at this point too 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.130
 be good with the game
