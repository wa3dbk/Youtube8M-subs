so<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.690> give<00:04:27.930> way<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.260> things<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.800> are<00:04:28.979> coming

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.250 
so to give way to things that are coming
on<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.669> roundabout<00:04:30.030> which<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.810> completely

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
on to the roundabout which is completely

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.169 
on to the roundabout which is completely
how<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:31.860> shouldn't<00:04:32.190> be

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:35.179 

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:37.969 

so<00:04:36.179> turn<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.659> wheel<00:04:36.839> into<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.229> left<00:04:37.559> which<00:04:37.949> is

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
so turn the wheel into the left which is

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.260 
so turn the wheel into the left which is
the<00:04:38.099> only<00:04:38.279> way<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.550> can<00:04:38.789> go<00:04:38.909> around<00:04:38.999> this

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
the only way I can go around this

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.989 
the only way I can go around this
roundabout<00:04:39.629> and<00:04:39.989> the<00:04:40.739> steering<00:04:41.039> is<00:04:41.309> not<00:04:41.489> quite

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:41.999 
roundabout and the steering is not quite

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.019 
roundabout and the steering is not quite
as<00:04:42.300> crisp<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.319> as<00:04:43.409> tight<00:04:43.769> as<00:04:44.129> it<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.789> in<00:04:44.939> a

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:45.029 
as crisp and as tight as it is in a

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:46.909 
as crisp and as tight as it is in a
minute<00:04:45.330> which<00:04:45.479> is<00:04:45.509> incredibly<00:04:46.229> sure-footed

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
minute which is incredibly sure-footed

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.199 
minute which is incredibly sure-footed
so<00:04:47.069> there's<00:04:47.249> a<00:04:47.279> little<00:04:47.519> bit<00:04:47.729> more<00:04:47.969> sort<00:04:48.179> of

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:48.209 
so there's a little bit more sort of

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:51.409 
so there's a little bit more sort of
body<00:04:48.569> roll<00:04:48.839> in<00:04:49.379> this<00:04:49.949> car<00:04:50.279> than<00:04:50.489> in<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:50.729> Mini<00:04:50.969> no

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:59.239 
body roll in this car than in a Mini no
bad<00:04:51.659> thing<00:04:57.349> so<00:04:58.349> while<00:04:58.529> I'm<00:04:58.649> stuck<00:04:58.919> at<00:04:59.099> yet

00:04:59.239 --> 00:04:59.249 
bad thing so while I'm stuck at yet

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:00.769
