00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.440
 he has to tell you that even in 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.450
 the end of the video because I'm going to 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.730
 be doing a little surprise 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.320
 for my subscribers then well no 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.510
 forget about that and here I leave you with 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.160
 the outfits good girls this is the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.660
 first auto and how can you see this is a 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.850
 little bit more rocker that's why I'm 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.170
 using leggings or pants 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.360
 Leather obviously runs really 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.970
 lie school and I'm using 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.710
 some high shoes only to give me 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.500
 a little more height and that the ofid 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.600
 be between the rocker and elegant and good 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.000
 here they have the cross of close up and they can 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.979
 see that it is very beautiful and everything will look 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.749
 as if it were made by hand for the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.890
 second out fit this one is a little bit 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.050
 plus 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.490
 but casual this is more than everything as 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.800
 for a dinner that's why I'm using 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.880
 my boots that have a little bit of heel 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.320
 to give me a little more height 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.750
 and it's good I'm also using 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.939
 Estevez that is like that of hairs 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.909
 also obviously it's not really 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.970
 false but it's also like to give me a 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.530
 look more elegant and also be 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.869
 wintry 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.940
 and good for the last out fit this 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.430
 follow a little more casual that's why 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.470
 I'm using some red pants 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.210
 I'm using my bini I'm 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 also using a pharmacy is that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.090
 They have a heel but they are very comfortable since 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.100
 they will use it to go to the city to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.330
 go for a coffee or just to go 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.710
 to have lunch and be all super casual 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.479

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.560

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.260

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.450

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.290
