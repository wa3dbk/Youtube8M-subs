00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.009
 so today I'm doing a tutorial 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.049
 with the gilad palette indicated so a 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.750
 new palette and that went out made his 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.689
 she's a look that I wore 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.289
 in my video of may ends in the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.910
 collection of this ghost and mac 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.920
 worse she many of you who 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.929
 me ticket was missing fair and beautiful 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 doing industrial that I had also posted 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.360
 a picture on instagram so it's a 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.270
 look really easy finally I find 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.129
 then the child I used only 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.920
 colors of this palette that I 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.989
 will show you all the material 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 so if the looks interest you 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.870
 installed that so you see a little the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 look at the cerleau 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.789
 natural is not it is not too 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.600
 royal in my opinion I can wear that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.420
 everyday 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.750
 there is nothing that prevents me from addressing this all 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.120
 days 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 I love the color that moaning underneath 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
 from the eye the shock and she's really 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.460
 the look even though I put a pencil 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.030
 in the collection are that if the look you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.799
 interested 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
 no I already apply the cream 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.780
 reproaching harvey milk and especially of 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.450
 map after my games anyway 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.060
 fragile to the bases in kg but the trouble 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.729
 tarnished mac that has a base that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.280
 completely Belgian like this one that goes 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.070
 generate a girl all my eyelid does 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.070
 so I know that all of this goes all con 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.630
 you see that's just a little unified 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.520
 I threw up below the same eye 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.680
 case a next hervÃ© niquet I 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.869
 have put below version we will open to 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.690
 this t1 colors the first color that 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.540
 we need in the pallet it's 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.860
 the color that is a little more peach 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.350
 so the one here is just a 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.619
 little bit a little sentences as ends 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.740
 so we're going to apply it with a big 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.289
 flat brush like this one so it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.690
 leave from sigma and we will apply 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.250
 apo land almost all over the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.810
 mobile eyelid we will stop we have 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.780
 here and that's it so it just comes 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.940
 really a little lit up the fire 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 illuminate their gore so we take the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.650
 even brushes we just know how to turn it 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.450
 two good stops and we take the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.720
 color that a little earlier in the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.550
 palette so the color here so that's 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.000
 a mole with a little gloss at 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.100
 inside so accepted the thin at 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.620
 become applied in color but more 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.890
 severe the last part in the farm 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.890
 of the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.720
 no we also want to mix the two 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.090
 colors together as the demarcation 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.890
 so we take a big brush that is 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.800
 a people too to mix the two 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.130
 colors so the color she's a little 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.050
 just more thinking wants our look and is 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.080
 now he just has us color to 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.910
 so use the dark purple color that 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.640
 will really go in the shot our 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.590
 eye so this one is super pigmented 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.230
 so it can be applied in two 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.049
 times the most charming marked one wants a 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.290
 accurate then we can miss what we want 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.049
 make 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.670
 I apply to 1.15 or so here that has 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.590
 makes a jump to put in the hole of 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.850
 the eye that there is from sigma he 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.980
 is really very weak and that's me 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.660
 my brush preferably and the n 5 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.190
 so it's perfect for would not go 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.709
 apply the color in the hollow is 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.730
 so the word we will apply it a little 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.680
 just here 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.220
 then we will make a small movement 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.220
 as if 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.260
 then after creating a little color 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.000
 like that here we really mean to 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.680
 mix for well-founded colors of which 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.750
 should take a big brush like 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.470
 this one to mix all the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.470
 colors together 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.390
 well mix the colors are a little 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.920
 lost the intensity our word but we 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.349
 did not want a demarcation 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.690
 so we're just in htm doing the same 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.170
 knife brushes and in them really 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.170
 in the shot 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.140
 to have bought our bad in the raw 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.860
 they are a joke and bought from 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.739
 colors in blades below the 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.780
 threshold of flaming so that's unique 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.580
 favorite marc the palette really knows it 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.490
 it's really beautiful as color 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.090
 so this is the duo I thought oracle in 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.820
 video then the market info during the 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.030
 part that is more blue here to put 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.590
 below the eye and is in the corner 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.660
 internal and this color there I had to 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.110
 take to put it below the 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.110
 eyebrows 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.100
 and that's so I find that color 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.400
 below the eye it's really 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.960
 this color and the light in the look on 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.050
 often of color setting that is 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.510
 darker down but sure it's there 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.480
 really open the look so the 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.640
 next step is to put the line 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.610
 so I always take the same year 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.160
 that he indicated classes who knows 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.440
 with a sugar tip then that of 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.440
 famines still mean it's for sure 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.640
 so here is the moon done as you see 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.660
 I paint them completely until 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.180
 internal corner then it is the breeding souk 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.070
 so after that we're going to come bent over weddings 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.680
 and I do not send I use the remedy by 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.540
 transport top used their fight 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.440
 salt comes back excuse our material has 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.320
 favorite of the moment 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.390
 the mavs years I use my base maximiles 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.730
 they jack a white base that just 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.460
 give more volume and length 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.840
 also having applied I applied my 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.420
 favorite master of the moment but in this 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.950
 moment that it justifies niedermayer has 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.540
 so finished the smoky loose 2004 as well as 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.670
 the mascara the body if it stays 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.320
 a lot in the inter it's not the 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.900
 best is closed the one right now 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.690
 but what I can remember so 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.640
 and that's after applying but two 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.270
 materials so after have led to 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.890
 buy the pencils lady that is so 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.660
 creo that I take if the creditor in 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.170
 the palette is in the rock color 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.480
 star and turn to steven klein 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.460
 benson indicated so for once he 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.470
 super black who even in the palette but 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.280
 well a role I think it's really going to die 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.280
 complete the look 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.020
 so and that's after applying the 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.360
 pencils in the best soup but 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.090
 still soften the pollack light look 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.960
 it's not a bad guy then the excess 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.960
 concert I watch it by mail 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.400
 so here is the final lauquet I hope 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:02.229
 that you like the look of the eyes is 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.490
 sure it gives so it's a look that we 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:05.650
 can still go every day and 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:10.810
 if i know it's a uses words 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.010
 nice little blue and white eyes but 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.370
 I think they are still very 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.320
 portable the final look I hope it 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.680
 did me more for my time I 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.840
 used I knew pie crime with so 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.000
 the 37 or there profits 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.729
 so if you have any questions 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.680
 do not hesitate to leave me in the 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:32.919
 bar but no comments below 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.930
