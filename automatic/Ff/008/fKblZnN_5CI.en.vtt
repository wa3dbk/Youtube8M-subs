00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
corner so it was kind of like one of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.050 
corner so it was kind of like one of
those<00:01:16.920> things<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.700> had<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.909> get

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
used to and kind of figure out how fast

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
used to and kind of figure out how fast
I<00:01:21.150> could<00:01:21.210> push<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> sled<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.320> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
I could push the sled and it was just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980 
I could push the sled and it was just
like<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.070> no<00:01:23.100> limit<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.659> now<00:01:24.810> if

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
like there was no limit to it so now if

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.690 
like there was no limit to it so now if
