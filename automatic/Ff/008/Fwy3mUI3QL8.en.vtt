00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:07.790
 like other prodigies of technology 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.130
 current this is a field that even makes 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.190
 a few years he was alone in the movies 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.200
 but that is now getting closer 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.110
 of entering the homes of the world 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.270
 whole why the time has come for 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.650
 immerse ourselves fully in the hallucinatory 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.900
 world of virtual reality in general 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.420
 Virtual reality refers to a 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.850
 digitally generated environment that we 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.999
 allows us to simulate our physical presence 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.350
 in real or imaginary places 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:38.449
 exploiting mainly the aspect 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.269
 visual through the use of lenses 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.100
 specials but also through 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.129
 other accessories that can enrich 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.699
 the experience at the auditory level and up 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.129
 tactile at present this incipient 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.319
 technology must still face some 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.319
 technical drawbacks such as 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:01:00.560
 limitations in resolution processing 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:03.530
 of image and bandwidth 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.770
 and while the term virtual reality is 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.750
 used since the 70s has been 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.840
 on everyone's lips in the last weeks 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.910
 for two important reasons the first 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.150
 was the announcement by the company 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.010
 sony of his promising project that was 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.350
 presented in the recent game 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.990
 developers conference in san francisco 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.960
 california in development since 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.600
 about 3 years the marius project 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.940
 it is much more than a simple peripheral 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.550
 although we are still talking about a 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.640
 prototype that will be perfected with 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.310
 the time this system is composed 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.030
 basically by a viewer with 3d screen 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.790
 of 5 inches with full HD resolution a 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.550
 90 degree field of vision and sound 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.040
 envelope in addition to the part in charge 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.050
 of motion sensors similar to 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.660
 the technology used in the playstation 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.560
 move is to say shaped by 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.290
 Accelerometers and gyroscopes initially 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.229
 designed to work with playstation 4 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.490
 its respective camera the dualshock and the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.470
 peripheral move 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.690
 it is not ruled out that in the future more 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.970
 fisk is also compatible with 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.180
 personal computers and others 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.640
 devices in addition the way 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.860
 connect all these elements is to 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.550
 less for now only through 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.560
 usb and hdmi connections and a cable 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.390
 several meters although they are expected 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.630
 wireless features for 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.849
 future versions unfortunately 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.880
 there is still no information 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.819
 about launch dates prices u 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.799
 other specifications however moore 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.480
 fuse is available to 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.239
 leading developers of 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.769
 videogames and have already been seen demos 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.540
 of some titles like zip jeff baker and 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.580
 of course we had the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.250
 opportunity to try the moorfields in 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.440
 san francisco and we can confirm that it is 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.720
 an immersive experience that still 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.819
 it needs some adjustments but that 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.150
 promises a lot for the future of the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.150
 video game 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.880
 the other recent news that has us 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.560
 all talking about this topic is the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.320
 acquisition of the Californian company 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.590
 or with the bear by the giant 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.050
 facebook that put on the table more than 2 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.420
 one billion dollars to become 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.810
 in the owner of the star product of the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.300
 I saw the virtual reality lenses 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.760
 oculus ruiz this gadget that was given to 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.130
 know successfully on the page 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.350
 of kickstarter financing and that 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.780
 just launched its second and improved 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.420
 developer version is one of 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.330
 the best achieved devices and with 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.420
 greater projection of the item 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.280
 well after more than two years 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.920
 perfecting itself and with about 75,000 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.530
 units in the hands of developers the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.390
 oculus rif could be released to the market 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.710
 massive by the end of this year or 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.500
 early next 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.530
 already with the accolade of the queen of 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.930
 social networks whose founder the popular 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.210
 mark zuckerberg considers that the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.910
 virtual reality is the great platform 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.100
 of the future thanks to its many 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.799
 possible applications beyond the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.650
 video games like communications the 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.470
 cinema television sports 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.750
 distance education the military field and 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.240
 Medicine 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.220
 if it was not enough facebook has a 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.120
 interesting catalog of games that 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.610
 could benefit from the oculus network 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.460
 this is the fascinating virtual reality 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.070
 which by offering a world so 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.620
 convincing like the real but without their 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.419
 limitations is shaping up as one of the 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.510
 technological revolutions more 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.520
 important of the story so no 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.720
 tell you not dying to 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.650
 put on some lenses like these 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.650
