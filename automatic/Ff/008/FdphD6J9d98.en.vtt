going to go through all of them because
there<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.680> many<00:01:29.009> options<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.729> some

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
there are so many options and some

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.980 
there are so many options and some
options<00:01:30.240> will<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.509> better<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.750> some

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
options will look better on some

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
options will look better on some
pictures<00:01:31.320> rather<00:01:31.860> than<00:01:32.100> others<00:01:32.400> you've<00:01:32.610> got

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
pictures rather than others you've got

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
pictures rather than others you've got
the<00:01:32.820> sharpness<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.630> boost<00:01:34.290> all

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the sharpness here that I can boost all

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
the sharpness here that I can boost all
the<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:34.770> up<00:01:34.920> or<00:01:35.130> even<00:01:35.159> make<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> blurry<00:01:35.909> all

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the way up or even make it blurry all

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.990 
the way up or even make it blurry all
the<00:01:36.240> way<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.689> well<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.100> choose<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the way down well we will choose all the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
the way down well we will choose all the
way<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.600> want<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> make<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> picture<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
way up I want to make the picture of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
way up I want to make the picture of
sharp<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.970> draw<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
sharp as we can I can draw in the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.789 
sharp as we can I can draw in the
picture<00:01:42.720> which<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.170> don't<00:01:43.439> want<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> do

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
picture which I really don't want to do

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.109 
picture which I really don't want to do
but<00:01:43.979> you'll<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.610> start<00:01:44.880> drawing

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
but you'll see that when I start drawing

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.429 
but you'll see that when I start drawing
you<00:01:45.240> got<00:01:45.360> different<00:01:45.540> colors<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.140> different

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
you got different colors here different

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.380 
you got different colors here different
sizes<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.060> shows<00:01:48.240> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
sizes what I really like is it shows you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.550 
sizes what I really like is it shows you
on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> screen<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:49.140> you're<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> be

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
on the screen what you're going to be

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
on the screen what you're going to be
drawing<00:01:49.799> with<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.640> middle<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
drawing with in the middle I think the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.359 
drawing with in the middle I think the
last<00:01:51.960> thing<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> go<00:01:52.979> over<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
last thing we want to do is go over to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.010 
last thing we want to do is go over to
the<00:01:53.490> jess<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.149> mess<00:01:54.360> around<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:54.899> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the jess just mess around with some of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.359 
the jess just mess around with some of
the<00:01:55.079> options<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> brightness

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the options here like the brightness

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.859 
the options here like the brightness
move<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.270> we've<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
move that up a bit we've got the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.389 
move that up a bit we've got the
contracts<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.740> mess<00:01:58.890> around<00:01:58.920> with

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
contracts that we can mess around with

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.149 
contracts that we can mess around with
think<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.869> always<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:02.040> look

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
think the more is always don't look

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.399 
think the more is always don't look
better<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.659> we've<00:02:03.810> got<00:02:03.840> warmth

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
better I like that then we've got warmth

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.649 
better I like that then we've got warmth
which<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.799> want<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.939> leave<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> middle

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
which I want to just leave in the middle

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.140 
which I want to just leave in the middle
and<00:02:07.849> here<00:02:08.849> we've<00:02:09.000> got<00:02:09.140> saturation<00:02:10.140> which<00:02:11.150> I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and here we've got saturation which I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.580 
and here we've got saturation which I
will<00:02:12.330> boost<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.930> well<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> little<00:02:13.319> bit<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
will boost up as well a little bit and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.650 
will boost up as well a little bit and
then<00:02:13.650> apply<00:02:14.040> once<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:14.879> all<00:02:14.970> set<00:02:15.330> we'll<00:02:15.510> hit

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
then apply once we're all set we'll hit

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
then apply once we're all set we'll hit
that<00:02:15.810> button<00:02:15.989> at<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.140> top<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.770> done<00:02:16.980> and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that button at the top this is done and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.040 
that button at the top this is done and
then<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.819> will<00:02:17.970> allow<00:02:18.209> us<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.510> share<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.900> some

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
then it will allow us to share to some

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.900 
then it will allow us to share to some
social<00:02:19.440> networks<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:19.950> save<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.400> our<00:02:20.489> camera
