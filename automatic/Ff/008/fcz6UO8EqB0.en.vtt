00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.210 

wireless<00:00:00.719> microphones<00:00:01.230> are<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.500> great<00:00:01.920> tool

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
wireless microphones are a great tool

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.150 
wireless microphones are a great tool
both<00:00:02.580> in<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:03.210> out<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.780> studio<00:00:04.049> but<00:00:04.859> they

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
both in and out of the studio but they

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.070 
both in and out of the studio but they
can<00:00:05.430> be<00:00:05.549> expensive<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.299> they<00:00:06.660> also<00:00:06.839> have

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
can be expensive and they also have

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.379 
can be expensive and they also have
their<00:00:07.230> own<00:00:07.379> issues<00:00:07.770> however<00:00:08.700> there<00:00:09.150> are

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
their own issues however there are

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.089 
their own issues however there are
alternatives<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.320> can<00:00:10.500> not<00:00:10.679> only<00:00:10.830> be

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
alternatives of it can not only be

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.310 
alternatives of it can not only be
cheaper<00:00:11.550> but<00:00:12.000> also<00:00:12.450> don't<00:00:12.840> suffer<00:00:13.200> from

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
cheaper but also don't suffer from

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.770 
cheaper but also don't suffer from
wireless<00:00:13.679> problems<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.179> video<00:00:15.540> I'll

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
wireless problems in this video I'll

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.480 
wireless problems in this video I'll
show<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.109> how<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> came<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.770> find<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.250> few

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
show you how I came to find a few

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.640 
show you how I came to find a few
alternatives<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> wireless<00:00:18.750> mics<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.529> you

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
alternatives to a wireless mics that you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.450 
alternatives to a wireless mics that you
may<00:00:19.920> not<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.250> thought<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.580 

now<00:00:30.030> when<00:00:30.180> I'm<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.480> studio<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.990> use<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.470> lapel

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
now when I'm in the studio I use a lapel

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.010 
now when I'm in the studio I use a lapel
mic<00:00:31.950> and<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.610> connected<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.180> Sennheiser

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
mic and it's connected to my Sennheiser

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.230 
mic and it's connected to my Sennheiser
wireless<00:00:34.320> system<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.340> consists<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
wireless system this consists of a

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.270 
wireless system this consists of a
transmitter<00:00:36.720> here<00:00:37.170> which<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.800> microphone

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
transmitter here which for microphone

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
transmitter here which for microphone
plugs<00:00:38.550> into<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:40.080> transmits<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.650> signal

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
plugs into there this transmits a signal

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
plugs into there this transmits a signal
which<00:00:41.190> goes<00:00:41.220> to<00:00:41.640> my<00:00:41.820> base<00:00:42.090> station<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
which goes to my base station which is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.260 
which goes to my base station which is
over<00:00:43.080> there<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:44.160> picks<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.970> radio

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
over there and this picks up the radio

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.200 
over there and this picks up the radio
signal<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.020> output<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> audio<00:00:47.250> into

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
signal and in output to the audio into

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
signal and in output to the audio into
the<00:00:48.540> camera<00:00:48.930> now<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.010> arrangement<00:00:50.400> works

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the camera now this arrangement works

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.280 
the camera now this arrangement works
really<00:00:50.970> well<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> allows<00:00:51.840> me<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> move

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
really well and it allows me to move

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.780 
really well and it allows me to move
around<00:00:52.410> without<00:00:53.100> having<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> worry<00:00:53.640> about

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
around without having to worry about

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.760 
around without having to worry about
getting<00:00:54.030> tangled<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.809> wires<00:00:55.110> pulling

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
getting tangled up in wires pulling

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.500 
getting tangled up in wires pulling
something<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.340> maybe<00:00:56.879> damaging<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
something out maybe damaging the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.960 
something out maybe damaging the
microphone<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.290> camera<00:00:59.010> however<00:00:59.520> last

summer<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.420> needed<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.900> do<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> piece<00:01:01.350> about<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
summer I needed to do a piece about a

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
summer I needed to do a piece about a
monopod<00:01:02.340> which<00:01:02.640> meant<00:01:02.880> I<00:01:02.940> had<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.149> film

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
monopod which meant I had to film

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.749 
monopod which meant I had to film
outside<00:01:04.020> and<00:01:04.290> away<00:01:04.440> from<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:05.009> camera<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
outside and away from a camera so I

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.790 
outside and away from a camera so I
couldn't<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.390> cameras<00:01:06.930> internal<00:01:07.380> mic

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
couldn't use the cameras internal mic

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.680 
couldn't use the cameras internal mic
because<00:01:08.190> that's<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.550> too<00:01:08.700> noisy<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.300> I

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
because that's just too noisy and I

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.840 
because that's just too noisy and I
couldn't<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.500> camera<00:01:10.950> mounted<00:01:11.369> shotgun

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
couldn't use a camera mounted shotgun

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
couldn't use a camera mounted shotgun
mic<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.869> too<00:01:13.110> far

mic because I was going to be too far

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.859 
mic because I was going to be too far
away<00:01:13.649> from<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.160> camera<00:01:14.399> now<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.720> my

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
away from the camera now because my

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
away from the camera now because my
current<00:01:16.170> wireless<00:01:16.710> mic<00:01:16.920> uses<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> base<00:01:17.580> station

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
current wireless mic uses a base station

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.450 
current wireless mic uses a base station
which<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.240> powered<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> mains<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.460> couldn't

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
which is powered by the mains I couldn't

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
which is powered by the mains I couldn't
use<00:01:20.550> that<00:01:20.759> Eva<00:01:20.970> because<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> be

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
use that Eva because it was going to be

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.740 
use that Eva because it was going to be
no<00:01:22.170> power<00:01:22.470> where<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:23.009> filming<00:01:23.300> so<00:01:24.300> I<00:01:24.330> had<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
no power where I was filming so I had a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
no power where I was filming so I had a
choice<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.229> had<00:01:25.649> to<00:01:25.680> buy<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.220> new<00:01:26.850> wireless

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
choice I had to buy a new wireless

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.940 
choice I had to buy a new wireless
system<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:27.960> used<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> battery<00:01:28.530> power

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950

are<00:01:31.259> pretty<00:01:31.500> expensive<00:01:31.920> or<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:33.270> could<00:01:33.690> use

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
are pretty expensive or I could use

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
are pretty expensive or I could use
something<00:01:34.080> else<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.920> back<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> old<00:01:35.549> days

connected to a portable audio recorder
which<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> carry<00:01:54.360> around<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.080> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
which you carry around with you in the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.630 
which you carry around with you in the
same<00:01:55.439> way<00:01:55.650> as<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.010> with<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.250> wireless

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
same way as you do with a wireless

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.510 
same way as you do with a wireless
transmitter<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.990> you're<00:01:58.470> recording<00:01:58.920> all<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
transmitter so you're recording all the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.969 
transmitter so you're recording all the
audio<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.299> move<00:02:00.689> around<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.680> have<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
audio as you move around all you have to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.560 
audio as you move around all you have to
do<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> make<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.580> work<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.240> make<00:02:03.390> sure

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
do to make this work is to make sure

another<00:02:12.989> advantage<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.650> method<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.160> that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
another advantage of this method is that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.340 
another advantage of this method is that
you're<00:02:14.489> not<00:02:14.790> limited<00:02:15.060> by<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.600> range<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
you're not limited by the range of a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.560 
you're not limited by the range of a
radio<00:02:16.650> signal<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.850> don't<00:02:18.030> have<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.390> worry

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
radio signal and you don't have to worry

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.630 
radio signal and you don't have to worry
about<00:02:18.720> radio<00:02:19.320> interference<00:02:19.860> problems<00:02:20.459> either

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
about radio interference problems either

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.240 
about radio interference problems either

that worked ok but it's not really the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.010 
that worked ok but it's not really the
best<00:03:37.680> solution<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:39.000> other<00:03:39.150> issue<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.600> that
