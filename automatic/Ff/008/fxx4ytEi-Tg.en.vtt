00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680 

ok<00:00:47.200> so<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.680> Hellfire<00:00:48.370> droid<00:00:48.790> itself<00:00:49.210> now<00:00:49.449> it

ok so the Hellfire droid itself now it

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.580 
ok so the Hellfire droid itself now it
is<00:00:49.989> definitely<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.710> step<00:00:51.430> up<00:00:51.640> from<00:00:52.420> I<00:00:52.840> think<00:00:53.470> it

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
is definitely a step up from I think it

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.369 
is definitely a step up from I think it
was<00:00:53.770> two<00:00:54.070> thousand<00:00:54.640> eight<00:00:54.790> or<00:00:55.570> even<00:00:55.600> earlier

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
was two thousand eight or even earlier

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
was two thousand eight or even earlier
i'll<00:00:56.680> post<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.430> picture<00:00:57.670> now

angled<00:02:23.910> pieces<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.230> its

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
angled pieces there then you have its

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.170 
angled pieces there then you have its
little<00:02:25.680> gun<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.640> shoot<00:02:26.820> out<00:02:26.970> there

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
little gun here it can shoot out there

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.050 
little gun here it can shoot out there
then<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.810> have<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.049> two<00:02:28.549> missile<00:02:29.549> pods<00:02:29.820> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
then you have the two missile pods I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.699 
then you have the two missile pods I
guess<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.330> could<00:02:30.360> call<00:02:30.660> them<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:31.019> there<00:02:31.260> now

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
guess you could call them up there now

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.100 
guess you could call them up there now
these<00:02:31.890> feature<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.519> new<00:02:32.850> style<00:02:33.269> missile<00:02:33.870> not

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
these feature the new style missile not

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.500 
these feature the new style missile not
to<00:02:34.290> flick<00:02:34.500> fire<00:02:34.739> missile<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.269> see

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
to flick fire missile but as you can see

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.729 
to flick fire missile but as you can see
here<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:38.959> all<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.079> got<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.350> do<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.530> push

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
here you can all you got to do is push

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:41.750 
here you can all you got to do is push
them<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:40.950> actually<00:02:41.220> works<00:02:41.370> better<00:02:41.459> if<00:02:41.700> you

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
them it actually works better if you

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.110 
them it actually works better if you
flick<00:02:42.060> them<00:02:42.769> if<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.100> do<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> go

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
flick them if I can do it there you go

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.150 
flick them if I can do it there you go
I'll<00:02:45.959> shoot<00:02:46.170> these<00:02:46.320> other<00:02:46.590> two<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> those

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
I'll shoot these other two so those

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.090 
I'll shoot these other two so those
actually<00:02:50.610> shot<00:02:51.150> out<00:02:51.480> pretty<00:02:52.110> far<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.769> pretty

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
actually shot out pretty far and pretty

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100 
actually shot out pretty far and pretty
hard<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.640> definitely<00:02:54.299> like<00:02:54.480> those<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:54.959> thing

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
hard so definitely like those one thing

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.890 
hard so definitely like those one thing
I<00:02:55.200> do<00:02:55.260> like<00:02:55.380> about<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:56.150> brick<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.570> 1<00:02:57.750> by

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
I do like about that brick is it to 1 by

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.750 
I do like about that brick is it to 1 by
4<00:02:58.110> brick<00:02:58.380> with<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> spring<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.489> it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
4 brick with the spring in it and it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.940 
4 brick with the spring in it and it
does<00:02:59.970> not<00:03:00.120> matter<00:03:00.390> which<00:03:01.230> way<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.470> put<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.799> on

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
does not matter which way you put it on

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.740 
does not matter which way you put it on
the<00:03:02.100> set<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.519> could<00:03:02.790> actually<00:03:03.000> load<00:03:03.540> these

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the set so I could actually load these

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.130 
the set so I could actually load these
in<00:03:03.989> backwards<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.450> still<00:03:06.450> shoot<00:03:06.870> them<00:03:06.989> out

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
in backwards and still shoot them out

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.530 
in backwards and still shoot them out
there<00:03:07.489> actually<00:03:08.489> maybe<00:03:08.700> not<00:03:11.030> actually<00:03:12.030> no<00:03:12.360> I'm

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
there actually maybe not actually no I'm

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.199 
there actually maybe not actually no I'm
wrong<00:03:12.810> oh<00:03:13.080> yeah<00:03:13.800> I'm<00:03:13.950> right<00:03:14.129> actually<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:15.030> yeah

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
wrong oh yeah I'm right actually so yeah

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.490 
wrong oh yeah I'm right actually so yeah
so<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.720> put

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
so you can put

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.350 
so you can put
them<00:03:16.710> out<00:03:16.920> backwards<00:03:17.490> or<00:03:17.610> forward<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.210> when

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
them out backwards or forward so when

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.030 
them out backwards or forward so when
you're<00:03:18.480> building<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:18.930> set<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.380> got<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.860> little

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
you're building this set I got a little

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.610 
you're building this set I got a little
confused<00:03:20.430> there<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.900> where<00:03:21.900> do<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.110> put<00:03:22.410> them

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
confused there of where do I put them

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.260 
confused there of where do I put them
you<00:03:22.830> know<00:03:22.920> forwards<00:03:23.310> or<00:03:23.400> backwards<00:03:23.430> was<00:03:23.970> then

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
you know forwards or backwards was then

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.390 
you know forwards or backwards was then
you<00:03:24.360> got<00:03:24.480> kind<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.990> fake<00:03:25.830> ones<00:03:26.160> they're

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you got kind of the fake ones they're

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.660 
you got kind of the fake ones they're
just<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> little<00:03:27.150> knob<00:03:27.690> piece<00:03:28.110> there<00:03:28.380> and

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
just the little knob piece there and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.920 
just the little knob piece there and
overall<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.700> sets<00:03:30.150> pretty<00:03:30.360> cool<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:30.780> can

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
overall this sets pretty cool you can

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.500 
overall this sets pretty cool you can
angle<00:03:31.320> these<00:03:31.860> up<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.090> perfectly

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
angle these up so it's perfectly

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.360 
angle these up so it's perfectly
horizontal<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.530> angle<00:03:34.920> them<00:03:35.130> just

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
horizontal or you can angle them just

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.360 
horizontal or you can angle them just
like<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.610> box<00:03:35.850> shows<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.620> overall<00:03:37.620> great<00:03:38.010> set

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
like the box shows and overall great set

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.340 
like the box shows and overall great set
comes<00:03:38.940> with<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.120> hundred<00:03:39.510> sixty<00:03:39.900> three<00:03:40.050> pieces

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
comes with a hundred sixty three pieces

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.320 
comes with a hundred sixty three pieces
now<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.890> is<00:03:41.100> including<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.790> minifigures

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
now that is including the minifigures

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.480 
now that is including the minifigures
but<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.260> minifigures<00:03:43.740> don't<00:03:43.980> make<00:03:44.160> up<00:03:44.310> for

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
but the minifigures don't make up for

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.300 
but the minifigures don't make up for
much<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.030> around<00:03:45.270> 150<00:03:46.110> pieces<00:03:46.410> for<00:03:47.160> this

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
much of it so around 150 pieces for this

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.979 
much of it so around 150 pieces for this
set<00:03:47.520> here<00:03:47.730> now<00:03:48.090> for<00:03:48.300> twenty<00:03:48.540> dollars<00:03:48.810> that's

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
set here now for twenty dollars that's

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.360 
set here now for twenty dollars that's
actually<00:03:49.380> pretty<00:03:49.560> good<00:03:49.800> that's<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.100> little

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
actually pretty good that's a little

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.880 
actually pretty good that's a little
over<00:03:50.580> ten<00:03:50.880> cents<00:03:51.150> apiece<00:03:51.300> but<00:03:52.170> overall

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
over ten cents apiece but overall

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.240 
over ten cents apiece but overall
definitely<00:03:53.610> a<00:03:53.670> really<00:03:54.060> cool<00:03:54.450> set<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:56.010> we're

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
definitely a really cool set so we're

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.090 
definitely a really cool set so we're
going<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.430> go<00:03:56.550> over<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.910> minifigures<00:03:57.360> now

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
going to go over the minifigures now

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.130 
going to go over the minifigures now
okay<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.160> here's<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.940> clone<00:04:00.360> lieutenant<00:04:00.989> now

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
okay so here's the clone lieutenant now

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.590 
okay so here's the clone lieutenant now
I<00:04:01.380> definitely<00:04:02.190> have<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.550> say<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.120> awesome

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
I definitely have to say this is awesome

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.690 
I definitely have to say this is awesome
that<00:04:03.630> they<00:04:03.930> included<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.890> set<00:04:05.130> but

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
that they included this in the set but

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.460 
that they included this in the set but
it<00:04:05.910> also<00:04:06.090> sucks<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.900> may<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.200> fourth

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it also sucks for the may the fourth

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.130 
it also sucks for the may the fourth
promotion<00:04:08.190> i<00:04:08.370> believe<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.000> was<00:04:09.090> this<00:04:09.360> year<00:04:09.420> or

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
promotion i believe it was this year or

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.560

pieces as you can see here as well as a
spare<00:06:09.570> missile<00:06:10.570> so<00:06:10.930> that's<00:06:11.110> pretty<00:06:11.320> awesome

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
spare missile so that's pretty awesome

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.439 
spare missile so that's pretty awesome
so<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:12.070> think<00:06:12.160> they<00:06:12.490> were<00:06:12.550> looking<00:06:12.850> out<00:06:13.090> for<00:06:13.330> us

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
so I think they were looking out for us

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.590 
so I think they were looking out for us
making<00:06:14.110> sure<00:06:14.440> we<00:06:14.740> did<00:06:14.979> not<00:06:15.160> lose<00:06:15.460> them<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:15.910> I

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
making sure we did not lose them and I

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.800 
making sure we did not lose them and I
think<00:06:16.660> that's<00:06:16.960> pretty<00:06:17.110> awesome<00:06:18.630> okay<00:06:19.630> last

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
think that's pretty awesome okay last

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.860 
think that's pretty awesome okay last
but<00:06:19.990> not<00:06:20.199> least<00:06:20.260> here's<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:21.099> box<00:06:21.550> now<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.360> box

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
but not least here's the box now the box

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.960 
but not least here's the box now the box
is<00:06:23.080> definitely<00:06:23.560> a<00:06:23.590> little<00:06:23.800> bit<00:06:24.010> smaller<00:06:24.580> than

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
is definitely a little bit smaller than

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.029 
is definitely a little bit smaller than
I<00:06:25.570> was<00:06:25.960> expecting<00:06:26.110> it<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.680> be<00:06:26.770> but<00:06:26.979> I

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
I was expecting it to be but I

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:28.439 
I was expecting it to be but I
definitely<00:06:27.250> like<00:06:27.639> how<00:06:27.820> they're<00:06:27.970> going<00:06:28.180> with

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
definitely like how they're going with

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.800 
definitely like how they're going with
kind<00:06:28.810> of<00:06:28.840> a<00:06:28.960> square<00:06:29.830> and<00:06:30.160> then<00:06:30.789> a<00:06:30.849> thicker<00:06:31.449> box

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
kind of a square and then a thicker box

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.510 
kind of a square and then a thicker box
I<00:06:32.020> think<00:06:32.229> that's<00:06:32.380> kind<00:06:32.590> of<00:06:32.620> cool<00:06:32.800> so<00:06:33.400> it

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
I think that's kind of cool so it

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.219 
I think that's kind of cool so it
advertises<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.330> new<00:06:34.479> missiles<00:06:34.840> here<00:06:35.050> and

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
advertises the new missiles here and

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.140 
advertises the new missiles here and
once<00:06:35.710> again<00:06:35.830> you<00:06:36.010> have<00:06:36.039> disney<00:06:36.580> now<00:06:36.760> because

once again you have disney now because

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.939
