 to go now i do not want to land anymore 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.540
 Let's start with the video and me 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.070
 I wish you a lot of fun before 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.870
 I'm on my facial routine 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.730
 I would like to start you directly once 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.220
 first tip against pimples call and the 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.900
 is not a face 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.610
 that will be some of you very much now 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.040
 shock but I have with me 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.900
 actually found that I have a lot 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.210
 I have more pimples when I have some days 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.640
 long unvarnished was easy 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.530
 That's why I'm always in the face 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.450
 hold if I'm unvarnished because of it 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.310
 I try at least one during the day 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.140
 little powder to carry me then 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.680
 it keeps me constantly face to face 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.270
 take 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.830
 but remember that this tip 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.510
 it just helps with me that means 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.640
 not that it will be the case for everyone 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.200
 many will swear by it completely 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.200
 to waive maker 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.340
 Let's start with the actual 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.540
 I have to clean my face 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.850
 Of course my hair is out of my face 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.040
 so they do not get wet and 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.590
 the first product I use 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.090
 I use the valeo cleaning cloths 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.560
 just to rough my make-up too 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.480
 remove and now we come too 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.430
 already directly to the second tip and the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.020
 is always make-up when you enter 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.090
 bed goes and you should not 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.010
 just use a section of cloth like 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.110
 this is on the dressing table 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 really just because you roughly yours 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.489
 make-up removed that is sort of a 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.930
 pre-cleaning after that you should 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.609
 always wash your face 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.469
 if i water resistant on the day 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.120
 Removed mascara I remove 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.769
 first of all with your eyes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.480
 make up remover of mail berlin 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.129
 if then most of the make-up 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.290
 it is already down to 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.459
 proper facial cleansing for it before 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.349
 Of course, I'll take my face first 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.109
 with water and then I take this 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.000
 lotion of salt house dead sea 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.709
 and there we will be directly at my 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.840
 third tip against pimples and though 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.280
 Just like me, you have sensitive skin 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.049
 then definitely used one 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.969
 Gentle facial cleansing such as 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.370
 For example, this is better avoided 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.180
 on such strong crass anti pimples 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.700
 Products 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.470
 because the irritating sensitive skin is very strong 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.859
 and you get even more 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.859
 pimple 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.829
 Nevertheless, it is very important 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.989
 at least once a week or so 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.549
 I face about every two days 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.739
 to play that is right my 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.959
 fourth tip i either take for it 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.419
 always a peeling or a facial 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.459
 brush and the regular many is like that 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.650
 important because it frees the pores and 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.780
 the dead skin scales removed 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.909
 which can easily cause pimples 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.799
 but here too, you have to be careful 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.419
 play should not rub too hard 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.979
 and so on, that would be the skin 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.079
 again only too much irritate 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:45.180
 then I wash my face off and on 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.709
 Ink it with a towel and 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.049
 then it goes on with these 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.239
 cells cleaning water from lira or 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.220
 something like that I just give again 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.379
 on a waterbed and stroke it 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.540
 over my face and over my eyes 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.250
 to simply make up what legal 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.889
 could be somewhere and of course 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.900
 also a few eyelashes tusche leftovers too 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.599
 remove that is really very good 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.530
 After that, everything is really down 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.530
 on the face had 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.130
 in winter, my skin tends to dry 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.870
 and that's why I use in 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.790
 moment a fatty creams for 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.740
 dry skin what me then too 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.050
 my last tip and that is 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.940
 to find the right cream if you are 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.169
 pimples made us very greasy skin then 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.150
 you should definitely 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.320
 Avoid fatty creams and 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.520
 really take care that there 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.710
 it just says it's one 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.180
 Moisturizer is in the dry 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.710
 skin as well as I have then you should open 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.810
 every case a fatty cream 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.610
 just use your skin again 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.830
 the fat returns what they just do 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.660
 I ended up losing then 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.310
 now and then an eye cream on 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.930
 this one is from clinique and the 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.520
 I just pots with my ring 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.199
 Fingers on my eyes 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.400
 and that makes the eye area easy 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.620
 again a little more moisture 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:12.350
 because I'm very dry right there 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:13.880
 skin often have so that we now have a 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.620
 facial care routine and a few 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.510
 tips against pimples I simply am 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.190
