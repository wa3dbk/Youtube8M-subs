00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.490
 history coffee with federica praise hello 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.049
 federica is first of all thanks for 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.610
 participate in this new installment of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.160
 stay at the cafe thanks to you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.840
 the first question is always the same here 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.920
 in this format that coffee companies that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.390
 relationship you have with coffee 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.080
 then I got a macchiato e 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.020
 relationship with coffee is enough 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.220
 tight that is in the sense that above all 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.840
 when maybe I do all a little 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:31.470
 challenging i drink not too many 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.239
 bar machine when bar closes maybe 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 then I entrust the machine yes yes no no 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.719
 I'm not so fine this is it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.379
 important that there is the field is always 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.430
 ready then I close the speech on the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.180
 food is a question that intrigues 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.829
 very 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.120
 chemistry chemistry hungry and that hunger 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.140
 that is not after the evenings between fumes 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 and no demanding alcohol scents will be a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 milano goes from paninaro and around 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.149
 in the Italian province it will be in the ovens 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.939
 more or less federica praises enters and asks 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 of the savory of the boiled sweet of the salt 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.689
 and go pizza type sandwiches too I am 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 absolutely to be done then there is actually 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.409
 I would like to ask a lot about piadina though 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.049
 milano ie if you want to ask for it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.680
 here maybe someone has it but the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.720
 at that time leaders certainly anger at 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.759
 top and vacation and I ask you where you go 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.159
 and above all your ideal holiday if 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.770
 seas mounts agritourisms and maras 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.360
 definitely all my life or maybe 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.440
 visit a city between indicatively 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.710
 to rest 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.030
 the sea where I go not just because of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 how many parts I will go I hope and I don't know 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 then at school you give me the impression 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.680
 to have been to school you did the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.440
 high school I did not do all around with 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.760
 second languages ​​called this 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.110
 school no longer exists among other things 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.080
 merged with accounting if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.090
 ok he did well and by the way I got it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.900
 you were beautiful brave and envied by all 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.340
 classmates 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:15.270
 no I was good this one studies very little 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:20.490
 I listened a lot but then sent no 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.830
 indeed, one does not even believe it 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.490
 very good losers but it was a thing of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:31.650
 all women 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:33.090
 we are games like 27 28 but they are one 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.920
 great competitiveness at the level of 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.070
 practical results what liked 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070
 very 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:46.050
 I know that music is another great passion 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.209
 convenient because the kind that 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.920
 prefer and not paying for the kind of 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.070
 genres that prefer made rock genres 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.410
 always a rock listening to a lot of 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.440
 concerts I love my music there is one 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.770
 soundtrack always the presentation 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.630
 of twitter and abi rock no though that ab 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.910
 faith rock and roll between ferrara and mi 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.380
 exalt you reality that definition is 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.380
 created by mark greaney ok 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.140
 we are favorite artists in Italy 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.180
 in short, nothing is always a lot 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.180
 linked to music is very related to 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.950
 my life always turned away the song of the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.390
 moment 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.660
 according to you there is a singing canton that 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:39.030
 often hum, maybe a song that 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.500
 karachi dixit that you often listen to 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.560
 this period if there was I'm listening 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:54.450
 bryan adams and go and go to nobel for a 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.520
 great because it is not scene made 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:09.240
 two or three are patients to be a mi 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:12.260
 remember never say comito well then 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.260
 how long his strategy lasted 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.130
 if I know years but I was pinching friend 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.630
 linen and I ask you this is a good point 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.700
 a good starting point in your opinion in 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.610
 courtship is a good point of 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.170
 departure is to be high or equal to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.430
 brad pitt or do a similar job 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.550
 to do a completely different job 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:48.420
 or give red roses to give you a 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:50.220
 everything, however, always looks like this 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.590
 well i don't know in my opinion the first thing is 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.440
 actually feeling that there is something 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.770
 chemistry absent from its own activity 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.310
 that then if you are very similar to a 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.910
 brad pitt does not look enough but it is not 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.960
 a fundamental thing 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.000
 feel good about animals and no soul 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.580
 I'm not in Milan also because I have the 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.210
 tendency to make a massacre of plans 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.640
 I would like all year 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.940
 my parents have a cat that i 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:25.180
 I am very fond of it because I am sure 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.010
 I've been through 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.540
 much of my youth with 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.250
 this wonderful pyrgi 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.410
 very funny that I always grace them 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.410
 I would like to investigate the massacre of plants 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.960
 forget it really is mine 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.020
 balcony has magically bloomed took 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.090
 I believe perhaps an initiative also for 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.720
 spite 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.900
 chenis is rebellious there is not really a 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.420
 creative and explanations I am milessso 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.240
 Federica is fine for the many you 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:03.490
 meanwhile fans follow but also for whom 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.130
 maybe he doesn't know you I tell you this 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.020
 there was a cross there was a federica praise 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.400
 cream presented the mass not only the 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.400
 surface of sky sport 24 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:20.440
 the other kid money later 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:25.390
 sorry lyrical knot names me 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:31.360
 clearly I 'm sorry to follow you 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:32.620
 anyway where where can be found 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.919
 for those who don't know 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.009
 then I work the same newspaper 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.150
 practically 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.639
 let's say it 's not long enough 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.529
 so there are possibilities to see me 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.900
 absolutely now you can find me 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:49.039
 also around ferrara with friends 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.689
 when like today, for example, good now 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:56.080
 I have to enter the camera to do 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:58.330
 like a selphy video bye bye 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.710
 nothing that dedicates 6 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.270
