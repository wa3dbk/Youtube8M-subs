00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.020
 I know 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.040
 are healthy here we have a problem a 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.840
 problem that involves us all leaving 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.360
 sideways the political colors or 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.070
 any difference we have 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.960
 first of all let's do an analysis of 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.119
 where are we standing as a university and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.369
 Why are we gentlemen the university? 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.140
 federico santa maría technique 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.450
 we figure texts in the ranking of 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.500
 top universities of chile yes 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.030
 gentlemen texts but let's ask ourselves why 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.520
 by comparing our teacher ratios 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.320
 feet and warm between full time with those of 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.750
 the other universities that lead the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.030
 ranking we can see that the figures 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.740
 they are noticeably lower now let's see 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.260
 the ranking of the engineering career 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.270
 industrial civil here we figure as 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.700
 third but if you look at the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.410
 research the data are worrying 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.840
 when compared with those who lead the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.060
 ranking now let's review the ranking 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.220
 of commercial engineering we configure 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.770
 sixth below the university ort 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.089
 ibáñez the university diego portals and 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.150
 let's look again at the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.310
 research leaves much to be desired 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.480
 now if we see a ranking of the best 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.910
 business schools at the level 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.280
 Latin American we can see that we are 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.770
 in place 19 under the university of 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.110
 development let's say the amount of papers 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.000
 and if they are published as we pretend 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.980
 be the leader in science engineering and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.840
 technology if our teachers we 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.480
 they are updating researching on the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.850
 current market clearly here we have 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.740
 a problem gentlemen the department of 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.690
 Industry is not working well 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.330
 to achieve the excellence of which 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.150
 We both boast this excellence that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.380
 is a bit far from reality to root 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.940
 of this two groups of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.070
 professors within the department of 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.150
 industries that have different forms 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.430
 to see how the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.710
 department on the one hand is the one that 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.710
 eight a group of eight teachers all 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.300
 doctor videos and that concentrate an 82.4 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.490
 percent of the publications of the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.170
 department of industries them 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.580
 they propose the separation of the department 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.800
 of industries has reformed the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.380
 commercial engineering department but 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.970
 because they want this they pose that 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.830
 there is a lot of irregularity within the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.930
 department of industry within the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.040
 which we can find the fast bass 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.069
 of students by professors 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.099
 the small amount of publications isi 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.980
 few teachers conductive two suns 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.900
 with salaries not suitable for the market and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.549
 they can only degree instructors have 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.799
 salary close to 10 million 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.999
 weights in addition to this highlights that there are 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.790
 two professors within the department 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:34.260
 are under summary the g8 has a 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.489
 vision that seeks the growth of the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.459
 academy through refinement 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.799
 and the constant research to be able 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.540
 be the elite of knowledge them 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.579
 propose that with this more the complete 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.230
 transparency our university can 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.810
 aim to do the match of 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.879
 latin america on the other hand is the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.590
 g-15 that is formed by 15 teachers 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.049
 of the department of industries in the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.989
 which 46.6 percent of them are 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.730
 doctors and together they total 17 6 for 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.739
 hundred of the publications and follows the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.269
 department they pose a system 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.180
 which is based on the department itself 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.290
 same as a set that is not necessary 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.180
 that all teachers are 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.489
 investigating that some researcher 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.349
 can be a bad teacher with this 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.540
 pose that there may be researchers 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.239
 exclusive that meet the minimum 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.769
 academic burden now we ask ourselves if 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.319
 researchers almost do not do classes 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.850
 teachers do not investigate how 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.800
 we receive the new ones 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.470
 of the market to be able to go to the 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.910
 vanguard they also pose that 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.830
 there is total transparency of 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.570
 department and that there are no older 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.220
 problems claim that this looks 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.140
 reflected in the six years of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.970
 accreditation of the race now with 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.250
 all this data can be left in 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.620
 four different scenarios the first 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.330
 would do nothing, which implies that 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.450
 several of the g8 teachers 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.700
 give up another plane that we can see 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.570
 in the equal separation benefits the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.040
 commercial 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.050
 leaves you with large gaps in the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.150
 department of industries the third 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.560
 plan similar to the second only that 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.200
 He argues that the teachers who 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.670
 attached to the industry department what 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.920
 which would be beneficial for both 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.080
 careers but in theory they would not have 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.300
 changes in the background we would follow the same 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.430
 before and finally we have the fourth 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.440
 scenario that contemplates before anything 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.870
 an intervention to the department that 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.370
 correct existing irregularities and 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.830
 from this projecting into the future 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.200
 all this will finally be decided in the 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.210
 top council but as students 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.370
 in our duty to inform and make us 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.260
 of listening especially if it comes to what 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.130
 who are teaching us and our 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.130
 future prestige
