due to my eyesight another point I
started<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> consider<00:00:54.960> trained<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
started to consider trained to be a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310 
started to consider trained to be a
commercial<00:00:56.190> pilot<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.390> discovered<00:00:58.230> that

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
commercial pilot and discovered that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.510 
commercial pilot and discovered that
there<00:00:58.469> are<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.739> few<00:00:58.800> sponsorship

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
there are very few sponsorship

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.430 
there are very few sponsorship
opportunities<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.020> very<00:01:01.230> expensive

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
opportunities and that is very expensive

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.880 
opportunities and that is very expensive
so<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:03.480> decided<00:01:03.930> probably<00:01:04.379> best<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so I decided probably best I go to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399 
so I decided probably best I go to
university<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.760> look<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.479> again<00:01:06.630> looking

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
university and look at again looking

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
university and look at again looking
things<00:01:07.619> again<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> few<00:01:08.189> years<00:01:08.280> time<00:01:09.020> towards

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
things again in a few years time towards

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.530 
things again in a few years time towards
the<00:01:10.049> end<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.260> my<00:01:10.380> degree<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.119> took<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> look<00:01:12.299> at

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
