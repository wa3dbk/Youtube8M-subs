00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
what I mean by the best weapon I'm I'm

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.959 
what I mean by the best weapon I'm I'm
going<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.229> talk<00:01:29.439> about<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.860> what<00:01:30.520> I've<00:01:30.670> seen

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
going to talk about the what I've seen

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.910 
going to talk about the what I've seen
so<00:01:31.180> far<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.630> best<00:01:31.899> weapons<00:01:32.259> in<00:01:32.409> each<00:01:32.619> class

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
so far is the best weapons in each class

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.819 
so far is the best weapons in each class
but<00:01:33.159> also<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:34.360> weapons<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.140> should<00:01:35.170> equip

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
but also which weapons you should equip

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.370 
but also which weapons you should equip
yourself<00:01:36.399> with<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.850> think<00:01:37.659> you<00:01:37.780> need<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.960> machine

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
yourself with I think you need a machine

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.520 
yourself with I think you need a machine
gun<00:01:38.619> and<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:39.789> think<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.329> you<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:41.110> go<00:01:41.259> either

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
gun and I think that you can go either

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.069 
gun and I think that you can go either
with<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.159> assault<00:01:42.850> rifle<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.750> will<00:01:43.930> go

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
with the assault rifle and I will go

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.929 
with the assault rifle and I will go
with<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.350> FAL<00:01:45.070> if<00:01:45.340> you're<00:01:45.490> gonna<00:01:45.579> do<00:01:45.820> an

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
with the FAL if you're gonna do an

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.749 
with the FAL if you're gonna do an
assault<00:01:46.270> rifle<00:01:46.329> or<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.920> go<00:01:48.130> with<00:01:48.520> a

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
assault rifle or you can go with a

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.310 
assault rifle or you can go with a
sniper<00:01:49.299> rifle

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
sniper rifle

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.980 
sniper rifle
and<00:01:51.310> from<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:51.609> I've<00:01:51.729> seen<00:01:51.759> right<00:01:52.119> now<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.390> Mk

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
and from what I've seen right now the Mk

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.770 
and from what I've seen right now the Mk
II<00:01:53.020> think<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.100> 20<00:01:55.060> have<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.299> look<00:01:55.479> whatever

II think it's 20 have to look whatever

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.270 
II think it's 20 have to look whatever
is<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.859> way<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.039> go<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.670> now<00:01:58.829> why<00:01:59.829> I<00:01:59.859> like

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
is the way to go on that now why I like

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.090 
is the way to go on that now why I like
the<00:02:00.430> fao<00:02:00.990> mostly<00:02:01.990> assault<00:02:02.259> rifles<00:02:02.649> I<00:02:02.740> tried

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
the fao mostly assault rifles I tried

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.340 
the fao mostly assault rifles I tried
other<00:02:03.850> than<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.329> earlier<00:02:04.719> levels<00:02:05.020> what<00:02:05.320> I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
other than the earlier levels what I

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.380 
other than the earlier levels what I
like<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.770> they're<00:02:06.159> just<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.700> little<00:02:06.880> under

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
like that they're just a little under

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.749 
like that they're just a little under
power<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:08.770> don't<00:02:08.920> have<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.220> range<00:02:09.580> that

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
power they don't have that range that

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.380 
power they don't have that range that
you<00:02:10.030> need<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.509> found<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.410> found<00:02:11.470> that<00:02:12.070> at<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you need I found I found that at the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.380 
you need I found I found that at the
closer<00:02:13.390> range<00:02:13.750> whatever<00:02:14.140> I'd<00:02:14.290> rather<00:02:14.530> have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
closer range whatever I'd rather have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.020 
closer range whatever I'd rather have
machine<00:02:16.390> gun<00:02:16.630> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
machine gun and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.780 
machine gun and
the<00:02:18.380> assault<00:02:19.380> rifle<00:02:19.860> didn't<00:02:20.220> really<00:02:20.520> give<00:02:20.760> me

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the assault rifle didn't really give me

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.360 
the assault rifle didn't really give me
much<00:02:21.330> better<00:02:22.320> range<00:02:22.740> or<00:02:23.040> anything<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.310> that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
much better range or anything like that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.390 
much better range or anything like that
or<00:02:24.410> dramatically<00:02:25.410> better<00:02:25.530> accuracy<00:02:26.040> or

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
or dramatically better accuracy or

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.770 
or dramatically better accuracy or
anything<00:02:26.580> like<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.330> liked<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
anything like that so I liked the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.410 
anything like that so I liked the
machine<00:02:28.080> gun<00:02:28.290> until<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.340> tried<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> FAL

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
machine gun until I tried the FAL

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.480 
machine gun until I tried the FAL
now<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.600> FAL<00:02:31.140> at<00:02:31.290> first<00:02:31.560> until<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.100> modified

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
now the FAL at first until it's modified

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.570 
now the FAL at first until it's modified
is<00:02:32.910> okay<00:02:33.390> once<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.410> modified<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.160> basically

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
is okay once it's modified it basically

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.170 
is okay once it's modified it basically
becomes<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:39.830> semi<00:02:40.830> sniper<00:02:41.430> rifle<00:02:42.030> if

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
becomes like a a semi sniper rifle if

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.990 
becomes like a a semi sniper rifle if
you<00:02:42.330> will<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.900> scope<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.280> has<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.880> know

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
you will the scope but it has you know

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.699 
you will the scope but it has you know
basically<00:02:45.830> burst<00:02:46.830> fire<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.630> think<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.410> a

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
basically burst fire and I think it's a

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.949 
basically burst fire and I think it's a
fabulous<00:02:50.459> weapon<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.239> its<00:02:51.360> really<00:02:51.810> pretty

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
fabulous weapon and its really pretty

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.840 
fabulous weapon and its really pretty
good<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.650> kind<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.070> get<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.459> sniper

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
good so you can kind of get that sniper

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.070 
good so you can kind of get that sniper
rifle<00:02:54.030> type<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.200> range<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.600> not<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.840> same

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
rifle type of range and and not the same

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080 
rifle type of range and and not the same
power<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.980> know<00:02:59.070> you're<00:02:59.250> shooting<00:02:59.970> out

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
power but you know you're shooting out

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.020 
power but you know you're shooting out
you<00:03:00.390> know<00:03:00.540> burst<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:01.080> a<00:03:01.560> fire<00:03:02.250> there<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:02.790> as

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
you know burst of a fire there so as

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.180 
you know burst of a fire there so as
opposed<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.480> one<00:03:03.720> shot<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.830> gives<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.130> a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
opposed to one shot and it gives you a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.130 
opposed to one shot and it gives you a
lot<00:03:05.370> more<00:03:05.520> flexibility<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.660> will<00:03:06.900> work

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
lot more flexibility so it will work

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.260 
lot more flexibility so it will work
with<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.800> medium<00:03:08.190> range<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.790> even<00:03:09.000> the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
with that medium range and even the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.300 
with that medium range and even the
closer<00:03:09.510> range<00:03:09.870> whereas<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> sniper<00:03:10.560> rifle<00:03:10.800> has

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
closer range whereas a sniper rifle has

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.920 
closer range whereas a sniper rifle has
a<00:03:11.340> little<00:03:11.640> bit<00:03:11.730> more<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.360> difficulty<00:03:12.840> with

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
a little bit more of a difficulty with

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.800 
a little bit more of a difficulty with
that<00:03:13.100> at<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.310> same<00:03:14.520> time<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:14.850> can<00:03:15.270> easily<00:03:15.450> see

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that at the same time I can easily see

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.750 
that at the same time I can easily see
sitting<00:03:16.080> you'll<00:03:16.290> go<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.590> sniper<00:03:16.890> rifle<00:03:17.370> you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
sitting you'll go on to sniper rifle you

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.310 
sitting you'll go on to sniper rifle you
have<00:03:17.940> your<00:03:18.120> machine<00:03:18.270> gun<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> fully

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
have your machine gun and a fully

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.310 
have your machine gun and a fully
modified<00:03:19.739> machine<00:03:20.250> gun<00:03:21.200> particularly<00:03:22.200> like

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
modified machine gun particularly like

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.770 
modified machine gun particularly like
the<00:03:22.470> amount<00:03:22.709> later<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.980> Peking<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.780> I'm

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the amount later the Peking and I'm

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.570 
the amount later the Peking and I'm
using<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.140> pique<00:03:25.530> if<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.400> amount

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
using the pique if you like the amount

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.550 
using the pique if you like the amount
because<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.180> liked<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.480> little<00:03:27.600> bit<00:03:27.720> faster

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
because you liked a little bit faster

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.990 
because you liked a little bit faster
rate<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.709> fire<00:03:28.830> I'm<00:03:29.100> not<00:03:29.250> gonna<00:03:29.340> really<00:03:29.610> fault

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
rate of fire I'm not gonna really fault

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.910 
rate of fire I'm not gonna really fault
you<00:03:30.120> with<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.049> like<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.320> pique<00:03:31.680> was

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you with that but I like the pique was

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.350 
you with that but I like the pique was
that<00:03:32.070> likes<00:03:32.250> once<00:03:32.459> it's<00:03:32.610> fully<00:03:32.760> modified<00:03:33.090> you

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
that likes once it's fully modified you

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.470 
that likes once it's fully modified you
got<00:03:33.450> 150<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.410> clip<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.799> got<00:03:34.920> 454<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.360> know

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
got 150 in a clip you got 454 you know

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.140 
got 150 in a clip you got 454 you know
your<00:03:36.840> your<00:03:37.440> main<00:03:37.650> weapons<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.430> can<00:03:38.580> really<00:03:38.940> do

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
your your main weapons you can really do

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.030 
your your main weapons you can really do
some<00:03:39.420> great<00:03:39.630> suppressive<00:03:40.170> fire<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.560> has<00:03:40.739> it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
some great suppressive fire and has it

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.970 
some great suppressive fire and has it
has<00:03:41.280> more<00:03:41.670> punching<00:03:42.630> power<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.799> think

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
has more punching power to it so I think

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.880 
has more punching power to it so I think
that<00:03:44.280> thing<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.640> good<00:03:45.150> too<00:03:45.390> but<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.530> know<00:03:46.650> if

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
that thing is good too but you know if

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.810 
that thing is good too but you know if
you<00:03:47.070> using<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.209> pique<00:03:48.600> if<00:03:48.780> using<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.230> good

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
you using the the pique if using a good

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.550 
you using the the pique if using a good
machine<00:03:50.820> gun<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.360> your<00:03:51.630> short<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.230> medium

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
machine gun as your short to medium

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.900 
machine gun as your short to medium
range<00:03:52.709> dishes<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.340> want<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.579> get<00:03:53.730> that

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
range dishes and you want to get that

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.759 
range dishes and you want to get that
really<00:03:54.390> extra<00:03:54.840> long<00:03:55.049> distance<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.620> go

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
really extra long distance and you go

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.610 
really extra long distance and you go
with<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.950> good<00:03:56.100> sniper<00:03:56.250> rifle<00:03:56.610> that's<00:03:56.730> fine<00:03:57.030> too

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
with a good sniper rifle that's fine too

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.640 
with a good sniper rifle that's fine too
particularly<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.829> you<00:04:00.079> modify<00:04:01.079> them<00:04:01.290> get<00:04:01.500> one

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
particularly as you modify them get one

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.770 
particularly as you modify them get one
more<00:04:01.860> advanced<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.489> MK<00:04:02.820> I've<00:04:02.940> got<00:04:03.120> right

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
more advanced like the MK I've got right

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.410 
more advanced like the MK I've got right
now<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.019> think<00:04:04.440> it's<00:04:04.650> level<00:04:04.920> four<00:04:05.549> maybe<00:04:06.120> five

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
now I think it's level four maybe five

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.699 
now I think it's level four maybe five
you<00:04:06.540> think<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:06.810> level<00:04:07.019> four<00:04:07.230> I've<00:04:07.350> got<00:04:07.500> we'll

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
you think it's level four I've got we'll

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.770 
you think it's level four I've got we'll
see<00:04:07.860> here<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.130> second<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.420> know<00:04:09.510> got

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
see here in a second and you know got

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.110 
see here in a second and you know got
the<00:04:09.900> silencer<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.280> got<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.549> scope<00:04:11.820> on

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the silencer on and you got the scope on

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.940 
the silencer on and you got the scope on
it<00:04:12.269> you've<00:04:12.450> got<00:04:12.630> like<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.110> know<00:04:13.230> 20<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.860> the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
it you've got like you know 20 in the

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.789 
it you've got like you know 20 in the
clip<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.549> then<00:04:14.670> so<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.049> think<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.650> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
clip and then so that I think is the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.409 
clip and then so that I think is the
best<00:04:16.979> way<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.220> go<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.760> found<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
best way to go I found that the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.000 
best way to go I found that the
submachine<00:04:21.419> guns<00:04:21.660> just<00:04:21.989> didn't<00:04:22.290> have<00:04:22.440> the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
submachine guns just didn't have the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.460 
submachine guns just didn't have the
range<00:04:23.550> or<00:04:23.940> punching<00:04:24.300> power<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.870> wanted

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
range or punching power that I wanted

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.800 
range or punching power that I wanted
shaaka<00:04:26.700> they<00:04:26.849> had<00:04:26.970> me<00:04:27.090> mess<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:27.479> them<00:04:27.630> yet

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
shaaka they had me mess with them yet

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.100 
shaaka they had me mess with them yet
but<00:04:27.930> I

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
but I

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.719 
but I
know<00:04:28.229> what<00:04:28.439> that<00:04:28.469> is<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:29.099> know<00:04:29.219> a<00:04:29.250> lot<00:04:29.610> of

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
know what that is you know a lot of

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.670 
know what that is you know a lot of
power<00:04:29.909> very<00:04:30.090> close<00:04:30.629> distance<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.349> it's<00:04:31.530> like

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
power very close distance and it's like

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.950 
power very close distance and it's like
I<00:04:31.889> need<00:04:32.219> something<00:04:32.520> for<00:04:32.729> long<00:04:32.909> range<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.689> you

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
I need something for long range so you

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.839 
I need something for long range so you
know<00:04:34.229> I<00:04:34.259> have<00:04:34.560> found<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.129> this<00:04:35.310> is<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.520> best

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
know I have found that this is the best

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.209 
know I have found that this is the best
setup<00:04:36.379> we're<00:04:37.379> going<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.560> show<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.770> what<00:04:38.189> I

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
setup we're going to show you what I

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.790 
setup we're going to show you what I
mean<00:04:38.400> by<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.909> why<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.180> think<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.800> right

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
mean by that and why I think that right

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800 
mean by that and why I think that right
now<00:04:40.979> let's<00:04:41.370> check<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.669> out<00:04:41.759> as<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.330> can<00:04:42.360> see

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
now let's check it out as you can see

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.040 
now let's check it out as you can see
you<00:04:43.379> have<00:04:43.409> two<00:04:43.919> choices<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.610> weapons<00:04:45.240> as<00:04:45.449> what

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
you have two choices of weapons as what

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.990 
you have two choices of weapons as what
your<00:04:46.229> loadout<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.189> same<00:04:47.400> thing<00:04:47.699> with<00:04:47.849> your

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
your loadout is the same thing with your

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.559 
your loadout is the same thing with your
gear

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
gear

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.929 
gear
I<00:04:48.599> really<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.319> FAL<00:04:49.919> and<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.580> can<00:04:50.759> see

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:50.939 
I really like the FAL and you can see

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.029 
I really like the FAL and you can see
why<00:04:51.090> not<00:04:51.300> it's<00:04:51.539> fully<00:04:51.780> modified<00:04:52.199> but<00:04:52.830> your

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
why not it's fully modified but your

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.040 
why not it's fully modified but your
accuracy<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.699> very<00:04:53.789> high<00:04:54.090> your<00:04:54.479> range<00:04:54.719> is<00:04:54.870> very

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
accuracy is very high your range is very

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.379 
accuracy is very high your range is very
high<00:04:55.289> your<00:04:55.500> damage<00:04:55.949> is<00:04:56.280> about<00:04:56.729> medium<00:04:57.000> then

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
high your damage is about medium then

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.659 
high your damage is about medium then
put<00:04:57.810> your<00:04:57.900> capacity<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.620> rating<00:04:58.919> are<00:04:59.129> pretty

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
put your capacity and rating are pretty

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.050 
put your capacity and rating are pretty

to start off with a fail let's test the

century<00:05:18.000> here<00:05:19.939> it<00:05:20.939> can<00:05:21.240> so<00:05:22.110> you've<00:05:22.259> got<00:05:22.500> the
