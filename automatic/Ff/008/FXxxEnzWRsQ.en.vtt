 today this paradise on earth is created 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.390
 landscape designers at first it seems

 stages 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.449
 however before construction 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.760
 the designer always communicates with the customer 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 human character is important 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 family composition addictions and interests all 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.229

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.940
 after approval of the plan begin 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.099
 construction work much attention 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.200
 given to the soil that should not

 and creator and it's hard to say that 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.540
 the main result prevails 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.940
 going back to the words I don't want to go to that paradise
