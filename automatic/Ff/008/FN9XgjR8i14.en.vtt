00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.840
 Hello I'm not just pole I run three car dealerships and there 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.609
 Do not mess with logos 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.379
 and the noon meal enthusiasm Pfaff and I like to show them now 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.019
 In the morning I was first wait for which employee 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.019
 only large order with that operated for all kilns 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.050
 also the farmers should see in their work 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.560
 his sermons are in-house news that runs like Lena 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.490
 in the 15th 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.730
 that too i can criteria should approach are right 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.810
 many lamps decades increased considerably 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.760
 In the diary I can only briefly see what my sellers are doing 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.220
 so that no one is bored anymore 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.220
 so now the boss makes her wounds 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.130
 we do not want to keep our customers waiting so the workshop will be there 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.860
 Huntelaar by name many staff table fluttered guest with it the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.890
 Dates financier distributed to most entertainers 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 so we offer fast service 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.150
 especially useful because it does not want to bite at interfaces 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.750
 They help quickly and safely comeback the countertop and spare parts in 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.260
 Orders bills or spare parts to take orders 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.560
 then for all makes farmers their customers on the interface five 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.270
 The digital catalog 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.690
 very important the correct data is always directly accessible 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 And how can you just take your login details 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.789
 then just briefly implemented the Miss Craft Scott's metrics 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.789
 no one is the "no incident" now saving time and money 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.680
 In the workshop, I really do not want to be spared 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 because I am constantly changing my times 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.210
 but of course I'm looking forward to my escape 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 One, of course, is enormously important 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.280
 I see, for example, asthma remedies could be so on the man and the woman 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.769
 brought 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.719
 Only good that the pilot does not often interpret the internal calculations 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.999
 June, then he does not make more than 4 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.579
 Anyone can afford I can no longer beat my farm size 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.209
 but on top of that you change the color eye on it 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:30.269
 The GDR, on the other hand, quickly showed the results of the individual departments 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.869
 which change directly 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 can react and argue better in case of operational changes 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.629
 before and after running 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:40.609
 and keep on burning 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.689
 With Le Concert I can organize my businesses really well 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:45.739
 at a fair price
