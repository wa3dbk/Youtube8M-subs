00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.920 
whatever reason the nunchuck controller
just<00:01:42.850> doesn't<00:01:43.119> seem<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.330> work<00:01:43.450> too<00:01:43.689> well<00:01:43.810> for

detected<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:48.520> it's<00:01:48.729> really<00:01:49.060> frustrating

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
detected and it's really frustrating

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.520

he just keeps smacking around because of
it<00:01:52.090> hopefully<00:01:52.689> this<00:01:52.990> is<00:01:53.110> something<00:01:53.140> they're

as<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.259> whole<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.649> game<00:02:02.799> feels<00:02:03.100> really<00:02:03.399> good

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
as a whole the game feels really good

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.370 
as a whole the game feels really good
but<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.939> doesn't<00:02:04.149> exactly<00:02:04.329> look<00:02:04.780> right<00:02:05.020> it's

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
but it doesn't exactly look right it's

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.410 
but it doesn't exactly look right it's
basically<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:05.770> mix<00:02:06.009> between<00:02:06.130> Xbox<00:02:06.790> version<00:02:07.180> and

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
basically a mix between Xbox version and
