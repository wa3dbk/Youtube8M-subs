00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
party or something that can click on the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.950 
party or something that can click on the
people<00:04:59.580> that<00:04:59.760> they<00:04:59.910> want<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.300> run<00:05:00.510> on<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.930> spot

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
people that they want to run on the spot

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.770 
people that they want to run on the spot
see<00:05:01.949> what<00:05:02.070> I'm<00:05:02.130> saying<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.639> mean<00:05:03.419> I<00:05:03.449> don't<00:05:03.720> have

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
see what I'm saying I mean I don't have

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.330 
see what I'm saying I mean I don't have
the<00:05:03.990> answer<00:05:04.289> but<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:04.470> think<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:04.860> think<00:05:05.130> if<00:05:05.220> they

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
the answer but I think I think if they

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.339 
the answer but I think I think if they
had<00:05:05.490> something<00:05:05.940> like<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.300> we<00:05:06.840> could<00:05:06.990> qjb

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
had something like that we could qjb

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.870

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
with the big block I think if they had

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.279 
with the big block I think if they had
something<00:05:09.240> like<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.690> parks<00:05:09.990> would<00:05:10.139> be

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
something like that the parks would be

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.999 
something like that the parks would be
way<00:05:10.500> more<00:05:11.900> it'll<00:05:12.900> be<00:05:12.990> it'll<00:05:13.229> be<00:05:13.349> a<00:05:13.470> better

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
way more it'll be it'll be a better
