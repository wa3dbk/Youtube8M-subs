is<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> secondary<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.009> I've<00:01:17.430> been<00:01:17.640> using<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> as

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
is a secondary and I've been using it as

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.340 
is a secondary and I've been using it as
a<00:01:18.060> primary<00:01:18.450> weapon<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.810> try<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.140> gaunt

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
a primary weapon to try and get gaunt

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
a primary weapon to try and get gaunt
camouflage<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> sniper<00:01:20.549> for

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
camouflage but if you're a sniper for

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.219 
camouflage but if you're a sniper for
example<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> building

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
example and you're in a building

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
example and you're in a building
protecting<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> zone<00:01:23.100> area<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
protecting the zone area and you want to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.580 
protecting the zone area and you want to
use<00:01:24.479> these<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> viable<00:01:25.350> weapon

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
use these it's actually a viable weapon

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.170 
use these it's actually a viable weapon
so<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.030> would

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
so if you are going to use this I would

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.210 
so if you are going to use this I would
actually<00:01:27.509> suggest<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> use<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.920> fast

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
actually suggest that you use the fast

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.080 
actually suggest that you use the fast
mags<00:01:29.430> attachment

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
mags attachment

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.910 
mags attachment
basically<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> does<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.439> speeds<00:01:31.710> up

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
basically what that does is it speeds up

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
basically what that does is it speeds up
the<00:01:31.979> reload<00:01:32.520> because<00:01:33.150> without<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> fast<00:01:33.840> mags

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the reload because without the fast mags

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
the reload because without the fast mags
what<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.299> you

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
what you have to do is you have to you

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:36.950 
what you have to do is you have to you
know<00:01:36.390> manually

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
know manually

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410 
know manually
inputs<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.590> six<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.670> rounds<00:01:39.030> or<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
inputs all six of the the rounds or the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.700 
inputs all six of the the rounds or the
little<00:01:39.600> pellets<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.110> into<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> weapon

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
little pellets that go into the weapon

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170 
little pellets that go into the weapon
and<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> fast<00:01:41.460> mag<00:01:41.610> he<00:01:41.729> does<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> all<00:01:42.060> at

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and with the fast mag he does it all at

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
and with the fast mag he does it all at
once<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.720> makes<00:01:42.840> everything<00:01:42.990> as

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
once and it just makes everything as

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
once and it just makes everything as
quick<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.189> possible<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> akimbo<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.000> also<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
quick as possible the akimbo is also a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.850 
quick as possible the akimbo is also a
viable<00:01:45.780> option<00:01:46.020> because<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.470> speeds<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
viable option because it speeds up the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.710 
viable option because it speeds up the
reload<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.820> makes<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> even<00:01:48.299> more<00:01:48.420> deadly

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
reload and it makes it even more deadly

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.380 
reload and it makes it even more deadly
close<00:01:49.020> range<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.560> weapon<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.610> was<00:01:51.180> very

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
close range but this weapon it was very

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.580 
close range but this weapon it was very
challenging<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.049> gold<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> would

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
challenging to get gold so I would

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.870 
challenging to get gold so I would
appreciate<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> guys<00:01:53.520> could<00:01:53.579> leave<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
appreciate it if you guys could leave a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090 
appreciate it if you guys could leave a
like<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> possibly<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.259> favorite<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.950> be

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
like and possibly a favorite I will be

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.219 
like and possibly a favorite I will be
using<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> golden<00:01:57.060> tac-45<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.990> tomorrow's
