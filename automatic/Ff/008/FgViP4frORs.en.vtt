so<00:00:00.269> how<00:00:00.329> do<00:00:00.420> you<00:00:00.539> find<00:00:00.810> ruler<00:00:01.170> fractions<00:00:01.860> hi

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so how do you find ruler fractions hi

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.889 
so how do you find ruler fractions hi
I'm<00:00:02.669> Jimmy<00:00:03.149> Chang<00:00:03.179> I've<00:00:03.570> been<00:00:03.750> teaching

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
I'm Jimmy Chang I've been teaching

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.320 
I'm Jimmy Chang I've been teaching
college<00:00:04.259> math<00:00:04.410> for<00:00:04.859> over<00:00:05.250> nine<00:00:05.640> years<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
college math for over nine years and

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.290 
college math for over nine years and
we're<00:00:07.259> here<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.740> discuss<00:00:08.160> how<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.460> can<00:00:08.639> use

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
we're here to discuss how you can use

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.290 
we're here to discuss how you can use
rulers<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.380> write<00:00:10.860> fractions<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:12.210> all

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
rulers to write fractions and it all

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.400 
rulers to write fractions and it all
depends<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.660> kind<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.929> ruler<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.170> you

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
depends on the kind of ruler that you

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.770 
depends on the kind of ruler that you
have<00:00:13.590> but<00:00:13.950> once<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.460> know<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.540> kind<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
have but once you know what kind of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.390 
have but once you know what kind of
units<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.170> want<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.619> make<00:00:16.740> sure<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
units you want just make sure that the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.730 
units you want just make sure that the
ruler<00:00:17.699> has<00:00:17.880> enough<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.080> call<00:00:19.230> marks<00:00:19.619> or

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
ruler has enough what we call marks or

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.279 
ruler has enough what we call marks or
ticks<00:00:20.070> on<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.939> ruler<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.750> go

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
ticks on the ruler so that you can go

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.470 
ticks on the ruler so that you can go
for<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.460> fractions<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.060> you're<00:00:24.240> looking

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
for the fractions that you're looking

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.170 
for the fractions that you're looking
for<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:25.199> depending<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> ruler<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:27.150> can

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
for now depending on the ruler you can

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.900 
for now depending on the ruler you can
work<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:27.660> halves<00:00:27.960> quarters<00:00:28.859> eight<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
work with halves quarters eight and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.600 
work with halves quarters eight and
sixteen<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> purposes<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
sixteen so for the purposes of this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
sixteen so for the purposes of this
demonstration<00:00:32.850> we'll<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.450> looking<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.809> rulers

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
demonstration we'll be looking at rulers

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.220 
demonstration we'll be looking at rulers
with<00:00:34.469> 16<00:00:35.250> tix<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:36.210> let's<00:00:36.510> take<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> look<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:36.989> for

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
with 16 tix now let's take a look at for

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950 
with 16 tix now let's take a look at for
example<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.950> area<00:00:38.340> between<00:00:38.520> four<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.329> five

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
example the area between four and five

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.920 
example the area between four and five
if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.680> count<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.520> area<00:00:42.090> between<00:00:42.390> four<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
if you count the area between four and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.380 
if you count the area between four and
five<00:00:43.260> you'll<00:00:43.559> discover<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.070> there's<00:00:44.390> 16

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
five you'll discover that there's 16

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.440 
five you'll discover that there's 16
ticks<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.680> means<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.129> each<00:00:47.340> tick<00:00:47.760> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
ticks so that means for each tick it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
ticks so that means for each tick it
represents<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> sixteenth<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:50.010> increase<00:00:50.340> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
represents a sixteenth of an increase so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.160 
represents a sixteenth of an increase so
for<00:00:51.090> example<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> take<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.020> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
for example if you take a look at this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.160 
for example if you take a look at this
very<00:00:52.469> first<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.940> represents<00:00:54.170> four

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
very first one here that represents four

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
very first one here that represents four
and<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:56.160> sixteenth<00:00:59.629> two<00:01:00.629> tix<00:01:01.879> for<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.120> 216

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and one sixteenth two tix for and 216

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.740 
and one sixteenth two tix for and 216
but<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.920> use<00:01:05.250> these<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.000> opportunities

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but you can use these as opportunities

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
but you can use these as opportunities
to<00:01:07.140> teach<00:01:07.380> students<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> reduce<00:01:08.250> fractions

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
to teach students to reduce fractions

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.300 
to teach students to reduce fractions
because<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.930> 216<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.159> can

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
because as you know with 216 you can

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
because as you know with 216 you can
reduce<00:01:11.520> both<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:11.939> by<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.049> will

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
reduce both of these by two so this will

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
reduce both of these by two so this will
be<00:01:13.290> four<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.920> one-eighth<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:16.880> three<00:01:17.880> tix

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
be four and one-eighth now three tix

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.990 
be four and one-eighth now three tix
will<00:01:18.360> give<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.570> 4<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.930> 3<00:01:19.080> 16<00:01:19.549> for<00:01:20.549> tix<00:01:20.850> will

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
will give you 4 and 3 16 for tix will

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.359 
will give you 4 and 3 16 for tix will
give<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> 4<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.869> 4<00:01:22.200> 16<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
give you 4 and 4 16 but as you know you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
give you 4 and 4 16 but as you know you
can<00:01:26.520> teach<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> students<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.560> 4<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> 16

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
can teach the students that 4 and 16

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.200 
can teach the students that 4 and 16
reduces<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> 4<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.960> fourth<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.759> then<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
reduces to 4 and one fourth and then you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
reduces to 4 and one fourth and then you
could<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.750> any<00:01:33.960> number<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.409> ticks<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
could do it for any number of ticks that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.069 
could do it for any number of ticks that
you<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.130> between<00:01:35.490> whole<00:01:35.759> numbers<00:01:36.119> even<00:01:36.720> at

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
you want between whole numbers even at

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
you want between whole numbers even at
the<00:01:37.170> halfway<00:01:37.380> mark<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> halfway<00:01:38.520> mark<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the halfway mark at the halfway mark you

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.240 
the halfway mark at the halfway mark you
know<00:01:39.270> there's<00:01:39.540> eight<00:01:39.810> tix<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.619> between<00:01:41.009> four

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
know there's eight tix in between four

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.690 
know there's eight tix in between four
and<00:01:41.280> five<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.180> before<00:01:42.360> an<00:01:42.780> 816<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.460> can

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and five so before an 816 which you can

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.719 
and five so before an 816 which you can
reduce<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.329> four<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> one-half<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:47.189> both

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
reduce to four and one-half because both

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.440 
reduce to four and one-half because both
sides<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.299> reducible<00:01:48.750> by<00:01:49.110> eight<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.210> can

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
sides are reducible by eight but you can

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.660 
sides are reducible by eight but you can
use<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> ruler<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.530> any<00:01:52.860> point<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> use<00:01:53.460> any

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
use a ruler at any point and use any

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.770 
use a ruler at any point and use any
number<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:53.970> ticks<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.270> you're<00:01:54.479> looking<00:01:54.600> for

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
number of ticks that you're looking for

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.950 
number of ticks that you're looking for
and<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.680> convert<00:01:56.369> into<00:01:57.090> any<00:01:57.270> fraction<00:01:57.750> or

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and you can convert into any fraction or
