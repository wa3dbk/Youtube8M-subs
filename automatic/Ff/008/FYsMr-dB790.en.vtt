we're going to be using a GTX um as you

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.880 
we're going to be using a GTX um as you
can<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.080> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
can see is

pretty soon and next we have the
Challenger<00:01:56.250> from<00:01:56.280> roseville<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:58.940> this<00:01:59.940> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Challenger from roseville and this is

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.600 
Challenger from roseville and this is
decent<00:02:00.570> case<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> gonna<00:02:02.100> cost<00:02:02.310> too<00:02:02.550> much

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
decent case was it gonna cost too much

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.390 
decent case was it gonna cost too much
that's<00:02:03.450> black<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:03.960> black<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> back<00:02:05.159> I

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
that's black and black in the back I

mean backing on front back in the inside

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.280 
mean backing on front back in the inside
and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.599 
and
it's<00:02:11.829> over<00:02:12.159> a<00:02:12.189> pretty<00:02:12.730> good<00:02:12.909> case<00:02:13.780> for

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:14.609 
it's over a pretty good case for

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.140 
it's over a pretty good case for
computer<00:02:15.609> parts<00:02:15.969> and<00:02:17.430> I'll<00:02:18.430> be<00:02:18.579> having<00:02:18.700> many

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
computer parts and I'll be having many

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.170 
computer parts and I'll be having many
more<00:02:19.420> upgrades<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.049> this<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:21.430> not<00:02:21.760> really

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
more upgrades for this it's not really

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.420 
more upgrades for this it's not really
complete<00:02:22.750> right<00:02:22.989> now<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.379> I<00:02:23.620> decided<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
complete right now but I decided to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.339 
complete right now but I decided to
build<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.329> it<00:02:25.480> won't<00:02:25.659> be<00:02:25.750> collecting<00:02:25.900> more

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
build it so it won't be collecting more

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.680 
build it so it won't be collecting more
does

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.290 

so<00:02:29.260> I'll<00:02:29.710> be<00:02:29.890> having<00:02:30.040> many<00:02:30.400> more<00:02:30.700> updates<00:02:31.120> on

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
so I'll be having many more updates on

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.400 
so I'll be having many more updates on
this<00:02:32.310> alright<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.580> we're<00:02:33.730> done<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:34.410> then

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this alright so we're done here then

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:44.840 
this alright so we're done here then
result<00:02:37.140> there's<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.440> i5<00:02:41.550> then<00:02:42.550> gets<00:02:42.790> rammed

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
result there's the i5 then gets rammed

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.260 
result there's the i5 then gets rammed
the<00:02:45.850> gtx<00:02:46.360> 260<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.880> soon-to-be<00:02:49.200> 7970<00:02:51.270> i'll

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
the gtx 260 and soon-to-be 7970 i'll

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.810 
the gtx 260 and soon-to-be 7970 i'll
update<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:53.040> update<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.220> when<00:02:54.340> i<00:02:54.460> get<00:02:54.520> that
