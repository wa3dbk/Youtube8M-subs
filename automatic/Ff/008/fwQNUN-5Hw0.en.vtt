00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the second one this is um I guess a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
the second one this is um I guess a
little<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.579> more<00:00:56.789> dressy<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.510> could<00:00:57.719> say<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
little bit more dressy you could say I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.010 
little bit more dressy you could say I
mean<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.100> either<00:00:59.129> way<00:00:59.460> really<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
mean it can go either way really but you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779
