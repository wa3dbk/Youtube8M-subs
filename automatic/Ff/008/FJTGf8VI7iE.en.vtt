00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
right directly into the scalp now if

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.530 
right directly into the scalp now if
you're<00:02:49.370> not<00:02:49.519> getting<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.940> lather<00:02:50.150> and

you're not getting a lather and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.270 
you're not getting a lather and
sometimes<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.170> happens<00:02:51.560> with<00:02:51.739> one<00:02:52.010> or<00:02:52.250> two

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280

times a week washer time a week washers
it<00:02:55.970> just<00:02:56.329> means<00:02:56.629> you<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.079> bit<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.379> a

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
it just means you have a bit of a

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.099 
it just means you have a bit of a
buildup<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.579> remedy<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.660> not<00:02:59.870> to

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
buildup so the remedy to this is not to

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.280 
buildup so the remedy to this is not to
put<00:03:00.349> more<00:03:00.650> product<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.430> it's<00:03:02.090> actually<00:03:02.780> to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
put more product on it's actually to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.819 
put more product on it's actually to
rinse<00:03:03.680> out<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.340> apply<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.269> second<00:03:05.930> shampoo<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
rinse out and apply a second shampoo the

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.400 
rinse out and apply a second shampoo the
same<00:03:07.129> way<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.569> little<00:03:08.599> bit<00:03:08.900> larger<00:03:09.200> than<00:03:09.230> a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
same way just a little bit larger than a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.860 
same way just a little bit larger than a
quarter<00:03:09.709> size<00:03:09.859> block<00:03:10.220> apply<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:10.970> second<00:03:11.629> time

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
quarter size block apply it second time

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.800 
quarter size block apply it second time
to<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.200> scalp<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.919> then<00:03:13.370> rinse<00:03:13.669> through<00:03:14.180> you

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
to the scalp and then rinse through you

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.990 
to the scalp and then rinse through you
will<00:03:14.989> find<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.620> second<00:03:16.069> wash<00:03:16.310> has<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.669> lot<00:03:16.970> of

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
will find the second wash has a lot of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.259 
will find the second wash has a lot of
lather<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:18.440> my<00:03:18.620> little<00:03:18.799> mantra<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.519> first<00:03:20.090> and

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
lather so my little mantra is first and

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.270 
lather so my little mantra is first and
removes<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.720> dirt<00:03:20.989> second<00:03:21.769> one<00:03:21.889> does<00:03:22.069> the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
removes the dirt second one does the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.400 
removes the dirt second one does the
work<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:22.790> there's<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.269> buildup<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.260> need

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
work if there's a buildup you just need

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.229 
work if there's a buildup you just need
that<00:03:24.440> first<00:03:24.859> wash<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.370> break<00:03:25.609> through<00:03:25.880> and

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
that first wash to break through and

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.030 
that first wash to break through and
then<00:03:26.690> your<00:03:26.840> second<00:03:27.260> wash<00:03:27.410> will<00:03:27.650> do<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.889> work

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
then your second wash will do the work

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.860 
then your second wash will do the work
whether<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.430> be<00:03:28.519> shine<00:03:28.790> or<00:03:29.060> volume<00:03:29.450> and
