00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.929
 banal we chose to make you a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.580
 little video in a nightclub 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.170
 because we thought that the atmosphere 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.880
 musical like that where we do not hear this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.320
 look at the dj we do not have it 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.300
 any DJ is the most 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.970
 fast of the world is usain bolt who is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.449
 the truth usain bolt has made an agreement 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 brand with his banter young 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.500
 one day we are caught up with the muse 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.280
 nightclub but we are in paris 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520
 devices runs fast but it's good already 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.930
 so it's not bad this nomad since 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 just now we want to dance good 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.079
 the advantage also is that we have when 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.920
 even some cameras to you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.920

 we start with that one french yes 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.520
 so that's the galaxy actually it's a 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.810
 os May 4 which zoome is so in fact you 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.210
 you end up with a real phone 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.420
 but the peculiarity is that he has to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.820
 a real a small compact degree with a 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 zoom ten times but it's a phone 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.369
 ie you can spend your 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.409

 latest version of android 4.261 qu'alex 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.970
 is fourth with 1 a small particular the 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.399
 progressed 4 min then after us 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.520
 have in store is not it the nx 2000 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.649
 how is it a hybrid that is to say 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.020
 having removed the camera the lens 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.000
 of course we go upmarket in terms of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.280
 sensors etc and he is connected 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.840
 also is not under android it is 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.679
 not under android under Linux it's for 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.890
 that they start even more 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.740
 quickly yes but that's it and if we go up 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 still the lx3 thousand the x300 forgiveness he 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.429
 must not be wrong there this one 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.630
 sensor a little more powerful one is not 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.759
 still not under android 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.200
 there is a quick than previous and it is 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.209
 faster and it started on him 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.569
 has the the fastest camera 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.039
 of the world 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.750
 that's it and so it's here by fashionistas 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.060
 usain bolt look at it when they do 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.730
 these pictures is with this camera with 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.010
 a look a little retro like that with 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.620
 a leather invitation cover etc 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.090
 he said he never separated from his 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.920
 camera what is life 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.030
 i think samsung saw him give him a 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.099
 little check anyway also why 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 who is supposed to marc moreau no no it's 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.860
 good and so that's the top of the top 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.690
 so that's the best of the best it's a 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.150
 big beast is also a 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.970
 hybrid one can remove the goal is 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.040

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.129
