because<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.940> level<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.420> enormous<00:00:52.079> because

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because the level is enormous because

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.869 
because the level is enormous because
it's<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.070> believe<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.520> not<00:00:53.670> there

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.020 
necessarily on the mountain some of them
are<00:02:38.720> these<00:02:39.650> platforms<00:02:39.950> over<00:02:40.310> here<00:02:40.670> there's<00:02:40.940> a

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
are these platforms over here there's a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.300 
are these platforms over here there's a
cage<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.989> whenever<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.100> see<00:02:43.280> something

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
cage that whenever you see something

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.370 
cage that whenever you see something
caged<00:02:43.820> up<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.390> look<00:02:44.660> for<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.900> locket

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
caged up like that look for a locket

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.470 
caged up like that look for a locket
step<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.950> green<00:02:46.160> switch<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:47.090> will<00:02:47.239> fire

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
step on the green switch it will fire

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.180 
step on the green switch it will fire
off<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.930> break<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.350> cage<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.430> over<00:02:49.730> me

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
off and break the cage right over me

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.890 
off and break the cage right over me
balloons<00:02:52.190> hope<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.270> get<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> little<00:02:53.660> bit<00:02:53.870> of

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
balloons hope you get a little bit of

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.510 
balloons hope you get a little bit of
height<00:02:54.110> they<00:02:54.320> usually<00:02:54.739> give<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.920> wings<00:02:55.250> or

height they usually give you wings or

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.630 
height they usually give you wings or
something<00:02:56.920> place<00:02:57.920> where<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.220> can<00:02:58.370> hear<00:02:58.489> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
something place where you can hear the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.040 
something place where you can hear the
one<00:02:58.820> that's<00:02:59.000> got<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.450> be<00:02:59.540> where<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> ghost

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
one that's got to be where the ghost

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.440 
one that's got to be where the ghost
train<00:03:00.320> is<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.700> ghost<00:03:01.880> train<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.390> a

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
train is but the ghost train is it a

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.030 
train is but the ghost train is it a
bunch<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.810> different<00:03:03.170> points<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.770> place

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
bunch of different points in this place

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.000 
bunch of different points in this place
I<00:03:04.310> mean<00:03:05.150> if<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.390> want<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.780> switch<00:03:06.440> where<00:03:06.860> the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
I mean if you want to switch where the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.710 
I mean if you want to switch where the
train<00:03:07.280> goes<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:08.060> go<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.270> go<00:03:08.450> straight

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
train goes you go to go straight

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.910 
train goes you go to go straight
Mountain<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.140> saw<00:03:09.350> there<00:03:09.500> was<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.620> little

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
Mountain you saw there was a little

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.000 
Mountain you saw there was a little
switch<00:03:10.160> over<00:03:10.520> there<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.870> changes<00:03:12.440> where<00:03:12.830> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
switch over there that changes where the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.150 
switch over there that changes where the
train<00:03:13.310> actually<00:03:13.820> goes<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:15.620> really<00:03:15.860> hard

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
train actually goes but it's really hard

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.699 
train actually goes but it's really hard
to<00:03:16.310> remember<00:03:16.870> which<00:03:17.870> switch<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.350> need<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.590> hit

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
to remember which switch you need to hit

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.229 
to remember which switch you need to hit
to<00:03:18.860> make<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.130> move<00:03:19.250> where<00:03:19.459> yeah<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.700> figured<00:03:20.120> it

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
to make it move where yeah I figured it

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.490 
to make it move where yeah I figured it
was<00:03:20.330> church<00:03:20.570> mountain<00:03:20.870> because<00:03:21.020> my<00:03:21.140> radar

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
was church mountain because my radar

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.020 
was church mountain because my radar
wasn't<00:03:21.800> going<00:03:22.130> off<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.430> your<00:03:22.459> ghost<00:03:22.760> train

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
wasn't going off in your ghost train

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.860 
wasn't going off in your ghost train
mountain<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:24.520> think<00:03:25.520> the<00:03:25.700> train<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.150> up<00:03:26.360> here

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
mountain I think the train is up here

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.410 
mountain I think the train is up here
there's<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.800> little<00:03:27.950> section<00:03:28.430> at<00:03:28.550> fracks<00:03:28.970> with

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
there's a little section at fracks with

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.350 
there's a little section at fracks with
the<00:03:29.600> wait<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.590> even<00:03:30.800> church<00:03:31.130> mountain<00:03:31.489> no

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
the wait is this even church mountain no

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.199 
the wait is this even church mountain no
this<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:32.720> pumpkin<00:03:33.140> mountain<00:03:33.790> there's<00:03:34.790> church

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
this is pumpkin mountain there's church

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.210 
this is pumpkin mountain there's church
mountain<00:03:35.540> all<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> way<00:03:35.870> over<00:03:36.110> there<00:03:36.140> see<00:03:37.070> what

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
mountain all the way over there see what

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.950 
mountain all the way over there see what
I<00:03:37.280> mean<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.610> place<00:03:37.850> is<00:03:37.880> mostly<00:03:38.330> open<00:03:38.540> space

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
I mean this place is mostly open space

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.180 
I mean this place is mostly open space
so<00:03:41.960> it's<00:03:42.080> got<00:03:42.230> to<00:03:42.260> be<00:03:42.440> near<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.740> ghost<00:03:42.950> train

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
so it's got to be near the ghost train

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.070 
so it's got to be near the ghost train
summer<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.820> track<00:03:44.090> sit<00:03:44.300> right<00:03:44.480> down<00:03:44.510> there<00:03:44.780> I

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
summer the track sit right down there I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.340 
summer the track sit right down there I
have<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.350> feelings<00:03:45.800> buried<00:03:46.070> underground<00:03:47.350> right
