wrong with it it just keeps turning and
turning<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.380> wasn't<00:00:22.590> tight<00:00:22.859> when<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.130> took

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
turning and I wasn't tight when I took

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.849 
turning and I wasn't tight when I took
it<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:29.990> it's<00:00:30.990> totally<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.619> stiff

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859

it out and it's totally kind of stiff
coming<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:33.300> might<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.540> normal

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.430 

I<00:00:52.170> can't<00:00:52.920> tell<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.370> stripped<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.820> not

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.000 

but<00:01:01.950> it<00:01:02.040> kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.310> kind<00:01:02.490> of<00:01:02.520> irritates<00:01:02.940> me<00:01:03.150> that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
but it kind of kind of irritates me that

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.650 
but it kind of kind of irritates me that
it<00:01:05.010> won't<00:01:05.160> tighten<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.910> it<00:01:06.510> worked

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
it won't tighten up and it worked

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.180 
it won't tighten up and it worked
perfectly<00:01:07.020> fine<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.560> took<00:01:07.620> it<00:01:07.860> down<00:01:07.950> there

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
perfectly fine when I took it down there

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.240 
perfectly fine when I took it down there
to<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> engine<00:01:09.510> rebuilt<00:01:12.800> and<00:01:13.800> I<00:01:13.890> may<00:01:14.070> end

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to have the engine rebuilt and I may end

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.560 
to have the engine rebuilt and I may end
up<00:01:14.340> putting<00:01:14.550> another<00:01:14.820> washer<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
don't know what I may in a wrap that was

electric tape but an oil pan is $200 for

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.200 
electric tape but an oil pan is $200 for
the<00:01:21.750> shitty<00:01:22.140> garage<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:23.970> take

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the shitty garage and it's going to take

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.110 
the shitty garage and it's going to take
probably<00:01:24.560> three<00:01:25.560> hundred<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.910> four<00:01:27.060> hundred

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
probably three hundred to four hundred

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.650 
probably three hundred to four hundred
dollars<00:01:27.600> labor<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:28.050> replace<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.479> is

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
dollars labor to replace it and this is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.180 
dollars labor to replace it and this is
the<00:01:33.690> kind<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.110> shoddy<00:01:34.290> work<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.800> comes<00:01:35.010> out

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
the kind of shoddy work that comes out

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.219 
the kind of shoddy work that comes out
of<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> lot<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.610> garages<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.750> don't<00:01:36.990> want<00:01:37.170> to

of a lot of garages and I don't want to
put<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.500> oversized<00:01:37.890> plug<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.369> here<00:01:38.810> because

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
put an oversized plug in here because

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:53.930

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
threads that are completely gone and I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.029 
threads that are completely gone and I
don't<00:02:06.539> know<00:02:06.690> how<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.140> it'll<00:02:07.380> show<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:07.770> or<00:02:07.920> not

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.020 

you'll<00:02:15.210> see<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> bad<00:02:15.630> spot<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.080> threads<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.030> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
you'll see a bad spot the threads and a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.220 
you'll see a bad spot the threads and a
little<00:02:18.240> washer<00:02:18.600> here<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:20.480> took<00:02:21.480> off<00:02:21.690> there<00:02:21.990> I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
little washer here I took off there I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.160 
little washer here I took off there I
might<00:02:22.620> might<00:02:22.920> be<00:02:23.100> able<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.460> use<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.819> if<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.420> stack

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
might might be able to use it if I stack

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.980 
might might be able to use it if I stack
two<00:02:25.500> or<00:02:25.560> three<00:02:25.710> washers<00:02:26.069> on<00:02:26.250> there<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:27.690> it's

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
two or three washers on there but it's

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.050 
two or three washers on there but it's
just<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.260> cheesy<00:02:28.560> repair<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.819> really

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
just a cheesy repair and I'm really

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.580 
just a cheesy repair and I'm really
irritated<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:33.300> truck<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.569> given<00:02:34.020> back

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
irritated that the truck was given back

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.059 
irritated that the truck was given back
to<00:02:34.830> me<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.130> condition<00:02:35.840> when<00:02:36.840> obviously

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
to me in this condition when obviously

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.530 
to me in this condition when obviously
the<00:02:38.069> shop<00:02:38.310> probably<00:02:38.580> stripped<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.150> out<00:02:39.390> or

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
the shop probably stripped that out or

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.190 
the shop probably stripped that out or
they<00:02:39.660> just<00:02:39.870> threw<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.520> different<00:02:41.520> oil<00:02:41.670> pan<00:02:41.880> on

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
and the replacement part is quite a bit

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.600 
and the replacement part is quite a bit
