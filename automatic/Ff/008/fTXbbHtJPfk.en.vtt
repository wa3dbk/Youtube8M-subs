we're entering an age now where we look
at<00:03:05.750> what<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.680> round<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.209> fossils

at what is a round of the fossils
instead<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.290> just<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.769> bones<00:03:10.150> now<00:03:11.150> they're

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
instead of just the bones now they're

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.750 
instead of just the bones now they're
going<00:03:11.959> back<00:03:12.140> into<00:03:12.440> their<00:03:12.620> collections<00:03:13.340> and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
going back into their collections and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.479 
going back into their collections and
going<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:15.380> know<00:03:15.470> those<00:03:15.590> marks<00:03:15.950> we<00:03:16.069> saw<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
going you know those marks we saw on the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
hundred years ago let's look at those

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.569 
hundred years ago let's look at those
again<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.560> they<00:03:21.769> take<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> look<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.400> they<00:03:22.459> go

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
time in dinosaur science in the next ten

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.229 
time in dinosaur science in the next ten
years<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:34.250> I'm<00:03:34.340> pretty<00:03:34.459> happy<00:03:34.579> with<00:03:34.910> his<00:03:35.030> dry
