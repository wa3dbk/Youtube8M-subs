00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
expecting such a tough game and I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.380 
expecting such a tough game and I
remember<00:01:11.310> walking<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> pitch<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> was

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
remember walking to the pitch it was

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
remember walking to the pitch it was
about<00:01:12.540> ten<00:01:13.110> minutes<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> pitch

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
about ten minutes to get to the pitch

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.470 
about ten minutes to get to the pitch
and<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.130> dressing<00:01:14.400> room<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> right<00:01:14.970> hiking

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:15.480 
and the dressing room was a right hiking

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.660 
and the dressing room was a right hiking
and<00:01:15.690> there<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.520> this

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and there we got there I like that this

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.430 
and there we got there I like that this
is<00:01:17.730> it<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.260> would<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
is it and I think that it would be a

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.900 
is it and I think that it would be a
tough<00:01:19.740> sort<00:01:19.980> of<00:01:20.040> early<00:01:20.250> period<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> game

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
tough sort of early period in the game

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.370 
tough sort of early period in the game

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.309 
think under liked a lot lost a game in
that<00:04:03.909> tournament<00:04:04.180> or<00:04:04.540> at<00:04:04.719> home<00:04:04.870> for<00:04:05.139> a<00:04:05.200> long

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
that tournament or at home for a long

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.309 
that tournament or at home for a long
long<00:04:05.469> period<00:04:05.819> for<00:04:06.819> me<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.629> team<00:04:07.870> performs

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
long period for me that team performs

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.869 
long period for me that team performs
was<00:04:08.590> probably<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:09.219> best<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:09.670> they<00:04:09.819> were

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
was probably the best that they were

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.039 
was probably the best that they were
playing<00:04:10.120> because<00:04:10.689> we<00:04:10.840> absolutely

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
playing because we absolutely

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.860 
playing because we absolutely
annihilated<00:04:11.709> them<00:04:11.859> that<00:04:12.069> night<00:04:12.219> and<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:13.030> know

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
annihilated them that night and you know

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.270

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
it was a massive massive game for

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.039 
it was a massive massive game for
everyone<00:04:15.969> because<00:04:16.060> we<00:04:16.180> still<00:04:16.599> want<00:04:16.660> to<00:04:16.840> beat

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
everyone because we still want to beat

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.900 
everyone because we still want to beat
them<00:04:17.259> because<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:18.009> way<00:04:18.039> that<00:04:18.160> said

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
against Lazio in the final match well I

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.659 
against Lazio in the final match well I
think<00:04:41.410> we<00:04:41.560> rather<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.919> burner<00:04:42.070> bow<00:04:42.310> on<00:04:42.430> him<00:04:42.550> is

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
think we rather the burner bow on him is

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.159 
think we rather the burner bow on him is
like<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.940> know<00:04:43.060> on<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.479> best<00:04:43.660> diamond<00:04:43.900> in<00:04:44.110> the

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
like you know on the best diamond in the

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.360 
like you know on the best diamond in the
world<00:04:44.199> but<00:04:44.500> we<00:04:44.590> don't<00:04:44.800> really<00:04:44.889> need<00:04:45.039> to<00:04:45.099> get<00:04:45.340> a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
world but we don't really need to get a

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.779 
world but we don't really need to get a
result

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
result

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.219 
result
but<00:04:45.940> obviously<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.449> want<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.750> because<00:04:47.020> you

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
but obviously you want it because you

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.540 
but obviously you want it because you
know<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.380> want<00:04:47.530> to<00:04:47.560> test<00:04:47.740> yourselves<00:04:48.070> again<00:04:48.370> I

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
know you want to test yourselves again I

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.969 
know you want to test yourselves again I
think<00:04:49.419> they<00:04:49.990> already<00:04:50.080> qualified<00:04:50.530> as<00:04:50.650> well<00:04:50.800> I

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
think they already qualified as well I

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.649 
think they already qualified as well I
think<00:04:51.460> they<00:04:51.669> might<00:04:51.820> have<00:04:51.880> so<00:04:52.150> he<00:04:52.210> was<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.479> you

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
think they might have so he was like you

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.909 
think they might have so he was like you
know<00:04:52.750> it<00:04:52.840> was<00:04:52.930> like<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.110> friendly<00:04:53.409> game<00:04:53.590> really

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
know it was like a friendly game really

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.580 
know it was like a friendly game really
