that<00:02:30.700> are<00:02:31.060> average<00:02:31.569> because<00:02:31.930> they<00:02:32.110> fit<00:02:32.410> our

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
that are average because they fit our

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.789 
that are average because they fit our

mental prototypes of what that body or
that<00:02:36.010> thing<00:02:36.370> should<00:02:36.610> look<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.120> average

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
that thing should look like so average

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.150 
that thing should look like so average
