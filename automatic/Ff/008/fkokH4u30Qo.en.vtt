00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.360
 In the end, war always comes down to choosing a side 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.780
 but if you don't, you can fight anyone. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 Hello all! My name is Diana and today I will show you the basic gameplay of our new game Rising Generals. 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.620
 When you start the game, you first see this huge world map. 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.840
 When the game is ready, up to 25,000 players can fight each other per continent. 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 The further you zoom in, the more different sectors and cells you can see. 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.680
 Gray cells are neutral; red are the enemies and the blue ones are mine. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.280
 I have already captured three outposts on this test server. 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.560
 Together with my headquarters I now have four districts in total. 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.040
 My headquarters here is the center of the game. 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.360
 From here I can produce fuel and parts, build units, perform surveys and much more. 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.980
 Rising Generals currently differs from most other online strategy games. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.600
 Normally you have to wait until you can use the troops or supplies you have made. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 But not in Rising Generals! 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 A click is enough and you get your produced fuel and troops immediately 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.160
 and you can attack with it directly. 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 This new cooldown system ensures that you can take immediate action and be efficient on the battlefield. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.140
 So let's see if we can make an army, get fuel, and attack our neighbors. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.880
 First, let's go to our barracks and recruit some new troops. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.860
 As you can see, I can choose from different tanks, helicopters and jet planes. 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.720
 Another thing you see here is our stone-paper-scissors system. 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.000
 Each unit has its own strengths and weaknesses against other species. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.500
 The Paladin tank, for example, is very strong against aircraft, but weak against light and heavy tanks. 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.100
 To build the troops, I only have to click on the quantity that I want to produce 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.600
 and after a single click the troops are immediately available. 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.820
 Now the cooldown starts and I have to wait a while before I can produce the next tanks. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.200
 Producing fuel works in the same way as with troops. 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.960
 Select how much fuel you want, click on this button and we are ready to attack our poor neighbors. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.560
 Attacking is very easy in Rising Generals. 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.220
 You just have to select the outpost where your troops are and click on "Army Action". 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.380
 After selecting the enemy outpost you can choose to plunder or take over. 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.320
 In the next screen we can choose which troops we want to use for the attack. 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.960
 We are bound by the amount of fuel we have. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.400
 The more troops we want to use, the more fuel we need. 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.460
 I have not prepared my attack well, so we can only use half our army 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.560
 but I think it's still enough. 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.020
 Ok, enough talk - let the battle begin! 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.420
 At the top of the screen you can see the power of my army and the power of the enemy army. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.780
 This time I am lucky because my army is clearly better. 

00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:59.737
 The entire fight is divided into three rounds: 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.120
 First the planes start with a bombing raid 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.980
 after that comes the artillery and the miners lay their work 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.480
 and in the third round all other troops enter the battlefield. 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.000
 That looks pretty good to me, I would say. 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.500
 The enemy's troops have almost been destroyed and I have not lost much. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360
 If you don't have time to watch the whole fight, 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.360
 You can of course skip it and see the results immediately. 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.820
 In this case we were successful and we took over a new outpost 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.580
 that we can now use to produce parts and fuel. 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.320
 I have now shown you our new cooldown system and how you can take over new outposts. 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.160
 I hope you enjoyed this video and keep an eye on us for more information about Rising Generals!
