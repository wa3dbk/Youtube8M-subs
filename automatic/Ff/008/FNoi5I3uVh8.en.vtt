00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
do one thing better than the newest

do one thing better than the newest
golfing<00:01:13.369> games<00:01:13.990> listen<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.200> music<00:01:22.569> that's

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
golfing games listen to the music that's

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.749 
golfing games listen to the music that's
way<00:01:24.410> better<00:01:24.679> than<00:01:24.920> any<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.280> music<00:01:25.490> they

way better than any of the music they

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.870 
way better than any of the music they
have<00:01:25.940> in<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.209> newer<00:01:26.390> games<00:01:27.280> which<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.459> turn<00:01:28.700> off

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
have in the newer games which I turn off

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.850 
have in the newer games which I turn off
as<00:01:29.149> quickly<00:01:29.450> as<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.869> can<00:01:29.929> when<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.380> play<00:01:30.649> them

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
as quickly as I can when I play them

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.010 
as quickly as I can when I play them
this<00:01:31.580> game<00:01:31.789> is<00:01:31.910> very<00:01:32.030> similar<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.509> golf<00:01:32.869> on<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
this game is very similar to golf on the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.639 
this game is very similar to golf on the
Atari<00:01:33.440> 2600<00:01:34.130> but<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.640> be<00:01:34.729> honest<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.179> prefer

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
Atari 2600 but to be honest I prefer

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.440 
Atari 2600 but to be honest I prefer
computer<00:01:36.649> golf<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.250> Magnavox<00:01:37.610> Odyssey<00:01:37.970> 2

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
computer golf on the Magnavox Odyssey 2

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.300 
computer golf on the Magnavox Odyssey 2
I<00:01:38.479> think<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.200> just<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.590> slightly<00:01:39.950> better

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
I think this is just a slightly better

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.300 
I think this is just a slightly better
game<00:01:41.170> once<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.319> get<00:01:42.470> used<00:01:42.679> to<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.920> fact<00:01:43.160> that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
game once you get used to the fact that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.730 
game once you get used to the fact that
you're<00:01:43.520> swinging<00:01:44.060> over<00:01:44.300> your<00:01:44.600> head<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:45.590> go

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
you're swinging over your head to go

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.900 
you're swinging over your head to go
down<00:01:46.099> and<00:01:46.399> left<00:01:47.380> or<00:01:48.380> Southwest<00:01:49.130> depending<00:01:49.819> on

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
down and left or Southwest depending on

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.499 
down and left or Southwest depending on
how<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.060> want<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.390> look<00:01:50.569> at<00:01:50.750> it

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.330 

you<00:01:56.509> have<00:01:56.660> 9<00:01:56.899> holes<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.349> golf<00:01:57.530> they<00:01:57.920> stay<00:01:58.220> the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
you have 9 holes of golf they stay the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.490 
you have 9 holes of golf they stay the
same<00:01:58.550> each<00:01:58.729> time<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:59.090> play<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.330> game<00:01:59.500> once

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
same each time you play the game once

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.749 
same each time you play the game once
you<00:02:00.590> get<00:02:00.740> into<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.099> it's<00:02:01.220> actually<00:02:01.580> not<00:02:01.700> that

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
you get into it it's actually not that

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.210 
you get into it it's actually not that
bad<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.539> game<00:02:02.720> does<00:02:03.050> provide<00:02:03.440> some<00:02:03.500> challenge

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
bad the game does provide some challenge

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.820 
bad the game does provide some challenge
it's<00:02:04.450> somewhat<00:02:05.450> laughable<00:02:05.660> today<00:02:06.349> when<00:02:06.740> you

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's somewhat laughable today when you

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.440 
it's somewhat laughable today when you
look<00:02:07.039> at<00:02:07.190> it<00:02:07.310> there's<00:02:07.520> golf<00:02:07.849> because<00:02:08.300> it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
look at it there's golf because it

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.690 
look at it there's golf because it
really<00:02:08.630> doesn't<00:02:08.830> resemble<00:02:09.830> golf<00:02:10.280> all<00:02:10.490> that

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
really doesn't resemble golf all that

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:28.360 
really doesn't resemble golf all that
much

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.449 

yes<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.080> Magnavox<00:02:31.799> Odyssey<00:02:32.010> -

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
yes and if you have a Magnavox Odyssey -

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.920 
yes and if you have a Magnavox Odyssey -
this<00:02:32.610> game<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:32.849> cheap<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> relatively<00:02:33.780> easy

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
this game is cheap and relatively easy

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.500 
this game is cheap and relatively easy
to<00:02:34.319> find<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.370> play<00:02:35.700> with<00:02:35.879> up<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.180> four

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
to find you can play with up to four

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.699 
to find you can play with up to four
people<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.049> does<00:02:37.230> provide<00:02:37.650> some

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
people and it does provide some

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.830 
people and it does provide some
challenge<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.519> that's<00:02:38.610> not<00:02:38.940> terribly<00:02:39.540> easy

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
challenge and that's not terribly easy

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.559 
challenge and that's not terribly easy
to<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.260> par<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.950> each<00:02:41.159> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.459> holes<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:42.390> do

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
to get par on each of the holes you do

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.559 
to get par on each of the holes you do
have<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.959> line<00:02:43.409> up<00:02:43.440> your<00:02:43.709> shots<00:02:44.069> as<00:02:44.879> bizarre<00:02:45.209> as

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
have to line up your shots as bizarre as

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.180 
have to line up your shots as bizarre as
the<00:02:45.720> interface<00:02:46.110> might<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:49.470> does<00:02:49.829> actually

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the interface might be it does actually

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.910 
the interface might be it does actually
work<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:51.810> hold<00:02:51.989> down<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.319> button<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.769> that's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
work you hold down the button and that's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.190 
work you hold down the button and that's
when<00:02:53.069> he<00:02:53.160> does<00:02:53.310> his<00:02:53.489> counterclockwise<00:02:54.200> swing

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200

when he does his counterclockwise swing
wind-up<00:02:55.829> no<00:02:56.459> matter<00:02:56.640> what<00:02:56.879> direction<00:02:57.030> he's

facing and obviously the longer you hold
the<00:03:00.180> button<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.690> more<00:03:00.870> powerful<00:03:01.349> your<00:03:01.530> shot

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829
