00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.650
 points 21 we are going to 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:14.010
 is this page 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.760
 ours 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.760
 Favourite 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.289
 but almost 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.259
 this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.259
 we see the page as they see me 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.730
 I have and to see what then is 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.450
 true that we download it again 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.450
 we unload 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.850
 to use our scales 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 here 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.120
 now we open it 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.950
 t 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.130
 at the beginning it seems this dance what 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130
 they hear again 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.470
 again we are going to release the power 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.530
 Young already says 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.689

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.860
 as I already have a profile you to 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.040
 main that the box appeared 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.610
 where you should put the exam then 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.090
 we already saw it so let's go here to edit 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.100
 profile 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:58.320
 he does everything and here he says pressure 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:02:01.259
 you can say 1 point 7.4 1.7 points 2 and 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.770
 well and like most of 1.7 points 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770
 we wait 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.500

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.780
 Huesca print 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.930
 as you see already above it says to me to mark 1.7 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.930
 points 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.690
 Do not pay attention to this because 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.690
 It is a posture 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.670
 i 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.310

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.310
