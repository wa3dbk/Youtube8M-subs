00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.970
 in this video I explain how to do the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.069
 cubes makes sense on a preparation or 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.840
 a burr 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.559
 the tick tick is a combination of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.360
 rights and purse stitches because you have the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.440
 straight stitches and knit ring on 3 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.850
 make manners 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.680
 It is wise to first get one 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.340
 make a test piece and look the same 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.019
 which straight stitch you like best 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.080
 at the cubes take you get both 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.179
 sides of your brain became a block 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 I myself found the back of it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.010
 cubes pattern the most beautiful that patterns 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 see you here on the photo 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.190
 that is of course no problem 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.140
 if you make a big plane with only 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 but the blocks just stick if you have the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 cubes stitch is going to combine with one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.140
 other sting than it is wise to 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.620
 do take the front of the cubes too 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.260
 In that case I recommend using the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.510
 official straight stitch but 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.489
 the stabbing you also gives a nice result 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.489
 with this block I have this example 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 made on a sailor preparation 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.850
 I also have double thread knitting yarn 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.530
 used with a needle thickness of 4 to 5 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.500
 you can also make this stitch on one 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.119
 blackberry a blackberry often has thinner 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 pins and more space between the pins 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.439
 so t can therefore be a little different 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.270
 therefore always make a test piece 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.080
 before you cross over a very large one 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.080
 plain knit 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.450
 if you ever take the cubes on one 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.700
 have made a knitting needle 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.800
 probably learned to three right and 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.900
 3 counterproductive and then 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.080
 then knit to 4 rows 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.119
 then you get a square block with 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.400
 a stitch ring makes the stitch a bit wider 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.790
 therefore you have more rows or tours 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.340
 needed to get a square block 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.020
 in this case I have three straight stitches 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.690
 and three purl stitches with each other 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 interspersed and there are 6 tours each or there 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.740
 rows of knitted 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.509
 the block region is therefore very simple 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.640
 she just put three purl stitches first 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.920
 then three straight 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.110
 then back 3 then straight again 3 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.200
 and so on 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.570
 breyer six tough van 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.670
 then you turn it around where you first 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.850
 you had three purl stitches now 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.590
 three straight stitches, then 3 purl 3 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.930
 straight and so on 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.930
 six tough or rows of them also knit 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.140
 I put a link of mine below 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.430
 website where your pattern will be quiet 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.660
