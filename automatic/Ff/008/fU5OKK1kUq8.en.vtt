00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.790
 Many buyers think that the main thing 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.589
 difference from the female bike is 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.570
 low upper frame but it is not 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 sports bike for example have 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 sloping top tube on some 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.820
 models it is slightly understated closer to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.010
 the base of the saddle is such a geometry 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960
 provides greater comfort on 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
 the bike more conveniently climbs comfortably 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.250
 jump and ride in a dress at the same time 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.289
 the difference does not end manufacturers 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 attentive to vi sur female 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.519
 This is due to the large bicycle 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.929
 ease of handling on heavy 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.790
 bike for example harder 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.200
 maneuver though it will be different 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.610
 good cross 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.620
 another interesting feature 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 is setting the front 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 shock absorber in women's bikes he 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.770
 softer which raises the level 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.780
 comfort on the one hand on the other 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 girl's weight compensation significantly 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 It is therefore easier to change and the shock absorber will be 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 better work off rough areas 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.789
 roads tighter plug just not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.100
 will shrink under your weight also 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.610
 there is a difference in the saddles handles and of course 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.559
 design 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.690
 female bike must be selected under 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.789
 then your height will be comfortable 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 the back will not tire on our site 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.600

 recommendations from the table of sizes of flirting 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.439
 with her before you go to the store for 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.060
 purchase during fitting pay 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.250
 attention to your landing you should not 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.080
 reach for the wheel excessively if it is not 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.970
 sports bike but the back should 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.710
 be tilted slightly forward to 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.720
 vibration from the road is not given to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.520
 whether the spine is worth overpaying for 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.820
 expensive model and what is the difference 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.979
 bicycles for 10 20 and in 30 thousand rubles 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.720
 cheap models are suitable for pleasure 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 skating can be recommended to people 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.400
 who ride on weekends or after 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.229
 work they are reliable and have equipment 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.189
 entry level with less 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.290
 speeds 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.420
 hardly you will use all 30 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.189
 speeds for fortune telling on asphalt though 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.049
 actually a large number 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.149
 possible combinations of speeds created 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.610
 due to more gears 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.890
 which provide smoother 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.869
 transmission changes than numbers that is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.300
 smoother chain shifting and more 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.550
 soft 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.380
 switching this smooth transition with 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.270
 Stars on a star positive 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.050
 affects the convenience of reliability and 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.240
 durability 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.550
 the frame is slightly harder a little harder 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.140
 accelerate bicycles for 20 thousand 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.220
 rubles are gaining speed faster 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500
 speeds 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.150
 much more convenient to switch as well 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.520
 bikes have less weight 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.320
 if you are not a professional you can not 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.090
 notice a tangible difference between 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.310
 bike from more expensive pricing 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.900
 categories that's why for 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.240
 short ride 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.330
 we recommend looking to the price 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.460
 categories of 15-20 thousand rubles are best 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.260
 not to focus on specific brands and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.810
 choose the best option 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.820
 for your money but still if you decide 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.240
 stop by bike up to 10,000 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.910
 rubles 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.280
 it's better to use stealth or star 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.960
 in this price category the most 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.930
 quality bikes if you decide 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.470
 choose more than 15,000 rubles 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.980
 preferably Merida 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.430
 jane track 2 cannondale 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.430
