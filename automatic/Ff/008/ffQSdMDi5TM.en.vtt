00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hello dear listeners with you 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.690
 archiv 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.599
 i keep my story about some 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.549
 the intricacies of windows 7 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.890
 surely many of you would like to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.680
 under the shortcuts on the desktop was not 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.730
 program titles simple 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.480
 renaming 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.529
 and erasing you will not achieve anything 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 so we will use some 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.160
 workaround for this click on 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.760
 the shortcut of the program you want to remove 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.079
 name press f2 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 after backspace hold down the alt key and 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:47.730
 dial 255 after this same mine 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.579
 center as you can see the label has become untitled 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.190
 and the same way you can 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.989
 use not only to programs but also 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.629
 for example 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.760
 remove my computer name for 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.860
 This also press f2 backspace alt 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.780
 255 enter as you see now we already have 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.560
 two desktop shortcuts 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 has no names also thought 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.960
 many of you have encountered a problem 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.830
 the fact that they constantly have this one 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.009
 label 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.939
 troubleshoot while there is some 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.330
 a way that will allow him to remove with 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.230
 launch panels 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.880
 for this click 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:35.060
 property menu and after that you have 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.350
 such a window appears called 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.130
 system icons 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.910
 here you choose a support center and in 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.920
 behavior you remove the value off 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.990
 then press ok and as you can see 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.300
 you have a full notification icon 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.980
 Now many of you probably wanted to 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.620
 to keep the computer off 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.060
 almost instant windows in 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.670
 principle can provide you with such 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.000
 opportunity so we need to go into 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.520
 the registry for this we need to call 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.540
 execute the string after this, enter there 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.830
 ridgid 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:14.870
 click ok look here and point glasses 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.980
 local machines further systems here to us 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.350
 Need a car and control set and select 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.150
 control folder 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.680
 here we will need to find 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.320
 parameters it to control a kill 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.150
 service time out and click on it item 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.170
 change and here by default we are given 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.010
 value of 20,000 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.380
 it's about 20 seconds and here we are 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.320
 we can change his appointment smaller 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.080
 but remember the minimum value here 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.470
 100 on recommended after all in 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.720
 range from 2000 to 5000 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.120
 less is not recommended 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.280
 otherwise the system will understand 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.190
 inadequate lack of feedback from 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.560
 services and complete them in unsuitable 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.930
 time moment for example when they 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.930
 your work will be saved 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.730
 either finished wrong or maybe 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.360
 translate any other errors 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.900
 so I will enter the value of the example 3000 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.030
 I press ok now after turning it off 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.680
 computer 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.350
 the system will terminate practically 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.239
 instantly for quick change 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.340
 system state can be created on 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.890
 desktop gear 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.290
 such allow to block the computer 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.650
 exit system shutdown 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.470
 reboot and or send and 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:43.540
 computer into sleep mode and for that you 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.069
 you need to create a shortcut and keep one of 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.819
 teams 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:52.780
 which you now see on the screen I 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:56.040
 choose a command to log out for 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.980
 this i just mean it 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.120
 in the line specify the location of the object and 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.630
 click next after this in view of the name and 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.000
 left unchanged Click Finish 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.799
 after that on the created shortcut 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.870
 since the levels are quite presentable i 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.570
 I propose to change his badge for this 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.820
 go to the properties to change the icon and 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:27.250
 choose any like us icon i 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:30.850
 for example, let 's choose this okay 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.070
 apply okay now girlok acquired 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.690
 somewhat presentable look and after 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:41.970
 clicking on it you see what's what 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.970
 the computer was turned off 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.660
 if we assume that you need to know 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.350
 how long does your computer work 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.080
 for this we do the following to us first 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.330
 need to open any text editor 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:05.170
 in my case it will be a notebook and in it 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:08.710
 copy this code here after that to us 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.140
 you need to save it but save it 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.490
 need in some other extension for 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:18.540
 This file type select all files and 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:22.750
 the name of the thing absolutely any 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:27.480
 after that we need to enter extension 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:30.880
 extension needs to be conducted exactly in b with a 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.500
 After that, choose a place and click 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.040
 save the code you can close it as 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.280
 see we have a shortcut in our 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.970
 name clicking on which we can 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.430
 to know that the system is running some 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.370
 certain time my case is seven 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.960
