air<00:01:34.729> circulation<00:01:35.270> keep<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.899> temperature

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
air circulation keep the temperature

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.080 
air circulation keep the temperature
down<00:01:36.469> a<00:01:36.530> little<00:01:36.710> bit<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.100> then<00:01:37.159> as<00:01:37.819> we<00:01:37.939> go

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
down a little bit and then as we go

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.149 
down a little bit and then as we go
ahead<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:38.569> take<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.899> look<00:01:39.079> on<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.350> inside<00:01:39.380> on

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
ahead and take a look on the inside on

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.399 
ahead and take a look on the inside on
the<00:01:40.280> liner<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.759> guy<00:01:40.939> they've<00:01:41.780> used<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
the liner this guy they've used the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.550 
the liner this guy they've used the
vector<00:01:42.979> dry<00:01:43.579> liner<00:01:44.060> which<00:01:44.569> is<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> kind<00:01:45.319> of<00:01:45.409> like

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
vector dry liner which is a kind of like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.760 
vector dry liner which is a kind of like
a<00:01:45.590> mesh<00:01:46.039> liner<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:47.990> see<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.319> runs

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
a mesh liner on this and you see it runs

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.169 
a mesh liner on this and you see it runs
through<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.159> length<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:49.670> this<00:01:49.850> is<00:01:50.060> an

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
through the length of it this is an

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.109 
through the length of it this is an
antimicrobial<00:01:50.539> treatment<00:01:51.499> really<00:01:52.310> prevent

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
antimicrobial treatment really prevent

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.940 
antimicrobial treatment really prevent
some<00:01:53.359> of<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.539> bacterial<00:01:54.020> build-up<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:54.710> you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
some of that bacterial build-up and you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.169 
some of that bacterial build-up and you
can<00:01:55.100> really<00:01:55.249> see<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.460> overall<00:01:55.819> design<00:01:55.939> of

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
can really see the overall design of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.459 
can really see the overall design of
this<00:01:56.329> guy<00:01:56.479> how<00:01:56.719> you<00:01:56.749> have<00:01:56.899> one<00:01:57.170> piece

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
this guy how you have one piece

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.879 
this guy how you have one piece
connecting<00:01:58.329> through<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.659> then<00:01:59.899> your<00:02:00.079> middle

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
connecting through and then your middle

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.099 
connecting through and then your middle
segment<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.459> panels<00:02:01.819> on<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.389> spine<00:02:02.689> as<00:02:02.899> well

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
segment and panels on the spine as well

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.859 
segment and panels on the spine as well
as<00:02:03.200> on<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.409> chest<00:02:04.149> alright<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:05.329> going<00:02:05.630> over

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
as on the chest alright so going over

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.809 
as on the chest alright so going over
the<00:02:05.990> overall<00:02:06.319> fit<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.649> this<00:02:06.740> guy<00:02:06.979> like<00:02:07.520> i<00:02:07.609> said

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
the overall fit of this guy like i said

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.669 
the overall fit of this guy like i said
before<00:02:07.939> has<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.300> nice<00:02:08.539> lightweight<00:02:08.929> feel<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.649> it

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
before has a nice lightweight feel to it

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.050 
before has a nice lightweight feel to it
but<00:02:09.979> still<00:02:10.160> offers<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> little<00:02:10.819> more

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
but still offers a little more

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.480 
but still offers a little more
