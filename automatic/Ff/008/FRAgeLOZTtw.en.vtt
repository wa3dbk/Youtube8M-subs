coming from I'm very concerned and want
to<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.840> top<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.290> shedinja<00:01:19.740> also

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
to know on top of that shedinja also

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.560 
to know on top of that shedinja also
gets<00:01:20.250> access<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> move<00:01:21.030> double<00:01:21.420> edge

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
gets access to the move double edge

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
gets access to the move double edge
which<00:01:21.900> means<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.350> use<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.770> move<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
which means if you use that move the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.760 
which means if you use that move the
recoil<00:01:24.030> makes<00:01:24.330> students<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.960> feint<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
time

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
time
it's<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.060> very<00:01:27.330> tricky<00:01:27.600> thing<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.110> also

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it's it's very tricky thing that's also

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's it's very tricky thing that's also
as<00:01:28.470> crazy<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> ninja<00:01:29.400> getting<00:01:29.700> final<00:01:30.030> gambit

right now I have no idea I this just
doesn't<00:02:09.569> make<00:02:09.750> sense

looking at Jellison it's personally not

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
damp ability so it isn't a billion it

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.440 
damp ability so it isn't a billion it
doesn't<00:02:31.830> make<00:02:32.129> sense<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.730> because<00:02:33.269> it's<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
doesn't make sense on it because it's a

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.000 
doesn't make sense on it because it's a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
ghost type and it's not going to get hit

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.770 
ghost type and it's not going to get hit
by<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.190> moves<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.790> it's<00:02:36.090> surprising<00:02:36.360> with

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
by the moves that it's surprising with

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.270 
by the moves that it's surprising with
disability<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.470> one's<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.040> bit<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
disability so that one's just a bit of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.729 
disability so that one's just a bit of
head<00:02:38.459> scratcher<00:02:38.760> right<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.590> next<00:02:40.590> up

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
head scratcher right there and next up

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.339 
head scratcher right there and next up
we<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.090> Magnemite<00:02:42.090> evolving<00:02:42.629> into<00:02:42.750> Magneton

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
we have Magnemite evolving into Magneton

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.500 
we have Magnemite evolving into Magneton
so<00:02:43.890> Magnemite<00:02:44.310> only<00:02:44.640> weighs<00:02:44.790> six<00:02:45.209> kilograms

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
so Magnemite only weighs six kilograms

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.839 
so Magnemite only weighs six kilograms
and<00:02:46.019> then<00:02:46.800> we<00:02:47.040> need<00:02:47.190> evolved<00:02:47.489> some<00:02:47.760> to

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
and then we need evolved some to

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.559 
and then we need evolved some to
Magneton

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
Magneton

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.860 
Magneton
it<00:02:48.870> weighs<00:02:49.110> 60<00:02:49.590> kilograms<00:02:50.040> I'm<00:02:51.030> not<00:02:51.450> sure<00:02:51.720> how

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
it weighs 60 kilograms I'm not sure how

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.199 
it weighs 60 kilograms I'm not sure how
that<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.290> works<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:53.340> if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.000> think

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that one works because if you think

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.790 
that one works because if you think
about<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.569> in<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.930> pokedex<00:02:55.349> entry<00:02:55.650> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
about it in the pokedex entry and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.339 
about it in the pokedex entry and
watching<00:02:56.310> pokemon<00:02:56.670> snap<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.120> everything<00:02:57.450> it

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
watching pokemon snap and everything it

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.229 
watching pokemon snap and everything it
literally<00:02:58.890> takes<00:02:59.099> three<00:02:59.400> Magnemite<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.030> form

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
literally takes three Magnemite to form

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.030 
literally takes three Magnemite to form
a<00:03:00.300> Magneton<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:00.989> generic<00:03:01.440> math<00:03:01.620> tells<00:03:01.890> you

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
a Magneton so generic math tells you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.589 
a Magneton so generic math tells you
that<00:03:02.159> should<00:03:02.340> be<00:03:02.430> six<00:03:02.670> times<00:03:02.819> three<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.330> six

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
that should be six times three not six

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.449 
that should be six times three not six
