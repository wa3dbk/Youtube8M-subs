besides the two statistics we just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.890 
besides the two statistics we just
listed<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.640> clearly<00:00:30.000> different<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
listed that are clearly different the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
fire rate and the reload time these

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.560 
fire rate and the reload time these
weapons<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.140> almost<00:00:34.880> identical<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.149> every

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
weapons are almost identical in every

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.470 
weapons are almost identical in every
way<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.590> behave<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.250> think<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> key

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
way they behave I think one of the key

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.660 
way they behave I think one of the key
differences<00:00:40.010> statistically<00:00:41.010> speaking<00:00:41.129> is

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
differences statistically speaking is

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.200 
differences statistically speaking is
the<00:00:42.079> m249<00:00:43.079> tends<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.129> higher<00:00:44.210> spread

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the m249 tends to have a higher spread

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
the m249 tends to have a higher spread
all<00:00:45.539> around<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.649> bit<00:00:46.739> more<00:00:46.890> recoil

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
all around and a little bit more recoil

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
all around and a little bit more recoil
yes<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> splitting

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
yes but we're just kind of splitting

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
yes but we're just kind of splitting
hairs<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.070> lot<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> has<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.090> with

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
hairs here a lot of it has to do with

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.090 
hairs here a lot of it has to do with
hipfire<00:00:51.570> where<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.350> LSAT<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.739> actually<00:00:53.010> much

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
hipfire where the LSAT is actually much

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
hipfire where the LSAT is actually much
better<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.000> only<00:00:54.180> thing<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> LSAT<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> not

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
better the only thing the LSAT is not

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.560 
better the only thing the LSAT is not
better<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.800> its<00:00:56.610> aim<00:00:56.910> down<00:00:57.120> sight<00:00:57.539> spread

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
better is its aim down sight spread

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.889 
better is its aim down sight spread
while<00:00:58.559> moving<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.640> let's<00:01:00.390> face<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> that's

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
while moving which let's face it that's

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.439 
while moving which let's face it that's
not<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.199> most<00:01:01.829> people<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.489> an<00:01:02.640> LMG<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
not what most people do with an LMG it's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.109 
not what most people do with an LMG it's
a<00:01:03.780> difference<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> 1<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.589> 1.25<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.909> being

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
a difference of 1 to 1.25 the one being

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
a difference of 1 to 1.25 the one being
the<00:01:06.330> m249<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:08.400> than<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.729> mean

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the m249 but other than that I mean

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.250 
the m249 but other than that I mean
they're<00:01:09.119> almost<00:01:09.270> statistically<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.229> same

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
they're almost statistically the same

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
they're almost statistically the same
exact<00:01:11.010> thing<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.180> bit

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
exact thing you just get a little bit

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
exact thing you just get a little bit
less<00:01:12.689> left-to-right<00:01:13.530> recoil<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> LSAT

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
less left-to-right recoil with the LSAT

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.929 
less left-to-right recoil with the LSAT
me<00:01:15.780> personally<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.920> m249<00:01:17.549> is

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
me personally I know that the m249 is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.460 
me personally I know that the m249 is
kind<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.360> LMG<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.020> lot<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> people

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
kind of that LMG that a lot of people

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.870 
kind of that LMG that a lot of people
think<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.549> quote-unquote

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
think is your you know quote-unquote

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.289 
think is your you know quote-unquote
running<00:01:21.479> gun<00:01:21.750> LMG<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.549> seems<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.150> it's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
running gun LMG in it it seems like it's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.149 
running gun LMG in it it seems like it's
a<00:01:24.360> good<00:01:24.509> weapon<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.020> has<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.650> fairly

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
a good weapon because it has a fairly

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.740 
a good weapon because it has a fairly
high<00:01:26.310> rate<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.670> fire<00:01:26.909> mean<00:01:27.119> 800<00:01:27.509> rounds<00:01:27.689> per

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
high rate of fire mean 800 rounds per

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
high rate of fire mean 800 rounds per
minute<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.500> higher<00:01:28.619> than

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
minute is a little bit higher than

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
minute is a little bit higher than
average<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.820> there's<00:01:30.000> something<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
average but there's something about the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.539 
average but there's something about the
LSAT<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.140> know<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.350> first<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.770> wasn't<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> big

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
LSAT you know at first I wasn't that big

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.249 
LSAT you know at first I wasn't that big
of<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.729> fan<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.630> used<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
of a fan but the more I got used to it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.200 
of a fan but the more I got used to it
the<00:01:34.650> lower<00:01:34.829> rate<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> fire<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.640> slightly

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the lower rate of fire the slightly

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
the lower rate of fire the slightly
tighter<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.680> recoil<00:01:38.130> patterns<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
tighter you know recoil patterns and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
tighter you know recoil patterns and
just<00:01:39.090> seemed<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.540> could<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:40.110> done

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
just seemed like I could get more done

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.740 
just seemed like I could get more done
of<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> even<00:01:40.979> though<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> was<00:01:41.280> firing

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
of it even though I was firing

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.460 
of it even though I was firing
significantly<00:01:42.750> slower<00:01:43.049> than<00:01:43.259> its

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
significantly slower than its

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
significantly slower than its
counterpart<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> m249<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.840> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
counterpart the m249 it was just it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
counterpart the m249 it was just it
seemed<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> more<00:01:46.500> rounded<00:01:46.860> gun<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
seemed like a more rounded gun that I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.060 
seemed like a more rounded gun that I
could<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> hold<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> handle<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> lot

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
could get a hold of and handle a lot

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.249 
could get a hold of and handle a lot
easier<00:01:50.520> than<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.790> could<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> m249<00:01:51.720> one<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
easier than I could the m249 one of the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
easier than I could the m249 one of the
things<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> m249<00:01:53.280> has<00:01:53.670> over<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.000> LSAT

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
things that the m249 has over the LSAT

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
things that the m249 has over the LSAT
is<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.930> simply<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.740> people<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.219> used<00:01:56.430> it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
is that simply more people have used it

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.179 
is that simply more people have used it
the<00:01:57.240> 2:49<00:01:58.020> has<00:01:58.140> been<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.439> since<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> game<00:01:59.159> was

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
the 2:49 has been out since the game was

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.920 
the 2:49 has been out since the game was
released<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> LSAT<00:02:00.240> snuck<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.750> close

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
released the LSAT snuck in with close

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
released the LSAT snuck in with close
quarters<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> lot<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.920> people<00:02:02.130> have

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
quarters so not a lot of people have

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.520 
quarters so not a lot of people have
even<00:02:02.610> put<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.030> much<00:02:03.270> time<00:02:03.570> into<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> LSAT<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
even put that much time into the LSAT I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.730 
even put that much time into the LSAT I
know<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.740> personally<00:02:04.950> use<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.759> m249<00:02:06.390> way<00:02:07.350> more

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
know I personally use the m249 way more

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.660 
know I personally use the m249 way more
than<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> LSAT

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
than the LSAT

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.220 
than the LSAT
but<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.700> agree<00:02:10.090> with<00:02:10.119> what's<00:02:10.599> new<00:02:10.780> said<00:02:11.019> I<00:02:11.049> found

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
but I agree with what's new said I found

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.369 
but I agree with what's new said I found
the<00:02:11.409> LSAT<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.129> be<00:02:12.640> more<00:02:12.879> consistent<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.690> I

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
the LSAT to be more consistent and I

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.940 
the LSAT to be more consistent and I
think<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.159> higher<00:02:15.909> recoil<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.950> higher

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
think the higher recoil and higher

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.240 
think the higher recoil and higher
spread<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.819> m249<00:02:19.540> really<00:02:20.230> affected<00:02:20.830> my

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
spread on the m249 really affected my

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.789 
spread on the m249 really affected my
gameplay<00:02:21.819> more<00:02:22.180> than<00:02:23.019> anything<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.739> that's

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
gameplay more than anything and that's

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.300 
gameplay more than anything and that's
why<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.250> chose<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.209> LSAT<00:02:25.690> over<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.140> m249<00:02:26.739> since

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
why I chose the LSAT over the m249 since

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.940 
why I chose the LSAT over the m249 since
they<00:02:27.430> both<00:02:27.610> deal<00:02:27.970> assault<00:02:28.599> rifle<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.409> damage

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
they both deal assault rifle like damage

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.649 
they both deal assault rifle like damage
you<00:02:30.400> really<00:02:30.730> need<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.090> able<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.269> hit<00:02:31.510> as

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
you really need to be able to hit as

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.930 
you really need to be able to hit as
many<00:02:31.810> bullets<00:02:32.349> as<00:02:32.560> quickly<00:02:33.010> as<00:02:33.190> possible<00:02:33.670> and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
many bullets as quickly as possible and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.569 
many bullets as quickly as possible and
I<00:02:34.209> found<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.480> m249<00:02:35.049> just<00:02:35.409> bounced<00:02:35.739> around<00:02:36.220> a

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
I found the m249 just bounced around a

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.819 
I found the m249 just bounced around a
little<00:02:36.760> bit<00:02:37.000> too<00:02:37.329> much<00:02:37.599> when<00:02:38.440> going<00:02:38.709> up

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
little bit too much when going up

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.860 
little bit too much when going up
against<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> salt<00:02:39.549> rifles<00:02:39.909> yeah<00:02:40.329> even<00:02:40.629> when<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
against the salt rifles yeah even when I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.930 
against the salt rifles yeah even when I
had<00:02:41.049> this<00:02:41.170> thing<00:02:41.349> bipod<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:41.920> up<00:02:42.040> there<00:02:42.280> was<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
had this thing bipod it up there was it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.190 
had this thing bipod it up there was it
was<00:02:43.030> kind<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.269> nice<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.720> high<00:02:43.989> rate

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
was kind of nice to have that high rate

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.599 
was kind of nice to have that high rate
of<00:02:44.260> fire<00:02:44.470> one<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.010> those<00:02:45.129> I<00:02:45.280> feel<00:02:45.459> like<00:02:45.579> a

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
of fire one of those I feel like a

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.360 
of fire one of those I feel like a
higher<00:02:45.790> rate<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.000> fire<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.510> high<00:02:47.230> mo<00:02:47.890> capacity

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
higher rate of fire and high mo capacity

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.869 
higher rate of fire and high mo capacity
kind<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:49.000> helps<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.959> compensate<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.129> terrible

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
kind of helps to compensate for terrible

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.149 
kind of helps to compensate for terrible
aim<00:02:52.000> not<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.290> LMG<00:02:53.560> when<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.010> five

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
aim not with the LMG when it's five

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.339 
aim not with the LMG when it's five
potted<00:02:54.579> up<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.849> actually<00:02:55.000> wanted<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.540> go<00:02:55.720> slower

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
potted up I actually wanted to go slower

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.710 
potted up I actually wanted to go slower
rate<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.680> fire<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.010> more<00:02:57.340> control<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.970> even

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
rate of fire and more control and even

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.089 
rate of fire and more control and even
though<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.959> was<00:02:59.079> able<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.500> absolutely<00:02:59.709> lay

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
though I was able to just absolutely lay

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.860 
though I was able to just absolutely lay
down<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.489> incredible<00:03:01.450> amounts<00:03:01.780> of

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
down in incredible amounts of

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.110 
down in incredible amounts of
suppressive<00:03:02.349> fire<00:03:02.590> with<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.430> m249

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
suppressive fire with the m249

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.569 
suppressive fire with the m249
especially<00:03:05.079> with<00:03:05.170> fixated<00:03:05.680> mags<00:03:05.859> I<00:03:06.159> just

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
especially with fixated mags I just

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.619 
especially with fixated mags I just
didn't<00:03:06.940> feel<00:03:07.030> like<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.239> was<00:03:07.299> really<00:03:07.510> getting

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
didn't feel like I was really getting

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:08.970 
didn't feel like I was really getting
the<00:03:07.840> hits<00:03:08.049> that<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.319> needed<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.680> in<00:03:08.799> order<00:03:08.890> to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
the hits that I needed to in order to

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.649 
the hits that I needed to in order to
put<00:03:09.129> them<00:03:09.280> down<00:03:09.459> without<00:03:09.849> doubt<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.329> like<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
put them down without doubt I like the

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.629 
put them down without doubt I like the
LSAT<00:03:10.959> over<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> m249<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:12.010> that's<00:03:12.159> two<00:03:12.430> votes

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
LSAT over the m249 so that's two votes

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.690 
LSAT over the m249 so that's two votes
for<00:03:12.849> the<00:03:13.359> LSAT<00:03:13.870> over<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.380> m249<00:03:15.160> if<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.549> guys

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
for the LSAT over the m249 if you guys
