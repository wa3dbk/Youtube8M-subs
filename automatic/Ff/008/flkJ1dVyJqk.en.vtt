something historically and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.670 
something historically and
scientifically<00:01:47.159> significant<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.560> it's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
scientifically significant I think it's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
scientifically significant I think it's
really<00:01:49.920> cool<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.130> wish<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.850> had<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> 3d<00:01:51.329> printer

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the vein of like print as many cogs and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.649 
the vein of like print as many cogs and
weird<00:02:11.530> things<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.129> you<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:13.060> like<00:02:13.329> make

weird things as you can and like make

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.349 
weird things as you can and like make
your<00:02:13.840> own<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:15.010> know<00:02:15.159> I<00:02:15.489> think<00:02:15.579> we<00:02:15.790> did<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.969> story

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
your own you know I think we did a story

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.569 
your own you know I think we did a story
one<00:02:16.540> time<00:02:16.569> about<00:02:16.900> 3d<00:02:17.260> printing<00:02:17.650> we<00:02:18.250> have<00:02:18.400> 3d

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
one time about 3d printing we have 3d

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.520 
one time about 3d printing we have 3d
printed<00:02:18.909> pizza<00:02:19.209> don't<00:02:19.359> they<00:02:19.510> pretty<00:02:20.019> pretty

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
printed pizza don't they pretty pretty

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.949 
printed pizza don't they pretty pretty
print<00:02:20.829> food<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.310> extremely<00:02:22.180> expensive<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
print food it's extremely expensive and

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.830 
print food it's extremely expensive and
not<00:02:23.140> worth<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.680> at<00:02:23.799> this<00:02:23.950> point<00:02:24.569> research<00:02:25.569> is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
not worth it at this point research is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.210 
not worth it at this point research is
significant<00:02:26.470> because<00:02:26.530> maybe<00:02:26.799> we<00:02:27.010> could<00:02:27.159> do

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
significant because maybe we could do

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.860 
significant because maybe we could do
that<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.549> space<00:02:28.090> people<00:02:28.540> even<00:02:28.720> did<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
that in space people even did a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.470 
that in space people even did a
schematics<00:02:29.439> for<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:30.040> guns<00:02:32.879> obviously<00:02:33.879> you

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
schematics for for guns obviously you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.319 
schematics for for guns obviously you
know<00:02:34.599> print<00:02:34.810> things<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.079> are<00:02:35.170> useful<00:02:35.349> for

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
know print things that are useful for

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.420 
know print things that are useful for
utilitarian<00:02:37.329> purposes<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.920> can<00:02:39.129> make

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
utilitarian purposes and you can make

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.500 
utilitarian purposes and you can make
crappy<00:02:39.639> little<00:02:39.879> dolls

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
crappy little dolls

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.390 
crappy little dolls
there's<00:02:40.840> 14<00:02:41.319> right<00:02:41.530> now<00:02:41.709> available<00:02:42.250> on

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
there's 14 right now available on

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.420 
there's 14 right now available on
sketchfab<00:02:43.109> so<00:02:44.109> you<00:02:44.170> can't<00:02:44.470> exactly<00:02:44.829> have<00:02:45.159> rid

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
sketchfab so you can't exactly have rid

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.800 
sketchfab so you can't exactly have rid
of<00:02:45.549> do<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> marbled<00:02:46.120> portrait<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.480> julius

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
said it's about 3d printing is that 3d

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.800 
said it's about 3d printing is that 3d
printing<00:02:54.159> as<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.639> technology<00:02:55.299> now<00:02:55.419> will<00:02:55.659> pretty

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
printing as a technology now will pretty

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.809 
printing as a technology now will pretty
much<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.139> novelty<00:02:56.560> item<00:02:56.859> until<00:02:57.730> we<00:02:57.939> get<00:02:58.180> into

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
much be a novelty item until we get into

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.729 
much be a novelty item until we get into
terraforming<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.180> terrestrial<00:03:01.959> like<00:03:02.470> space

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
terraforming and terrestrial like space

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.069 
terraforming and terrestrial like space
travel<00:03:02.769> it's<00:03:03.639> not<00:03:03.790> gonna<00:03:03.879> have<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.870> not

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
really gonna have practical effect on us

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.240 
really gonna have practical effect on us
too<00:03:07.269> much<00:03:07.450> there'll<00:03:07.959> be<00:03:07.989> some<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:08.680> right<00:03:09.099> now

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250

game but I love it um they think 3d

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.420 
game but I love it um they think 3d
because<00:03:23.409> that<00:03:23.620> when<00:03:23.769> they're<00:03:23.889> doing<00:03:24.099> models

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
because that when they're doing models

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.979 
because that when they're doing models
for<00:03:24.669> it<00:03:24.729> it's<00:03:24.819> really<00:03:24.970> cool<00:03:25.209> they<00:03:25.359> 3d<00:03:25.720> print
