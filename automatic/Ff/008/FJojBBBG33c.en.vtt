looking package they've obviously done a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
say that it's a facelift it's actually
somewhere<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.549> between<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.090> closer<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.630> an

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
somewhere in between and closer to an

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.330 
somewhere in between and closer to an
all-new<00:01:43.079> model<00:01:43.110> into<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> facelift<00:01:44.280> because

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
all-new model into a facelift because

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.429 
all-new model into a facelift because
they've<00:01:44.579> done<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.240> lot<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> work<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.320> this

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
they've done a lot of work to this

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.069 
they've done a lot of work to this
vehicle<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:47.579> around<00:01:48.030> 80<00:01:48.360> percent<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
vehicle I think around 80 percent of the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.749 
vehicle I think around 80 percent of the
body<00:01:49.290> components<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.250> new<00:01:50.579> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
body components are all new and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
body components are all new and
certainly<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.390> exterior<00:01:52.020> sheet<00:01:52.350> metal<00:01:52.740> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
certainly the exterior sheet metal is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.090 
certainly the exterior sheet metal is
totally<00:01:53.729> new<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.590> as<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.740> mentioned<00:01:56.040> before

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
totally new and as you mentioned before

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.520 
totally new and as you mentioned before
of<00:01:56.399> course<00:01:56.460> people<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.479> cabs<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.380> tone

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
of course people get in cabs if a tone

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.929 
of course people get in cabs if a tone
tone<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> health<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.189> themselves<00:01:59.549> they<00:01:59.700> tend

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
tone of health in themselves they tend

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.190

orion but of course we also have the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.210 
orion but of course we also have the
Honda's<00:04:02.820> about<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.270> launch<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.690> new<00:04:03.720> Accord<00:04:04.530> v6

Honda's about to launch a new Accord v6
which<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> large<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.840> guess<00:04:07.500> it's<00:04:07.680> pretty

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
which is a large I guess it's pretty

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.979 
which is a large I guess it's pretty
close<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:08.340> being<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.640> Falcon<00:04:09.030> sized<00:04:09.300> car<00:04:09.690> and

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
close to being a Falcon sized car and

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.680 
close to being a Falcon sized car and
that<00:04:10.920> could<00:04:11.430> potentially<00:04:11.550> be<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.090> competitor

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that could potentially be a competitor

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.630 
that could potentially be a competitor
and<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:13.050> course<00:04:13.290> masters<00:04:13.770> got<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.070> master<00:04:14.400> six

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
and of course masters got the master six

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.640 
and of course masters got the master six
so<00:04:14.790> there<00:04:14.940> are<00:04:15.060> cars<00:04:15.300> that<00:04:15.450> are<00:04:15.690> not<00:04:15.959> quite<00:04:16.560> as

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
so there are cars that are not quite as

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.650 
so there are cars that are not quite as
largest<00:04:17.310> for<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:17.549> legal<00:04:17.910> cars<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.480> people

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
largest for like legal cars that people

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.930 
largest for like legal cars that people
but<00:04:18.959> probably<00:04:19.109> are<00:04:19.470> considering<00:04:20.070> these<00:04:20.580> days

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
but probably are considering these days

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.670
