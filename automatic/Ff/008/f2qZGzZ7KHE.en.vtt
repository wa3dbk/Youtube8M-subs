00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 a new engine for minecraft and 0.10 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.249
 points is very good guys we are dealing 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.779
 of the world 's tourism ship as the most 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.230
 which we are going to add 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.449
 different types of animals people 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.339
 we are going to add them to our 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.720
 minecraft but still guys this way 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.610
 it's pretty cool the truth is 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.649
 I recommend a lot since it 's like telling 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.000
 some added different animals but 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.500
 good guys here we can find 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.960
 animals to lions 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.770
 far away I think that's a rabbit to 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.250
 giraffes buffaloes to donkeys or horses 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.950
 or that this is a horse bunnies 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.230
 different colors yellow pink coffee 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.590
 but we can also find elephants 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.770
 common that look pretty weird this 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.730
 butterflies or wings we can also 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.740
 find what would be bird 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.450
 good the cycle that are too many 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.850
 animals that can not say all 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.290
 we can also find enough mods 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.600
 do not go very be as it is said very thriller 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.520
 yes very very annoying you are since we can 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.860
 find the piano with red particles 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.060
 so the killer villager the terrorist 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.979
 this mode that is going to attack you 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.930
 anyone where you go too what 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.190
 It would be the lion what I recommend 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.690
 guys is that they do not come close to these 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.369
 types of mountains since in any 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.400
 world that they have in any being is 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.290
 urban or creative is like these modes 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.210
 that would be the lion in what would be the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.789
 terrorist and what would the villager be 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.530
 murderer are not going to be fighting already 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.780
 every time they go to xesta with the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.310
 be hitting until they are killed and 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.950
 well nothing guys this world is the one of 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.539
 woman network seur and they are animals I do not know how 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.580
 it is called but in itself the mode is 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.930
 pretty cool we already have more animals 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.300
 we started from two but we already have 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.890
 enough animals at the helm and also 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.080

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.820
 all animals 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.400
 but here we can also find 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.550
 any turn next meal I think it's 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.700
 food put together at the moment 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.890
 we can also find more food 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.810
 a weapon to be able to attack these 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.810
 terrorist foundations 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.090

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.230

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.010

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.540
 to be able to assemble what is created with two of 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.360

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.459
 what would be the good horse with the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.230
 rope and we will not go up and we would already be 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.840
 more than anything mounted on our mobile 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.510
