to<00:01:13.620> be<00:01:13.680> flipped<00:01:13.920> over<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.250> course<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to be flipped over of course to do that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.600 
to be flipped over of course to do that
and<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.110> will<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> motor<00:01:16.920> box<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.550> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and I will and the motor box is going to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
and I will and the motor box is going to
make<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.030> harder<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.510> flip<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.500> I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
make it a little harder to flip but I

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.830 
make it a little harder to flip but I
got<00:01:19.799> some<00:01:20.040> capable<00:01:20.670> 25<00:01:21.299> year<00:01:21.509> old<00:01:21.630> neighbor

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
China log I'm learning all kinds of new

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
China log I'm learning all kinds of new
terms<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.270> anyway<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:50.070> were<00:01:50.490> left<00:01:50.960> where

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
terms but anyway that were left where

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.459 
terms but anyway that were left where
the<00:01:52.229> wall<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> boat<00:01:53.340> comes<00:01:53.939> up<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:55.350> have

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
the wall of the boat comes up you have

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.880 
the wall of the boat comes up you have
to<00:01:55.619> tape<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.430> fiberglass<00:01:56.820> tape<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
to tape that with fiberglass tape so I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.889 
to tape that with fiberglass tape so I
thought<00:01:59.100> it'd<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.369> good<00:01:59.880> idea<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.689> go

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
thought it'd be a really good idea to go

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.740 
thought it'd be a really good idea to go
ahead<00:02:00.929> and<00:02:01.170> put<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.350> motor<00:02:01.560> box<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.250> because

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
ahead and put a motor box on because

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.990 
ahead and put a motor box on because
where<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.960> meets<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.409> floor<00:02:04.759> along<00:02:05.759> there

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
where that meets the floor along there

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.849 
where that meets the floor along there
that<00:02:06.390> we'll<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.630> need<00:02:06.840> teeps<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.649> whole

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
that we'll all need teeps and this whole

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.639 
that we'll all need teeps and this whole
interior<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:09.149> box<00:02:09.450> gets<00:02:09.810> fiberglass<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
interior this box gets fiberglass to

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.790 
interior this box gets fiberglass to
waterproof<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.720> epoxy<00:02:13.230> resin<00:02:13.680> and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
waterproof but it's the epoxy resin and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.460 
waterproof but it's the epoxy resin and
fiberglass<00:02:13.890> cloth

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.110 
fiberglass in the bottom there's keels
on<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.230> bottom<00:02:33.620> they're<00:02:33.800> already<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.940> and

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
on the bottom they're already on it and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.870 
on the bottom they're already on it and
all<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.290> gets<00:02:36.530> fiberglass<00:02:37.190> tape<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:37.760> then

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
all that gets fiberglass tape and then

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.420 
all that gets fiberglass tape and then
favor<00:02:38.120> glass<00:02:38.390> cloth<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.050> an<00:02:39.830> epoxy<00:02:40.220> resin

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
favor glass cloth and an epoxy resin

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.080 
favor glass cloth and an epoxy resin
over<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.420> anyway<00:02:42.460> so<00:02:43.460> that<00:02:43.580> whole<00:02:43.760> bottom

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
over it but anyway so that whole bottom

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.960 
over it but anyway so that whole bottom
will<00:02:44.210> get<00:02:44.330> fiberglass<00:02:45.490> hopefully<00:02:46.490> this<00:02:46.730> next

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
will get fiberglass hopefully this next

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.080 
will get fiberglass hopefully this next
week<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.570> then<00:02:47.900> I'll<00:02:48.290> paint<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.160> bottom<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
week and then I'll paint the bottom and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.760 
week and then I'll paint the bottom and
then<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.330> will<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.660> flipped<00:02:50.990> back<00:02:51.230> over<00:02:51.590> like

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
then it will get flipped back over like

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.830 
then it will get flipped back over like
this<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.890> sides<00:02:55.220> will<00:02:55.490> go<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.210> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
this and the sides will go on and the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.380 
this and the sides will go on and the
wheelhouse<00:02:57.080> will<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:57.740> built<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.670> decks<00:02:58.970> and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
wheelhouse will get built the decks and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.800 
wheelhouse will get built the decks and
so<00:03:00.430> it'll<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.640> there's<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.210> lot<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.510> work<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.780> lot

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
so it'll be there's a lot of work a lot

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.350 
so it'll be there's a lot of work a lot
of<00:03:02.930> detail<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.410> go<00:03:03.710> yet<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.220> once<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.120> flip

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
of detail to go yet but once it flip

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.880 
of detail to go yet but once it flip
back<00:03:05.540> over<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.990> bottom<00:03:06.320> is<00:03:06.410> done<00:03:06.590> and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
back over and the bottom is done and

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.120 
back over and the bottom is done and
it'll<00:03:07.640> start<00:03:07.820> looking<00:03:08.120> more<00:03:08.240> like<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.420> boat

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130
