00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.380 
small pistons inside some of the rocker
arms<00:02:10.690> are<00:02:10.899> forced<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.860> move<00:02:11.980> across<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.760> lock

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
arms are forced to move across and lock

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.380 
arms are forced to move across and lock
into<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> arms<00:02:14.110> next<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.590> them<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:15.880> action

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
into the arms next to them this action

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.960 
into the arms next to them this action
effectively<00:02:16.870> locks<00:02:17.349> all<00:02:17.650> three<00:02:18.310> rocker<00:02:18.610> arms

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
effectively locks all three rocker arms

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.199 
effectively locks all three rocker arms
together<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.349> they<00:02:20.500> move<00:02:20.739> as<00:02:20.920> one<00:02:21.220> large<00:02:21.730> arm

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
together so they move as one large arm

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.860 
together so they move as one large arm
as<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:24.069> center<00:02:24.430> cam<00:02:24.700> lobe<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.030> causes<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
as the center cam lobe that causes the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.870 
as the center cam lobe that causes the
middle<00:02:26.200> rocker<00:02:26.470> arm<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.950> move<00:02:27.099> up<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.400> down<00:02:27.610> is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
middle rocker arm to move up and down is

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.300 
middle rocker arm to move up and down is
larger<00:02:28.420> than<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.690> two<00:02:28.900> normal<00:02:29.410> lobes<00:02:29.650> it's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
larger than the two normal lobes it's

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.949 
larger than the two normal lobes it's
now<00:02:30.579> forcing<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> two<00:02:31.390> valves<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.930> open

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
now forcing the two valves to open

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.000 
now forcing the two valves to open
sooner<00:02:32.709> close<00:02:33.670> later<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.650> increase<00:02:35.650> valve

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
sooner close later and increase valve

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.009 
sooner close later and increase valve
lift<00:02:36.400> according<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.390> shape<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
lift according to the shape of the

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.430 
lift according to the shape of the
center<00:02:38.380> cam<00:02:38.620> lobe<00:02:39.569> this<00:02:40.569> action<00:02:41.019> will<00:02:41.170> enable

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
center cam lobe this action will enable

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.380 
center cam lobe this action will enable
the<00:02:41.709> engine<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.190> breathe<00:02:42.340> more<00:02:42.700> effectively

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
the engine to breathe more effectively

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.410 
the engine to breathe more effectively
at<00:02:43.569> these<00:02:43.840> higher<00:02:44.200> engine<00:02:44.530> revs<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.420> increase

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
at these higher engine revs and increase

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.829 
at these higher engine revs and increase
the<00:02:46.810> engines<00:02:47.230> performance
