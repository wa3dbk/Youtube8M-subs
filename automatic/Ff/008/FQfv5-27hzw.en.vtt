showing you how to build version 3 of my
automatic<00:00:06.960> chicken<00:00:07.290> cooker<00:00:07.620> it's<00:00:08.189> so<00:00:08.639> much

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
automatic chicken cooker it's so much

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.570 
automatic chicken cooker it's so much
more<00:00:09.090> compact<00:00:09.480> than<00:00:09.630> version<00:00:10.050> 1<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.580> it

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
more compact than version 1 and it

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.549 
more compact than version 1 and it
requires<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.059> lot<00:00:12.090> less<00:00:12.750> resources<00:00:13.440> than

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
requires a lot less resources than

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.700 
requires a lot less resources than
version<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.309> version<00:00:14.340> two<00:00:14.820> required<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.299> cobweb

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
version to version two required a cobweb

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.650 
version to version two required a cobweb
but<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:17.039> one<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.430> can<00:00:17.460> build<00:00:17.789> right<00:00:18.270> after

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
but this one you can build right after

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.910 
but this one you can build right after
you<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.109> nether<00:00:19.320> all<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.590> need<00:00:19.770> is

alright<00:00:27.630> guys<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.080> let's<00:00:28.199> build<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> facing

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
alright guys so let's build it facing

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.980 
alright guys so let's build it facing
this<00:00:29.039> way<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.699> basically<00:00:30.570> you're<00:00:30.810> going<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this way so basically you're going to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.590 
this way so basically you're going to
start<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.579> seven<00:00:32.579> blocks<00:00:32.730> high<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.300> one

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
start out with seven blocks high so one

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.889 
start out with seven blocks high so one
two<00:00:34.020> three<00:00:34.530> four<00:00:34.829> five<00:00:35.130> six<00:00:35.190> seven<00:00:35.899> delete

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
two three four five six seven delete

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.860 
two three four five six seven delete
everything<00:00:37.200> under<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.940> come<00:00:39.840> down

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
everything under that and then come down

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.229 
everything under that and then come down
to<00:00:40.700> build<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.969> box<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.190> like<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
to build a box just like this with a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.490 
to build a box just like this with a
block<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> middle<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.539> same<00:00:49.469> thing

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
block not in the middle and same thing

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.580 
block not in the middle and same thing
up<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:51.270> put<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> glass<00:00:52.199> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
up here and then put the glass in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
up here and then put the glass in
between<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.570> your<00:00:54.719> little

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
between this is going to be your little

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.520 
between this is going to be your little
chicken<00:00:55.350> coop<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.230> once<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.500> that

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
chicken coop so once you have that

chicken coop so once you have that
you're<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> put<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> slab<00:00:59.460> underneath

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you're going to put a slab underneath

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.590 
you're going to put a slab underneath
and<00:01:01.579> it's<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.879> facing<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.359> way<00:01:03.420> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
and it's going to be facing this way so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
and it's going to be facing this way so
you're<00:01:03.870> going<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> put<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.379> dispenser<00:01:05.339> right

let's say you have that you're going to
put<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.890> repeater<00:02:40.890> facing<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.480> way<00:02:43.820> into

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
put a repeater facing this way into

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.010 
put a repeater facing this way into
another<00:02:45.090> block<00:02:45.390> which<00:02:46.320> goes<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:48.239> this

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
another block which goes to this

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.460 
another block which goes to this
repeater<00:02:49.410> right<00:02:49.620> here<00:02:49.770> also<00:02:50.010> on<00:02:50.400> full<00:02:50.640> delay

look<00:02:52.470> they're<00:02:52.650> both<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:52.950> for<00:02:53.160> delay<00:02:53.370> by<00:02:53.520> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
look they're both on for delay by the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.840 
look they're both on for delay by the
way<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.690> once<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.800> you're<00:02:56.700> going

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.599 
seeds out and let the chickens follow
you<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.020> you<00:04:16.109> find<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.770> once<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.310> get<00:04:17.430> two

you that you find and once you get two

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.550 
you that you find and once you get two
chickens<00:04:17.940> in<00:04:18.120> here<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.900> just<00:04:19.080> breed<00:04:19.410> them

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
chickens in here you just breed them

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.210 
chickens in here you just breed them
with<00:04:19.709> seeds

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
with seeds

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.000 
with seeds
and<00:04:20.370> you'll<00:04:20.579> get<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:21.150> want<00:04:21.329> about<00:04:21.390> I'd<00:04:21.810> say<00:04:22.010> 40

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
and you'll get you want about I'd say 40

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.580 
and you'll get you want about I'd say 40
to<00:04:23.550> 60<00:04:24.030> chickens<00:04:24.390> in<00:04:24.510> here<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:24.870> basically

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
to 60 chickens in here and basically

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.160 
to 60 chickens in here and basically
this<00:04:26.010> is<00:04:26.070> what<00:04:26.190> it's<00:04:26.400> going<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.610> do<00:04:27.170> you're

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
this is what it's going to do you're

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
this is what it's going to do you're
going<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.380> have<00:04:28.470> something<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.920> looks<00:04:28.950> like

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
going to have something that looks like

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.910 
going to have something that looks like
this<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.330> about<00:04:30.630> 60<00:04:31.110> chickens<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.620> believe

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
this this is about 60 chickens I believe

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.530 
this this is about 60 chickens I believe
and<00:04:32.720> every<00:04:33.720> time<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:34.430> one<00:04:35.430> lays<00:04:35.610> an<00:04:35.790> egg<00:04:35.940> it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
and every time you one lays an egg it

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.150 
and every time you one lays an egg it
will<00:04:36.840> come<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.560> dispenser<00:04:38.010> right

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
will come out of the dispenser right

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.000 
will come out of the dispenser right
here<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:38.700> I<00:04:38.730> have<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> clock<00:04:39.720> let's<00:04:40.590> see<00:04:40.740> if<00:04:40.830> we

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
here so I have a clock let's see if we

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.530 
here so I have a clock let's see if we
will<00:04:41.130> see<00:04:41.430> an<00:04:41.490> egg<00:04:41.670> pop<00:04:41.910> out<00:04:42.090> any<00:04:42.270> time<00:04:42.480> soon

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
will see an egg pop out any time soon

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.490 
will see an egg pop out any time soon
there<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.820> basically<00:04:45.510> once<00:04:46.020> they<00:04:46.320> lay

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
there it is so basically once they lay

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.980 
there it is so basically once they lay
an<00:04:46.620> egg<00:04:46.770> comes<00:04:47.670> into<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.060> dispenser<00:04:48.540> which

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
an egg comes into the dispenser which

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.810 
an egg comes into the dispenser which
sets<00:04:49.500> off<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.710> comparator<00:04:50.280> which<00:04:50.310> sets<00:04:50.670> off

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
sets off the comparator which sets off

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.420 
sets off the comparator which sets off
this<00:04:51.000> clock<00:04:51.300> shooting<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.140> help<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.830> then

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
this clock shooting it help and then

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.850 
this clock shooting it help and then
once<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:54.030> turns<00:04:54.210> nighttime<00:04:54.840> I'll<00:04:55.530> show<00:04:55.800> you

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
once it turns nighttime I'll show you

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.740 
once it turns nighttime I'll show you
what<00:04:56.010> happens<00:04:57.020> I'm<00:04:58.130> six<00:04:59.840> nineteen<00:05:01.310> thousand

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
what happens I'm six nineteen thousand

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.200 
what happens I'm six nineteen thousand
alright<00:05:03.750> as<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:03.960> can<00:05:04.110> see<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:05.550> day<00:05:05.700> licensure

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
alright as you can see the day licensure

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.140 
alright as you can see the day licensure
turns<00:05:06.420> off<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:07.490> basically<00:05:08.490> it's<00:05:08.760> on<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.910> night

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
turns off and basically it's on a night

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.290 
turns off and basically it's on a night
cycle<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:09.870> whenever<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.500> turns<00:05:10.710> back<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:10.950> day

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.000 

the<00:05:15.300> lava<00:05:15.540> will<00:05:15.810> burn<00:05:16.050> all<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.620> adult

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
the lava will burn all the adult

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.800 
the lava will burn all the adult
chickens<00:05:17.460> and<00:05:17.669> what<00:05:17.820> is<00:05:17.940> amazing<00:05:18.240> about<00:05:18.540> the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
chickens and what is amazing about the

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.510 
chickens and what is amazing about the
system<00:05:19.200> as<00:05:19.350> it<00:05:19.380> leaves<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.919> baby<00:05:20.100> wants<00:05:20.340> to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
system as it leaves the baby wants to

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.850 
system as it leaves the baby wants to
still<00:05:20.820> grow<00:05:21.060> so<00:05:21.510> everything<00:05:22.140> you<00:05:22.230> get<00:05:22.410> will

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
still grow so everything you get will

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.990 
still grow so everything you get will
come<00:05:23.220> into<00:05:23.490> here<00:05:23.850> and<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:26.520> coolest<00:05:26.850> thing

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
come into here and the coolest thing

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.250 
come into here and the coolest thing
about<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.300> system<00:05:27.600> is<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:27.810> don't<00:05:27.870> have<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.140> do

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
about the system is you don't have to do

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.980 
about the system is you don't have to do
anything<00:05:28.500> you<00:05:28.890> just<00:05:29.419> lead<00:05:30.419> this<00:05:30.600> by<00:05:30.810> your

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
anything you just lead this by your

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.230 
anything you just lead this by your
house<00:05:31.169> and<00:05:31.530> you<00:05:31.770> will<00:05:31.950> have<00:05:32.100> food<00:05:32.460> forever<00:05:32.790> I

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
use it all the time it is very efficient

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.180 
use it all the time it is very efficient
I<00:05:36.000> made<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:36.720> system<00:05:37.169> I've<00:05:37.440> never<00:05:37.740> seen<00:05:37.890> this

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
I made this system I've never seen this

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.110 
I made this system I've never seen this
before<00:05:38.250> um<00:05:40.100> it<00:05:41.100> took<00:05:41.490> me<00:05:41.640> a<00:05:41.669> while<00:05:41.820> to<00:05:41.880> figure

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
before um it took me a while to figure

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.030 
before um it took me a while to figure
out<00:05:42.300> how<00:05:42.390> to<00:05:42.479> build<00:05:42.870> this<00:05:43.110> even<00:05:43.860> though<00:05:44.010> it

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
out how to build this even though it

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.900 
out how to build this even though it
looks<00:05:44.160> super<00:05:44.820> simple<00:05:45.450> but<00:05:46.410> um<00:05:46.620> yeah<00:05:47.340> so<00:05:47.640> I

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
looks super simple but um yeah so I

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.020 
looks super simple but um yeah so I
don't<00:05:48.510> believe<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:49.890> took<00:05:50.430> this<00:05:50.580> from<00:05:50.760> every

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
don't believe I took this from every

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.170 
don't believe I took this from every
anybody<00:05:51.630> believe<00:05:52.229> this<00:05:52.380> is<00:05:52.530> my<00:05:52.680> idea<00:05:53.040> but<00:05:53.940> yeah

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
anybody believe this is my idea but yeah

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.000 
anybody believe this is my idea but yeah

literally a you will never have to go

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.659 
literally a you will never have to go
find<00:06:03.210> food<00:06:03.479> again<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:03.990> survival<00:06:04.580> this<00:06:05.580> is

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
find food again and survival this is

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.490 
find food again and survival this is
probably<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.540> first<00:06:06.780> thing<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.080> build<00:06:07.350> in

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
probably the the first thing I build in

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.000 
probably the the first thing I build in
survival<00:06:07.950> and<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.640> works<00:06:08.820> really<00:06:08.970> well<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:10.010> if

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
survival and it works really well and if

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.260 
survival and it works really well and if
you<00:06:11.130> guys<00:06:11.250> appreciate<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:11.880> please<00:06:11.910> give<00:06:12.180> me<00:06:12.240> a
