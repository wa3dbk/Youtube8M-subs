00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:59.329
 This package is first what it all there 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:03.950
 on the one hand there is the hiking book 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:06.019
 you can not see it here now but that 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.359

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:15.530
 Comrades then here is something 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.569
 pile up and yes I can not do that 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.799
 Describe that is actually the must 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.829
 you see yourself and I show you that 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:28.910
 in my gameplay video because there too 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:34.099
 Twelve pages in here are good 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:45.549
 does not handle the book bad then 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:50.120
 have 2 disc box fur in here once 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:52.870
 and I do not really know what that is 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.250
 here is the review disc on it 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.699
 special book I have to again exactly 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.150
 look 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:04.150
 I can not say that exactly 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:10.989
 how many are the two games and then 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.989
 here we have the 3 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.530
 usb 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.410
 are 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:27.919
 and of course strictly from the wrist strap 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:33.300
 and once again the move controller 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:35.330
 so that has been there even more than 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.330
 enough 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.500
 yes that's the offer that's now 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.540
 is it out? 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.310
 and as I said, if you do not 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.940
 expect what you can do with it 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.530
 you can just go to youtube 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.200

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.510
