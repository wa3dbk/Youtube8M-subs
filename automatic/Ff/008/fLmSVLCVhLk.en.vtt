like reinstall the game itself and I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200 
like reinstall the game itself and I
would<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.590> sometimes<00:00:44.010> ten<00:00:44.280> times<00:00:44.579> until

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
would do that sometimes ten times until

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.720 
would do that sometimes ten times until
I<00:00:45.450> could<00:00:45.629> finally<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.440> past<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
I could finally get past that a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.779 
I could finally get past that a
consistent<00:00:48.629> freezing<00:00:49.020> point<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.760> you<00:00:50.760> know

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
consistent freezing point but you know

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.689 
consistent freezing point but you know
just<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.600> little<00:00:51.750> bit<00:00:51.960> later<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.489> same

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
just a little bit later is the same

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.920 
just a little bit later is the same
thing<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.000> happen<00:00:54.030> again<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> I'll<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.719> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
