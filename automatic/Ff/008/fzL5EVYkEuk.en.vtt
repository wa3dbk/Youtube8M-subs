00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.349
 a star specialty from waiblingen 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.770
 sushi ginger yoghurt christie's and soy 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:23.360
 sauce a char is created I catch 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.360
 times as to that I take the head 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:31.279
 and then I just see that way up here 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.800
 Not by the way and the speech in London 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.790
 and then the abdomen kick off and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.160
 Make sure that I am very careful 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.770
 the building equipment orientate on the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 baby is not so much about it now 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.550
 that you make great sections 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.200
 I could already understand myself 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.630
 that makes you last forever 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.300
 The fish should be as fresh as possible 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.400
 be that you can control yourself if 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.579
 So you can serve the fish at home 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.670
 would let say tee off from 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.890
 fishmonger two to three days at zero 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.630
 Gradually let it rest and then go 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.360
 the bones also totally out and easy 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.360
 the full aroma of the fresh fish's is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.710
 So here I have taken out 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.299
 and now I'm taking that coat over the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.600
 ears crisis because they cut the skin off and on 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.790
 start at the back of the tail and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.360
 pull it underneath and now I have that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 finished 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.940
 I'll show you I'll cut you 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.290
 there you could help me there 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.270
 could you ever turn one 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.670
 even if the recipe has been around for a long time 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 there is also a christian jürgens must 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.420
 every now and again we improvise 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.610
 products work coming from the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.290
 nature and they are not always from 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.299
 consistent quality because that's it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.610
 does not work and therefore you have to constantly 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.869
 try and taste and try 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 and deal with it 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.229
 but that's a great pity there 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.150
 We can not go to the soy sauce now 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.200
 Therefore do not give up bad 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.319
 if you can do such things yes 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.859
 combine 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.049
 If I call this number , that is 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:19.090
 a very special soy sauce is one 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:21.639
 temarii soya vegetables and that's it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.540
 sets maßstäbe we the thing that was so 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:26.769
 yes my church call it even if it is 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.590
 I'm forgiven by others 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.109
 automarken the porsche sauce yes that is 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.370
 the hammer under the soya sauce then 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:38.439
 here we have a tonsure sauce and me 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.329
 also give a normal soja 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.659
 So then and then finally one 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.310
 little lemon and maxi try yes 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.930
 absolutely so now the marinade is me 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.340
 I tasted it tasted like me 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.930
 have now no salt pure forest 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.030
 in that the soy sauces taste so 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.540
 are they 17 do not need salt and max 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.889
 that fresh from simone or me 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:04.410
 have lemon really great out for 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:06.660
 next highlight yogurt rounded 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.200
 it's the same with the yogurt truffle 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.860
 that's where the products are again 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.480
 have merged to the Char 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.560
 So yes yogurt sour frame 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.440
 Buttermilk and now we have the good ones 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.330
 cooled and win very beautiful 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.860
 An aroma game in which you just that 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.980
 Mix together a little salt 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.510
 sugar lemon limes abrasion and then 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.310
 you inject that in and through this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.170
 effect that one then dried these 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.430
 yogurt christie's outside it gets 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.440
 you something that you can do relatively easily 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.120
 can produce and a great effect 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.140
 for our guests has that this human 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.150
 I have never eaten anything 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 so I believe it is enough now but 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.630
 diligently yes, of course you set 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.490
 you do the freezer and then 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.990
 We place here the same going okay the 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.970
 yogurt truffles I have so too 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.440
 not yet made that reminded me 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.270
 a little bit of the Christmas chocolates 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.400
 and I am very curious how the 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.510
 I also made beautiful makeup 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.680
 just found a few yes 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.810
 perfect then we can now here 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.030
 do the same so I have now 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.950
 here's something in the bottle I have 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.350
 Grapes meant for the grapes 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.910
 got horseradish underneath 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.760
 climbed while being careful 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.940
 puree that the grapes that the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.110
 Do not break it and go with it 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.450
 horseradish slimmed down so 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.880
 I make some points here 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.910
 salt lemon and sugar also a bit 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.440
 You take away so much now 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.110
 they bring it to the right and left 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.710
 through the marinade and I play like this 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.020
 a bit of 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.490
 He has the stone we take too 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.150
 really actually in the restaurant too 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.390
 cause 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.820
 It keeps it pretty cool 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.410
 I have a bit before synonymous 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.430
 properly located in the fridge and 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.430
 Cool the right one 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.530
 also on the plate but do that 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.380
 problem is if you have a chilled 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.510
 Plates down and out of the fridge 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.340
 brings the cheering will always protect 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.500
 true but the stone Switzerland pays even 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.390
 nothing that is the great thing about this 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.150
 stone that dani if ​​you only one 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.000
 cool that dani then somehow that way 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.950
 this water condenses on it 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.590
 we still have a little bit off 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.990
 garnished and completely without the original 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.360
 Ingredients in chemistry do not come from 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.479
 but I have here is the green so 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.070
 caviar from the green flying fish 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.920
 an endangered with wasabi 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.690
 yes and now we'll put it up there 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.910
 on it still on it here I have too 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.910
 a really original thing was so bad 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.650
 this is a pickled ginger man 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.540
 Of course not the horse from behind 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.130
 Two years so important is not that 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.840
 you staged something great, which is good 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.490
 looks and the gimmicky there 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.350
 probably not but that must make sense 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.450
 primarily is the taste if 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.250
 you have a dish that tastes great 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.510
 then you can think about it 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.000
 how can you do it well in scene 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.860
 put and what makes you are one 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.200
 put infant in scene 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.960
 fillet and turn into rolls 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.180
 a marinade of the best soy sauces 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.770
 Stir and yogurt in truffle form 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.750
 bring 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.750
 star cuisine once around block and up close 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.770
 a 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.890
 the infant chemistry on the stone that 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.990
 was the Oberhammer who raised that 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.610
 Interaction of the temperatures with 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.010
 the yogurt praline tea so I am 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.930
 be thrilled eat on the 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.370
 I have not had that level before 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.930
 so I am always eaten 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.930
 still totally excited
