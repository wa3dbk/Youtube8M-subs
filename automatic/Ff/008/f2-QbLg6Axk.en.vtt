00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.690
 for the restlessness that he had of good 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.780
 it's not good complicated 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.489
 print reports and mónica the only thing that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.489
 you have to do is configure 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.660
 the part 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.110
 of the mónica printer which is not 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.570
 so hard for that we 're going to 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.300
 parameters in parameters we are going to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.850
 general in general we are going to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.210
 document format or that I explain to you 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210
 something 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.230
 before 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.300
 and do the document configuration 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.160
 with the printer now I know that the first thing 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.310
 what you have to do is install the 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.460
 printer either through network or already 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 be a local printer connected to your 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850
 Own team 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.400
 for that once we have the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.150
 local printer connected to it 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.200
 team have to go to the part where 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.610
 there is the stand tab 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.149
 and for each of the documents they have 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 to go configuring the printer that 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:55.580
 I explain if I want to print 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.120
 kardex good I select kardec sound 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.480
 selected the type of format since 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.110
 I want it to print and we go to the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.140
 part of the printer and we select the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.960
 printer either that which they have 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.790
 connected in a network or the one that has 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.290
 connected locally in this case I the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.080
 that I have connected in network I do not use it 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.830
 because I have my printer connected 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.290
 locally then by each of the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.780
 documents either quote deposits 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.209
 Estimated account states account 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.920
 invoices receipts for each and every one of 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.430
 they have to go to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.690
 select the printer so that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.050
 time to print the document 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.610
 The serial order is sent directly to 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.620
 what is the computer of 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.569
 architecture in mónica 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.109
 for example 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.109
 and 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:59.820
 a quote I believe here 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.820
 already this quote I configure it 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.700
 and there we see what preliminary invites but 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.130
 before that you said that to the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:16.040
 printer is predefined printer 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.000
 epson l 2 200 series already then either 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.740
 the printer that you have 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.140
 configured will appear in the 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.210
 part where it says printer and they 're not going to 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.120
 have no problem with respect 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.540
 to the printing of reports on what is 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.540
 Monica
