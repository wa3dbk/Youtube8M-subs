what is the major reason for my early
success<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:39.169> do<00:04:39.350> believe<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:39.980> that

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
success and I really do believe is that

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.600 
success and I really do believe is that
I<00:04:40.580> had<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.389> unique<00:04:42.110> style

I<00:04:43.639> could<00:04:44.450> put<00:04:44.690> things<00:04:44.840> into<00:04:45.139> repeat<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.919> there

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
I could put things into repeat and there

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.760 
I could put things into repeat and there
was<00:04:46.580> definitely<00:04:46.790> a<00:04:47.120> need<00:04:47.330> for<00:04:48.050> coastal

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
was definitely a need for coastal

marketplace so all those three things
together<00:04:54.370> really<00:04:55.370> made<00:04:55.700> for<00:04:55.940> an<00:04:56.000> early

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
together really made for an early

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.180 
together really made for an early
success<00:04:56.480> that<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:57.110> was<00:04:57.530> able<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.800> build<00:04:57.980> my
