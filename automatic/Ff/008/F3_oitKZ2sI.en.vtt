was the river and that's a sight to
behold<00:05:24.650> because<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.370> eats<00:05:25.610> itself<00:05:26.060> it's<00:05:26.629> got<00:05:26.900> a

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
behold because it eats itself it's got a

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.550 
behold because it eats itself it's got a
rolling<00:05:27.500> motion<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:28.129> goes<00:05:28.370> like<00:05:28.669> that<00:05:28.970> and

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
rolling motion that goes like that and

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.550 
rolling motion that goes like that and
it's<00:05:30.560> probably<00:05:31.370> 20<00:05:32.090> feet<00:05:32.240> high<00:05:32.289> then<00:05:33.289> he<00:05:33.379> gets

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
it's probably 20 feet high then he gets

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.040 
it's probably 20 feet high then he gets
to<00:05:33.650> 30-foot<00:05:34.220> high<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.849> then<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.449> just<00:05:35.479> spreads

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
to 30-foot high and then it just spreads

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.689
