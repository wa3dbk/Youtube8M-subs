partial<00:02:43.349> just<00:02:44.099> shut<00:02:44.250> up<00:02:44.370> jack<00:02:44.610> but<00:02:45.209> basically

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
partial just shut up jack but basically

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.479 
partial just shut up jack but basically
both<00:02:46.560> these<00:02:46.739> teams<00:02:46.920> starting<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> bottom

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
both these teams starting the bottom

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.800 
both these teams starting the bottom
division<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.090> they're<00:02:48.180> probably<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.599> best

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
division and they're probably the best

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.030 
division and they're probably the best
two<00:02:49.049> teams<00:02:49.220> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:51.049> 5th<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.290> 4th<00:02:52.440> divisions

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
two teams in the 5th and 4th divisions

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.559 
two teams in the 5th and 4th divisions
I'd<00:02:53.190> say<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.879> you<00:02:53.970> should<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.209> able<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.480> get

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
I'd say so you should be able to get

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.059 
I'd say so you should be able to get
promotion<00:02:55.019> pretty<00:02:55.230> easily<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.709> first<00:02:55.920> two

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
promotion pretty easily the first two

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.009 
promotion pretty easily the first two
years<00:02:56.099> but<00:02:57.030> these<00:02:57.120> two<00:02:57.329> teams<00:02:57.599> are<00:02:57.750> really

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
years but these two teams are really

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.990 
years but these two teams are really
kind<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.290> competitive<00:02:58.709> teams<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.879> they're

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
kind of competitive teams but they're

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.910 
kind of competitive teams but they're
programmed<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.569> as<00:03:00.690> local<00:03:01.049> rivals<00:03:01.440> they<00:03:01.829> have

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
programmed in as local rivals they have

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.380 
programmed in as local rivals they have
slightly<00:03:02.190> more<00:03:02.310> money<00:03:02.609> than<00:03:02.790> other<00:03:02.940> clubs<00:03:03.209> and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
slightly more money than other clubs and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.490 
slightly more money than other clubs and
they're<00:03:03.510> probably<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.840> best<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.379> do<00:03:04.470> a

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
they're probably the best to to do a

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.960 
they're probably the best to to do a
play<00:03:04.769> through<00:03:05.040> with<00:03:05.220> if<00:03:05.400> going<00:03:05.640> from<00:03:05.879> the

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
play through with if going from the

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.580 
play through with if going from the
depths<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.420> non-league<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.170> top<00:03:07.379> division

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
depths of non-league to the top division

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.970 
depths of non-league to the top division
is<00:03:07.829> your<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.129> of<00:03:08.250> thing<00:03:08.599> so<00:03:09.799> I'm<00:03:10.799> going<00:03:10.950> to
