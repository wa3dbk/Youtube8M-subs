00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.430 
Dam of course and this is the result
when<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:18.989> was<00:04:19.320> here<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.650> 61<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:21.690> was<00:04:21.930> all<00:04:22.140> woods

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
when I was here in 61 this was all woods

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.800 
when I was here in 61 this was all woods
and

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.540 
and
we<00:04:24.350> would<00:04:24.530> come<00:04:24.710> out<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.010> swim<00:04:25.280> in<00:04:25.430> the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
we would come out and swim in the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.400 
we would come out and swim in the
springs<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.210> we'd<00:04:26.330> get<00:04:26.510> in<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.780> canoe<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.139> it

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
springs and we'd get in the canoe and it

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.070 
springs and we'd get in the canoe and it
was<00:04:27.500> quite<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> paddle<00:04:28.570> through<00:04:29.570> these<00:04:29.780> woods

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
was quite a paddle through these woods

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.100 
was quite a paddle through these woods
dense<00:04:30.770> cypress<00:04:31.280> woods<00:04:31.520> until<00:04:32.450> we<00:04:32.720> get<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:33.020> the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
dense cypress woods until we get to the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.640 
dense cypress woods until we get to the
Oklahoma<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:35.570> as<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.870> can<00:04:35.960> see<00:04:36.020> now<00:04:36.350> it's

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
Oklahoma and as you can see now it's

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.879 
Oklahoma and as you can see now it's
it's<00:04:37.040> more<00:04:37.340> or<00:04:37.430> less<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:38.150> Cypress<00:04:38.889> graveyard

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
it's more or less a Cypress graveyard

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.060 
it's more or less a Cypress graveyard
just<00:04:40.790> kind<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.150> white<00:04:41.560> skeletal<00:04:42.560> remains<00:04:42.680> of

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
just kind of white skeletal remains of

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.409 
just kind of white skeletal remains of
the<00:04:43.160> Cypress<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:45.580> that's<00:04:46.580> about<00:04:46.730> it<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.210> is

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
the Cypress and that's about it this is

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.379 
the Cypress and that's about it this is
what<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.290> Oklahoma

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
what the Oklahoma

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.020 
what the Oklahoma
during<00:04:50.389> your<00:04:50.510> drawdown<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:51.290> hopefully

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
during your drawdown and hopefully

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.770 
during your drawdown and hopefully
someday<00:04:53.200> it'll<00:04:54.200> be<00:04:54.260> restored
