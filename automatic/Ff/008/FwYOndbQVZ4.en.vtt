you can see on my computer here they are
coloring<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.480> plane<00:04:02.690> around<00:04:02.720> them<00:04:04.420> really

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
coloring the plane around them really

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.500 
coloring the plane around them really
neat<00:04:05.569> trick<00:04:05.840> okay<00:04:06.200> mines<00:04:06.470> down<00:04:06.709> here<00:04:07.180> if<00:04:08.180> i<00:04:08.390> go

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
neat trick okay mines down here if i go

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.180 
neat trick okay mines down here if i go
ahead<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.810> hit<00:04:08.900> replace<00:04:09.530> mesh<00:04:09.799> this<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.099> the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
ahead and hit replace mesh this is the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.740 
ahead and hit replace mesh this is the
important<00:04:10.549> part<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.970> took<00:04:11.269> me<00:04:11.390> forever<00:04:11.599> to

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
important part it took me forever to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.110 
important part it took me forever to
figure<00:04:11.959> out<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.549> there<00:04:13.549> was<00:04:13.670> like<00:04:13.849> one

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
figure out and there was like one

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.330 
figure out and there was like one
tutorial<00:04:14.390> online<00:04:14.750> about<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.379> and<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.829> really

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
tutorial online about it and it really

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.699 
tutorial online about it and it really
sucked<00:04:16.669> all<00:04:17.449> you<00:04:17.600> do<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.900> every<00:04:18.139> play<00:04:18.289> smash<00:04:18.530> if

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
sucked all you do is every play smash if

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.870 
sucked all you do is every play smash if
you<00:04:18.829> render<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.160> without<00:04:19.340> hitting<00:04:19.549> replace

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
you render it without hitting replace

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.450 
you render it without hitting replace
mesh<00:04:20.120> nothing<00:04:20.900> will<00:04:21.049> happen<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:22.250> will<00:04:22.340> be

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
mesh nothing will happen and you will be

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.689 
mesh nothing will happen and you will be
very<00:04:22.639> irritated<00:04:23.270> hit<00:04:23.990> replace<00:04:24.410> mesh<00:04:24.740> okay<00:04:25.160> and

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
very irritated hit replace mesh okay and

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.490 
very irritated hit replace mesh okay and
then<00:04:25.850> go<00:04:26.000> ahead<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.479> hit<00:04:26.750> render<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:29.229> as<00:04:30.229> you

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
then go ahead and hit render and as you

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.420 
then go ahead and hit render and as you
can<00:04:30.620> see<00:04:30.669> this<00:04:31.669> is<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.910> horrible<00:04:32.090> example

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
can see this is a horrible example

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.360 
can see this is a horrible example
because<00:04:34.430> it's<00:04:34.669> like<00:04:34.910> making<00:04:35.300> white<00:04:35.630> light<00:04:36.370> as

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
because it's like making white light as

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.810 
because it's like making white light as
you<00:04:37.430> can<00:04:37.639> see<00:04:37.820> though<00:04:38.260> their<00:04:39.550> cubes<00:04:40.550> are

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
you can see though their cubes are

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.520 
you can see though their cubes are
admitting<00:04:41.150> light<00:04:41.330> one<00:04:42.229> way<00:04:42.380> you<00:04:42.440> can<00:04:42.620> kind<00:04:43.220> of

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
admitting light one way you can kind of

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.250 
admitting light one way you can kind of
do<00:04:45.530> this<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:45.919> delete<00:04:46.310> your<00:04:46.460> lamp<00:04:46.639> try<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.389> if

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
do this is delete your lamp try that if

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.650 
do this is delete your lamp try that if
you<00:04:48.349> delete<00:04:48.590> your<00:04:48.620> lamp<00:04:48.950> and<00:04:49.510> there<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.630> go

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
you delete your lamp and there you go

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.629 
you delete your lamp and there you go

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
kind of personifies it a little bit

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.529 
kind of personifies it a little bit
there<00:04:52.880> but<00:04:53.750> that's<00:04:53.870> basic<00:04:54.349> radiosity<00:04:55.419> you<00:04:56.419> can

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
there but that's basic radiosity you can

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:57.790 
there but that's basic radiosity you can
do<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.660> bunch<00:04:56.900> of<00:04:56.960> different<00:04:57.229> neat<00:04:57.320> tricks<00:04:57.590> with

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
it between the time so something should

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.820 
it between the time so something should
think<00:05:58.550> about<00:05:58.750> but<00:05:59.750> what<00:06:00.200> I<00:06:00.230> did<00:06:00.440> was<00:06:00.590> I<00:06:00.620> hit
