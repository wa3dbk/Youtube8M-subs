would<00:01:48.899> recommend<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.030> were<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.390> rate

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
would recommend it it if I were to rate

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.560 
would recommend it it if I were to rate
it<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.869> would<00:01:52.049> probably<00:01:52.590> write<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.070> 10<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.149> 10

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
