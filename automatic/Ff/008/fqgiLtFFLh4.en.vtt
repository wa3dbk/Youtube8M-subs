00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 according to the road police 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.040
 one of the major causes of 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.990
 paranÃ¡ accidents is precisely when 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 the motorcyclists will braking 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.280
 and motorcycle brake and then the problem is 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.070
 tires are already worn with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 where life already completed and carries a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 big problem because the tire is the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.020
 end up giving is causing accidents in the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 bomb 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.410
 exactly then I always ask 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.750
 how to identify if your tire is still 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 has or can not be used 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.450
 Who said your tire is in good condition? 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.829
 is the marking that the manufacturer makes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.140
 of tw and tw is the maximum wear index 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.450
 tire then what happens we go 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 and observing the tire exists on the side 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.140
 him a little triangle informing where 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.520
 is that tw and when your tire starts to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.820
 Turn and sugar it comes in this tw 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.550
 and tw which is a small elevation that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 It is the center of your home that tells 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.989
 sugar minimum gem which will be your 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.700
 and minimum so that this tire rod 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.400
 so when wear start aaa 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.250
 when wear reaches that mark 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.900
 It's time to change the tire shock with 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.939
 motorcycle that has been paralyzed has 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.009
 good opinion to have a bad tire what 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.500
 indicates that this tire okay bruno one 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.740
 good first we'll note here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 this one here this mark indicates where 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.579
 is the tire twr a marking of the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 manufacturer 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.189
 so I 'm going to get the treadmill 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.400
 tire and I'll watch you look at this 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.799
 that we have here when the tire 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.350
 start running and start spending that 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.509
 means that the time has come for 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.659
 change that tire so I have both 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.350
 here as well as sugar in your home in 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.079
 central here look i got it again 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.590
 that right then if your tire 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.590
 began to wear and wear 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.000
 arrived at this mark is the moment of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.189
 you make the exchange 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.459
 we will observe the other tire that is 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.530
 same as here and it has passed the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.290
 talk time back now in the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.500
 rear tire of this motorcycle 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.230
 honda cg titan 150 the front is good 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.329
 this one not okay right so I will bruno 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.359
 look here it looks like we have the pw and 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.030
 here's right then we're going to watch the band 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.549
 at that point 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.579
 notes that the central marking here 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.519
 the tire no longer has 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.980
 so what happened he has is what he looks at 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.439
 he has the irt work of marking 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.040
 but he has completely lost 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:45.650
 central sugar that has already been rotated 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.889
 Spent already lost sugar already this tire 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.459
 here it should be changed because it 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:55.310
 this tire he has spent so much sugar gem 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.859
 center and almost missed the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.049
 because this tire is running here with 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.720
 an excessive calibration 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.239
 he is very full so he spends the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.209
 the center of the tread and instead of 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.659
 spend the tread is in a way 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.090
 more complete or location remembered y 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.000
 that default image does not exist 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.549
 more or less is you have to use aa 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.829
 right calibration 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.659
 in this case here he is using the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.040
 calibration greater than the calibration 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.040
 ideal tire 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.229
 then what happens there is only wear and tear 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.329
 in the central part of the tread 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:35.750
 now why be dangerous bruno says 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.060
 so with the tire worn because in a rain 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.150
 for example sure you will not tire 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.269
 will not be able to run the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.569
 water he will not be able to keep a 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.379
 contact with asphalt there accidents 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.109
 are inevitable 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.159
 It certainly increases the 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.169
 probability of an accident 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.840
 with that motorcycle that's right to 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.840
 We thank Bruno prf we 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.299
 explained there explained the viewer 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.699
 about knowing if the tire has already lost 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.500
 the life or not the images are 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.459
