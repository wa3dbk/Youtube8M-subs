00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and it's only really recently that I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.859 
and it's only really recently that I
felt<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> games<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.130> really

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
felt that the games have really

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
felt that the games have really
definitely<00:01:39.869> justified<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:40.650> purchase<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.369> took

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
definitely justified my purchase it took

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.520 
definitely justified my purchase it took
a<00:01:41.640> while<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.030> finally<00:01:42.119> got<00:01:42.420> there<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.899> think

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
a while but we finally got there I think

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.310 
a while but we finally got there I think
maybe<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.979> tide<00:01:44.220> turned<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:45.200> medgar<00:01:46.200> saw

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
maybe the tide turned when medgar saw

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.480 
maybe the tide turned when medgar saw
Ground<00:01:46.560> zeroes<00:01:46.860> came<00:01:47.009> out<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.460> really

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
Ground zeroes came out because I really

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.399 
Ground zeroes came out because I really
enjoyed<00:01:47.880> playing<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
enjoyed playing that and I got to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
quite strongly about the PlayStation 4

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.599 
quite strongly about the PlayStation 4
like<00:03:46.139> I<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.560> love<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.859> interface<00:03:47.400> it's

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.750 
like I just I love the interface it's
very<00:03:47.790> slick<00:03:48.150> it's<00:03:48.329> very<00:03:48.450> clean<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:49.769> like<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.579> I

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
very slick it's very clean I like that I

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.879 
very slick it's very clean I like that I
can<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.480> know<00:03:51.510> put<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.959> game<00:03:52.169> in<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.739> the

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
can just you know put a game in and the

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.979 
can just you know put a game in and the
install<00:03:53.280> doesn't<00:03:53.579> take<00:03:53.730> forever<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.840> can

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989

just<00:03:55.079> stop<00:03:55.230> playing<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:55.919> I<00:03:55.950> guess<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.310> best

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
just stop playing so I guess the best

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.170 
just stop playing so I guess the best
thing<00:03:56.700> about<00:03:57.260> having<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.590> ps4<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.790> having

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
thing about having a ps4 is not having

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.110 
thing about having a ps4 is not having
to<00:04:00.299> use<00:04:00.569> an<00:04:00.810> Xbox<00:04:01.200> one<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:02.190> know<00:04:02.549> I'm<00:04:03.000> gonna

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
get a lot of flack for that but the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.729 
get a lot of flack for that but the
whole<00:04:04.769> experience<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:07.019> much<00:04:07.230> nicer

have in the office just over here so
I've<00:04:34.600> kind<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.380> actually<00:04:35.710> played<00:04:35.949> through

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
I've kind of actually played through

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.909 
I've kind of actually played through
everything<00:04:36.430> that's<00:04:36.729> out<00:04:37.139> in<00:04:38.139> the<00:04:38.199> office<00:04:38.440> and

again<00:04:41.490> yes<00:04:42.520> see<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.360> think<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:44.440> first<00:04:44.620> year<00:04:44.740> of

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
again yes see I think the first year of

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.140 
again yes see I think the first year of
the<00:04:44.889> PlayStation<00:04:45.340> 4<00:04:45.370> has<00:04:45.639> been<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.789> little<00:04:46.060> bit

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
the PlayStation 4 has been a little bit

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.580 
the PlayStation 4 has been a little bit
underwhelming<00:04:46.720> there<00:04:46.960> hasn't<00:04:47.110> really<00:04:47.260> been<00:04:47.470> a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
underwhelming there hasn't really been a

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.620 
underwhelming there hasn't really been a
major<00:04:47.830> must-have<00:04:48.610> game<00:04:48.850> for<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.210> system

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
major must-have game for the system

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.650 
major must-have game for the system
there's<00:04:49.840> been<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:49.990> few<00:04:50.320> re-releases<00:04:50.919> and

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
there's been a few re-releases and

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.409

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
remasters but there's nothing really

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.629 
remasters but there's nothing really
that's<00:04:55.419> there<00:04:55.720> on<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.620> makes<00:04:56.800> me<00:04:56.889> want<00:04:57.550> to
