00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.940
Let's start choosing one of the 30 available levels

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.840
The goal is to bring each cube to his own coloured target

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.460
To do that, stand on the cube, point a direction and then look straight down! the cube will move in a straight line

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.620
When there isn't any cube left, you completed the level

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.640
The cubes will also follow directions suggested by pistons

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:44.960
Teleporters are teleporters

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.980
The minigame also has a level editor

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.780
The command blocks will be replaced with what their name says, so pay attention to the height you place them

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.060
Don't exaggerate with the editor! Unpleasant situations may happen...

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.240
No explanation this time, I'm sorry! If you want to learn more... try reading these commands
