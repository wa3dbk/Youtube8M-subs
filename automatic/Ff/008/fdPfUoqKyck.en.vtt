00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
breakthrough we will refrain from being

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
breakthrough we will refrain from being
too<00:00:25.859> precise<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.820> time<00:00:27.060> events<00:00:27.750> will<00:00:27.810> be

why we do not simply take over matters
but<00:05:28.000> we<00:05:28.120> have<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.479> say<00:05:28.660> that<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.169> impossible

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
but we have to say that it is impossible

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.490 
but we have to say that it is impossible
unless<00:05:29.889> we<00:05:30.280> are<00:05:30.430> given<00:05:30.789> divine<00:05:31.090> authority<00:05:31.500> we

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
unless we are given divine authority we

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.260 
unless we are given divine authority we
have<00:05:32.650> often<00:05:32.860> mentioned<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.490> we<00:05:33.669> are<00:05:33.820> careful

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
have often mentioned that we are careful

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.570 
have often mentioned that we are careful
not<00:05:34.449> to<00:05:34.720> interfere<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.440> that<00:05:35.919> is<00:05:36.160> because

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
not to interfere and that is because

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.779 
not to interfere and that is because
duality<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.389> an<00:05:37.539> experiment<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:39.130> aim<00:05:39.280> was<00:05:39.610> to

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
duality is an experiment the aim was to

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.310 
duality is an experiment the aim was to
find<00:05:40.060> out<00:05:40.240> what<00:05:40.510> you<00:05:40.630> would<00:05:40.780> do<00:05:40.960> if<00:05:41.169> you<00:05:41.199> were

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
find out what you would do if you were

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.100 
find out what you would do if you were
separated<00:05:42.130> from<00:05:42.310> God<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.910> each<00:05:43.419> and<00:05:43.690> very<00:05:43.900> one

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
separated from God and each and very one

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.159 
separated from God and each and very one
of<00:05:44.320> you<00:05:44.470> volunteered<00:05:45.099> to<00:05:45.250> take<00:05:45.430> part<00:05:46.169> the

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
of you volunteered to take part the

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.110 
of you volunteered to take part the
reward<00:05:47.560> for<00:05:47.650> you<00:05:48.039> was<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.340> experience<00:05:49.060> that

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
reward for you was the experience that

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.180 
reward for you was the experience that
you<00:05:49.419> would<00:05:49.570> gain<00:05:49.840> that<00:05:50.289> would<00:05:50.560> speed<00:05:50.860> up<00:05:50.919> your

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
you would gain that would speed up your

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.100 
you would gain that would speed up your
evolution<00:05:51.820> beyond<00:05:52.180> anything<00:05:52.539> in<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:52.870> normal

evolution beyond anything in a normal

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.010 
evolution beyond anything in a normal
way<00:05:53.349> that<00:05:54.310> meant<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:54.760> had<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.000> be<00:05:55.240> responsible

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
way that meant you had to be responsible

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.990 
way that meant you had to be responsible
for<00:05:56.229> your<00:05:56.260> actions<00:05:56.590> so<00:05:57.400> it<00:05:57.550> would<00:05:57.729> have<00:05:57.760> been

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
for your actions so it would have been
