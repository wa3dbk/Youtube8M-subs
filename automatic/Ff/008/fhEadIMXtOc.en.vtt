00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.230
 bathroom 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.890
 here we all broke down 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:54.190
 let's start take the butterdish and lubricate this one 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.670
 their thing called the mixer so here 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.709
 we rather smeared it with a mixer hose 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.700
 so and now we take a sponge and remove 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.680
 all the docks dirt that has accumulated you 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.630
 so and he we still have a turning mechanism 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.850
 on the tap he also rusted 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.480
 further we have worn out 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.780
 the hose itself was worn out too 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:24.130
 my tape tape here too 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.520
 do the most personally we take an adjustable wrench 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.790
 with you and what we do to him that there 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.670
 we can unscrew but the tap with us 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.880
 Faucet crackles we witness the swing 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.380
 key remove round 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.600
 and wait until we bring a new crane with 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.040
 warehouse 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.960
 great guys have done everything now 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.310
 check if the water is running and no 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.310
 tighten it intelligently with a wrench 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.750
 account super water everything runs all possible 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:09.450
 wash you can safely wash 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:15.930
 so we continue fixes I do not see 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:20.459
 I read the spider at us is constantly hiding 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.080
 him trying to get in he hides behind 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.080
 mirror and lay 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:37.250
 the mixer ran away again 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:44.090
 Zar no but what a breakdown well means 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:53.150
 we will repair it for nobody else 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:55.130
 below here and so so so so so not so 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.550
 We found no one else let's 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.880
 repairing a toothbrush and so here 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.910
 us 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.210
 battery it has oxidized us we have it 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.570
 throwing garbage 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:15.920
 so we still have here and still we donâ€™t 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:19.840
 the button works the button does not work and 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.260
 sometimes vypayat guys crazy songs everything is already 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:29.510
 broken 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:32.720
 so we throw glue for some reason 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.150
 glue we glue our brush which 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.660
 we 'll push then in your mouth okay 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.310
 so once invented it means it's non-toxic 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.200
 glue 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.200
 so insert this thing here is the regulator 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:52.580
 so we insert it I can not understand where 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:58.190
 what is she and these are the same bristles 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.470
 correctly they are left so what is it 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.250
 well, we have already put the button guys and a miracle 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.650
 I can not understand 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:08.690
 the door of the button somewhere you need to put 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:13.430
 Rather, these krutilki still so well that you do not 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:17.419
 I can understand why this battery is that okay 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:21.910
 what's another patrick is some kind of lacquer 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:26.120
 programs and so I understand because yes 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:30.650
 this is something we have sent us more 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:33.410
 items than annoy so current talk current 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:40.010
 current and what do we do then how do we 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:41.690
 to be like us to be and that's how it is 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.950
 it says lag went through with us all 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:49.580
