00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
this lesson how to build this technique

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.849 
this lesson how to build this technique
and<00:00:22.390> make<00:00:22.660> it<00:00:22.839> really<00:00:22.990> strong<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:23.619> that<00:00:23.650> you'll

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
you can apply it to a wide variety of

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.290 
you can apply it to a wide variety of
instruments<00:00:28.749> that<00:00:29.289> your<00:00:29.619> fingers<00:00:30.189> all<00:00:30.820> stay

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
instruments that your fingers all stay

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
instruments that your fingers all stay
together<00:00:31.509> and<00:00:32.190> they're<00:00:33.190> sort<00:00:33.520> of<00:00:33.870> coming<00:00:34.870> down

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
together and they're sort of coming down

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.240 
together and they're sort of coming down
so<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:36.879> you're<00:00:37.090> creating<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:37.899> cavity<00:00:38.469> right

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
so that you're creating a cavity right

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.660 
so that you're creating a cavity right
here<00:00:39.550> this<00:00:39.730> is<00:00:39.850> sort<00:00:40.180> of<00:00:40.239> an<00:00:40.359> exaggerated<00:00:41.079> view

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
here this is sort of an exaggerated view

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.290 
here this is sort of an exaggerated view
but<00:00:42.670> when<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:43.570> bring<00:00:44.320> your<00:00:44.379> hand<00:00:44.829> down<00:00:45.300> it's

but when you bring your hand down it's
almost<00:00:46.629> like<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:47.019> the<00:00:47.320> sound<00:00:47.649> is<00:00:47.890> escaping

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
almost like the the sound is escaping

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.250 
almost like the the sound is escaping
