00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
pending ridge then acts like a speed
bump<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.159> imagine<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.240> forces

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
bump if you can imagine and it forces

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
bump if you can imagine and it forces
the<00:01:27.960> foot<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> stay<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.770> place<00:01:29.040> hmm<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.030> even<00:01:30.540> if

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the foot to stay in place hmm so even if

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
the foot to stay in place hmm so even if
your<00:01:30.780> foot<00:01:30.930> were<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.350> sweaty<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.040> forces

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
your foot were to get sweaty it forces

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.390 
your foot were to get sweaty it forces
the<00:01:33.150> foot<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.479> stay<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> place<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.799> how

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the foot to stay in place so that's how

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
the foot to stay in place so that's how
this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.390> much<00:01:36.570> different<00:01:36.780> than<00:01:37.049> anything

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
this is so much different than anything

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.260 
this is so much different than anything
else<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> market<00:01:37.950> he<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.490> did<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.030> lot

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
else on the market he actually did a lot

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.819 
else on the market he actually did a lot
of<00:01:39.299> market<00:01:39.659> research<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> yeah<00:01:40.619> actually

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
of market research on it yeah actually

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.289 
of market research on it yeah actually
just<00:01:41.159> reviewed<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.670> other<00:01:41.909> products<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just reviewed all the other products I

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.609 
just reviewed all the other products I
mean<00:01:42.450> they're<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> like<00:01:43.049> foam<00:01:43.290> or

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
mean they're a lot of like foam or

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.710 
mean they're a lot of like foam or
different<00:01:43.950> softgels<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:45.149> they're<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.390> flat

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
different softgels but they're all flat

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.109 
different softgels but they're all flat
and<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.829> relies<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:47.460> friction<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and you know it relies on friction to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.460 
and you know it relies on friction to
hold<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.360> foot<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.600> place<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.380> know

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
hold your foot in place right you know

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.800 
hold your foot in place right you know
so<00:01:49.619> after<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> while<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.640> get<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.329> bottom

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
so after a while you can get your bottom

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.060 
so after a while you can get your bottom
if<00:01:51.899> he<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.110> get<00:01:52.170> irritated<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
if he can get irritated so I'm like you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
if he can get irritated so I'm like you
know<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.000> use<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.360> other<00:01:54.420> type

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
know what we have to use some other type

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
know what we have to use some other type
of<00:01:54.689> mechanics<00:01:55.140> acting<00:01:55.380> hole<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.649> put<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.920> place

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
of mechanics acting hole to put in place

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.920 
of mechanics acting hole to put in place
well<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> love<00:01:57.000> these<00:01:57.180> I've<00:01:57.360> actually<00:01:57.540> tried<00:01:57.840> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
made of well this is actually made of a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.510 
made of well this is actually made of a
new<00:02:05.960> plastic<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.170> soft<00:02:07.409> plastic<00:02:07.920> huh<00:02:08.099> so

elastomers it's all soft plastic and huh

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.250 
elastomers it's all soft plastic and huh
how<00:02:12.060> people<00:02:12.209> think<00:02:12.390> passing<00:02:12.629> think<00:02:12.959> hard<00:02:13.140> but

this is actually

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710 
this is actually
soft<00:02:14.100> material<00:02:14.580> yeah<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> variable<00:02:15.480> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
soft material yeah it's a variable you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.870 
soft material yeah it's a variable you
show<00:02:16.020> us<00:02:16.260> Laura<00:02:16.590> how<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.040> fits<00:02:17.280> into<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> shoe

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
show us Laura how it fits into the shoe

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.910 
show us Laura how it fits into the shoe
exactly<00:02:18.870> actually<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.410> what<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.710> do<00:02:19.890> is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
exactly actually so what you do is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.800 
exactly actually so what you do is
you'll<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.340> grab<00:02:20.550> your<00:02:20.700> shoe<00:02:20.970> yeah<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
you'll just grab your shoe yeah and you

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.300 
you'll just grab your shoe yeah and you
just<00:02:22.020> kind<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.470> place<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.250> in

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
just kind of just place it right in

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.130 
just kind of just place it right in
there<00:02:23.610> actually<00:02:23.970> let<00:02:24.120> me<00:02:24.150> let<00:02:24.660> me<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.900> this

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
there actually let me let me get this

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.480 
there actually let me let me get this
one<00:02:25.350> cuz<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.770> actually<00:02:26.070> comes<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.310> an

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
one cuz it actually comes with an

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.850 
one cuz it actually comes with an
adhesive<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.810> use<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.140> adhesive<00:02:28.350> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
adhesive so you can use this adhesive to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.290 
adhesive so you can use this adhesive to
kind<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.190> hold<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.670> place<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.180> don't

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
kind of hold it in place so you don't

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.060 
kind of hold it in place so you don't
have<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.480> worry<00:02:30.600> about<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.900> riding<00:02:31.320> around<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
have to worry about it riding around and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.680 
have to worry about it riding around and
doing<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.250> lot<00:02:32.370> at<00:02:32.550> all<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.240> right<00:02:33.510> there

always recommend talk here shorty
podiatrists<00:02:39.270> make<00:02:39.420> sure<00:02:39.600> but<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.650> help

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
podiatrists make sure but this can help

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.620 
podiatrists make sure but this can help
