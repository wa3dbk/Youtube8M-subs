monitor to the systems and in this way
this<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.740> useful<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.640> most<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
this is very useful for most of the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.109 
this is very useful for most of the
workstation<00:01:30.900> users<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.650> terms<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.880> they

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
workstation users in terms of that they

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
workstation users in terms of that they
can<00:01:33.479> build<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.140> structure<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> first

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
can build a structure in the first

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.490 
can build a structure in the first
screen<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.840> rendering<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
screen and do some rendering in the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
screen and do some rendering in the
third<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> second<00:01:38.430> screen<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> finally

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
third in the second screen and finally

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.630 
third in the second screen and finally
share<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> result<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> third<00:01:41.189> screen<00:01:41.490> in

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
share the result in the third screen in

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
share the result in the third screen in
the<00:01:41.759> third<00:01:42.140> monic<00:01:43.140> more<00:01:43.470> interested<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the third monic more interested and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.460 
the third monic more interested and
still<00:01:44.820> has<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.479> special<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.170> office

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
still has one more special in the office

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.210 
still has one more special in the office
work<00:01:46.909> on<00:01:47.909> their<00:01:48.210> panels<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
work on their panels so this will be a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.840 
work on their panels so this will be a
sequel

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
sequel

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.679 
sequel
and<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.210> very<00:01:51.470> unusual<00:01:52.700> very<00:01:53.700> common<00:01:54.210> user

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
and a very unusual very common user

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.440 
and a very unusual very common user
behaviour<00:01:55.500> during<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.070> workstations<00:01:56.700> users

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
behaviour during the workstations users

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.590 
behaviour during the workstations users
so<00:01:58.280> hopefully<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.700> will<00:01:59.940> bring<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.570> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
so hopefully that this will bring you a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.380 
so hopefully that this will bring you a
whole<00:02:00.990> new<00:02:01.020> experience<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
whole new experience to all of the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.530 
whole new experience to all of the
workstations<00:02:04.020> users
