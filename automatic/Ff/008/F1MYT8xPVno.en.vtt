I<00:02:47.660> think<00:02:48.660> cricket<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.320> now<00:02:49.550> sort<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.959> taken<00:02:51.959> a

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
I think cricket is now sort of taken a

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.620 
I think cricket is now sort of taken a
turn<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.340> good<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> last<00:02:53.970> last<00:02:54.330> 18

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
turn for the good in the last last 18

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.210 
turn for the good in the last last 18
months<00:02:54.660> we've<00:02:54.989> played<00:02:55.200> placing<00:02:56.040> great

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
months we've played placing great

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.100 
months we've played placing great
cricket<00:02:56.550> with<00:02:56.700> 1-1<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> lot<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.780> cricket<00:02:58.050> in

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
cricket with 1-1 a lot of cricket in

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.080 
cricket with 1-1 a lot of cricket in
that<00:02:58.230> time<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.400> guess<00:02:59.550> that's<00:02:59.700> got<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that time and and I guess that's got the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.229 
that time and and I guess that's got the
public<00:03:00.390> back<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.720> our<00:03:00.870> side<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:02.239> got

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
public back on our side and and got

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.880 
public back on our side and and got
people<00:03:03.540> back<00:03:03.690> into<00:03:03.930> inter<00:03:04.380> watching<00:03:04.709> cricket

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
people back into inter watching cricket

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.830 
people back into inter watching cricket
not<00:03:05.220> only<00:03:05.430> because<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.360> serious<00:03:06.660> ones

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
not only because of the the serious ones

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.060 
not only because of the the serious ones
we've<00:03:06.989> had<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.290> whatnot<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.709> think<00:03:07.890> that

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
we've had and whatnot but I think that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.350 
we've had and whatnot but I think that
the<00:03:08.250> brand<00:03:08.489> of<00:03:08.640> Krug<00:03:08.790> we<00:03:08.940> play

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
the brand of Krug we play

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.440 
the brand of Krug we play
it's<00:03:09.720> an<00:03:10.260> exciting<00:03:10.530> brand<00:03:10.890> that's<00:03:11.040> got<00:03:11.220> people

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
it's an exciting brand that's got people

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.090 
it's an exciting brand that's got people
to<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.570> grounds<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.410> watching<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.830> on<00:03:13.950> TV

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
to the grounds in and watching it on TV

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.430 
to the grounds in and watching it on TV
so<00:03:14.519> um<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.420> more<00:03:15.510> notice<00:03:16.200> taken

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
so um I think there is more notice taken

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.150 
so um I think there is more notice taken
around<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> country

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
around the country

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.430 
around the country
we<00:03:17.490> go<00:03:17.820> there<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.870> seems<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.320> more

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
we go there is it seems to be more

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.530 
we go there is it seems to be more
people<00:03:19.710> talking<00:03:19.980> about<00:03:20.070> it

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
people talking about it

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.510 
people talking about it
so<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> older<00:03:21.840> guys<00:03:22.020> remember<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.590> 92<00:03:23.280> will

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
so the older guys remember the 92 will

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.610 
so the older guys remember the 92 will
cuff<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.630> guess<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.230> lasting

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
cuff and and I guess the lasting

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.990 
cuff and and I guess the lasting
impressions<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.280> left<00:03:26.490> on<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
impressions that that left on the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.150 
impressions that that left on the
country<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.630> guess<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:28.320> can<00:03:28.500> form

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
country and I guess we can form

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.980 
country and I guess we can form
something<00:03:29.490> similar<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.570> that'll<00:03:30.870> be

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
something similar to to that that'll be

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.320 
something similar to to that that'll be
a<00:03:31.110> pretty<00:03:31.500> special<00:03:31.590> be<00:03:31.950> part<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.250> that's<00:03:32.760> a

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
a pretty special be part of that's a

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.510 
a pretty special be part of that's a
great<00:03:33.570> insight<00:03:33.750> now<00:03:34.560> let's<00:03:35.100> see<00:03:35.280> on<00:03:35.370> New
