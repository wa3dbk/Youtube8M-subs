00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.139
 the picture quality 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.380
 image quality is provided by the panasonic lumix 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.660
 dmc fc 201 classes usual 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.849
 mediocre result from the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.630
 digital camera only achieves iso 100 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.830
 and iso 200 a good detail rendering 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.150
 but the slightest problem is still 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.640
 already visible 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.010
 with the increase of the iso value sinks the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.440
 Image quality continuously from to iso 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.120
 400, the detail reproduction remains 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.340
 still at an acceptable level 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.360
 details are getting reasonably good 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.370
 reproduced 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.370
 from ISO 800 , the image quality drops 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.620
 stronger off rush clouds superimpose the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.700
 Textures and detail playback breaks 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.650
 on 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.780
 like with digital cameras with small ones 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.130
 image sensors are usually iso values ​​over 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.130
 800 no longer usable 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.580
 in the dark the picture quality falls 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.710
 of course a little worse off here 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.670
 should not have an iso value over 400 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.200
 be set 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.340
 because then the resolution decreases 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.160
 the fc 200 severely degrades with its result 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.080
 fc 200 is classified in the riege 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 Compact and bridge cameras with same 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.930
 sensor size 1 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.510
 she is not bad but she is not 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.740
 better than the average 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.440
 Recordings with more potential in the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.580
 image quality, the robots provide this 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.530
 are indeed from a stronger 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.729
 image noise superimposed show but 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.729
 visible more details 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.490
 an interactive comparison of here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.300
 you can find the picture sections shown here 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.880
 the camera point de 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.439
 continue in this path 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.539
 now you have the possibility the 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.289
 shown image sections interactively too 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.360
 to compare 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.460
 here you can compare the cameras 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.289
 specify if available an objective 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.200
 and the pictures in different 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.479
 compare situations 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.610
 These include the daylight conditions 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.799
 night or lightning the image format jpeg 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.530
 or if available as well as the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.690
 iso-sensitivity in addition to different 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.610
 You can also use camera models 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 particular model with different ones 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.360
 compare settings 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.989
 In this example we show the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.989
 Cutouts of a camera at iso 800 iso 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.989
 6400 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.640
 in the second comparison we present the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.640
 Recordings by day and night
