we are dealing with Doppler indicated

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.679 
we are dealing with Doppler indicated
just<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.100> severe<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.119> strong<00:01:15.450> as

anything we could see on the ground as

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
anything we could see on the ground as
well<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.640> definitely<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:18.270> shape<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
well so definitely take shape for this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it is moving east fairly rapidly at 50

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.820 
it is moving east fairly rapidly at 50
miles<00:01:24.060> per<00:01:24.210> hour<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.049> put<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> track<00:01:25.650> on

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
miles per hour and if we put a track on

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.429 
miles per hour and if we put a track on
this<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:27.119> course<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:28.170> will
