00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
women here but I believe the line was

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.590 
women here but I believe the line was
actually<00:00:16.170> called<00:00:16.350> women<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.740> Marvel<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.600> then

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
actually called women of Marvel and then

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.650 
actually called women of Marvel and then
you<00:00:18.720> see<00:00:18.900> Sue<00:00:19.199> Storm<00:00:19.260> comic<00:00:20.100> at<00:00:20.660> Marvel

Universe<00:00:22.109> that's<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> front<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> box

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
Universe that's the front of the box

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.420 
Universe that's the front of the box
very<00:00:23.869> nice<00:00:24.869> artwork<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.619> think<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
very nice artwork I think that was the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
very nice artwork I think that was the
exclusive<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> regular<00:00:27.810> it's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
exclusive this is the regular it's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.620 
exclusive this is the regular it's
number<00:00:28.279> 262<00:00:29.279> out<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.550> 600<00:00:29.970> which<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> small

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
number 262 out of 600 which is a small

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.280 
number 262 out of 600 which is a small
run<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> regular<00:00:32.040> line<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
run for a regular line so I think the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.100 
run for a regular line so I think the
exclusives<00:00:34.770> were<00:00:34.860> only<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.160> 300<00:00:36.110> there's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the side of the box and the back of the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.910 
the side of the box and the back of the
box<00:00:41.840> on<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> other<00:00:43.110> side<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> box<00:00:43.680> pretty
