heavy<00:00:00.269> amounts<00:00:00.659> of<00:00:00.750> rain<00:00:00.810> towards<00:00:01.589> Michigan

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
heavy amounts of rain towards Michigan

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.010 
heavy amounts of rain towards Michigan
and<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.610> tail<00:00:02.850> end<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.480> system<00:00:03.659> bringing

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
and the tail end of the system bringing

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.450 
and the tail end of the system bringing
some<00:00:04.200> showers<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.770> thunderstorms<00:00:05.310> to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
some showers and thunderstorms to

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.460 
some showers and thunderstorms to
develop<00:00:05.569> things<00:00:06.569> are<00:00:06.690> weakening<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.319> the

develop things are weakening of the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.740 
develop things are weakening of the
system<00:00:07.919> what<00:00:08.700> was<00:00:08.820> interesting<00:00:09.120> about<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
system what was interesting about the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.690 
system what was interesting about the
system<00:00:10.139> was<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> fact<00:00:10.620> that<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:11.460> was

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
system was the fact that it was

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.160 
system was the fact that it was
increasing<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.330> speed<00:00:12.480> as<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> moved<00:00:13.049> towards

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
increasing in speed as it moved towards

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.369 
increasing in speed as it moved towards
the<00:00:13.530> Northeast<00:00:14.099> around<00:00:15.059> 91<00:00:15.630> kilometres<00:00:16.109> an

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
the Northeast around 91 kilometres an

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.900 
the Northeast around 91 kilometres an
hour<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> that's<00:00:16.859> because<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.279> jumped<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
hour and that's because it jumped on to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.670 
hour and that's because it jumped on to
the<00:00:18.029> subtropical<00:00:18.990> jet<00:00:19.170> stream<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> that's

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the subtropical jet stream and that's

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
the subtropical jet stream and that's
why<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.100> come<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:20.400> quickly<00:00:20.850> into<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.630> Lower

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
why it's come so quickly into the Lower

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.840 
why it's come so quickly into the Lower
Mainland<00:00:22.470> now<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:23.160> have<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> rainfall

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
Mainland now we do have a rainfall

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.450 
Mainland now we do have a rainfall
warning<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.420> place<00:00:24.810> because<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.619> Ike<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
warning in place because of Ike and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.410 
warning in place because of Ike and
that's<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> bring<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.119> heavier

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that's going to bring some heavier

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.910 
that's going to bring some heavier
amounts<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.750> rain<00:00:27.810> really<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> brunt<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
amounts of rain really the brunt of it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800 
amounts of rain really the brunt of it
will<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.429> southwestern<00:00:30.090> Ontario<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
will be to southwestern Ontario and the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.959 
will be to southwestern Ontario and the
winds<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.279> strong<00:00:32.579> around<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
winds will be really strong around the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.990 
winds will be really strong around the
north<00:00:33.239> shores<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.320> Lake<00:00:34.469> Erie<00:00:35.000> it's

north shores of Lake Erie it's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.790 
north shores of Lake Erie it's
potentially<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.780> could<00:00:36.930> see<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> 100

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
potentially we could see up to 100

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.410 
potentially we could see up to 100
millimeters<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> areas<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.820> southwestern

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
millimeters in the areas of southwestern

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
millimeters in the areas of southwestern
Ontario<00:00:40.050> already<00:00:40.590> Windsor<00:00:40.950> broke<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> record

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
Ontario already Windsor broke a record

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.240 
Ontario already Windsor broke a record
on<00:00:41.610> Saturday<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.420> used<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.829> Lowell

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
on Saturday because used to be Lowell

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.680 
on Saturday because used to be Lowell
the<00:00:44.489> remnants<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.940> Lowell<00:00:45.090> which<00:00:45.270> became<00:00:45.539> an

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the remnants of Lowell which became an

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.240 
the remnants of Lowell which became an
area<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.079> low<00:00:46.200> pressure<00:00:46.230> system<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.950> brought

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
area of low pressure system that brought

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.740 
area of low pressure system that brought
some<00:00:47.460> heavy<00:00:47.610> amounts<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.000> rain<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.360> Saturday

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
some heavy amounts of rain on Saturday

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930 
some heavy amounts of rain on Saturday
so<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> amount<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> rain<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so the amount of rain it's going to be a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.209 
so the amount of rain it's going to be a
contrast<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.379> move<00:00:52.620> towards<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
contrast really if you move towards the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
contrast really if you move towards the
south<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.730> Lake<00:00:54.390> Ontario<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.320> Toronto

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
south of Lake Ontario but Toronto

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
south of Lake Ontario but Toronto
getting<00:00:56.129> some<00:00:56.309> heavy<00:00:56.460> amounts<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> rain<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
getting some heavy amounts of rain the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.180 
getting some heavy amounts of rain the
low-pressure<00:00:57.989> system<00:00:58.530> has<00:00:58.680> moved<00:00:58.890> slightly

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
low-pressure system has moved slightly

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.770 
low-pressure system has moved slightly
to<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> north<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> high<00:01:00.539> pressure

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
to the north because of a high pressure

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
to the north because of a high pressure
system<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.440> place<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> southeast

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
system in place just in the southeast

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
system in place just in the southeast
and<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.619> map<00:01:04.799> it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and so we are going to see some map it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.310 
and so we are going to see some map it's
from<00:01:05.460> breezy<00:01:05.880> conditions<00:01:06.150> about<00:01:06.720> 25

across<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.720> prairies<00:02:19.020> not<00:02:19.200> much<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.530> talk

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
across the prairies not much to talk

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.840 
across the prairies not much to talk
about<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.950> southern<00:02:20.250> prairies<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.760> were

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
about the southern prairies we were

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.520 
about the southern prairies we were
dealing<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.300> weak<00:02:21.600> trough<00:02:21.930> along<00:02:22.350> that

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
dealing with this weak trough along that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.080 
dealing with this weak trough along that
trough<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:23.010> could<00:02:23.160> see<00:02:23.250> some<00:02:23.430> cloud<00:02:23.640> cover<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
trough we could see some cloud cover and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.420 
trough we could see some cloud cover and
showers<00:02:24.450> developing<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.410> northern<00:02:25.740> Manitoba

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
showers developing for northern Manitoba

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.920 
showers developing for northern Manitoba
but<00:02:26.580> overall<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.210> looking<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.660> nice

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
but overall it's looking very nice

but overall it's looking very nice
across<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.070> West<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.820> there's<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.120> quasi

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
across the West now there's this quasi

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.300 
across the West now there's this quasi
stationary<00:02:30.750> boundary<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.710> along<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.190> we

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
stationary boundary and along that we

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.500 
stationary boundary and along that we
could<00:02:32.460> see<00:02:32.550> some<00:02:32.580> showers<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.180> cloud<00:02:33.330> cover

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
could see some showers and cloud cover

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.180 
could see some showers and cloud cover
developing<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.290> Labrador<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:34.890> northern

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
developing for Labrador and northern

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.670 
developing for Labrador and northern
Quebec<00:02:35.610> but<00:02:36.120> really<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> big<00:02:36.720> story<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.470> this
