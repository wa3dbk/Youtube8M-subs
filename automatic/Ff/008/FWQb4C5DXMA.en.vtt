shape on the seabed that it's round and

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.280 
shape on the seabed that it's round and
it's<00:00:38.000> unusually<00:00:39.000> round<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> location<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
it's unusually round and the location is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.729 
it's unusually round and the location is
between<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.370> between<00:00:41.910> Sweden<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.840> Finland

between the between Sweden and Finland
now<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> team<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.570> ocean

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
now there was a team of ocean

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.130 
now there was a team of ocean
researchers<00:00:46.680> who<00:00:46.980> found<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:48.450> searching<00:00:48.899> for

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
researchers who found was searching for

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
researchers who found was searching for
a<00:00:49.170> century<00:00:49.739> old<00:00:49.770> shipwreck<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.789> merchant<00:00:51.300> ship

a century old shipwreck a merchant ship

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
a century old shipwreck a merchant ship
a<00:00:51.809> swedish<00:00:52.170> merchant<00:00:52.530> ship<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.129> contained

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
a swedish merchant ship that contained

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
a swedish merchant ship that contained
several<00:00:54.000> cases<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.809> champagne<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.770> they

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
several cases of champagne what they

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.180 
several cases of champagne what they
found<00:00:56.070> instead<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.840> mysterious<00:00:58.559> circle

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
found instead was a mysterious circle

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
found instead was a mysterious circle
about<00:00:59.489> just<00:01:00.059> over<00:01:00.300> 18<00:01:00.510> metres<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.530> diameter

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
about just over 18 metres in diameter

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.690 
about just over 18 metres in diameter
and<00:01:02.750> clearly<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.439> visible<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.040> seabed

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and clearly it was visible on the seabed

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.859 
and clearly it was visible on the seabed
now<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> explorers<00:01:06.630> who<00:01:06.840> founded<00:01:07.380> say<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
now the explorers who founded say that

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
now the explorers who founded say that
the<00:01:09.869> earth<00:01:10.439> around<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.310> alleged<00:01:11.820> craft<00:01:12.299> was

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the earth around the alleged craft was

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.750 
the earth around the alleged craft was
scarred<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> therefore<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> suggests<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
scarred and therefore it suggests that

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.820 
scarred and therefore it suggests that
it<00:01:15.000> could<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.270> been<00:01:15.420> moving<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> seabed

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
it could have been moving on the seabed

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.300 
it could have been moving on the seabed
the<00:01:17.369> lead<00:01:17.909> explorer<00:01:18.420> Peter<00:01:19.409> Lindbergh<00:01:19.619> says

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the lead explorer Peter Lindbergh says

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.120 
the lead explorer Peter Lindbergh says
that<00:01:20.670> he<00:01:20.909> hasn't<00:01:21.119> seen<00:01:21.360> anything<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:22.110> his<00:01:22.290> 18

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that he hasn't seen anything in his 18

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.940 
that he hasn't seen anything in his 18
years<00:01:23.159> career<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.710> could

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
years career like this and that it could

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
years career like this and that it could
be<00:01:26.100> anything<00:01:26.520> if<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.570> shape<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
be anything if it's just a shape on the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
be anything if it's just a shape on the
ocean<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.619> then<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.280> obviously<00:01:29.939> worthless

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
ocean that then it's obviously worthless

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.920 
ocean that then it's obviously worthless
if<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.530> UFO<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.610> priceless<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.720> goes

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
if it's a UFO it's priceless but it goes

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.310 
if it's a UFO it's priceless but it goes
could<00:01:34.350> also<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.829> another<00:01:35.490> Stonehenge<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:37.020> he

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
could also be another Stonehenge but he

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
could also be another Stonehenge but he
says<00:01:37.560> he<00:01:37.710> doesn't<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.250> money<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
says he doesn't have the money or the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.929 
says he doesn't have the money or the
resources<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:40.259> explore<00:01:40.920> any<00:01:41.189> further<00:01:41.549> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
resources to explore any further and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.999 
resources to explore any further and
therefore<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.869> really<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.409> case<00:01:43.710> for

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
therefore this is really a case for

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.679 
therefore this is really a case for
exploration<00:01:44.340> absolutely<00:01:45.240> I'm<00:01:45.329> sure<00:01:45.479> there'll

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
exploration absolutely I'm sure there'll

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.999 
exploration absolutely I'm sure there'll
be<00:01:45.720> someone<00:01:46.020> interested<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.680> were<00:01:46.829> off

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
be someone interested so they were off

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
be someone interested so they were off
to<00:01:47.189> some<00:01:47.369> vintage<00:01:47.579> bubbly<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> what<00:01:48.600> they<00:01:48.750> get

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
to some vintage bubbly and what they get

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.469 
to some vintage bubbly and what they get
is<00:01:49.170> possibly<00:01:49.950> UFO<00:01:50.729> but<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.240> we're

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
is possibly UFO but what now we're

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.999 
is possibly UFO but what now we're
witnessing<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> scientists<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
witnessing is that scientists and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.240 
witnessing is that scientists and
bloggers<00:01:53.520> are<00:01:54.119> arguing<00:01:54.869> over<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.770> shape<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
bloggers are arguing over the shape of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.639 
bloggers are arguing over the shape of
this<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.729> ship<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.210> said<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.630> was<00:01:57.780> round<00:01:58.290> but

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
this this ship you said it was round but

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.620

tell us more well probably it's more the
bloggers<00:02:00.990> than<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> scientists<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.100> all<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
bloggers than the scientists for all you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.700 
bloggers than the scientists for all you
about<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.299> some<00:02:03.780> enthusiasts<00:02:04.590> have

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
about this but some enthusiasts have
