00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
but this tune is kind of a tribal Tom

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.290 
but this tune is kind of a tribal Tom
kind<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.690> groove<00:00:54.050> with<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.620> snares<00:00:55.460> off<00:00:55.820> and

using muffling and I just wanted to find

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.330 
using muffling and I just wanted to find
some<00:00:59.750> different<00:01:00.110> sounds<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:00.860> approach<00:01:01.309> it

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
some different sounds and approach it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.060 
some different sounds and approach it
you<00:01:02.180> know<00:01:02.300> more<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.570> a<00:01:02.720> tribal<00:01:02.989> kind<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.440> vibe

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
you know more of a tribal kind of vibe

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.040 
you know more of a tribal kind of vibe
until<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:04.879> get<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.239> chorus<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.840> then<00:01:05.930> I

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
until you get to the chorus and then I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.040 
until you get to the chorus and then I
I'm<00:01:06.500> more<00:01:06.890> or<00:01:06.980> less<00:01:07.100> open<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:07.580> up<00:01:07.730> to<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.050> regular

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
I'm more or less open it up to a regular

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.680 
I'm more or less open it up to a regular
type<00:01:09.260> you<00:01:09.950> know<00:01:10.040> groove<00:01:10.420> but<00:01:11.420> overall

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
type you know groove but overall

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.190 
type you know groove but overall
approaching<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.560> pretty<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:14.659> a<00:01:14.750> way<00:01:14.900> that<00:01:15.110> I'm

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
approaching it pretty in a way that I'm

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.140 
approaching it pretty in a way that I'm
not<00:01:15.229> necessarily<00:01:15.620> repeating<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.610> pattern<00:01:16.640> the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
not necessarily repeating a pattern the

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.240 
not necessarily repeating a pattern the
whole<00:01:17.300> time<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.080> know<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.380> ideas<00:01:18.920> are<00:01:19.100> there

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
whole time you know the ideas are there

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.060 
whole time you know the ideas are there
and<00:01:19.490> it's<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:19.790> enough<00:01:20.240> repetition<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.890> where

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
and it's it's enough repetition to where

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.020 
and it's it's enough repetition to where
it<00:01:22.220> works<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.909> it's<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:24.050> sounds<00:01:24.800> like<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.729> song

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
it works and it's it sounds like a song

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.620 
it works and it's it sounds like a song
and<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.450> works<00:01:26.720> for<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:26.990> song<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.420> didn't

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
and it works for the song but I didn't

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.660 
and it works for the song but I didn't
want<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.810> just<00:01:30.020> play<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:31.010> repetitive<00:01:31.370> pattern

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
want to just play a repetitive pattern

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.860 
want to just play a repetitive pattern
in<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.909> whole<00:01:32.030> time<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.479> each<00:01:32.540> in<00:01:32.810> each

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
in the whole time and each in each

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.810 
in the whole time and each in each
section<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.350> I'm<00:01:33.890> kind<00:01:34.160> of<00:01:34.190> improvising

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
section so I'm kind of improvising

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.380 
section so I'm kind of improvising
around<00:01:35.120> that<00:01:35.420> basic<00:01:36.340> pattern<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.180> guess<00:01:38.270> I

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
around that basic pattern and I guess I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.200 
around that basic pattern and I guess I
guess<00:01:38.540> I<00:01:38.630> should<00:01:38.810> say<00:01:39.730> because<00:01:40.730> it's<00:01:41.120> my

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
guess I should say because it's my

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.000 
guess I should say because it's my
wife's<00:01:41.450> record<00:01:41.900> she<00:01:42.110> allowed<00:01:42.380> me<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.620> approach

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
wife's record she allowed me to approach

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.640 
wife's record she allowed me to approach
it<00:01:43.160> this<00:01:43.280> way<00:01:43.460> yeah<00:01:43.820> not<00:01:44.780> everyone<00:01:45.200> would<00:01:45.440> you

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
it this way yeah not everyone would you

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.350 
it this way yeah not everyone would you
know<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.830> sometimes<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.670> might<00:01:46.790> be<00:01:46.970> reeled

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
know you sometimes you might be reeled

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.360 
know you sometimes you might be reeled
in<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.600> little<00:01:47.900> bit<00:01:48.020> more<00:01:48.200> but<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:48.680> was<00:01:49.100> able<00:01:49.310> to

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
in a little bit more but I was able to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.010 
in a little bit more but I was able to
just<00:01:49.610> approach<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.120> the<00:01:50.240> way<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.510> I<00:01:50.540> heard<00:01:50.810> it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
just approach it the way that I heard it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.330 
just approach it the way that I heard it
and<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:51.350> express<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.280> but<00:01:52.910> at<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.090> end

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
and just express it and but at the end

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.940 
and just express it and but at the end
it's<00:01:55.340> basically<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.730> drum<00:01:56.030> feature<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.890> for<00:01:57.890> you

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
it's basically a drum feature so for you

guys that are playing along just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.500 
guys that are playing along just

improvise do your own thing with it or

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.360 
improvise do your own thing with it or
cop<00:02:02.510> some<00:02:02.720> ideas<00:02:03.140> from<00:02:03.290> what<00:02:03.500> I<00:02:03.530> did<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.190> turn

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
cop some ideas from what I did and turn

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.430 
cop some ideas from what I did and turn
it<00:02:04.490> into<00:02:04.580> your<00:02:04.700> own<00:02:05.080> pretty<00:02:06.080> much<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:06.380> the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
it into your own pretty much for the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.290 
it into your own pretty much for the
whole<00:02:06.530> tomb<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:07.040> know<00:02:07.160> approach<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.149> way

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
whole tomb you know approach it that way

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.880 
whole tomb you know approach it that way
you<00:02:08.509> can<00:02:08.660> completely<00:02:09.140> change<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.619> up<00:02:09.739> if<00:02:09.830> you

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
you can completely change it up if you

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.759 
you can completely change it up if you
want<00:02:10.150> but<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:11.420> kind<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.930> track<00:02:12.140> allows<00:02:12.500> for

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
want but this kind of track allows for

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.339 
want but this kind of track allows for
that<00:02:12.860> because<00:02:13.489> it's<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.060> open<00:02:15.019> there's<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> lot

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
that because it's so open there's a lot

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.949 
that because it's so open there's a lot
of<00:02:15.470> big<00:02:15.680> notes<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:17.030> not<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> lot<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> sixteenth

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
of big notes it's not a lot of sixteenth

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.690 
of big notes it's not a lot of sixteenth
notes<00:02:18.170> happening<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:18.800> can<00:02:19.069> be<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.430> you

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
notes happening so you can be that you

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.089 
notes happening so you can be that you
can<00:02:20.150> be<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.360> busy<00:02:20.629> sixteenth<00:02:21.110> note<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.950> know
