00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.140
 Yes 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.790
 Hello friends today January 16 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.530
 closed beta ground testing 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.960
 technicians war thunder players became 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.850
 available new technology and the map is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.160
 the event can't go unnoticed 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
 so how exactly have many waited 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 already for several weeks 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.980
 participate in testing during this time on 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.930
 the server has several updates 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.460
 which more influenced 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.070
 optimization of the technical component 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.620
 games and also changed the so-called 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.350
 physics tank movement collision and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.520
 other prominent features of what 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.680
 concerns new card 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.290
 it is now purely tank in front of players 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 a battle that is different from the usual 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.790
 all Karelia significant distant 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 distance combat on the map Kuban 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.050
 also three central capture points 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.670
 located in an open area that 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.830
 presents some difficulty for 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.920
 retaining this position is a blessing 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.140
 small shelters south east point c 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.149
 corridor with two departures which 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.070
 located in the valley that says about 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.200
 local shootout in the fight for this 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.119
 position from this point of view 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 card center offering players 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.069
 tactical interaction . b 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.990
 frontier front battles for which 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.580
 usually occurs from long distances 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.209
 but still hide at the very point 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.920
 forces the enemy to come closer 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.990
 almost the whole map consists of ravines 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.970
 and hills that pose a threat to 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.950
 inexperienced or rather inattentive 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.200
 mechanics any attempt to cut 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.090
 trajectory may end in a ravine 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.220
 opposition on top of the hills often 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.320
 shot through by opponents who 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.930
 are at key points like 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.610
 in other words, the Kuban map has 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.920
 to active toxic effects 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.680
 when bypass maneuver is preferable 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.450
 head-on collision off-road 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.369
 certainly subject to flank attacks and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.369
 team coordination
