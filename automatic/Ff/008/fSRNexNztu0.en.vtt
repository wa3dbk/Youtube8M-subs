00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
what the lyrics actually don't work in

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.310

the<00:03:35.210> way<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.510> wanted<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:36.080> have<00:03:36.200> to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
the way that you wanted so you have to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320 
the way that you wanted so you have to
go<00:03:36.410> back<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.800> do<00:03:36.860> rewrites<00:03:37.180> sometimes<00:03:38.180> the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
go back and do rewrites sometimes the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.880 
go back and do rewrites sometimes the
arrangements<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.050> backgrounds<00:03:39.560> won't<00:03:39.770> be

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
arrangements to the backgrounds won't be

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.350 
arrangements to the backgrounds won't be
exactly<00:03:40.160> how<00:03:40.460> you<00:03:40.520> envision<00:03:41.030> them<00:03:41.210> when

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
exactly how you envision them when

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.640 
exactly how you envision them when
you're<00:03:41.480> doing<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.810> mix<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:42.200> got<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.470> go<00:03:42.530> back

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
you're doing the mix you got to go back

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.290 
you're doing the mix you got to go back
and<00:03:42.710> do<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.280> sometimes<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:44.150> know<00:03:44.210> you

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
and do that so sometimes you know you

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.580 
and do that so sometimes you know you
have<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.510> go<00:03:44.600> back<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.810> change<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.290> lot<00:03:45.410> of

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
have to go back and change a lot of

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.140 
have to go back and change a lot of
stuff<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:45.950> kind<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.190> gotta<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.760> it's

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
stuff you kind of gotta do that it's

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.600 
stuff you kind of gotta do that it's
like<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:48.140> know<00:03:48.290> for<00:03:48.710> example<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:49.520> know

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
like you know for example you know

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.950 
like you know for example you know
Michael<00:03:49.790> Jackson<00:03:50.330> he'll<00:03:50.570> write<00:03:50.750> like<00:03:50.930> a

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
Michael Jackson he'll write like a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.260 
Michael Jackson he'll write like a
hundred<00:03:51.230> songs<00:03:51.620> when<00:03:52.250> he<00:03:52.400> was<00:03:52.520> alive<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.030> do<00:03:53.150> an

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
hundred songs when he was alive to do an

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.450 
hundred songs when he was alive to do an
album<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.840> parse<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.710> down<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:55.040> whatever<00:03:55.190> it

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
album and parse it down to whatever it

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.980 
album and parse it down to whatever it
ended<00:03:55.700> up<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:56.000> that's<00:03:56.150> why<00:03:56.330> they're<00:03:56.510> able<00:03:56.660> to

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
ended up to that's why they're able to

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.140 
ended up to that's why they're able to
you<00:03:57.230> know<00:03:57.320> put<00:03:57.530> out<00:03:57.590> volumes<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.190> material<00:03:58.640> on

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
you know put out volumes of material on

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.420 
you know put out volumes of material on
him<00:03:59.360> now<00:03:59.540> even<00:03:59.900> though<00:04:00.080> he's<00:04:00.320> passed<00:04:00.590> on<00:04:00.830> so<00:04:01.190> I

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
him now even though he's passed on so I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.670 
him now even though he's passed on so I
just<00:04:02.060> kind<00:04:02.240> of<00:04:02.300> compare<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.840> that<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.560> know

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
just kind of compare it to that you know

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.650 
just kind of compare it to that you know
but<00:04:03.980> um<00:04:04.130> it's<00:04:04.550> like<00:04:04.730> one<00:04:05.060> album<00:04:05.360> I<00:04:05.480> did

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
but um it's like one album I did

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.840 
but um it's like one album I did
