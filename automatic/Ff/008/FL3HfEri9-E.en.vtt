00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.929
 the story 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.030
 this drawing was simply one of the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.950
 the most sensational I've ever seen 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.050
 my life is also a matter of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.320
 animation would give for better technology 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.079
 was the first 3D animation created 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.969
 at that time it was magical and it is still beyond 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.789
 bring an exciting plot to bring 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.280
 walk so every movie is me that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.270
 in short not to lose 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.739
 focus 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.390
 woody movie with buzz is what's new 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.810

 charismatic as a bullet in target and jéci and is 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.820
 saved underneath and toy story 3 that counts 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.290

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.240
 the best film of this technology the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:55.590

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.229

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.250

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.500
 the 2 in addition to being a movie fuck 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.170
 Funny is the time you really know 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.410

 Do not have hearts of people. 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.080
 it was a nice balcony to take to launch 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.760
 toy story 3 because they gave some time 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.890
 people who were small who watched 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.840

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.700
 completion of his childhood quotation marks 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.400
 It was kind of a really fucking thing. 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.549

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.610
 the game released for nintendo 64 and ps 1 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.340

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.129

 each phase start or sometimes until the 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.270
