00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.519
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.200
 those two on the server 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.150
 today we have hardware hands 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
 in fact we talk about a respectable one 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.740
 set top of the range studied 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.900
 mainly for the players of disease 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.369
 exact we are launching in type games 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.619
 world of warcraft what it gives us 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.869
 what this set provides us with 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 let's talk about the keyboard first 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.090
 as you see here as you are seeing 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.059
 surely in the images the keyboard a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.059
 18 programmable keys on this side 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 divided by three different modes of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.840
 registration so in all we have 54 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 custom macros for another number 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 formidable that will allow you 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.079
 absolutely to record any 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.210
 command geology has managed to use them 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.980
 all of you are certified nerds 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.229
 however the keyboard has an appeal 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.450
 fantastic even if on the games it does not bite 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.659
 it is not necessary to have who knows what appeal 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.000
 even the fbs gamer will not be able to do without 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.580
 who fully enjoy this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.680
 configuration because the keys really 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.630
 they react to the look more say than to the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.790
 feel really are very responsive 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.220
 keyboard comes 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.560
 unit of a comfortable wrist rest and you can 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.340
 connect and disconnect and what a lot 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.200
 interesting to see with two usb sockets 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.630
 one definitely serves for the keyboard 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.910
 the other is a cross for the door 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.410
 which we find behind therefore is a door 1 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:42.890
 at 1 we don't say from by usb slot like 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.270
 happens in many other keyboards what 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.160
 this must be said a keyboard 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.910
 backlit and that is possible 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.190
 through a zare management software 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.990
 in short not even in the lighting beyond 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.630
 than in macro programming 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.250
 so we have different combinations that 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.530
 can be useful in several 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.009
 different gaming situations fans 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.190
 the last thing I want to say for 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.649
 this keyboard is that there is an antique 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.720
 sting a very anti ghosting system 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.580
 very particular because it allows 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.450
 even press 20 keys 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.459
 at the same time and to this challenge i 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.480
 aliens probably doing ie not yes 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.010
 know how 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.510
 and even if you put us also adopted it is one 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.560
 patch to take 20 keys 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.659
 at the same time 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.670
 then guys, let's go and test 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.440
 what happens if we press 20 keys 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.750
 simultaneously on a keyboard 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.360
 normal just need a hand indeed 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.360
 two ok arrival at 9 pm 10 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.180
 but let's say this is a keyboard 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.610
 for very very direct gamers 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.040
 no nerd guys site is just a 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.310
 detail however the body of the keyboard 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.769
 it really looks like proof of grenade itself 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.680
 in a mineo another other very thing 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.150
 cute is that the keys come off being 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.819
 they attack very easily for one 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.890
 police effective or obviously accurate 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.230
 boys same speech of robustness e 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.609
 resistance must be done for the cables that 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.329
 I believe they can also be used for 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:22.430
 moor small fishing boats and we have 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.889
 wherever this appeal really is 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.299
 very solid on any part of 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.940
 this keyboard completes this 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.130
 wonderful scroll wheel for audio 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.810
 also in 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.500
 aluminum also stalled 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.420
 in short, a keyboard to see 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.310
 of course every gamer pc that you 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.410
 respect as well as having a keyboard 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.150
 high quality as this needs 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.760
 even a mouse that is up to par 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.800
 we are talking about the m95 vanguard series 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.060
 always of the race what we can 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.860
 say of this mouse 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.890
 the boy's aluminum body is never 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.260
 seen a mouse but it bursts in the year I 15 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.410
 individually programmable keys for 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.950
 nine different macros divided into six 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.070
 what profiles is there to say the uil is 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.260
 fantastic guys makes no noise 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.180
 and very soft, very reactive but not 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.740
 you risk taking two shots instead of 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.320
 one you really have a check 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.350
 absolute on the wheel to play a 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.840
 from games like world of warcraft this 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.610
 it's the best guys on the market for 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.360
 optimize the performance of 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.640
 this mouse 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.640
 we recommend a mat like this 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.610
 lmm 600 looks like the boys run for 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.470
 fantastic because at 22 parts why 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.450
 you have a rougher a smoother a 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.940
 depending on whether more resistance or not 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.350
 resistance will remain anchored to yours 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.440
 table that has rubber feet 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.060
 non-slip and is made entirely of 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.820
 practically aluminum you can pack 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.070
 absolutely arch over here 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.200
 very durable plus there is to say 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.380
 always the mouse that resists 20 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.820
 millions of pike said but then guys 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.870
 keyboard mouse pad are a wagon 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.330
 armed 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.390
 we are absolutely talking about though 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.270
 one of the most expensive sets in 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.530
 trade we talk in total about 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.630
 200 euros of stuff in the ones you see 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.030
 but do n't think it's money here 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.320
 used one is absolutely first time 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.910
 that you buy in this set 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.460
 guys you don't need anything anymore 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.770
 for years years years to the site much 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:30.660
 for each class of nine mice from us 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:30.660
 males both live up to looking at me 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:47.140
 even two side 22 live from badulati 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.030
 manager carlin's toro colombo design e 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.970
 don't have a carpet on our show 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.610
 from tears we claim our never 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:58.770
 he has rougher guys and in the case vi 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.770
 like to have a little more residents 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:06.420
 because but the practice was correct 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.270
 boys for boys to exalt to 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.530
 maximum performance of this mouse 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.530
 you have to feel we do automatic 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.940
 obviously this is only one 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:33.330
 question of preference what you say 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.330
 resell ever lied straight
