00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 and you want what they eat in 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.720
 McDonald's is soy meat or meat 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.880
 horse after listening what follows 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 they wish they had eaten the nutritious 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.250
 soy meat and the non-toxic meat of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.949
 horse according to authoritative sources in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.449
 Michigan State University 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.430
 It was recently learned that meat 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.859
 that uses mcdonal's for your 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.099
 burgers comes from an authentic 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.930
 lumps without legs and without horns that are 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.810
 fed by means of tubes 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.180
 connected to their stomachs and that of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.860
 done they do not have bones but a little 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.620
 cartilages that never reach 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.329
 develop those who have seen them 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.760
 they assure that they are very 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.450
 unpleasant because besides staying 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 immobile all their life they have no eyes nor 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.190
 tail and practically do not have hair of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.890
 made his head is the size of a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.140
 tennis ball and the only thing that stands out 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 is what they have left of mouth 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.149
 genetic manipulation of which are 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.129
 result makes them true 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.339
 inanimate things a horrifying 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.690
 gelatinous appearance when the government 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.250
 he tried to force them 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.670
 pull your ads that your 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.400
 beef burgers had them 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.520
 they argued that in Latin 3 means 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.830
 thing and that they produced thing meat 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.470
 so they argued that if they could 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.810
 say it was beef but said 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.120
 argument is pretty fliptable and 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.400
 fraudulent if you continue with all the power 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.920
 economic support that would have 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 bribed many people in various 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.780
 positions at very high levels 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 governmental for that reason 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 McDonald's is allowed the luxury of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.710
 announce that what they put in their 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.980
 burgers is 100% beef 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.430
 thing meat is to say of those things that 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.460
 they know how to grow in their stables and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.220
 with procedures of dubious ethics but 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.500
 you will never see that there is any legend or 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.350
 announcement where mcdonald's says that the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.090
 meat they use is from cattle 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.080
 which is the proper name to designate 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.690
 generically bulls and cows 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.910
 the worst of all this is not that you take me 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.430
 use genetic manipulation to 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.710
 achieve greater production but that said 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.470
 bruce meat of side effects in the 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.120
 health the substances and toxins that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.900
 develop the things I wanted to control 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.540
 more produce over time 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.299
 irreversible damage to health 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.340
 the first effects you feel in the day 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.010
 following having eaten hamburgers 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.700
 from mcdonald's large number of people 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.959
 suffer from indigestion and colitis 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.299
 it seems that these symptoms are 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.510
 inconsequential but with the passage of 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.880
 years the real side effects and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.980
 irreversible manifests 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.350
 although there is still no number 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.450
 large number of affected people has been 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.040
 known that places like canada australia 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.050
 and of course us scientific groups 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.150
 specialized in the matter relate 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.360
 to the consumption of mcdonald's burgers 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.400
 with this world I am not Alzheimer's among 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.620
 many other diseases whose origin 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.890
 it seemed not to be related to other 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.950
 Causes 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.350
 as you will see everything is extremely 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.530
 unpleasant that's why it's important that 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.240
 everyone is aware of the kind of 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.990
 meals that they offer us in those places 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.540
 I'm not very sure that if in fact 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.840
 mcdonal's does not know how to eat meat of thing 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.660
 truth is that it is not true but the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.430
 truth is that if you do not see food with 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.580
 many chemicals that harm the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.340
 health is better preferable to make yourself 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.040
 own hamburger if the video liked you
