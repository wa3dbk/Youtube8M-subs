00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
conjunctions that gives me a hint

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.610 
conjunctions that gives me a hint
whether<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:30.069> one<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> proposition<00:03:32.620> already

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
whether the one is a proposition already

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.729 
whether the one is a proposition already
or<00:03:33.829> not<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.250> Chi<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.609> course<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.079> conjunction

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
or not so Chi of course is a conjunction

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.030 
or not so Chi of course is a conjunction
chi<00:03:37.609> woon<00:03:38.079> okay<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.400> Allah<00:03:41.269> is<00:03:42.260> also<00:03:42.530> a

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
chi woon okay and then Allah is also a

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.170 
chi woon okay and then Allah is also a
conjunction<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:44.389> means<00:03:44.599> even<00:03:44.959> or<00:03:45.769> but<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:46.579> you

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
conjunction it means even or but so you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.050 
conjunction it means even or but so you
can<00:03:47.389> see<00:03:47.569> I<00:03:47.900> can<00:03:48.200> see<00:03:48.349> here<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.650> it's<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.340> to

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
can see I can see here that it's a to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.210 
can see I can see here that it's a to
the<00:03:50.180> preposition<00:03:50.780> proposition<00:03:51.319> already<00:03:51.560> do

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
the preposition proposition already do

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.009 
the preposition proposition already do
not<00:03:52.400> be<00:03:52.549> conformed<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.329> world<00:03:53.389> but<00:03:53.720> be

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
not be conformed to this world but be

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.289 
not be conformed to this world but be
transformed<00:03:55.010> by<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.400> renewing<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.180> mind

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
transformed by the renewing of the mind

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.720 
transformed by the renewing of the mind
so<00:03:56.660> I'll<00:03:57.139> cut<00:03:57.470> this<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.889> will<00:03:58.130> separate<00:03:58.579> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
so I'll cut this I will separate the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.150 
so I'll cut this I will separate the
splits<00:03:59.030> off<00:04:02.319> okay<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:05.500> okay<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.680> can<00:04:06.950> see

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
splits off okay and okay you can see

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.599 
splits off okay and okay you can see
clearly<00:04:07.489> here<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:08.150> there's<00:04:08.540> another<00:04:09.579> but<00:04:10.579> a

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
clearly here that there's another but a

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.839 
clearly here that there's another but a
proposition<00:04:11.829> here<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:13.130> actually<00:04:13.700> is

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
proposition here that actually is

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.599 
proposition here that actually is
clearly<00:04:14.409> should<00:04:15.409> be<00:04:15.680> separated<00:04:16.219> as<00:04:16.579> a

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
clearly should be separated as a

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.020 
clearly should be separated as a
proposition<00:04:17.650> by<00:04:18.650> okay<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.579> see<00:04:19.760> here<00:04:19.940> in

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
proposition by okay you see here in

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.009 
proposition by okay you see here in
English<00:04:20.269> but<00:04:20.450> Beatrice

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
English but Beatrice

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.290

by<00:04:21.199> the<00:04:21.259> renewing<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:21.919> mind<00:04:22.069> that<00:04:22.849> by

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
by the renewing of the mind that by

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.900 
by the renewing of the mind that by
testing<00:04:23.629> a<00:04:24.020> me<00:04:24.139> discern<00:04:24.410> what<00:04:24.650> what<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.759> the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
testing a me discern what what is the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.300 
testing a me discern what what is the
good<00:04:26.060> word<00:04:26.240> of<00:04:26.509> God<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:27.139> is<00:04:27.530> good<00:04:27.710> acceptable

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
good word of God that is good acceptable

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.180 
good word of God that is good acceptable
and<00:04:28.400> perfect<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:30.259> is<00:04:30.530> actually<00:04:30.949> a

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
and perfect so that that is actually a

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.619 
and perfect so that that is actually a
good<00:04:32.949> good<00:04:33.949> indication<00:04:34.639> that<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.940> actually

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629 
good good indication that is actually

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:39.480 
good good indication that is actually
another<00:04:35.960> proposition<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.599> separate<00:04:38.599> that<00:04:38.780> out

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
another proposition so separate that out

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.450 
another proposition so separate that out
okay<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.449> can<00:04:41.659> see<00:04:41.840> here<00:04:42.379> there<00:04:42.650> are<00:04:42.680> one

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
okay so you can see here there are one

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.080 
okay so you can see here there are one
two<00:04:43.940> three<00:04:43.970> four<00:04:44.870> five<00:04:45.669> propositions<00:04:46.669> and

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
two three four five propositions and

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.080 
two three four five propositions and
then<00:04:47.870> we'll<00:04:48.080> establish<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:49.099> merge<00:04:50.090> each<00:04:50.930> one

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
then we'll establish and merge each one

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.230 
then we'll establish and merge each one
how<00:04:53.090> they<00:04:53.330> function<00:04:53.900> or<00:04:54.409> how<00:04:54.620> they<00:04:55.960> argue<00:04:58.240> or

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
how they help together as a verse or as

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:09.600 
how they help together as a verse or as
