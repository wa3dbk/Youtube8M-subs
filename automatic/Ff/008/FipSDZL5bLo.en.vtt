color in it although the goal was a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.450 
color in it although the goal was a
traditional<00:00:09.510> English<00:00:09.840> garden<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:11.010> was<00:00:11.130> beyond

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
traditional English garden it was beyond

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.919 
traditional English garden it was beyond
the<00:00:11.550> point<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.059> delphiniums<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
the point with the delphiniums the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.560 
the point with the delphiniums the
lupins<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.530> fox<00:00:13.740> clubs<00:00:14.099> had<00:00:14.400> bloomed<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.969> at

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
lupins the fox clubs had bloomed and at

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.240 
lupins the fox clubs had bloomed and at
this<00:00:15.690> point<00:00:15.990> there<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:16.379> just<00:00:16.650> foliage<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
this point there was just foliage and

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.849 
this point there was just foliage and
not<00:00:17.760> much<00:00:18.000> happening<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> interest<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
not much happening of interest the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.950 
not much happening of interest the
solution<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.760> create<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.420> mixed<00:00:21.660> border

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
solution was to create a mixed border

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.570 
solution was to create a mixed border
which<00:00:22.260> would<00:00:22.439> contain<00:00:22.800> shrubs<00:00:23.279> perennials

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
which would contain shrubs perennials

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.689 
which would contain shrubs perennials
and<00:00:24.420> annuals<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.260> was<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.070> colors<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and annuals that was the colors and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.720 
and annuals that was the colors and
textures<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:27.570> last<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:27.990> season<00:00:28.410> long

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
textures that would last all season long

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.339 
textures that would last all season long
to<00:00:29.730> create<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> mixed<00:00:30.390> Gardens<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.019> create

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
to create a mixed Gardens to create

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.950 
to create a mixed Gardens to create
three<00:00:31.650> tiers<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.369> tier<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.390> short<00:00:33.719> growing

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
three tiers a tier of short growing

fence anything 24 inches or taller
we<00:00:44.190> started<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:44.700> planting<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> few<00:00:45.570> shrubs

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
we started with planting a few shrubs

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.260 
we started with planting a few shrubs
and<00:00:46.230> roses<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:47.160> would<00:00:47.399> give<00:00:47.520> us<00:00:47.670> color<00:00:47.879> at

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and roses which would give us color at

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.819 
and roses which would give us color at
different<00:00:48.870> times<00:00:49.050> during<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> summer<00:00:49.620> and

looking<00:01:32.970> from<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.210> distance<00:01:33.689> at<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> garden<00:01:34.229> like

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
looking from a distance at a garden like

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
looking from a distance at a garden like
this<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.970> plant<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this you don't want to see one plant you

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390 
this you don't want to see one plant you
want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> large<00:01:37.229> mass<00:01:37.530> producing<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> lot

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
want to see a large mass producing a lot

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.789 
want to see a large mass producing a lot
of<00:01:38.520> color<00:01:38.729> therefore<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:40.079> tried<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.439> plant<00:01:40.680> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
of color therefore we tried to plant in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.210 
of color therefore we tried to plant in
groups<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.189> five<00:01:41.460> seven<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.540> nine<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.920> gives

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
groups of five seven or nine this gives

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.280 
groups of five seven or nine this gives
this<00:01:44.759> large<00:01:45.060> mass<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.259> giant

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
this large mass as if it's one giant

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
this large mass as if it's one giant
plant<00:01:46.950> although<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.490> many<00:01:47.670> plants<00:01:48.060> growing

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
plant although it's many plants growing

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
plant although it's many plants growing
together<00:01:48.740> one<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> greatest<00:01:50.100> challenges

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
together one of the greatest challenges

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
together one of the greatest challenges
to<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:50.939> garden<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.689> half<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to this garden was that half of the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
to this garden was that half of the
garden<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.680> hot<00:01:52.829> Sun<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> other<00:01:53.549> half

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
garden is in hot Sun and the other half
