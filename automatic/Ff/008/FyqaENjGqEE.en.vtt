00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.350
 people ask about the car as if 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.480
 My brother is my name. 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.910
 Caco grew up with me is with the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 people since let me see that I am 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.360
 little one then he got a name 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.180
 romeu flame is how people 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.720
 so people know car deal 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720
 by romeu 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.619
 I do not have any now 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.509
 especially with the car because all my 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.949
 my whole childhood was inside the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.250
 car my entire adolescence by 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.649
 inside the car so travels that made 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.280
 family laws are always associated 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.280
 to the car 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.570
 This is the result of 76 for my father 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.120
 take the seriously was placed a 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.710
 dealership 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.830
 Rafael 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.980
 I want to stay until today is something he 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.330
 he fights a lot to do 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.330
 He is 73 years old. 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.530
 the maverick is a car 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.420
 stylish me so the car has a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 sports pinch 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.380
 I'm particularly suspicious to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.549
 to say that I really like to walk in a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.350
 media I think a sensational car 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.869
 already with his own name, do not you? 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.280
 maverick maverick right on that 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.380
 then you have this pinch of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:54.299
 that the car is going to become 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:56.429
 presenting with certainty is not expensive to maintain 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.170
 a girl I learned if you have the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.250
 I like to have a car see if you do not 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.469
 will strive to maintain 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.299
 working is not difficult to find parts 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.149
 and I think that nowadays the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.310
 toss on the shovel for you to find the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.679
 parts are 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.700
 replacements that are as good or even 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.700
 better than the originals 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.769
 nowadays we can say the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.260
 cars gifts were all already 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.579
 Do you still get croupes? 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.579
 means of ports 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.389
 I have some romeo wrinkles have his 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.950
 has some defects romeo has his 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:44.889
 some ask me if I'm not going 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.389
 restore the cathode I did not leave I do not see 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.430
 I really like to take care of the 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.590
 car likes to keep it cute but 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.689
 he never won a zero car at this time. 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.000
 contract for example was never opened 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.560
 It was never done, it 's something I like. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.859
 one for all the way you left for 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.510
 Call if I leave the house before I 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.919
 I think very well where I'm going to leave 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.579
 the car because I do not deliver with 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.579
 valet parking 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.360
 but I've learned to degenerate and I think 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.460
 That's why I end up driving with 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.080
 certain ease and turning well with him 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.660
 although he did not have that degree and that 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.150
 despite being a car very close together and in the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.660
 In my case I keep a car in my 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.130
 married single life in strawberry 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.410
 I think it treats you like a child. 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.420
 I think this is big issue for 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.680
 car I wish I had this car 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.680
 same care that would have 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.170
 so for me it 's if it 's too much 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.360
 important in several respects beyond 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.730
 be a sensational car a wonderful 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.860
 an icon of automobile history 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.860
 National I think this is the primary 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.609
 my plans to use the car until one is the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.680
 last as long as you can use the cable 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.650
 I intend to continue using it but it does 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:31.930
 part of my family has no way how 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.930
 The mage has fled and I do not care.
