the 24 VNA 9 and cooling right now it's
on<00:00:14.400> third<00:00:14.730> stage<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.320> you<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.440> hear<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
on third stage and you can hear that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.200 
on third stage and you can hear that
it's<00:00:17.240> super<00:00:18.240> quiet<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.930> has<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.260> same<00:00:19.529> tin<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
it's super quiet it has that same tin to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.900 
it's super quiet it has that same tin to
it<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.990> green<00:00:22.230> speed<00:00:22.699> modulating<00:00:23.699> does

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
it that the green speed modulating does

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.660 
it that the green speed modulating does
but<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.539> lacks<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:26.039> severe

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
but what it lacks is the severe

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.529 
but what it lacks is the severe
high-pitched<00:00:27.359> ping<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:29.849> inverter<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.420> the

that<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> forcing<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.780> push<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that I'm kind of forcing it to push it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
that I'm kind of forcing it to push it
but<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> fact<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.189> could<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> my

but the fact that it could do it my

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.810 
but the fact that it could do it my
green<00:01:33.479> speed<00:01:33.799> was<00:01:34.799> only<00:01:35.220> ever<00:01:35.310> able<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> put

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
green speed was only ever able to put

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.109 
green speed was only ever able to put
out<00:01:35.939> 98<00:01:36.450> degree<00:01:36.750> temperature<00:01:37.610> out<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.909> mine

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
out 98 degree temperature out of mine

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
out 98 degree temperature out of mine
and<00:01:39.450> other<00:01:39.900> people<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.229> had<00:01:40.320> varying

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and other people have had varying

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.649 
and other people have had varying
results<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.610> really<00:01:42.060> only<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> green

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
results we really only do the green

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.289 
results we really only do the green
speed<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.020> new<00:01:43.140> construction<00:01:44.119> more<00:01:45.119> than

speed on new construction more than

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.429 
speed on new construction more than
anything<00:01:45.509> because<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
anything because you really have to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
anything because you really have to
control<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.920> ductwork<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> unit<00:01:47.850> but

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
control the ductwork with that unit but

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
control the ductwork with that unit but
this<00:01:48.420> units<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.079> forgiving<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this units a little more forgiving and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.179 
this units a little more forgiving and
its<00:01:51.170> operating<00:01:52.170> great<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.590> I'm<00:01:53.159> really

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
its operating great it's I'm really

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.170 
its operating great it's I'm really
thrilled<00:01:54.030> let<00:01:54.210> me<00:01:54.270> show<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.509> inside<00:01:54.780> the

here<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.160 

so<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.119> notice<00:02:07.329> there<00:02:07.540> there<00:02:07.810> really<00:02:07.900> isn't

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so you notice there there really isn't

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.199 
so you notice there there really isn't
it's<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.830> ten<00:02:09.069> sound<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.729> there<00:02:09.940> isn't

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
it's just that ten sound it there isn't

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's just that ten sound it there isn't
really<00:02:10.330> any<00:02:10.630> grinding<00:02:11.530> or<00:02:11.860> compressor<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
really any grinding or compressor the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.900 
really any grinding or compressor the
noise<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.349> much<00:02:14.530> anything<00:02:14.860> that's<00:02:15.430> severe

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
noise as much anything that's severe

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.180 
noise as much anything that's severe
I'll<00:02:16.450> pull<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.780> back<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.349> get<00:02:18.160> a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
I'll pull you back so you can get a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.150 
I'll pull you back so you can get a
feeling<00:02:18.430> for<00:02:18.700> how<00:02:19.590> quiet<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.770> is<00:02:20.920> on<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
feeling for how quiet that is on the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.300 
feeling for how quiet that is on the
side<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.270> house<00:02:25.260> some<00:02:26.260> at<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:26.680> point<00:02:27.099> I'm

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
side of a house some at some point I'm

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.530 
side of a house some at some point I'm
gonna<00:02:27.489> have<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.700> switch<00:02:27.849> out<00:02:28.000> my<00:02:28.120> green<00:02:28.330> speed

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
gonna have to switch out my green speed

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.140 
gonna have to switch out my green speed
to<00:02:28.660> one<00:02:28.750> of<00:02:28.840> these<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.110> mean<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:30.489> high-pitched

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
to one of these I mean that high-pitched

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.390 
to one of these I mean that high-pitched
noise<00:02:32.019> that<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.410> green<00:02:32.560> speed<00:02:32.800> puts<00:02:33.010> out<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
noise that the green speed puts out I

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.160 
noise that the green speed puts out I
can<00:02:33.700> hear<00:02:33.940> my<00:02:34.060> neighbors<00:02:34.360> can't<00:02:34.660> because

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
can hear my neighbors can't because

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.350 
can hear my neighbors can't because
they're<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> little<00:02:35.590> older<00:02:35.920> but<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.640> can<00:02:37.090> hear<00:02:37.269> it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
they're a little older but I can hear it

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.110 
they're a little older but I can hear it
and<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.630> when<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.430> came<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
and I when it's on and I came to the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.140 
and I when it's on and I came to the
backyard<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:40.870> like<00:02:40.989> me<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:42.880> one<00:02:43.030> I'm

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
backyard I'm like me so this one I'm

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.270 
backyard I'm like me so this one I'm
real<00:02:43.330> excited<00:02:44.010> okay<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:46.239> coming<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.660> here<00:02:47.280> this

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
real excited okay so coming in here this

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.050 
real excited okay so coming in here this
is<00:02:48.459> our<00:02:48.610> fan<00:02:48.850> coil<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.519> case<00:02:51.760> with<00:02:51.940> the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
is our fan coil so in this case with the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.220 
is our fan coil so in this case with the
zoning<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:53.500> know<00:02:53.620> there's<00:02:53.890> been<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.100> lot<00:02:54.310> of

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
zoning you know there's been a lot of

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.870 
zoning you know there's been a lot of
originally<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.380> Infinity<00:02:56.799> zoning<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:57.850> a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
originally with Infinity zoning it was a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.729 
originally with Infinity zoning it was a
dam<00:02:58.120> perlis<00:02:58.450> system<00:02:58.840> but<00:02:59.819> we<00:03:00.819> as<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.560> very

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.370 

what's<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.799> word<00:03:05.860> we<00:03:06.790> do<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> lot<00:03:07.269> of<00:03:07.510> systems

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
what's the word we do a lot of systems

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.590 
what's the word we do a lot of systems
and<00:03:08.680> we<00:03:08.980> quickly<00:03:09.130> realized<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:10.299> need<00:03:10.510> to

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
and we quickly realized that you need to

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.330 
and we quickly realized that you need to
have<00:03:10.750> some<00:03:10.959> kind<00:03:11.079> of<00:03:11.170> bypass<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.950> system

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
have some kind of bypass in the system

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.960 
have some kind of bypass in the system
with<00:03:13.079> this<00:03:14.079> type<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.350> zoning<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:15.040> just<00:03:15.609> doesn't

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
with this type of zoning it just doesn't

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.670 
with this type of zoning it just doesn't
it<00:03:16.120> needs<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.660> little<00:03:16.780> pressure<00:03:17.049> relief<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.560> we

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
it needs a little pressure relief so we

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.330 
it needs a little pressure relief so we
put<00:03:17.859> in<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:19.049> static<00:03:20.049> damper<00:03:20.350> there<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:21.220> that's

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
put in a static damper there so that's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.920 
put in a static damper there so that's
set<00:03:21.549> at<00:03:21.640> point<00:03:21.850> five<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.480> that'll<00:03:22.720> give<00:03:22.900> a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
set at point five so that'll give a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.840 
set at point five so that'll give a
little<00:03:23.170> release<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:24.100> brought<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.549> separate

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
little release we brought in a separate

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.940 
little release we brought in a separate
return<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.230> limit<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:26.650> thing<00:03:26.829> is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
return just a limit this thing is

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.830 
return just a limit this thing is
purring<00:03:27.370> right<00:03:27.579> now<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.000> super<00:03:28.209> super<00:03:28.540> happy

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
purring right now it's super super happy

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.010 
purring right now it's super super happy
and<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.880> can<00:03:30.970> hear<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.239> noise<00:03:31.269> volume<00:03:32.250> so

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.570 

-<00:03:37.560> super<00:03:37.920> quiet<00:03:38.100> out<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.490> garage

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
- super quiet out in the garage

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.240 
- super quiet out in the garage
especially<00:03:39.390> if<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:39.750> like<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.250> assistant

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
especially if you have like a assistant

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.190 
especially if you have like a assistant
right<00:03:41.340> now<00:03:41.460> that's<00:03:41.670> super<00:03:41.940> loud<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.750> used<00:03:43.110> to

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
right now that's super loud this used to

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.470 
right now that's super loud this used to
be<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.380> propane<00:03:43.800> system<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.730> there<00:03:45.030> used<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.420> be

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
be a propane system so there used to be

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.150 
be a propane system so there used to be
a<00:03:45.600> high-efficiency<00:03:46.170> propane<00:03:46.680> furnace<00:03:46.860> in

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
a high-efficiency propane furnace in

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.640 
a high-efficiency propane furnace in
here<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.850> had<00:03:48.390> no<00:03:48.600> ability<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.050> stage<00:03:49.380> down

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
here that had no ability to stage down

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.130 
here that had no ability to stage down
it<00:03:49.950> still<00:03:50.160> had<00:03:50.310> four<00:03:50.550> zones<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.330> took<00:03:51.570> the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
it still had four zones so we took the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.590 
it still had four zones so we took the
four<00:03:52.740> zone<00:03:52.980> Honeywell<00:03:53.550> system<00:03:53.910> adapted<00:03:54.450> into

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
four zone Honeywell system adapted into

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.570 
four zone Honeywell system adapted into
the<00:03:54.720> honey<00:03:54.960> into<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> carrier<00:03:56.100> four<00:03:56.370> zone

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
the honey into the carrier four zone

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.840 
the honey into the carrier four zone
system<00:03:57.000> put<00:03:57.600> on<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.840> five<00:03:58.020> stage<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.850> it's

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
system put on the five stage and it's

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.370 
system put on the five stage and it's
like<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.150> match<00:04:00.420> made<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:00.750> heaven<00:04:01.020> but<00:04:01.910> yeah<00:04:03.380> so

carrier<00:04:09.660> system<00:04:10.230> has<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.810> energy<00:04:12.810> tracking<00:04:13.200> so

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
carrier system has a energy tracking so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.470 
carrier system has a energy tracking so
