00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
power is shown from the beginning of the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.240 
power is shown from the beginning of the
freezer<00:00:53.640> saga<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.230> probably<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.070> quite

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
freezer saga to the probably not quite

the beginning but when freezers are

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.160 
the beginning but when freezers are
revealed<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.670> saga<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.840> shown<00:01:01.050> that

revealed in in the saga it's shown that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.280 
revealed in in the saga it's shown that
his<00:01:01.350> power<00:01:01.620> grows<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:02.309> when<00:01:02.760> he's<00:01:02.969> first

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
his power grows from when he's first

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
his power grows from when he's first
introduced<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.880> moment<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.330> he

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
introduced to the to the moment that he

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
introduced to the to the moment that he
is<00:01:06.570> defeated<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.950> there's<00:01:08.159> cooler

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
is defeated and then there's cooler

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.570 
is defeated and then there's cooler
who's<00:01:11.150> introduced<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.420> movie<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.580> he's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
who's introduced in this movie but he's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480 
who's introduced in this movie but he's
introduced<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
introduced is this like this one of the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.260 
introduced is this like this one of the
strongest<00:01:18.000> beings<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> universe<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:20.270> he

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
strongest beings in the universe but he

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.530 
strongest beings in the universe but he
really<00:01:21.869> has<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> play<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> five<00:01:23.790> minute<00:01:24.210> fight

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
really has a play a five minute fight

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.190 
really has a play a five minute fight
with<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.530> through<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.990> really<00:01:27.990> doesn't

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
with going through that really doesn't

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.010 
with going through that really doesn't
show<00:01:28.380> cast<00:01:28.860> too<00:01:29.070> much<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.460> cools<00:01:29.700> power<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.720> I

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
show cast too much of cools power so I

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
show cast too much of cools power so I
suppose<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.890> respect<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.759> could<00:01:32.970> say

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
suppose in that respect you could say

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.490 
suppose in that respect you could say
that<00:01:34.670> freezer<00:01:35.670> could<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.150> could<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.259> would

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that freezer could this could or would

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
that freezer could this could or would
be<00:01:37.680> stronger<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> fact<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
be stronger just for the fact that it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.060 
be stronger just for the fact that it
showed<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> he<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.799> able<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.250> push<00:01:42.799> push<00:01:43.799> all

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
showed that he was able to push push all

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.429 
showed that he was able to push push all
of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> fighters<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.270> took<00:01:45.990> him<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
of the fighters that are took him on to

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.160 
of the fighters that are took him on to
their<00:01:46.590> limits<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.549> through<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:48.240> even

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
their limits go through even even

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.300 
their limits go through even even
piccolo<00:01:50.540> Gohan<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.810> dare<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> say<00:01:52.500> even

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
piccolo Gohan and dare I say even

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.120 
piccolo Gohan and dare I say even
Crillon<00:01:54.000> was

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
Crillon was

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.370 
Crillon was
push<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> limits<00:01:57.600> while<00:01:57.750> even<00:01:58.110> fighting

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
push to the limits while even fighting

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.370 
push to the limits while even fighting
the<00:01:59.250> beginning<00:01:59.939> forces<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.689> things<00:02:01.229> like

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the beginning forces and things like

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.779 
the beginning forces and things like
that<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.899> how<00:02:03.899> cooler<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.590> only<00:02:04.979> showcased

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
that and how cooler was only showcased

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.900 
that and how cooler was only showcased
with<00:02:06.000> his<00:02:06.149> power<00:02:06.439> for<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.470> group<00:02:07.740> five<00:02:08.519> or<00:02:08.729> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
with his power for a group five or so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.190 
with his power for a group five or so
minutes<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.450> didn't<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.780> didn't<00:02:09.989> really

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
minutes and it didn't it didn't really

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.600 
minutes and it didn't it didn't really
show<00:02:10.790> how<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:11.849> was<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.480> push<00:02:12.769> go<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.430> his

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
show how he was to push go to to his

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.710 
show how he was to push go to to his
limits<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.310> think<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.599> who

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
limits like I think the I I think who

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.470 
limits like I think the I I think who
was<00:02:18.900> armored<00:02:19.230> squadron<00:02:19.709> gay<00:02:19.890> um<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:21.239> through
