rebuild kits from has everything for the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.939 
rebuild kits from has everything for the
carburetors<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> also<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.470> I've<00:00:31.560> noticed

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
carburetors and also what I've noticed

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.400 
carburetors and also what I've noticed
is<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.669> thing<00:00:32.940> says<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.020> empty<00:00:34.260> on

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
is is that this thing says it's empty on

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.500 
is is that this thing says it's empty on
the<00:00:34.530> fuel<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.950> guess<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.300> empty

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the fuel and guess what it's not empty

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
the fuel and guess what it's not empty
so<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.930> tells<00:00:37.380> me<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.160> float

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
so that tells me that the little float

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.940 
so that tells me that the little float
mechanism<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> fuel<00:00:39.930> sender<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.379> dead<00:00:40.649> so

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
mechanism on the fuel sender is dead so

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.440 
mechanism on the fuel sender is dead so
I'm<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.790> order<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.059> new<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.360> of

you<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.060> never<00:01:45.270> never<00:01:46.049> got

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you that this just never never got

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.380 
you that this just never never got
serviced<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.640> tell<00:01:47.790> by<00:01:47.850> looking<00:01:48.000> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
serviced but I can tell by looking in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.850 
serviced but I can tell by looking in
the<00:01:48.509> exhaust<00:01:48.869> ports<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.470> side<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the exhaust ports the side of the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
the exhaust ports the side of the
Pistons<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.490> good<00:01:50.610> shape<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:50.909> hopefully

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Pistons are in good shape so hopefully

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.780 
Pistons are in good shape so hopefully
we've<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.020> got<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.100> basically

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
we've just got a you know a basically

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.609 
we've just got a you know a basically
clogged<00:01:54.060> fuel<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.600> fuel<00:01:54.899> filters<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.500> each

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
clogged fuel with fuel filters in each

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.800 
clogged fuel with fuel filters in each
one<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> these<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.509> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
one of these or that this one and that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.200 
one of these or that this one and that
one<00:01:58.130> they<00:01:59.130> caused<00:01:59.369> those<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> burn<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> hole<00:02:00.119> in

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
one they caused those to burn a hole in

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.960 
one they caused those to burn a hole in
the<00:02:00.299> piston<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.469> I'm<00:02:01.560> hoping

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
the piston so that's what I'm hoping

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.880 
the piston so that's what I'm hoping
so<00:02:03.420> everything<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.110> part<00:02:04.290> out<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.740> one

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
so everything is a part out of this one

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.290 
so everything is a part out of this one
so<00:02:05.130> far<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.910> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.120> start

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
so far and I'm just going to start

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.820 
so far and I'm just going to start
little<00:02:06.600> by<00:02:06.690> little<00:02:06.960> tearing<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.380> apart<00:02:07.470> I'm

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
little by little tearing it apart I'm

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.109 
little by little tearing it apart I'm
gonna<00:02:07.950> drain<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.130> fuel<00:02:08.490> out<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.850> get<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
gonna drain the fuel out of it get the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.750 
gonna drain the fuel out of it get the
gas<00:02:09.300> tank<00:02:09.630> out<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.890> see<00:02:11.070> if<00:02:11.130> I<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:11.520> son

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
gas tank out and see if I can get my son

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
gas tank out and see if I can get my son
out<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.390> duct<00:02:12.690> tape<00:02:12.900> off<00:02:13.080> of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
out here to get this duct tape off of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.740 
out here to get this duct tape off of
here<00:02:13.760> I'm<00:02:14.760> kind<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.090> thinking<00:02:15.210> about<00:02:15.450> shooting

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
here I'm kind of thinking about shooting

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.230 
here I'm kind of thinking about shooting
some<00:02:16.020> clear<00:02:16.380> over<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.970> kind<00:02:18.120> of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
some clear over this just to kind of

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.740 
some clear over this just to kind of
spiff<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.110> little<00:02:19.200> bit<00:02:20.300> no<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.510> isn't

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
spiff it up a little bit no it isn't

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.270 
spiff it up a little bit no it isn't
perfect<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.680> know<00:02:22.770> at<00:02:22.890> least<00:02:23.070> it's

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
perfect but you know at least it's

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.880 
perfect but you know at least it's
better<00:02:23.970> than<00:02:24.090> nothing<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> little<00:02:25.680> clearer

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
better than nothing and a little clearer

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.160 
better than nothing and a little clearer
on<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.190> make<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.490> look<00:02:26.610> good<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.150> all<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
on it make it look good and all the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.590 
on it make it look good and all the
little<00:02:28.800> marks<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.400> where<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:30.090> lifted<00:02:30.450> this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
little marks that where we lifted this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.120 
little marks that where we lifted this
thing<00:02:30.810> up<00:02:30.990> off<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.410> cherry<00:02:31.620> picker<00:02:31.830> went

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
thing up off of the cherry picker went

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.370 
thing up off of the cherry picker went
away<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.400> apparently<00:02:33.060> they<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.240> kind<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.080> self

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
away so apparently they do kind of self

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.040 
away so apparently they do kind of self
recover<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.850> that's<00:02:36.210> kind<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> update<00:02:36.840> now

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
recover so that's kind of the update now

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.370 
recover so that's kind of the update now

know<00:02:52.350> how<00:02:52.500> dirty<00:02:52.740> they<00:02:52.950> are<00:02:52.980> because<00:02:53.730> I'd

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
know how dirty they are because I'd

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.060 
know how dirty they are because I'd
really<00:02:54.120> like<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.540> use<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.050> carbs<00:02:55.380> off<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.770> 95

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
really like to use the carbs off my 95

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.040 
really like to use the carbs off my 95
SLX<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.060> somebody<00:02:57.360> told<00:02:57.510> me<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.780> they<00:02:57.900> have

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
SLX but somebody told me that they have

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.810 
SLX but somebody told me that they have
a<00:02:58.080> different<00:02:58.290> jetting<00:02:58.860> I'm<00:02:59.459> actually<00:02:59.580> gonna

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
a different jetting I'm actually gonna

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.820 
a different jetting I'm actually gonna
take<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.180> diaphragm<00:03:00.600> covers<00:03:00.959> off<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.170> verify

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
take the diaphragm covers off and verify

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.650 
take the diaphragm covers off and verify
that<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.790> different<00:03:03.120> jetting<00:03:03.450> then

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
that they have different jetting then

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.510 
that they have different jetting then
you<00:03:04.020> know<00:03:04.080> we<00:03:04.590> got<00:03:04.709> an<00:03:04.800> issue<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.130> got<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.430> make

you know we got an issue I got to make

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.160 
you know we got an issue I got to make
sure<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.670> swap<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:06.810> those<00:03:06.989> are

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
sure I swap that out but those are

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.110 
sure I swap that out but those are
freshly<00:03:07.650> rebuilt<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.670> want<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.880> make<00:03:08.970> sure

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
freshly rebuilt and I want to make sure

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
that's it everything is rolling along

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.940
