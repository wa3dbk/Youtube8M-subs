not hitting the back of the shoe a lot

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.670 
not hitting the back of the shoe a lot
that's<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.430> original<00:02:34.970> color<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.680> shoe

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
it looks different than that but that

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.490 
it looks different than that but that
would<00:03:40.639> be<00:03:40.669> a<00:03:41.030> basic<00:03:41.569> description<00:03:42.169> of<00:03:42.260> what<00:03:42.470> I

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500
