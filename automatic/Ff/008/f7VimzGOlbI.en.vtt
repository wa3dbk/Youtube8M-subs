00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.740
 A recent study showed that regular drinkers are less likely to die 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.890
 before it's time 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.299
 Then people who indulge in alcohol never 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.369
 Time reports which abstain from alcohol 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.060
 It seems quite to connect to a shorter but then harmonious life 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.440
 Moderate drinking 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.710
 This study was closely controlled in individuals aged 55 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.300
 And 65 years 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.860
 The span of twenty years represents variables ranging from 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.140
 Social and economic status to the level of physical activity 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.810
 Found that mortality rates were higher for those who did not 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.260
 Drink at all for less heavy drinkers 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.890
 The West is low for moderate drinkers who enjoy 2:59 drinks 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.880
 In the day over 1824 participants in the study 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.730
 41 percent of moderate drinkers died prematurely 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.649
 Compared with 69 percent% uh non-Sharabi 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.750
 Heavy drinkers were in the middle in a 60 percent mortality rate 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.150
 Despite the increased risk of liver cirrhosis 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.920
 And several types of cancer not to mention alcoholism 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.409
 A car accident in poor governance is generally associated with excessive drinking 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.650
 Those who drink are less likely to die 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.690
 Of those who do not drink at all even 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.479
 The possible explanation for the study is that 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.830
 Alcohol can be the right lubricant and social that 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.680
 Those with friends who have an active social life 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.290
 I tend to be the longest life social network with the right to do associated with 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.150
 Longer life 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.580
 If we look at it I would 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.799
 Can not be drawn immediately because it is the explanation I would like to say 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.990
 The question I want to answer is what 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.170
 They are those who do not drink at all do 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.259
 Or do not do so differs from those who drink moderately 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.500
 And those who drink a lot of it 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.890
 It is something that maybe those who drink moderately drink heavy 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.910
 As you do or do not do 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.030
 Other than just being more social because they are drinking 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.709
 Which is actually an issue of a longer life for alcohol 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.340
 It does not seem like the study suggests that it is alcohol 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.630
 Consumption consumption 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.340
 There is a se leads to a longer life right 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.020
 I know they can have some benefits to reduce stress 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.080
 I knew even arming the benefits of the heart 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.610
 In small quantities by in and I do not think that would be the leader I would say to 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.200
 Individuals 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.910
 Think about the people you know refuse to drink who never drank 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.520
 I just and I do not know Ito analyzed this kind of person maybe there are some 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.040
 directione 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.629
 Yes I do not know I mean if I think of people I know who absolutely 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.950
 Never drink 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.860
 They are definitely in the general public who are 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.980
 A bit more tense but at the same time 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.440
 I'm nervous and I drink and even I do not know that really 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.489
 It is the exact thing but most people I know who do not drink at all 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.400
 In fact do not drink because they know that they have a family history of alcoholism 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.610
 And they do not even want to open that door which actually looks like very 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.370
 The responsible thing to do 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.519
 Add right I think maybe something 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.410
 We should have bought in the equation both of us a lottery issue because that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.590
 Makes perfect sense there right 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.860
 Yes I am opening this to the public what your opinion of what you are referring to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.430
 to me 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.569
 Do not buy the idea that it is simply the social lubrication side 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.900
 Alcohol consumption that is linked with life is longer there is something 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.720
 About those who do not eat that link probably but life is shorter than causing 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.550
 Life is shorter 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.840
 I'm really ready for all the ideas on this one
