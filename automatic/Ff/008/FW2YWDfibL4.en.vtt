00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
wood screws and some blocks of wood

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.689 
wood screws and some blocks of wood
we're<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.650> turn<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.949> track<00:00:17.250> into<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
we're going to turn this track into a

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.210 
we're going to turn this track into a
giant<00:00:18.210> ramp<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.590> really<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:20.010> those

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
giant ramp so we can really make those

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.300 
giant ramp so we can really make those
hydrogels<00:00:21.090> perform<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> shoot<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.439> top

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
hydrogels perform as I shoot up on top

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.700 
hydrogels perform as I shoot up on top
of<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.640> pool<00:00:24.019> we<00:00:25.019> will<00:00:25.140> need<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> cover<00:00:25.529> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
of the pool we will need the cover on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.810 
of the pool we will need the cover on
again<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.279> wouldn't<00:00:26.519> really<00:00:26.609> go

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
again because they wouldn't really go
