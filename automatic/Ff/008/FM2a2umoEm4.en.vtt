00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 welcome to this tutorial of converts 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.060
 chst or hd new software from 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.360
 conversion of all video formats to 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.880
 blu-ray format becomes software so 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.889
 here is how the software works 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.619
 very very simply just a few clicks 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.740
 if you already know our convert x 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.890
 to dvd that it's going to convert that to the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.570
 dvd you will notice that the interface 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 is almost the same and totally 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.260
 identical so no need for tutorials 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.750
 for you know how to use it yourself 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.730
 know it's super easy to use 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 now for others who are we 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.809
 join in the universe vs at 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 welcome and so I will show you 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.160
 how in a few clicks you go 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.500
 can convert any format 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 of video in blu-ray and the bass and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.489
 then on blu ray so here I have 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.930
 inserted a video file a small file 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.840
 video we can certainly a file on 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.309
 press this little icon towards me 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 it's done so here we see now 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.070
 so it was inserted here we see very 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.090
 important video preview so 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.530
 you will be able to play the file 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.290
 here you go with thanks to this screen 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.189
 to check all of them all 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.920
 the changes you're going to make the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.110
 video will be able to be seen live thanks 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 to the preview so the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.439
 changes precisely they go they are 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.920
 just under it are very easy to 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.960
 use 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.580
 so first thing if you do not have 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.170
 want to add subtitles or 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.000
 make editing changes on the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 video you can simply supported 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.930
 right now on convert the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.909
 conversion will start automatically 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.250
 and then in the end you will be asked to care 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.930
 to insert a blu ray disc if you 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.130
 want engraved on blu ray or so if 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.079
 you want to make an iso image or 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.400
 just kept me converting on 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.900
 your pc to be able to put it on a 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 usb key for example 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.619
 so that's just for those who 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.509
 do not want to bother we put the file 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.310
 we put several voices there you can 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.880
 put several and we could 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.470
 reconvert 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.360
 now for those who want to go 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.610
 a little further so here is just a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.979
 a short overview of the options 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.020
 available so of course the audio you 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.460
 can add remove files 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.899
 audio 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 same for subtitles the sub 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.090
 titles I'm already there on the video 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.050
 but just to show you that's it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
 how do we 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.190
 insert a subtitle file on 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.710
 support stay for small 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.440
 options and you can change the size 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.480
 the font the color imposition the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.560
 cottage if you have subtitles 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.530
 in a language with characters 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.800
 special options for example 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.840
 advanced obviously if you want that's it 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.210
 it's very simple now we go to 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.170
 chapter then by default the software 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.780
 you see he will add a chapter 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.920
 every five minutes 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.630
 now you can change that yourself 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.730
 can remove them completely you 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.200
 can move for example go 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.610
 learn chapter 2 you see there he 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.070
 at five minutes we'll just 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.750
 bursts with the mouse we move 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.430
 and there you see that his position has 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.860
 changed so it can be very late very 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.240
 interesting to stall a stack chapter 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.710
 at a time a moment where you want 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.540
 in the video to be able to navigate more 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.100
 easily 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.160
 then contrast and 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.640
 brightness so always with a rendering 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.670
 live 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.670
 look hop you'll see the quality 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.320
 finally the brightness of the image that will 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.940
 decline and then again if I play 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.770
 So here you go, see all of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.570
 then the result is that you 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.850
 allows to really have something 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.680
 very personalized then to do 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.270
 rotate the video obviously that it can 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.870
 to be useful if you have videos of 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.400
 smartphones that are often charged to 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.050
 backwards anyway on their side so 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.950
 there we can rotate the video 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.300
 now and options for the image 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.680
 in itself the size of the image by 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.350
 report to your screen if you have a 16 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.930
 9th or 30th so you can add some 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.459
 black bars or shooting and the video 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.020
 finally here it is the same with always the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.390
 live water rendering 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.950
 then very very important option very 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.870
 interesting to remove pieces 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.580
 videos so if you're advertising or or 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.870
 anything you can 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.560
 want removed in the video you can 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.360
 to make it live 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.470
 obviously you can do it 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.360
 many times you are you are not 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.709
 obliged not to limit to one of the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.550
 cuts so I'm going to show you 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.920
 how it works 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.410
 the only thing to remember is that we are going 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.489
 remove the pieces you do not want 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.080
 so for example saying we're going 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.209
 remove I do not know the credits of the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.820
 beginning in any case the beginning I position 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.650
 in the heart here I press on beginning and after 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.720
 I'm going to move hop with the mouse 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.190
 to where I want where we go 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.110
 stop anywhere 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.640
 then we go and we will now validate 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.680
 that's what this part means 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.870
 red here and gnawing sent back from 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.920
 red grid will be removed at the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.440
 conversion of quidams years it is necessary 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.480
 convert so that this piece is 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.980
 removed then here is a cutout 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.590
 video to have a very good result 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.750
 professional something else really so 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.170
 you want for example to stop a 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.700
 cutting pile hair at the moment when the pub 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.400
 stops or if you want a result 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.500
 very very accurate then this option 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.450
 interval and be very useful so there 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.860
 she's on a second and if I press 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.780
 the on this little arrow here you 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.430
 go see the cursor will jump from a 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.190
 second and you will really be able to 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.900
 stall the beginning or the end of the cut 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.720
 really very very accurate 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.150
 this is well past payet at war and 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.230
 then last important option also if 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.270
 for example, you have small 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.860
 camcorder files that wanted 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.380
 stick together to have only one 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.650
 in the end it's here with the option of 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.150
 merge files between them then 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.830
 it's you always put the first 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.680
 file normally in the software 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.680
 always with making a copy 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.360
 pardon drag drop 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.860
 and then it's after here that we go 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.210
 add by clicking here for example 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.790
 second file or the 3rd 4th 5th here and 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.890
 after that it will be a long a long 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.430
 tape with all the videos one to 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.710
 the rest of the others 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.300
 obviously once the conversion made 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.160
 you will have a single file at the end 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.380
 here you have seen a little trick 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.419
 of the available options 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.550
 for editing the video now 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.430
 another very interesting thing with 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.940
 covertix or hd is the fact that one 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.150
 can customize his menus so we 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.630
 we offer these ships several 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.240
 menu templates 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.260
 so here next may be the theme of 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.030
 your video you can adapt the type 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.880
 from menu to the theme of the video show 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.590
 for example we have a video a model for 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:19.470
 the polars that kind of stuff and then 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.810
 that's what we can do 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.100
 also 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.060
 if you are not satisfied with the 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.990
 selection we have or if they wanted 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.680
 really a little further in the 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.050
 personalization 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.430
 you can add your video that will 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.310
 play behind 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.350
 in the background with audio so 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.300
 either the audio of the film or another audio 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.650
 and music for example you have 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.270
 one of the compilations of clips or this 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.940
 kind of things you will be able to 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:46.560
 change the size the text obviously the 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.210
 color his position this is it really 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.820
 a tool that will allow you to have 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.880
 an almost professional result for 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.890
 a very simple software to use that 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.200
 is really for everyone and with 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.990
 options in more good I show you quickly 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.980
 fact more options for 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.870
 people who are really really they 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.050
 want a result at the top I would say 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:13.490
 with hardware acceleration for 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.660
 get an idea of quick conversions 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.800
 your the choice of filters for the 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.800
 video processing so that was a 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.050
 little more advanced really and then well 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.740
 sure the engraving so the engraving on blu
