00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.870
 nobody nobody of what is seeing us is 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 that each publisher each developer 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.550
 developers of the studies according to 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.700
 this source will be the system of achievements 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.360
 each study can add achievements without 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.519
 need to launch tlc to the game by 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.080
 example on a weekend where you 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.360
 celebrate special events 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.530
 interned or interrelate the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.900
 games of the same distributor of 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.250
 so that the achievements obtained can be 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.010
 grant both games at the same time 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.510

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.370
 PlayStation 4 will have a very system 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.930

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.070
