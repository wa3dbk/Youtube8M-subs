00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 we have a little evening here today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.639
 organized around the topic 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 Electromobility to come to speak 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 it all has a certain 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.210
 development background and the whole 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.870
 has here at the site ultimately 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.990
 began 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.020
 with the extension of the sea-town aspern here 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 as a smart city project for us that was 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.640
 Here also the question how can we 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.949
 from research development we 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.179
 we can on the part of the 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.489
 production technology here an active 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.160
 Contribute to the development of this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.930
 project here material and how can 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.300
 we contribute to that here 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.149
 Added value here comes with us 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.870
 Value added is also one 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.550
 service function afford that we 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.140
 create functions and the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 Question was in this 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 what correlates with that here 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.230
 project Seestadt aspern and that was it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.989
 topic mobility just that then we 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.850
 selected and selected 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.879
 we also have a certain amount here 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.699
 innovate mobility that is 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.549
 electrically powered systems the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.659
 a more fun in the movement too 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.790
 to mediate 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 thus also the function of the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.260
 to expand means of transport 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.110
 and we're giving them here today 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.780
 the few little pieces of information 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.900
 We inform you what we are about 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.900
 do 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.239
