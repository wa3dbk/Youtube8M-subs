 firm gamakatsu 16 number if its exactly 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.550
 also let's say they don’t 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.079
 match the format it significantly 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:38.899

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.300
 The wire and the same hook is made of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.350
 fine wire 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.610
