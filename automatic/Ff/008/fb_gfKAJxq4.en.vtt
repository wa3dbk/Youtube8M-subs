someone<00:04:01.910> dying<00:04:02.270> quite<00:04:02.780> soon<00:04:03.170> just<00:04:03.620> some<00:04:03.770> of

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
someone dying quite soon just some of

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.030 
someone dying quite soon just some of
the<00:04:04.400> solid<00:04:04.820> shots<00:04:05.060> as<00:04:05.240> once<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:06.470> likelihood

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
the solid shots as once the likelihood

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.520 
the solid shots as once the likelihood
that<00:04:07.070> are<00:04:07.220> missing<00:04:07.340> again<00:04:07.820> is<00:04:08.320> probably<00:04:09.320> quite

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
that are missing again is probably quite

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.130 
that are missing again is probably quite
slim<00:04:11.380> i<00:04:12.760> think<00:04:13.760> one<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.240> them<00:04:14.510> allows<00:04:14.750> us<00:04:14.960> to

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
slim i think one of them allows us to

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
slim i think one of them allows us to
have<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.320> name<00:04:15.590> shot<00:04:16.010> will<00:04:17.290> allow<00:04:18.290> them<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.950> have

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
have a name shot will allow them to have

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.300 
have a name shot will allow them to have
a<00:04:19.370> snapshot<00:04:19.850> in<00:04:20.270> other<00:04:20.660> words<00:04:20.930> if<00:04:21.320> an<00:04:22.160> alien

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
a snapshot in other words if an alien

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.440 
a snapshot in other words if an alien
shoot<00:04:22.760> at<00:04:22.940> us<00:04:23.060> in<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.530> we<00:04:25.460> if<00:04:25.820> we<00:04:26.030> see<00:04:26.240> them

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
shoot at us in that we if we see them

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.270 
shoot at us in that we if we see them
could<00:04:26.690> potentially<00:04:27.110> get<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.260> snapshot<00:04:27.560> off<00:04:28.100> of

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
could potentially get a snapshot off of

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.790 
could potentially get a snapshot off of
them<00:04:28.490> which<00:04:29.240> is<00:04:29.270> inaccurate<00:04:29.750> ha<00:04:30.140> no<00:04:30.200> no<00:04:30.680> one

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
shot cosmic thought but apparently

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.060 
shot cosmic thought but apparently
Kenneth<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.840> think<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.260> goes<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.680> one<00:04:33.830> who's

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
Kenneth I think it goes the one who's

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.590 
Kenneth I think it goes the one who's
closest<00:04:34.670> Thursday<00:04:35.590> so<00:04:36.590> Kenneth<00:04:37.160> can<00:04:38.030> you<00:04:38.300> see

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
closest Thursday so Kenneth can you see

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.970 
closest Thursday so Kenneth can you see
are<00:04:38.900> we<00:04:39.050> can<00:04:39.260> see<00:04:39.530> an<00:04:39.650> alien<00:04:40.010> submarine<00:04:41.980> so

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
are we can see an alien submarine so

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.080 
are we can see an alien submarine so
keep<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.790> I<00:04:44.480> believe<00:04:44.900> annealing<00:04:45.850> makes<00:04:46.850> you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
keep you I believe annealing makes you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.000 
keep you I believe annealing makes you
more<00:04:47.270> accurate<00:04:47.900> but<00:04:48.230> that<00:04:48.440> might<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:48.650> mean

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
more accurate but that might just mean

00:04:49.010 --> 00:05:00.350 
more accurate but that might just mean
that<00:04:49.040> they<00:04:49.370> may<00:04:49.520> talk<00:04:49.760> me<00:04:49.940> out<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.120> my<00:04:50.330> house

all<00:05:06.000> right<00:05:06.150> let's<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:06.569> search<00:05:06.720> you<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.110> a<00:05:07.139> few

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
all right let's just search you to a few

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:19.439 
all right let's just search you to a few
times<00:05:08.630> ok<00:05:10.819> fire<00:05:11.819> speed<00:05:12.240> that's<00:05:13.099> it

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.839 

well<00:05:20.080> once<00:05:20.409> night<00:05:20.740> has<00:05:21.279> less<00:05:21.490> than<00:05:21.699> ideal

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
well once night has less than ideal

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.119 
well once night has less than ideal
really<00:05:22.559> because<00:05:23.559> I<00:05:23.650> think<00:05:23.710> he's<00:05:23.979> probably

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
really because I think he's probably

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.519 
really because I think he's probably
going<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.520> end<00:05:24.550> up<00:05:24.729> in<00:05:24.879> his<00:05:24.999> shop<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.169> next

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
going to end up in his shop in the next

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.619 
going to end up in his shop in the next
