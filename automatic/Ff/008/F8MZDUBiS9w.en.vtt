 I want to introduce you to someone 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.450
 Actually, it's a lot 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.809
 happy man so that is always 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.230
 funny when he comes to the studio and 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.510
 but now one speaks one man one feels 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.300
 that he is really into the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.430
 Character that he is in the character 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.500
 So yes , he's coming to that 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.160
 character is of course that is super 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:20.420

 riva got riva that's it 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.320
 she is worth a narration in novigrad 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.430
 not in vain either where we should 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.090
 is still looking for salary is definitely 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:38.810
 relatively short baron is on 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.450
 edge of madness trade so clearly 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.250
 there would be quite a lot for me 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.259
 come to mind 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.360
 He is definitely one one 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:53.950
 positive hero figure tries that 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.950
 to do right and I like that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.570
 I always told her 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.430
 you do not have to be so pretty 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.539
 Now I've preached that to you and what 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.060
 are you doing there are funny beings with 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.500
 dents and any long fingers 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.690
 and and so it's a bit 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.210
 scary that too for me in mind though 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.830
 the targeted he actually gives me then 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.770
 Trust again a bit because he is so 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.660
 as a mentor occurs and can completely 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.670
 but always keep your finger in my head 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.100
 bother always makes sure that 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.590
 works properly 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.220
 the user valve autumn so much 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.760
 nice long way she has returned 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.920
 siri and me are playing this year 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 I'm such a thing who knows what she wants 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.950
 and can prevail and actually 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.840
 the whole time is on journey and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.200
 nowhere is home moment and 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.200
 Beginning 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.400
 Well, uncle, who will you ever see me ? 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.650
 good a sound oil still looks white for a long time 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.320
 lost and in the game it works 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.360
 then to look for me because I 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.630
 to be followed and to see that it is me 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.630
 goes well 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.740
 Games are getting bigger and bigger 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.470
 already very rapidly developed that one 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.720
 if you compare a feature film now 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.080
 I say that in the cut now 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.570
 1000 tx can be 1200 ours 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.540
 Computer game and feature come as well 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.990
 already easily 30 to 40 thousand text 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.060
 together 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.790
 we have when we are done today 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.790
 only in 2003 did i shape after 10.000 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.690
 the nearer the premiere values ​​are the more 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.330
 is worth more because the game 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.970
 looks really good and so if you are 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.810
 if you talk to us now 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.840
 take up 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.760
 then adjust the game is no going 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.330
 then the characters become now 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.550
 alive and there you finally feel 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.550
 that it's almost done
