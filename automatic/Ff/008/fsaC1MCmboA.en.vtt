00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 as box dolls, however, this one already has 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.660
 showed up coming from america me 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.660
 a friend of mine had brought her in 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.889
 2011 therefore and coming from the gods like 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.440
 one can well see is precisely and the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.100
 version of pocahontas still with i 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.460
 lower limbs and are not given here 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.090
 they are splash or kansas color and with lo 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.670
 splash john smith still in boxes 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.279
 then found in Milan precisely here in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.640
 Italy 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.989
 as you can see this is the back 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.989
 of the package of both 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.260
 then we move on to signing brains version 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.789
 of pocahontas that I did for you 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.160
 see I must xstrata but wanted 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.110
 obviously buy it back and in the box 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.149
 original because it is worth much more 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.190
 found in America, unfortunately, however 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.719
 team here was a little ruined and it is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.250
 been incellophanata with the card from 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.440
 kitchen function so i wanted to 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.100
 enough to laugh though at least it is in state 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.229
 the original but it has been opened and I am 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.600
 sent this one from America too 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 version of pocahontas that you can 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 to see is what I told you before 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.729
 edition of play store still in the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.369
 original box 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.750
 already the fact that it is quite rare though 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.869
 I found it in the original box 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 so that I made the deal 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.030
 absolutely fine as can be seen 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.880
 there were the princesses of the Cinderella 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.560
 aurora snow white jasmine nudges that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.900
 at the time she was still the princess then 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.600
 obviously luckily they took away some 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.250
 counters excused 3 and ariel that second 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.299
 they were much much more detailed and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.590
 much more beautiful than the ones they do 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 now there is no store 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.869
 in the eight always from mere America made 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.540
 send the cost winter version 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.540
 send me that it was like a version 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 limited edition that was in effect 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.799
 in 1995 and actually found it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.689
 at a price still quite 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.850
 reasonable because solved they shoot of 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.520
 absurd figures and instead I won 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 right at the auction for quite a little 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.259
 maybe they were a 9 euro a stuff of the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.239
 gender 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.150
 because it usually costs 45 today 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.940
 his boxing free postage and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.370
 so fortunately I managed to 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.900
 find I also mico still 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.819
 theoretically it should have words that 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.550
 the journey must be lost within the radius 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.870
 so a few nights travel in the middle of the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.209
 bottom of the box or this one I have it 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.640
 also found this in america sankara 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.890
 pocahontas with still fleet 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.300
 how can you see the friend that one 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.720
 baby could go to the tito era 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:40.370
 all a ring so it was a kind a 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.500
 new game or speed up the collection 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.049
 where exactly one could see very well who 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.660
 I do the part of what is always in 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.810
 italy precisely I managed to find 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.280
 suncor kockum that as can be seen 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.790
 I managed to complete with the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.799
 objects found in the French auction 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.799
 and still this boxed note 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.880
 this is the package for the series here 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.290
 in Italy I managed to do for the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.209
 short and pocahontas with still friend 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.400
 precisely that he did the three cs 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.180
 hair and accessories where, however, the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.609
 box is really stuff 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.630
 embarrassing I don't know what the hell 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:22.840
 have seen why it is really a thing 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.239
 hallucinating I would not like to define 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.120
 exactly what it is because it sucks though 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.470
 at least I hope he was never gods 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.510
 boc was even if this foreshortening 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.579
 Initially I would have doubts about it 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.310
 what at least to the package 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.079
 original so it should be overflight over 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.510
 done that actually a lot 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.959
 disaster always here in Italy I said 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.170
 I was found in this version of 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.860
 spirit of love pocahontas with john smith 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.270
 just a rate 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.040
 foreign said dellacasa home with her 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.760
 without presentation necklace but does it 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.340
 that is, of the type alive the coherence and 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.140
 moreover, in the last nico years ago 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.990
 I found this version there 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.740
 quite rare of styling kits 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.850
 pocahontas or rather that it will be alone 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.340
 the bust of pocahontas that a little girl 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.890
 as can be seen illustration could 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.930
 cover king unfortunately was styling 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.109
 the box ata therefore with all the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.320
 accessories scattered for a ride to 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.200
 the box but my fantastic genius has 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.370
 decided to put everything back in place 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.290
 re-glue the whole package 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.540
 conviction had never been opened e 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.630
 so officially if I could define 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.760
 that I have a brand new pocahontas 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.820
 then this was the one who spoke to me 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.470
 from America 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.419
 basically it's a suitcase where 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.070
 precisely here we can see that it contained 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.560
 in the 4 dolls among other things this doll 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.390
 girl for sale if someone wants her 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.880
 the pulls behind for two euro type there is one 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.620
 really embarrassing stuff here 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.800
 there were memo contents and accessories of 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.010
 pocahontas and the 4 dolls then 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.150
 pocahontas as joe smith is precisely the 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:10.780
 protagonist is cup and at the disney store 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.460
 then I had reported a while ago 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.030
 the pocahontas animators 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.669
 how well we can see that she was aware 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.140
 created just to almost celebrate them all 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.180
 then there were more princesses 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.180
 beautiful snow-white aurora and all the others 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.979
 then i found in america my favorites is 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:35.060
 happy or collection where there were precisely 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.950
 it does not seem very beautiful to me and perhaps that dawn 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.020
 they were this version I don't know for which 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.660
 strange reason several of clothes a little 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.860
 different from the usual and therefore with i 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.370
 characters that could also be 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.479
 detached used type as pop up then 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.419
 I found it in America ed 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.100
 actually very beautiful I did not think 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.720
 never find it here as it can 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.130
 see this the back of the package 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.630
 there was also a so you were right 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.540
 the two of them then there was also the game 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.770
 of the pocahontas type 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.860
 so everything has been sending some of the 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.170
 casper and lastly I would like to say but 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.160
 this is my collector's piece of 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:16.410
 I boast if the boys ended up in the mayor 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:20.890
 her own wind box 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:26.620
 here it is as if it appears inside the 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:31.960
 box this is the inside and her 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.460
 the conflict just a friend 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.530
 I had forgotten to show that I have 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.840
 Also tv characters loose mico 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.460
 precisely fleet that I found in the various 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.170
 lots of sickness is nothing but a great loss 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.210
 also because you can see them here as 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:49.060
 so this is the glass one 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:54.010
 really empty but this is kind of 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.050
 tablet ahec and brisk ediction to behold 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.950
 so it's often edition and therefore 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:03.280
 really very nice and for 50 euros 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:06.790
 ok let's leave it so this is it 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.860
 my collection of pocahontas that is 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.680
 it is always expanding 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.180
 I will always continue to expand it and vi 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.840
 I will keep you updated on my fantastic i 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.520
