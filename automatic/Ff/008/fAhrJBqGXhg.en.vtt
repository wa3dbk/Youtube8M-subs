00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
are just gonna have to wait so what
you're<00:01:44.790> gonna<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.270> click<00:01:45.570> you're<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.899> dance

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
you're gonna do is click you're a dance

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.740 
you're gonna do is click you're a dance
motion<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.130> chose<00:01:47.520> white<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> was

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
motion and I chose white because it was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
motion and I chose white because it was
probably<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> most<00:01:49.170> distinct<00:01:49.590> color<00:01:49.770> change

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
probably the most distinct color change

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.340 
probably the most distinct color change
between<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> white<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.329> blue<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.200> as

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
between the white and the blue and as

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
between the white and the blue and as
you<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.250> split<00:01:53.579> second<00:01:53.939> I'm

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you can see for that split second I'm

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.660 
you can see for that split second I'm
turning<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.630> weird<00:01:55.020> light<00:01:55.380> blue<00:01:55.770> color<00:01:56.100> now

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
turning a weird light blue color now

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
turning a weird light blue color now
when<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.909> slow<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.479> clip<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.170> guys<00:01:58.290> will
