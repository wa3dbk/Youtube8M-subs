not want to be a member of the Orlando
Magic<00:00:25.500> he<00:00:25.830> demanded<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.430> trade<00:00:26.670> earlier<00:00:27.090> this

keep it moving

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.450 
keep it moving
I<00:00:30.570> guess<00:00:31.080> Jameer<00:00:31.470> Nelson<00:00:31.500> isn't<00:00:32.130> good<00:00:32.430> enough

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I guess Jameer Nelson isn't good enough

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.340 
I guess Jameer Nelson isn't good enough
for<00:00:32.730> him<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> Shaquille<00:00:33.660> O'Neal<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.200> know

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
for him and Shaquille O'Neal we know

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
for him and Shaquille O'Neal we know
he's<00:00:34.559> an<00:00:34.710> analyst<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.280> TNC<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.059> he<00:00:36.630> doesn't

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
he's an analyst for TNC now he doesn't

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.590 
he's an analyst for TNC now he doesn't
do<00:00:37.079> much<00:00:37.290> analyzing<00:00:38.040> most<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.489> his<00:00:38.610> analysis

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
do much analyzing most of his analysis

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.970 
do much analyzing most of his analysis
generally<00:00:39.840> goes<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
generally goes like this

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.700 
generally goes like this
so<00:00:41.700> what<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.879> think<00:00:41.969> he<00:00:42.149> needs<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.780> don't

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
so what I think he needs to do is don't

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
so what I think he needs to do is don't
the<00:00:43.800> ball<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.160> bit<00:00:44.309> more<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.969> that's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the ball a little bit more and that's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
the ball a little bit more and that's
what<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.230> watch<00:00:46.500> Shaq<00:00:46.890> every

Howard it seems like four years at a
point<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.259> time<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.950> were<00:01:20.130> cool<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.580> were

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
point in time they were cool they were

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
point in time they were cool they were
dancing<00:01:20.939> together<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:22.140> were<00:01:22.200> hugging<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
out and I don't know if it's the whole

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
out and I don't know if it's the whole
Superman<00:01:24.720> thing<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.619> Shaq<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.009> needs<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
Superman thing but Shaq just needs to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.300

relax chill out and let him live in my

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
relax chill out and let him live in my
opinion<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.090> Shaquille<00:01:30.750> O'Neal<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
opinion I think Shaquille O'Neal was a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
opinion I think Shaquille O'Neal was a
better<00:01:32.009> player<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.360> in

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
better player and will go down in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
better player and will go down in
