honestly think if you put like a good 10

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.760 
honestly think if you put like a good 10
15<00:01:19.090> minutes<00:01:19.659> into<00:01:20.079> it<00:01:20.229> you<00:01:20.380> could<00:01:20.560> probably

about<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:28.400> has<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> really<00:02:29.060> short<00:02:29.390> wheelbase

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
about it has a really short wheelbase

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.559 
about it has a really short wheelbase
which<00:02:30.140> explains<00:02:30.500> why<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.890> snappy<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.569> it

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
which explains why it's snappy and it

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.010 
which explains why it's snappy and it
does<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:34.010> has<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:35.360> ton<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.630> power<00:02:35.720> like

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020

does and it has a ton of power like
I<00:02:36.260> think<00:02:36.680> it's<00:02:36.800> seven<00:02:37.070> or<00:02:37.160> eight<00:02:37.280> hundred<00:02:37.670> or

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.730 
I think it's seven or eight hundred or
something<00:02:38.030> at<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.110> has<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> really<00:02:39.500> good

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740

is<00:02:42.080> on<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.320> right<00:02:42.500> side<00:02:42.740> that's<00:02:43.100> where<00:02:43.250> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
is on the right side that's where the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.220 
is on the right side that's where the
exhaust<00:02:43.640> comes<00:02:43.850> out<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.750> find<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:44.959> cool

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459

it's right there you see um it tastes a
bit<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.760> time<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.060> get<00:02:53.150> used<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:53.660> it's

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
bit of time to get used to because it's

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.930 
bit of time to get used to because it's
very<00:02:54.110> light<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.650> stops<00:02:54.950> really<00:02:55.310> quick<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.820> so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
very light it stops really quick and so

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
mistake a few times and short wheelbase

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.449 
mistake a few times and short wheelbase
it<00:03:02.000> snaps<00:03:02.269> easily<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.110> holding<00:03:03.769> Jets<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.310> all

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459

originally<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.590> made<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> drip<00:03:16.700> bill<00:03:16.880> for<00:03:17.090> this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
originally I made a drip bill for this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.660 
originally I made a drip bill for this
car<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.660> wanted<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.500> make<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> jelly<00:03:19.250> bill<00:03:19.430> but

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
car I wanted to make it a jelly bill but

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.449 
car I wanted to make it a jelly bill but
that<00:03:19.850> didn't<00:03:20.150> work<00:03:20.209> out<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.769> why<00:03:22.100> I

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
that didn't work out so that is why I

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.580 
that didn't work out so that is why I
tried<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:22.910> one<00:03:23.120> Aereo<00:03:23.420> 360<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.410> almost

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
tried this one Aereo 360 and I almost

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.259 
tried this one Aereo 360 and I almost
look<00:03:24.920> at<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.310> almost<00:03:25.459> had<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.880> exit<00:03:26.239> I

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
look at that I almost had the exit I

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.060 
look at that I almost had the exit I
just<00:03:26.600> didn't<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.989> right<00:03:27.350> right<00:03:27.590> right<00:03:27.650> I

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
just didn't have it right right right I

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.280 
just didn't have it right right right I
would<00:03:28.670> straight<00:03:29.060> for<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.450> wall<00:03:29.630> at<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.049> place

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
would straight for the wall at the place

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.620 
would straight for the wall at the place
of<00:03:30.440> continuing<00:03:30.920> I'd<00:03:31.790> over<00:03:32.030> here<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:32.299> see<00:03:32.510> me

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
of continuing I'd over here you see me

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.090 
of continuing I'd over here you see me
do<00:03:32.750> some<00:03:32.959> tricky<00:03:33.260> drifting<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.739> I'm<00:03:33.920> like

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
do some tricky drifting and I'm like

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.069 
do some tricky drifting and I'm like
okay<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:34.610> can<00:03:34.880> do<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.000> bit<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.209> drifting<00:03:35.630> here<00:03:35.840> but

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
okay I can do a bit of drifting here but

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.259 
okay I can do a bit of drifting here but
I'm<00:03:36.140> gonna<00:03:36.290> need<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.560> slow<00:03:36.950> down<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.549> I<00:03:37.880> can<00:03:37.970> try

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
I'm gonna need to slow down so I can try

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.030 
I'm gonna need to slow down so I can try
and<00:03:38.329> do<00:03:38.450> my<00:03:38.540> 360<00:03:39.079> entry<00:03:39.350> right<00:03:39.470> here<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:39.860> what

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
and do my 360 entry right here so what

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.710 
and do my 360 entry right here so what
right<00:03:40.370> now<00:03:40.489> for<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.850> first<00:03:41.030> time<00:03:41.180> ever<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:41.510> was

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
right now for the first time ever I was

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.560 
right now for the first time ever I was
actually<00:03:41.870> trying<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.230> drift<00:03:42.410> with<00:03:42.530> clutch<00:03:42.739> and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
actually trying to drift with clutch and

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.479 
actually trying to drift with clutch and
what<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.600> think<00:03:44.900> my<00:03:45.019> issue<00:03:45.170> was<00:03:45.380> my<00:03:45.620> 360<00:03:46.190> entries

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
what I think my issue was my 360 entries

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.280 
what I think my issue was my 360 entries
is<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.760> wasn't<00:03:47.150> taking<00:03:47.450> enough<00:03:47.780> speed<00:03:48.079> into

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
is I wasn't taking enough speed into

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.770 
is I wasn't taking enough speed into
them<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.370> what<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:49.760> was<00:03:49.880> doing<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.299> was

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
them and so what I was doing is I was

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.750 
them and so what I was doing is I was
holding<00:03:50.989> clutch<00:03:51.260> in<00:03:51.410> third<00:03:51.620> gear<00:03:51.769> power

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
holding clutch in third gear power

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.850 
holding clutch in third gear power
through<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.329> first<00:03:53.540> half<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.900> 360<00:03:54.470> dropped<00:03:54.739> a

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
through the first half of 360 dropped a

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.740 
through the first half of 360 dropped a
second<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.370> when<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:55.880> come<00:03:56.060> out<00:03:56.239> as<00:03:56.420> power

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
second and when I come out as power

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.080 
second and when I come out as power
second<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.440> continue<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.920> drift<00:03:58.130> but<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.820> did

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
second to continue to drift but I did

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.880 
second to continue to drift but I did
not<00:03:59.209> have<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.480> fast<00:03:59.780> enough<00:04:00.019> entry<00:04:00.410> speed<00:04:00.620> into

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
not have a fast enough entry speed into

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830 
not have a fast enough entry speed into
my<00:04:00.950> 360<00:04:01.579> meaning<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.000> when<00:04:02.150> i<00:04:02.209> came<00:04:02.450> out<00:04:02.600> at

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
my 360 meaning that when i came out at

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.319 
my 360 meaning that when i came out at
the<00:04:03.230> second<00:04:03.739> i<00:04:03.829> would<00:04:04.130> just<00:04:04.340> small<00:04:04.760> spin<00:04:05.090> or

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
the second i would just small spin or

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.720 
the second i would just small spin or
not<00:04:05.660> have<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:06.019> long<00:04:06.290> enough<00:04:06.470> drift<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.489> with

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
not have it long enough drift so with

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.520 
not have it long enough drift so with
that<00:04:08.000> um<00:04:08.329> that's<00:04:08.630> pretty<00:04:08.870> much<00:04:09.019> it<00:04:09.079> so<00:04:09.260> as
