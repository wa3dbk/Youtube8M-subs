00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
where I was in my riding lessons and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.109 
where I was in my riding lessons and
there<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.710> coach<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.310> half<00:01:35.549> fault<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
there the coach is going half fault and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.760 
there the coach is going half fault and
more<00:01:36.329> half<00:01:36.540> faults<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.079> half<00:01:37.259> holt<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.710> I'm

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
effectively do a half fault so I'm to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.139 
effectively do a half fault so I'm to
answer<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.140> question<00:02:04.500> briefly<00:02:04.920> Kate<00:02:05.520> can

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
answer your question briefly Kate can

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.850 
answer your question briefly Kate can
you<00:02:06.329> do<00:02:06.479> too<00:02:06.719> many<00:02:06.840> half<00:02:07.110> holtz<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.649> don't

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
you do too many half holtz I don't

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.199 
you do too many half holtz I don't
believe<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.160> no<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:10.289> you<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.619> too<00:02:10.920> many

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
believe so no but can you do too many

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.080 
believe so no but can you do too many
ineffective<00:02:12.209> half<00:02:12.540> holtz<00:02:13.050> yes

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
ineffective half holtz yes

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.610 
ineffective half holtz yes
so<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.210> you're<00:02:15.420> not<00:02:15.570> doing<00:02:15.930> your<00:02:16.200> half<00:02:16.380> old

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
so if you're not doing your half old

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.310 
so if you're not doing your half old
effectively<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.790> could<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.150> ten<00:02:18.480> thousand<00:02:19.170> of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
effectively you could do ten thousand of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.530 
effectively you could do ten thousand of
them<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.710> not<00:02:20.250> one<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.460> them's<00:02:20.730> effective<00:02:21.270> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
them and not one of them's effective so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.480 
them and not one of them's effective so
that's<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.290> where<00:02:22.620> you're<00:02:22.770> at<00:02:23.010> where

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
that's I think where you're at where

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.790 
that's I think where you're at where
you're<00:02:23.640> feeling<00:02:23.880> I'm<00:02:24.270> doing<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:24.930> many<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
you're feeling I'm doing so many and the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.800 
you're feeling I'm doing so many and the
contacts<00:02:26.340> not<00:02:26.490> coming<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.210> horses<00:02:27.510> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
contacts not coming and the horses and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.770 
contacts not coming and the horses and
going<00:02:28.080> where<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.320> needs<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.770> so<00:02:29.550> I'm<00:02:30.450> doing

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
going where it needs to be so I'm doing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600 
going where it needs to be so I'm doing
too<00:02:30.930> many<00:02:31.140> no<00:02:31.680> I'll<00:02:31.920> tell<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.250> probably

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.840 
too many no I'll tell you just probably
not<00:02:32.850> doing<00:02:33.060> enough<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.690> effective<00:02:34.200> ones

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
not doing enough of effective ones

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.550 
not doing enough of effective ones
