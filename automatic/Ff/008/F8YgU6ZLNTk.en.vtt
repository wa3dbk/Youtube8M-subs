reptile skins onto your nail so let's

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.070 
reptile skins onto your nail so let's
try<00:00:17.190> together<00:00:17.460> right<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> lot<00:00:18.840> of

try together right now and be a lot of
fun<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.010> actually<00:00:20.449> I've<00:00:21.449> already<00:00:21.779> did<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.320> sort

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
fun so actually I've already did it sort

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.590 
fun so actually I've already did it sort
of<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.269> I've

of kind of and as you can see I've

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.759 
of kind of and as you can see I've
applied<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.260> gold<00:00:26.130> base<00:00:26.460> onto<00:00:26.849> my<00:00:27.570> nail<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
applied a gold base onto my nail but I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.970 
applied a gold base onto my nail but I
hope<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.849> video<00:00:30.119> camera<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> showing<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
hope the video camera is showing it that

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.850 
hope the video camera is showing it that
there<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.610> streaks<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:34.260> gaps<00:00:34.559> in

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
there are streaks and little gaps in

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030 
there are streaks and little gaps in
between<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.000> nail<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.680> easy

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
between of the nail and that's very easy

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
between of the nail and that's very easy
to<00:00:38.250> make<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> want<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> do<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.570> just

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
to make so what you want to do is just

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.080 
to make so what you want to do is just
grab<00:00:40.290> any<00:00:40.530> color<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.100> want<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.730> chose

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
grab any color that you want I chose

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.450 
grab any color that you want I chose
gold<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.350> reptile<00:00:43.770> skin<00:00:44.100> i<00:00:44.250> think

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
gold because for reptile skin i think

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.630 
gold because for reptile skin i think
that<00:00:44.640> suits<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:45.829> just<00:00:46.829> open<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that suits it more and then just open it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
that suits it more and then just open it
up<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:51.170> apply<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
up and then what you do is just apply it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
up and then what you do is just apply it
all<00:00:52.649> over<00:00:52.920> onto<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:53.879> nail<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.710> then<00:00:55.710> before

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
all over onto your nail and then before

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.360 
all over onto your nail and then before
it<00:00:56.760> dries<00:00:57.180> completely<00:00:57.739> take<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.920> your<00:00:59.039> cutter

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
it dries completely take out your cutter

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.349 
it dries completely take out your cutter
or<00:01:00.050> even<00:01:01.050> um<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.890> toothpick<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:02.879> anything

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
or even um a toothpick or anything

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.520 
or even um a toothpick or anything
that's<00:01:03.510> sharp<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.729> just<00:01:05.930> goes<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:07.320> onto

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
that's sharp and just goes right onto

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.480 
that's sharp and just goes right onto
the<00:01:07.830> nail<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> draw<00:01:09.590> lines<00:01:13.250> diagonal<00:01:14.250> lines

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the nail and draw lines diagonal lines

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.359 
the nail and draw lines diagonal lines
that<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.270> way<00:01:15.540> scraping<00:01:16.229> off<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.070> paint

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that go this way scraping off the paint

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
that go this way scraping off the paint
and<00:01:17.580> then<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> again<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> other<00:01:19.500> ways

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and then do it again on the other ways

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.120 
and then do it again on the other ways
to<00:01:20.759> create<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> grid-like<00:01:21.420> pattern<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
to create a grid-like pattern and this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.100 
to create a grid-like pattern and this
way<00:01:23.430> you've<00:01:24.000> had<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.509> texturized<00:01:25.580> base

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
way you've had a really texturized base

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.530 
way you've had a really texturized base
similar<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> reptile<00:01:28.890> skin<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
similar to a reptile skin just like that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.109 
similar to a reptile skin just like that
and<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.100> already<00:01:32.340> add<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.909> your

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and on this you can already add on your

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.600 
and on this you can already add on your
own<00:01:33.299> gemstones<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.409> even<00:01:34.740> other<00:01:34.920> patterns

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
own gemstones or even other patterns

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.560 
own gemstones or even other patterns
onto<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.869> create<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:38.270> complex<00:01:39.270> looking

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
onto it to create a more complex looking

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.859 
onto it to create a more complex looking
pattern<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.500> task<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.659> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
pattern for that task in so if you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.170 
pattern for that task in so if you
wanted<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.619> patterns<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.340> top<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.759> your

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
wanted to do patterns on top of your

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.390 
wanted to do patterns on top of your
skin<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.140> also<00:01:46.380> look<00:01:46.740> at<00:01:46.950> pictures<00:01:47.370> of

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
skin you can also look at pictures of

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.730 
skin you can also look at pictures of
like<00:01:47.880> snakes<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> stuff<00:01:48.900> that<00:01:49.050> you<00:01:49.320> find<00:01:49.650> on

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
like snakes and stuff that you find on

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.950 
like snakes and stuff that you find on
google<00:01:50.190> or<00:01:50.370> on<00:01:50.550> yahoo<00:01:50.730> search<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.930> i

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
google or on yahoo search and what i

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.290 
google or on yahoo search and what i
found<00:01:52.410> is<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> pattern<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.550> similar<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
found is a pattern that is similar to

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.290 
found is a pattern that is similar to
this<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:56.420> circular<00:01:57.420> blobs<00:01:58.160> across<00:01:59.300> the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
this it's like circular blobs across the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.290 
this it's like circular blobs across the
reptile<00:02:00.690> skin<00:02:01.170> but<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:02.520> requires<00:02:02.910> a<00:02:03.030> few

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
reptile skin but it requires a few

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.060 
reptile skin but it requires a few
layers<00:02:03.510> so<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.440> applied<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> white

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
layers so I first I applied a white

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.810 
layers so I first I applied a white
layer<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.510> yellow<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.200> top<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.820> then

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
layer and then a yellow on top and then

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.320 
layer and then a yellow on top and then
a<00:02:08.850> gold<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.630> top<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:10.140> well<00:02:10.350> so<00:02:10.890> there<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.430> three

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
a gold on top as well so there is three

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.420 
a gold on top as well so there is three
layers<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> pattern<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.620> then<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
layers to the pattern and then the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.830 
layers to the pattern and then the
fourth<00:02:14.700> layer<00:02:14.880> would<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.330> base<00:02:15.510> coat

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
fourth layer would be the base coat

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.440 
fourth layer would be the base coat
where<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.680> already<00:02:17.280> texturized<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
where it is already texturized with the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.150 
where it is already texturized with the
cutter<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.890> looks<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:21.650> if<00:02:22.650> you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160
