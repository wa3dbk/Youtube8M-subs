a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.530> bit<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.130> bring<00:01:59.399> her<00:01:59.549> into

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
a little bit and really bring her into

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.200 
a little bit and really bring her into
focus<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.070> photograph<00:02:02.549> again<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.969> same

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
focus on this photograph again the same

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.330 
focus on this photograph again the same
play<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.560> wanted<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> emphasize

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
play but I really wanted to emphasize

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.089 
play but I really wanted to emphasize
the<00:02:05.640> shadow<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> detail<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> picture

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
the shadow and the detail in the picture

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.190 
the shadow and the detail in the picture
so<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.700> went<00:02:08.879> ahead<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.179> used<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so I went ahead and used a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.440 
so I went ahead and used a
mr.<00:02:10.440> shutter<00:02:10.739> speed<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.849> was<00:02:12.000> still<00:02:12.239> kind

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
mr. shutter speed and I was still kind

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.000 
mr. shutter speed and I was still kind
of<00:02:12.480> blurring<00:02:12.810> out<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.200> background<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
of blurring out the background just a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.309 
of blurring out the background just a
tad<00:02:14.250> bringing<00:02:14.970> her<00:02:15.180> right<00:02:15.569> into<00:02:15.750> focus<00:02:16.019> in<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
tad bringing her right into focus in the

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.089 
tad bringing her right into focus in the
foreground<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.000> next<00:02:18.180> photograph<00:02:18.450> I

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
foreground and on this next photograph I

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.170 
foreground and on this next photograph I
wanted<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.190> pick<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.400> more<00:02:20.580> light<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
wanted to pick up more light in the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.479 
wanted to pick up more light in the
scene<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.959> did<00:02:22.170> open<00:02:22.379> up<00:02:22.560> my<00:02:22.620> aperture<00:02:23.069> just

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
scene so I did open up my aperture just

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.520 
scene so I did open up my aperture just
a<00:02:23.610> little<00:02:23.910> bit<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.989> blurt<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.379> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
a little bit and I blurt out the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.410 
a little bit and I blurt out the
background<00:02:25.769> but<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> additionally

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
background but then I additionally

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.850 
background but then I additionally
blurred<00:02:27.630> out<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> background<00:02:28.140> using<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
blurred out the background using a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.070 
blurred out the background using a
computer<00:02:29.160> software<00:02:29.700> program<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
computer software program so the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.630 
computer software program so the
techniques<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.860> mentioned<00:02:32.340> i'll<00:02:32.519> be

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
techniques I just mentioned i'll be

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.120 
techniques I just mentioned i'll be
teaching<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.209> about<00:02:33.360> today<00:02:33.900> now<00:02:34.739> i<00:02:34.769> have<00:02:35.099> a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
teaching you about today now i have a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400 
teaching you about today now i have a
student<00:02:35.489> named<00:02:35.700> David<00:02:36.209> who<00:02:36.239> loves<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.080> go<00:02:37.230> out

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
student named David who loves to go out

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.990 
student named David who loves to go out
and<00:02:37.560> take<00:02:37.709> pictures<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.099> his<00:02:38.310> friends<00:02:38.849> and

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and take pictures of his friends and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.780 
and take pictures of his friends and
bands<00:02:39.480> usually<00:02:40.200> at<00:02:40.530> night<00:02:40.560> he<00:02:41.340> went<00:02:41.430> ahead<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
bands usually at night he went ahead and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.430 
bands usually at night he went ahead and
emailed<00:02:41.940> me<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> photograph<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.870> he<00:02:43.080> took<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
emailed me a photograph that he took the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.259 
emailed me a photograph that he took the
other<00:02:43.560> night<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.099> I'm<00:02:44.519> guessing<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> this

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
other night and I'm guessing that this

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.180 
other night and I'm guessing that this
was<00:02:45.480> definitely<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.989> low<00:02:46.200> light<00:02:46.410> situation

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
was definitely a low light situation

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.270 
was definitely a low light situation
because<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.150> picture<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.920> out<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.980> focus

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
because the picture is out of focus

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520 
because the picture is out of focus
blurry<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.630> can't<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:51.989> pick<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.319> much

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
blurry and I can't really pick up much

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.160 
blurry and I can't really pick up much
detail<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.459> but<00:02:54.299> that's<00:02:54.480> okay<00:02:54.900> because

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
detail in it but that's okay because

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.250 
detail in it but that's okay because
I've<00:02:56.069> arranged<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.760> photo<00:02:56.790> session<00:02:57.329> with<00:02:57.720> David

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
I've arranged a photo session with David

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.530 
I've arranged a photo session with David
downtown<00:02:59.190> at<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.519> nightclub<00:02:59.730> that's<00:03:00.390> where

you'll learn about using your camera's
exposure<00:03:20.160> settings<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.389> that's<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.079> shutter

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
exposure settings and that's the shutter

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.620 
exposure settings and that's the shutter
priority<00:03:22.620> mode<00:03:23.069> versus<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> aperture

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
priority mode versus the aperture

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.569 
priority mode versus the aperture
priority<00:03:24.900> mode<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.920> different<00:03:26.220> effects

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
priority mode and the different effects

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.030 
priority mode and the different effects
you<00:03:26.819> can<00:03:26.850> achieve<00:03:27.090> using<00:03:27.600> each<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.139> then

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
you can achieve using each one then

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.440 
you can achieve using each one then
you'll<00:03:29.280> learn<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.459> little<00:03:29.730> bit<00:03:29.850> about<00:03:30.120> white

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
you'll learn a little bit about white

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.970 
you'll learn a little bit about white
balance<00:03:30.900> because<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.380> every<00:03:31.500> low<00:03:31.769> light

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
balance because in every low light

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.160 
balance because in every low light
situation<00:03:32.730> lights<00:03:33.480> might<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> different

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
situation lights might have a different

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.199 
situation lights might have a different
color<00:03:34.530> cast<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:35.130> them<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.639> white<00:03:35.850> balance

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
color cast to them with white balance

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.270 
color cast to them with white balance
you<00:03:36.299> can<00:03:36.329> adjust<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.829> we'll<00:03:38.100> come
