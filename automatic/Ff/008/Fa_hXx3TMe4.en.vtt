00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:26.480
 fell down fell britain so someone 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.480
 the signs are calling again 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 generally wait a minute now let's 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.300

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.070
 don't interfere so wait a minute 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:01:00.379
 hour know how to do just like that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:04.830

 these discs were not available, I understand 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.869
 I do not understand why they were not immediately 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.570
 available then it would be much easier 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.710
 see this tool at all 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 used a completely different by the way 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:41.550
 Generally used scissors but it's kapets 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.000
 so pretty interesting such an operation 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.989
 will be 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.030

 devour the rice 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:04.110

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.790
 have taken 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.790

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:21.600
 still know a little bit how the egg should be 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.530
 so neatly need to break yourself 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.480
 perfectly understand the country of his crust 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:35.070
