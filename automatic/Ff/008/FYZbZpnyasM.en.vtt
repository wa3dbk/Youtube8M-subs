00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.570
 while with nearly 2000 fans in the Schwenninger helios-arena currently only 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.230
 the most loyal fans can support their team 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.480
 Responsible of the beautiful at least one more great 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.349
 Partners build with the Fürstenberg brewery as main sponsor 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.349
 you also move together in the upcoming season 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.960
 Sporty, however, the way is still rocky 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.829
 in order to keep the privilege in the pre-playoffs open, the 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.360
 current opponents and direct competitors from Bremerhaven be forced 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.820
 but the better start knows the penguins in the white jerseys 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 Defending the Vikings anything but orderly 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.230
 no hundred seconds are played 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.920
 The penguins are already taking the lead with 1 0 by Matthias Forster 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.829
 the White Wings paralyzed we have to play yet 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.999
 in the seventh minute John Smith was to stay just yesterday 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.409
 Leisenring for the flattering balance at the time 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.399
 in the aftermath Schwenningen on pushers but without success 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.369
 Crap on the sixteenth minute 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.880
 Confusion in front of the housing of Bremerhaven Stieber alpine pushed 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.079
 suddenly the disc is in the box but the action has long been the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.780
 Referees whistled the 2 0 does not count with the score of 1 to 1 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.450
 goes into the first third break 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 this game presents 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.710
 Even in the middle third of the audience see no intoxicating game 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.710
 but no shot at the crossbar by Matthias Forster and then also goals 7 7 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.909
 Schwenningen in the 36 minutes in the majority 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.550
 and to have just used this is on pass from John Smith 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.550
 the White Wings Linz 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.520
 shortly thereafter Schwenningen's province sets such a punishment 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.090
 The answer of the penguins on the pass by Sergej Janzen was again Matthias 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.579
 Forster for the compensation to 2 2 2 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.309
 to overlook the joy of the blast are single traveling fans out 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.469
 Bremerhaven 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.430
 the final third 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.389
 55 seconds are played 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.269
 Bremerhaven in attack and with the chance to lead Dorsten 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.549
 direct return of the Schwenninger and the possibility for the people themselves 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.549
 excel 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.959
 The game is now exciting even 46.7 million tons equal two big chances 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.959
 2 0 as captain earns many good 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.749
 not so shiny in the gate 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.259
 less glamorous, however, the Ausraster of Jules Verne of those 69 votes needed 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.029
 about a referee's decision Plus the two 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.999
 the Bremerhaven shipyard also to enjoy 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:10.319
 namely behind the line 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.210
 staring behind Hüfner 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.429
 High low 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:18.089
 After 60 minutes it is 2 2 2 in Jena 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:22.420
 However, this finds a quick end or better quickly no winner 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.420
 because after 44 seconds show the Schwenninger 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.749
 what do you think about 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.919
 Thomas Berger have 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.639
 and Brady Leisenring with the 13 2 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.259
 Ending will be until the end of May 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:37.049
 very important 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.059
 the sales were both most important 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.059
 and St also amazed by the sacrifices 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.829
 Sat 1 and ran de 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.059
 Brigitta leaves 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.799
 second in the Middle Ages claim three 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.039
 the accused if we continue to play like this 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.259
 nationwide in the playoffs 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.369
 to move among these victims 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.719
 and who knows maybe they were panned 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.039
 i am a very different story we need to take advantage of it 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.159
 but Moosmann Power previously risen bass for Hannah Vogel 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.459
 but it's murder and it's percent this year. Manz looks at that in the US 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.040
 Sex had the team finished the first team extinct position 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.129
 it had to be related 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.529
 it is to be expected that this will be part of the game and it is to be expected 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.669
 By the way, I think it's possible that they'll be back in the coming Tuesday 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.719
 pre-playoffs meet again on Bremerhafen 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:30.180
 for the direct entry into the playoffs it is in the next games 

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:32.409
 between the Cannibals from Landshut 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.389
 and the Lusatian foxes
