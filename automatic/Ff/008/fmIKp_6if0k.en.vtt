did you feel I made one point for that
Israel<00:00:17.880> though<00:00:18.140> because<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:19.859> so

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
Israel though because I think it's so

Israel though because I think it's so
important<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.060> people<00:00:21.350> these<00:00:22.350> days<00:00:22.410> who<00:00:22.920> find

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
important for people these days who find

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.150 
important for people these days who find
out<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.699> they<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:24.060> cancer<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:25.619> understand

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
out that they have cancer to understand

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370 
out that they have cancer to understand
that<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.760> no<00:00:27.000> longer<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.480> death<00:00:27.810> penalty

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
that this is no longer the death penalty

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380 
that this is no longer the death penalty
automatically<00:00:29.189> when<00:00:29.400> you're<00:00:29.519> told<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.359> have

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
automatically when you're told you have

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.630 
automatically when you're told you have
cancer<00:00:30.779> because<00:00:31.740> every<00:00:31.890> day<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.340> every<00:00:32.489> way

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
cancer because every day in every way

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850 
cancer because every day in every way
they<00:00:33.030> find<00:00:33.329> new<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> better<00:00:33.930> ways<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> treat

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
they find new and better ways to treat

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.240 
they find new and better ways to treat
these<00:00:35.070> diseases<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:36.170> we<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.860> every

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
these diseases and we all know and every

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
these diseases and we all know and every
expert<00:00:38.670> who<00:00:39.629> has<00:00:39.660> anything<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.590> with

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
expert who has anything to do with

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.860 
expert who has anything to do with
cancer<00:00:41.219> will<00:00:41.430> tell<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.660> put

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
cancer will tell you that if you put

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.619 
cancer will tell you that if you put
enough<00:00:43.020> money<00:00:43.469> into<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.160> research

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
enough money into the research

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
enough money into the research
eventually<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:46.079> will<00:00:46.289> find<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.920> cure<00:00:47.309> for

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
eventually they will find a cure for

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
eventually they will find a cure for
cancer<00:00:47.910> right<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.289> thought<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
cancer right but what I thought was so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.510 
cancer right but what I thought was so
interesting<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.570> case<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:53.190> didn't

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
interesting in your case is you didn't

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.790 
interesting in your case is you didn't
just<00:00:53.730> take<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.510> death<00:00:54.840> penalty<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
just take this as the death penalty you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.069 
just take this as the death penalty you
grabbed<00:00:56.100> hold<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.149> decided<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> fight

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
grabbed hold of it you decided to fight

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.529 
grabbed hold of it you decided to fight
it<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> basically<00:00:58.829> did<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.059> what<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.239> did

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it you basically did just what you did

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.979 
it you basically did just what you did
with<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> bicycle<00:01:01.500> well<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:03.059> looked<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> as

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
with a bicycle well I I looked at it as

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.780 
with a bicycle well I I looked at it as
if<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> race<00:01:05.010> or<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
if it was a race or as if it was a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210 
if it was a race or as if it was a
competition<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:06.659> me<00:01:06.840> versus<00:01:07.350> him<00:01:08.040> or

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
competition so it was me versus him or

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.539 
competition so it was me versus him or
her<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.850> being<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> disease<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
her or it being the disease and so I

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.870 
her or it being the disease and so I
absolutely<00:01:11.549> hated<00:01:11.909> him<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.930> her<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.880> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
absolutely hated him or her or it and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.190 
absolutely hated him or her or it and

textbooks<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> remember<00:02:42.780> thinking<00:02:42.900> well<00:02:43.200> of

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
textbooks so I remember thinking well of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.720 
textbooks so I remember thinking well of
course<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.610> other

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
course they have all the other

course they have all the other
illustrations<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.840> there<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.170> remember<00:02:46.950> think

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
illustrations in there I remember think

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.200 
illustrations in there I remember think
well<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.280> isn't<00:02:47.490> right<00:02:47.760> let's<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.120> get

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
well this isn't right let's just get

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.580 
well this isn't right let's just get
that<00:02:48.360> back<00:02:48.570> in<00:02:48.750> there<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.290> say<00:02:49.440> we<00:02:49.560> did

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that back in there and we can say we did

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.070 
that back in there and we can say we did
a<00:02:49.740> good<00:02:49.890> job<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.420> grew<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.960> it

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
a good job but then it just grew and it

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.720 
a good job but then it just grew and it
evolved<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.710> expanded<00:02:53.490> to<00:02:53.610> other

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
evolved and we expanded to other

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.460 
evolved and we expanded to other
urological<00:02:54.450> cancers<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.050> they've<00:02:55.200> expanded

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
urological cancers and they've expanded

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.100 
urological cancers and they've expanded
more<00:02:55.770> into<00:02:55.950> survivorship<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.730> now<00:02:57.110> into

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
more into survivorship and now into

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.770 
more into survivorship and now into
advocacy<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.070> other<00:02:59.220> things<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.760> it's<00:03:00.630> been
