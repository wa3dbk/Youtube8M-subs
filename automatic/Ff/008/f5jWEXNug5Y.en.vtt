00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.040
 We are with Mr. Stick Printing of 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.140
 iveco argentina here in the lounge 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 international to tell us what 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 they are showing the way the world 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.660
 because the world I brought from Peru hello how 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.270
 you are good we are presenting a 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.220
 bet very strong here in Peru but 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.620
 he really exploited his motor park 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.260
 no terrible exponential growth 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.730
 and the energy matrix points towards the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.689
 gas why we wanted to offer a 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.640
 product born to daza geneve for the 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.840
 Peruvian market that is not a product 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.690
 transformed if not a product that does not 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.670
 come in and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.670
 specifically from his birth 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.800
 the person who has several benefits 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.690
 one is the almost zero pollution 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.460
 surely one will think that in the region 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.020
 the topic pollution is not so 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 important good we can not stop 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.400
 side the second strong strong benefit 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.820
 is the cost per kilometer the cost per 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.370
 kilometer down tremendously is it's a lot 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.870
 cheaper to keep a vehicle 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.290
 these that way a diesel vehicle or 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.720
 be it from the maintenance filters 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 Associations - the oil is contaminated less 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.050
 up to what each kilometer costs 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.340
 you know how to load gas is much more 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.190
 economic than loading diesel or 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.290
 fuel then we aim for that to 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.930
 that the price difference is amortized 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.330
 quickly and that the consumer can 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.830
 earn money from a very consuming 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.479
 inferior those that touch services 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.240
 main are those almost zero 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.100
 pollution and a cost per kilometer 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.560
 very very low which as you know 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.380
 surely tensed in the world after the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.150
 consumption is the fundamental variable in a 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.410
 carrier is what you first look at or 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.730
 carriers is the cost per 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.260
 kilometer 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.000
 and within that cost per kilometer the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.209
 fundamental variables the fuel and 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.769
 the second are others like tires 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.989
 maintenance and more where we aim is 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.450
 that the employer can lower their costs 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.879
 in a drastic way the expectation 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.299
 that has the market but we 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.349
 we have very high expectations people 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.540
 of motor networks making a bet 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.670
 strong will bring these products of 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.290
 all parts of the world in fact the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.360
 bailey more girls are the same as 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.099
 they sell in italy nowadays the euro 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.290
 charges are also state-of-the- art 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.670
 but our bet is to have the last 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.180
 that you have in all the plants of the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.180
 World of Peru
