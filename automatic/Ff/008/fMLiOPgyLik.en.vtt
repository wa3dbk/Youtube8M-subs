 "Watermelon for erectile dysfunction" 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.200
 As in the recently published Harvard Health Letter, 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.790
 up to three quarters of men with coronary arteries constricted by cholesterol deposition 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.730
 suffer from some degree of erectile dysfunction. 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.720
 We have medicines like Viagra, 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.920
 but the effects are only temporary; 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 moreover, it is a costly solution with dangerous side effects. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.210
 Obviously, if your vascular system is damaged, 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.080
 a more intense effort that involves much more than just swallowing pills 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.140
 can provide a long-term improvement in both sexual function and cardiovascular health. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.050
 Vegetable based diet can not only reverse both health problems 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.019
 but one of these foods may even serve as an interim solution to the cure. 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.559
 Viagra works by inhibiting the enzyme 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.960
 which deactivates something we call cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.670
 who would normally stretch the veins in his penis. 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.839
 Thus, the inhibition of this enzyme means more cGMP, which means greater blood flow. 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.360
 However, there is another way to increase cGMP levels. 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.030
 This is the opposite approach, 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 thus, in the stimulation of the enzyme that makes up the substance. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210
 And that's exactly what nitric oxide does. 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.720
 Nitric oxide is formed from arginine. 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.990
 Arginine can be formed from citrulline. 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.850
 So I wonder what would happen if you eat more citrulline. 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.570
 "Oral administration of L-citrulline for improvement 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.840
 erection strength in men with mild erectile dysfunction. " 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.049
 How can we find citrulline? 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.960
 In watermelon. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469
 How much watermelon would you have to eat each day to get a dose, 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.140
 they used in the study? 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.670
 Three and a half portions a day 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.159
 so if you don't give a yellow watermelon, 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.570
 which has about four times the amount of citrulline. 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.420
 So one portion of watermelon, that is, one crescent of a good melon, 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.960
 should provide the same dose of citrulline as used in the study. 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.060
 This amount increased the number of sexual intercourse per month by 68%. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.500
 Your heart should do that, 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.660
 whereas the consumption of watermelon greatly reduces blood pressure. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.650
 Watermelon can do both.
