00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.809
 worldwide have almost a billion 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.739
 people do not have access to clean 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.140
 Drinking water 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.150
 the fact of water shortage in the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.269
 countries of the third world manifested 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.550
 not only in poverty but acts 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.500
 in a further consequence on the 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.800
 education and health of the affected 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.440
 people out of 80 percent of all 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.500
 have diseases in southern countries 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.170
 their cause in contaminated drinking water 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.570
 the responsible handling of the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.840
 earthly resources and as well with 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.570
 Our fellow man is in the hands 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.270
 every one of us 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.759
 the Vienna tap water comes to 95 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.429
 percent from the austrian alps 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.050
 this spring water becomes over two high 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.330
 source lines to vienna 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.400
 transports the water of the first 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.640
 University administration flows from the 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.369
 area rax snow mountain in the city 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.100
 It is the shorter with 90 kilometers 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.100
 of the two the water of the 200 kilometer 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.200
 long second high source line comes 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.030
 from the high black forest somehow 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.630
 he has available water 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.250
 of the highest quality of the wiener 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.229
 I think water is world famous 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.450
 in that the water is from nature 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.519
 left areas where it flows 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 Actually, there are not forests except nature 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.530
 vegetation actually flows the same way 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.850
 through the mountain and just like that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.489
 it then flows naturally 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.110
 Vienna is an extremely high quality 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.120
 also in international comparison 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.120
 in vienna there are 29 in total 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.970
 water tank and there it flows 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.720
 from the network of the water tank about that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.610
 pipe network to households and is 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.380
 also there always according to the principle of 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.630
 communicating vessels that is the 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.580
 Water tank higher than the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.050
 faucet or never turned on 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.060
 and thereby provide this pressure since 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.550
 that the water comes out of it all by itself 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.760
 faucet flows 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.190
 in vienna, this is 375 million per day 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.130
 liters of water in households 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.650
 industry and public sector eg 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.959
 be used at fountain per 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.200
 People get average in Vienna 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.110
 130 liters per day consumed in the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.739
 compared to this in india, each consumes 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.590
 person 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.590
 statistically 25 liters per day 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.250
 after the war and before the war 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.760
 tell the story where he does not have any apartment 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.350
 a bathroom had where the hot or 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.690
 simple people had a toilet on thanks 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.940
 where all have gone a water pipe 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.860
 if you bring the pressure with the water 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.840
 and where you have little water of course 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.420
 has consumed and me wiener we have 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.489
 the high swelling water line the way 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.370
 my great-grandfather built it 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.080
 i come from a family very much 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.230
 well-known Austrian family painter 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.510
 but also scientists and and 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.340
 untermain great-grandchild sweet professor 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.430
 sweet the reieder water pipe built 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.610
 the flood line and therefore white 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.930
 I know a bit about the things 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.450
 Of course we always had this 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.820
 beautiful water used to be railway station 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.760
 a placard on which pleased sabine 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.380
 on high no water and ankerbrot the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.299
 there is no more offer 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.640
 but the water does not and then it is through 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.010
 the prosperity and in many housing 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.840
 Everyone got a bathroom and there 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.459
 consumption has increased so much that 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.739
 one like me think thunder water now 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.710
 filters and groundwater I know it 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.750
 not exactly what you now into all 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.060
 is the wiener population actually 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:54.900
 realize how much water you use daily 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:54.900
 consumes 560 85 do not need 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:11.630
 the northeast always to the pattern picture without 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:14.110
 big pores of rh with little water 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.110
 been 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.000
 I think that did not have too much 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.000
 I too much available 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.700
 it was self-evident though 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.130
 meanwhile, my awareness has been strengthened 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.530
 I am very optimistic 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:41.680
 optimistic international and we have 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:45.200
 Water projects and we are very 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.210
 informed and also instructed with 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.720
 not just handle water carefully 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.660
 we look to make us aware that 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.580
 Water life is as important as me and 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.720
 that our wealth is not 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.720
 of course 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.600
 for municipal facilities means 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.040
 actually privatize at negative 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.260
 effect the whole communal facility 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.350
 actually belongs to the communes 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.350
 leave or interests from the strong 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.250
 it depends on what you privatize 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.919
 There are things that are actually the state 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:34.910
 still not in the property but 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.600
 in care should have public 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.050
 Transportation water 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.060
 all these things are for the moment 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.040
 Water should not be a business 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.340
 that is also the case with hydropower 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.680
 We do not live in a time where it only 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.720
 It's all about profit and trade 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.729
 There are things you can not profit from 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.020
 it is likely to go against ethics 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:57.020
 a question of ethics 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:21.740
 that is, it is so far away it 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:24.740
 we will not be technically possible 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.050
 ever find a way to do that 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:32.350
 we have abundant water 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.350
 Distribute equitably worldwide
