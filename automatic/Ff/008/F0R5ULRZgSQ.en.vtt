00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello everybody today with you i will 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 make salted cucumbers recipes 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.170
 Of course a lot but I will show exactly my 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.540
 how to do and I will pickle cucumbers 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.320
 in a cold way that is pickle we don't 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.490
 we will only boil the difference 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.590
 cold cucumbers they are 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.949
 Throw a little longer than those 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 who pour hot pickle and so 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.890
 we will need the cucumbers themselves 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.620
 cucumbers and recommend previously 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 pour cold water and so they are there 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.100
 swam some of the co2 then they will 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.640
 crisp and mouthwatering 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.719
 you'll also need dill here with me 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.980
 horseradish leaves cherry leaves and garlic 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.879
 allspice salt sugar per kilogram 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 cucumbers 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.690
 I take 2 full spoons of salt and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.540
 one spoon of sugar 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.330
 natural garlic pepper you can 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.430
 vary according to your own taste if 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.250
 love posts and accordingly can 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.189
 more garlic add i love when 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.700
 just in measure I take a jar take part 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.720
 branches and stack them on the bottom also on 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.710
 bottom cut 1 clove garlic 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 a couple of peas fragrant pepper leaf 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.259
 cherries now put gothic in 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 cucumbers we need to cut the edges 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.140
 we stack the first layer of cucumbers by the way 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 salt not necessarily in the bank not all 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 By the way prolazit hand there let's say my 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.710
 the husband cannot put his hand into the jar and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 the words sewed there again another rosette 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 dill a couple of leaves garlic 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.860
 Pepper second layer will be laid 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.920
 and again on top weed garlic lay down 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.569
 already 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.040
 Now the smell is just awesome pepper and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.020
 now we do the paddle 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:20.050
 we need to build water in Lithuania 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.520
 salt and sugar as i said i do 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.810
 in a cold way 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.770
 if you are pushing in naturally 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.290
 dissolve in two accounts 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.440
 salt and sugar dissolved and I add 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.030
 them to our cucumber pouring cucumbers 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.300
 to pickle cover them and so here are mine 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.069
 cucumbers angry weight I got 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.989
 not full bank 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.690
 Now our bank put a plate 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.989
 why it is necessary to put a plate 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.780
 because the fermentation process will begin 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.340
 if you have a full bank, part 1 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.569
 about you will pour out 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.360
 and just cover the saucers why saucer 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.180
 again if cover with a tight lid 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:13.480
 then I will just sleep a break from you 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.180
 out and leave in a warm place for 24 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.570
 hours that is on the day after day our 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.810
 cucumbers will be ready but I love 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.320
 when they stood for about two days 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.350
 then they are more such 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.450
 salty so leave as 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.670
 at least a day and see you 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.609
 let's see what I did 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.640
 and so we spent the day watching what happened 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.850
 with my cucumbers as you see 1 o 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.840
 darkened and peel cucumbers, too 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.209
 darkened and they are basically ready for 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.590
 I will tell you a secret I will tell them 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.590
 I tried yesterday 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.920
 Here is such a stunning cucumber 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.959
 crispy 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.840
 when you make cucumbers 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.170
 in a cold way, they are more 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.790
 crispy if the cucumbers are made hot 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.840
 way when you pickle 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.539
 boil that cucumbers get a little bit 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.250
 2 rinnai of course it is also not bad 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.130
 It turns out delicious but in my opinion 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.080
 exactly the cold way to do better 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.570
 I'll tell you one more data cucumbers 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.419
 recommend still about a day to keep 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.910
 warm and then hide them in the fridge 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:41.410
 but what am i doing 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.979
 we, as we eat these 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.370
 pickles I'm about 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.289
 add new cucumbers fresh and they 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.990
 I have in the same brine as it were 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.780
 salted and so for about 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.930
 two weeks because then got out 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.720
 everything is already very sour to everyone 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.419
 thank you for your attention wish you culinary 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.419
 success and to new recipes for now
