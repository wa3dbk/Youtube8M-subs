00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
silane closer to the right we're exiting

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.940 
silane closer to the right we're exiting
right<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:58.840> why<00:01:59.830> are<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:01.689> I'm<00:02:02.500> going<00:02:02.860> to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
speed limit may be a little bit over why

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.359 
speed limit may be a little bit over why
are<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.289> like<00:02:05.619> on<00:02:05.920> my<00:02:06.130> bumper<00:02:06.789> yo<00:02:07.890> when<00:02:08.890> there

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
are clearly three other lanes that you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.729 
are clearly three other lanes that you
can<00:02:13.150> get<00:02:13.269> in<00:02:13.510> if<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.079> really<00:02:14.560> really

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
can get in if you just really really

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.400 
can get in if you just really really
really<00:02:15.040> want<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.940> go<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:17.410> fast<00:02:19.079> why<00:02:20.079> stay

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
really want to go that fast why stay

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.900 
really want to go that fast why stay
behind<00:02:20.620> me<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.519> just<00:02:22.380> write<00:02:23.380> my<00:02:23.650> bumper<00:02:24.220> when

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
behind me and just write my bumper when

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.710 
behind me and just write my bumper when
you<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:25.450> clearly<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:26.230> over<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:28.120> other<00:02:28.299> lanes

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
you can clearly get over to other lanes

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.680 
you can clearly get over to other lanes
I<00:02:29.380> think<00:02:30.160> people<00:02:30.340> like<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.850> are<00:02:31.030> just<00:02:31.060> but

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
I think people like that are just but

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.640 
I think people like that are just but
hoes<00:02:32.730> period<00:02:33.989> clearly<00:02:34.989> there's<00:02:35.200> three<00:02:35.470> other

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
lanes you are able to get in so why

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.599 
lanes you are able to get in so why
