certain<00:03:26.140> families<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.620> we<00:03:26.950> asked<00:03:27.160> about

places in America to do that and you did

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.920 
places in America to do that and you did
mention<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.970> me<00:03:40.210> in<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.390> commercial<00:03:40.780> break

though that age might play a role in
this<00:03:42.730> because<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.660> can<00:03:43.870> happen<00:03:44.080> in<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.470> first

body<00:03:48.940> reacts<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.840> very<00:03:50.080> rare<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:50.890> very

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
body reacts in a very rare but very

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.120 
body reacts in a very rare but very
devastating<00:03:51.970> way<00:03:52.150> two<00:03:52.290> very<00:03:53.290> common<00:03:53.830> very

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
devastating way two very common very

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.090 
devastating way two very common very
useful<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.120> aesthetics<00:03:55.780> let's<00:03:56.470> make<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.740> turn

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
useful and aesthetics let's make a turn

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.320 
useful and aesthetics let's make a turn
then<00:03:57.340> here<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:57.670> let's<00:03:57.790> say<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:58.270> is

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
then here and let's say that this is

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.930 
then here and let's say that this is
another<00:03:58.900> element<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.680> risk<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.430> surgical

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
another element of risk in a surgical

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.940 
another element of risk in a surgical
procedure<00:04:01.090> yes<00:04:01.840> so<00:04:02.170> when<00:04:02.380> you<00:04:02.500> hear<00:04:02.800> about

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
procedure yes so when you hear about

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.070 
procedure yes so when you hear about
these<00:04:03.280> 18<00:04:03.910> year<00:04:04.120> olds<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.570> and<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:04.810> was

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
these 18 year olds and and this was

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.650 
these 18 year olds and and this was
corrective<00:04:05.830> surgery<00:04:06.280> she<00:04:06.910> was<00:04:07.090> going<00:04:07.360> in<00:04:07.480> for

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
corrective surgery she was going in for

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.600 
corrective surgery she was going in for
this<00:04:07.780> was<00:04:08.050> not<00:04:08.260> traditional<00:04:08.860> breast

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
this was not traditional breast

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.820 
this was not traditional breast
augmentation<00:04:10.600> but<00:04:10.990> when<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.260> do<00:04:11.470> hear<00:04:11.709> the

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
augmentation but when you do hear the

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.980 
augmentation but when you do hear the
numbers<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.310> young<00:04:12.490> lady's<00:04:12.850> 18<00:04:13.300> years<00:04:13.510> old<00:04:13.780> in

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
numbers of young lady's 18 years old in

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.940 
numbers of young lady's 18 years old in
that<00:04:14.080> area

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
that area

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.340 
that area
jumping<00:04:15.610> these<00:04:16.150> girls<00:04:16.570> getting<00:04:16.989> breast

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
jumping these girls getting breast

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.740 
jumping these girls getting breast
augmentation<00:04:18.160> surgery<00:04:18.370> how<00:04:19.120> do<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.390> how<00:04:19.690> do

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
augmentation surgery how do you how do

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.500 
augmentation surgery how do you how do
you<00:04:19.959> deal<00:04:20.770> with<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:21.130> well<00:04:21.880> let's<00:04:22.240> first

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
you deal with it well let's first

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.510 
you deal with it well let's first
separate<00:04:23.140> what<00:04:23.560> happened<00:04:23.979> here<00:04:24.310> was<00:04:24.490> an

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
separate what happened here was an

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.370 
separate what happened here was an
anesthesia<00:04:25.150> program

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
anesthesia program

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.680 
anesthesia program
have<00:04:26.530> been<00:04:26.650> any<00:04:26.860> surgery<00:04:27.370> but<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.360> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
have been any surgery but the the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.050 
have been any surgery but the the
question<00:04:29.080> is<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.290> very<00:04:29.560> reasonable<00:04:30.220> one<00:04:30.580> as<00:04:30.820> to

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
question is a very reasonable one as to

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.360 
question is a very reasonable one as to
why<00:04:31.420> young<00:04:31.750> women<00:04:32.140> want<00:04:32.410> breast<00:04:32.710> surgery<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
why young women want breast surgery and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.490 
why young women want breast surgery and
and<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:33.760> think<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.660> development<00:04:35.260> of<00:04:35.380> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
and I think that the development of the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.410 
and I think that the development of the
breast<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.040> very<00:04:36.370> sensitive<00:04:36.910> issue<00:04:37.120> to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
breast is a very sensitive issue to

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.790 
breast is a very sensitive issue to
young<00:04:37.630> women<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.110> it's<00:04:38.260> something<00:04:38.470> that's

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
young women and it's something that's

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.850 
young women and it's something that's
important<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.370> them<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:39.850> our<00:04:40.690> job<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.500> what<00:04:41.710> we

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
important to them so our job and what we

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.440 
important to them so our job and what we
stay<00:04:42.130> up<00:04:42.310> at<00:04:42.460> night<00:04:42.490> doing<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.120> trying<00:04:43.360> to

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
stay up at night doing is trying to

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.220 
stay up at night doing is trying to
minimize<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:44.440> risk<00:04:44.680> if<00:04:45.520> these<00:04:45.880> adult<00:04:46.720> young

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
minimize the risk if these adult young

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.140 
minimize the risk if these adult young
women<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.860> we<00:04:47.950> feel<00:04:48.160> they<00:04:48.340> should<00:04:48.610> be<00:04:48.760> 18

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
women and we feel they should be 18

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.040 
women and we feel they should be 18
years<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.570> age

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
years of age

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.200 
years of age
the<00:04:50.380> FDA<00:04:50.680> feels<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.280> same<00:04:51.490> way<00:04:51.730> that<00:04:52.000> they

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the FDA feels the same way that they

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.720 
the FDA feels the same way that they
should<00:04:52.240> be<00:04:52.660> at<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.960> age<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.500> maturity<00:04:53.980> to<00:04:54.430> make

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
should be at the age of maturity to make

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.850 
should be at the age of maturity to make
this<00:04:54.910> decision<00:04:55.330> our<00:04:56.020> job<00:04:56.290> is<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.530> minimize

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
this decision our job is to minimize

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.130 
this decision our job is to minimize
their<00:04:57.430> risk<00:04:57.460> if<00:04:58.060> they're<00:04:58.360> going<00:04:58.630> to<00:04:58.750> do<00:04:58.930> that

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
their risk if they're going to do that

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.410 
their risk if they're going to do that
and<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.830> I<00:05:00.040> think<00:05:00.100> is<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.550> important<00:05:01.030> lesson

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
and that I think is the important lesson

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.540 
and that I think is the important lesson
here<00:05:01.450> for<00:05:01.720> for<00:05:02.470> young<00:05:02.830> women<00:05:03.190> for<00:05:03.400> their
