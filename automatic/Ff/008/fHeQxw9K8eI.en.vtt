I<00:00:46.270> walked<00:00:46.870> all<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.410> way<00:00:47.560> around<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.850> get<00:00:49.030> to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240

I walked all the way around to get to
the<00:00:49.360> hidden<00:00:49.510> village<00:00:49.720> but<00:00:50.080> I'm<00:00:50.140> going<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.500> warp

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
here and trans transport this bridge

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.930 
here and trans transport this bridge
back<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:55.030> on<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.620> bridge<00:00:56.620> of<00:00:56.950> Eldon<00:00:57.400> or<00:00:57.580> Eldon

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.790 
back to on the bridge of Eldon or Eldon
bridge<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.510> get<00:00:58.660> it<00:00:58.809> back<00:00:58.930> going<00:00:59.470> so<00:00:59.620> it's<00:00:59.739> a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
bridge and get it back going so it's a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.400 
bridge and get it back going so it's a
lot<00:00:59.950> easier<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.550> navigate<00:01:00.580> through<00:01:07.050> it's<00:01:08.050> not

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
lot easier to navigate through it's not

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.680 
lot easier to navigate through it's not
uh<00:01:08.440> it's<00:01:09.100> not<00:01:09.700> what<00:01:09.759> you'd<00:01:10.000> expect

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
uh it's not what you'd expect

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.540 
uh it's not what you'd expect
originally<00:01:11.470> when<00:01:11.680> when<00:01:12.070> you're<00:01:12.190> first<00:01:12.310> going

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
originally when when you're first going

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.310 
originally when when you're first going
through<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.970> game<00:01:13.150> it's<00:01:13.420> like<00:01:13.540> wait<00:01:14.140> they

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
through the game it's like wait they

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.150 
through the game it's like wait they
want<00:01:14.530> me<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:15.450> move<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.630> whole<00:01:16.780> bridge<00:01:17.110> is<00:01:17.440> that

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
want me to move the whole bridge is that

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.450 
want me to move the whole bridge is that
it's<00:01:19.150> sort<00:01:19.360> of<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.540> weird<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:20.070> plot<00:01:21.070> point<00:01:21.100> you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
it's sort of a weird a plot point you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.859 
it's sort of a weird a plot point you
know<00:01:21.580> I<00:01:21.610> don't<00:01:21.880> think<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.450> don't<00:01:22.690> think

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
know I don't think you I don't think

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.570 
know I don't think you I don't think
I've<00:01:23.110> ever<00:01:23.140> played<00:01:23.500> any<00:01:23.710> other<00:01:23.920> games<00:01:24.220> in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
I've ever played any other games in

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.160 
I've ever played any other games in
which<00:01:24.790> you're<00:01:24.970> required<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.600> move<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.840> bridge

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
which you're required to move the bridge

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.800 
which you're required to move the bridge
I<00:01:26.880> can't<00:01:27.880> think<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.270> any

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
I can't think of any

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.249 
I can't think of any
especially<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:29.950> Anna's<00:01:30.310> ala<00:01:30.520> game<00:01:30.790> I've<00:01:31.259> never

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
especially in Anna's ala game I've never

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.760 
especially in Anna's ala game I've never
been<00:01:32.440> even<00:01:32.560> close<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.220> moving<00:01:33.369> something<00:01:33.910> this

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
been even close to moving something this

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.950 
been even close to moving something this
but<00:01:36.340> she's<00:01:37.060> able<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.359> do<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.600> min<00:01:37.780> that's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
but she's able to do it min that's

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.870 
but she's able to do it min that's
pretty<00:01:38.170> strong<00:01:38.500> with<00:01:38.740> her<00:01:38.859> magic<00:01:39.250> power<00:01:39.429> so

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
pretty strong with her magic power so

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.450 
pretty strong with her magic power so
got<00:01:40.329> that<00:01:40.359> taken<00:01:40.719> care<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:41.320> now<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.189> can

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
got that taken care of and now we can

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.130 
got that taken care of and now we can
warp<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.030> button<00:01:43.299> it's<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.600> lot<00:01:43.780> closer

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
warp to this button it's a lot closer

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.800 
warp to this button it's a lot closer
than<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.579> run<00:01:45.820> all<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.299> way<00:01:46.420> around<00:01:46.689> the

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
than is to run all the way around the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.090 
than is to run all the way around the
entire<00:01:47.100> inside<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.219> map<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:50.619> I'm<00:01:50.979> sure

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
entire inside of the map and as I'm sure

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.010 
entire inside of the map and as I'm sure
cody<00:01:51.460> has<00:01:51.609> noticed<00:01:52.030> this<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.509> gamecube

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
cody has noticed this is the gamecube

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.660 
cody has noticed this is the gamecube
version<00:01:53.049> so<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.860> hidden<00:01:54.009> village<00:01:54.280> and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
version so the hidden village and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.990 
version so the hidden village and
everything<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.630> right<00:01:57.000> everything's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
everything is on the right everything's

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.090 
everything is on the right everything's
mixed<00:01:58.569> up

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
mixed up

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.980 
mixed up
funny<00:02:00.280> how<00:02:00.490> they<00:02:00.670> did<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.120> I<00:02:01.180> guess<00:02:01.510> it's<00:02:01.750> a

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
funny how they did that I guess it's a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.440 
funny how they did that I guess it's a
it<00:02:02.950> sort<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.310> gives<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.670> some<00:02:03.880> replayability

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
it sort of gives it some replayability

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.270 
it sort of gives it some replayability

that<00:04:30.000> we<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.300> this<00:04:30.480> book<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:33.090> video

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.190 

I'm<00:04:36.880> just<00:04:37.150> going<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.330> talk<00:04:37.480> about<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.870> bucha

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
I'm just going to talk about that bucha

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.560 
I'm just going to talk about that bucha
the<00:04:38.440> whether<00:04:39.130> they'd<00:04:39.520> appear<00:04:39.940> in<00:04:40.090> Skyward

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
the whether they'd appear in Skyward

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.670 
the whether they'd appear in Skyward
Sword<00:04:41.970> it<00:04:42.970> would<00:04:43.180> make<00:04:43.390> sense<00:04:43.630> but<00:04:43.900> I<00:04:44.020> don't

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
Sword it would make sense but I don't

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.040 
Sword it would make sense but I don't
think<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.070> because<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.520> generally<00:04:46.090> each

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
think so because just generally each

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.580 
think so because just generally each
game<00:04:47.830> has<00:04:48.160> some<00:04:48.490> sort<00:04:48.700> of<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.960> know<00:04:50.020> creature

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.740 
game has some sort of you know creature
that<00:04:51.070> they<00:04:51.340> invent<00:04:51.970> for<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.300> game<00:04:52.540> that

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
that they invent for that game that

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.560 
that they invent for that game that
doesn't<00:04:53.020> appear<00:04:53.320> again<00:04:53.850> yeah<00:04:54.850> it<00:04:55.330> looks<00:04:55.510> like
