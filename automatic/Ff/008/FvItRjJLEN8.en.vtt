we<00:01:41.100> were<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> underdogs<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.299> were<00:01:42.360> weaker<00:01:42.899> we

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
we were the underdogs we were weaker we

we were the underdogs we were weaker we
are<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.130> powerful<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:45.170> using<00:01:46.170> our<00:01:46.350> wits

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
are not as powerful but using our wits

and<00:01:46.829> our<00:01:46.979> intuition<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:47.820> our<00:01:47.939> logic<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.720> can

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and our intuition and our logic we can

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.600 
and our intuition and our logic we can
figure<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.319> way<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.709> level<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> playing

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
figure out a way to level the playing

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.309 
figure out a way to level the playing
field<00:01:50.729> let's<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.840> can't<00:01:52.080> buy<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
field let's see if we can't buy the

00:01:52.319 --> 00:02:04.030 
field let's see if we can't buy the
world<00:01:52.590> another<00:01:52.890> day
