you got a traditional cambered board at
the<00:00:22.410> high<00:00:22.529> point<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.070> center<00:00:23.430> try<00:00:24.150> to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the high point in the center try to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.060 
the high point in the center try to
intrude<00:00:24.600> camber<00:00:25.080> performance<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.830> one

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
intrude camber performance to this one

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
intrude camber performance to this one
it's<00:00:26.519> gonna<00:00:26.609> make<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> really<00:00:27.150> snappy<00:00:27.630> give<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it's gonna make it really snappy give a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470 
it's gonna make it really snappy give a
good<00:00:28.140> pop<00:00:28.500> coming<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> turns<00:00:29.580> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
do have their slime ball sidewall which

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
do have their slime ball sidewall which
is<00:00:33.690> nice<00:00:34.100> bigger<00:00:35.100> guys<00:00:35.309> you're<00:00:35.520> probably

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
is nice bigger guys you're probably

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.100 
is nice bigger guys you're probably
putting<00:00:35.969> bigger<00:00:36.239> weight<00:00:36.450> down<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.989> snow

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
putting bigger weight down on the snow

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
putting bigger weight down on the snow
this<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.100> gonna<00:00:38.250> act<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.910> shock

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this is gonna act as kind of a shock

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
this is gonna act as kind of a shock
absorber<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:40.110> gonna<00:00:40.230> take<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> lot<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
absorber it's gonna take a lot of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
absorber it's gonna take a lot of
chatter<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> icy<00:00:41.670> hard<00:00:41.879> pack<00:00:42.090> train

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
chatter from the icy hard pack train

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.560 
chatter from the icy hard pack train
it's<00:00:43.350> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> be<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.800> durable<00:00:44.300> as<00:00:45.300> well

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
it's going to be more durable as well

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.130 
it's going to be more durable as well
too<00:00:45.980> from<00:00:46.980> their<00:00:47.390> full<00:00:48.390> tip<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> tail<00:00:48.870> wood

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
too from their full tip to tail wood

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.979 
too from their full tip to tail wood
core<00:00:49.430> this<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:50.610> does<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.059> some<00:00:51.690> linear

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
core this one does have some linear

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.560 
core this one does have some linear
carbon<00:00:52.469> running<00:00:53.010> through<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> just

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
carbon running through it which is just

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
carbon running through it which is just
gonna<00:00:54.690> help<00:00:55.020> give<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.649> board<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.190> bit

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
gonna help give the board a little bit

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.889 
gonna help give the board a little bit
more<00:00:56.550> supportive<00:00:56.969> flex<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> bigger<00:00:57.660> guy

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
more supportive flex for a bigger guy

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.410 
more supportive flex for a bigger guy
but<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.070> add<00:00:59.219> too<00:00:59.430> much<00:00:59.550> weight<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
but not add too much weight on to it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.070 
but not add too much weight on to it
like<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> thicker<00:01:01.680> core<00:01:02.280> profile<00:01:02.730> wood<00:01:03.080> from

shape<00:01:38.280> on<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.689> little

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
shape on this one it's gonna be a little

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
shape on this one it's gonna be a little
directional<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.400> slightly

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
directional you can have just a slightly

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.200 
directional you can have just a slightly
longer<00:01:42.240> nose<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.200> would<00:01:43.350> tail

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
longer nose and then you would tail

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.819 
longer nose and then you would tail
basically<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.509> they're<00:01:46.439> assuming<00:01:46.740> that
