00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.940
At Brother Animal Rescue our mission is to help build a No Kill Community,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.740
where no homeless dogs or cats are ever euthanized for population control,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.300
and where true euthanasia is reserved only for animals with no hope of rehabilitation.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.320
We know we can’t just spay-neuter and adopt our way to No Kill:

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.860
we know we must work equally hard to help keep cats and dogs from ever entering the shelter system in the first place.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.300
Through our “NeighborCorps” program, our volunteers go door to door,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.260
neighborhood by neighborhood,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.120
to educate folks about the resources available for pets with medical or behavioral issues,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.860
and the support we offer to help make their yard safe and secure for their pets and children.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.240
Along the way, we often encounter neighbors at odds with each other over the care of their pets.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
It was only a generation or so ago, that if someone’s dog got out or cat got loose,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.680
some good neighbor would help catch it and walk it back over.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.140
Or if a neighbor was in crisis and needed help caring for their pets, their kids, or their home,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.260
folks would get involved and give help…

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.640
Nowadays, most people just call animal control, the police department, or social services on each other–

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.260
and as a result, we’ve outsourced good neighboring to local government.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.720
We've become more and more isolated from one another and less and less&nbsp;supportive of each another.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.860
Our NeighborCorps program seeks to engage citizens in a common&nbsp;mission

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.080
–one we can all agree on–

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.100
achieving a No-Kill community for homeless pets.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.240
We’re confident that with all&nbsp;us working together, we can get there!

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.140
And along the way, we’ll be helping build a stronger community too.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.220
"It really... cracked open my heart."

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.780
"I don't have a lot of money to throw at projects but I have some knowledge and some time...

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.920
and some expertise in certain areas.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.200
And I feel like that's the biggest asset that I can give back to a project like this."

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.020
"If we call all work together,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.000
what an awesome place this would be!"

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.940
"Any time you can involve a community

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.640
you can involve the people that live there,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.640
to be part of solutions,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.960
then you have solutions that last."
