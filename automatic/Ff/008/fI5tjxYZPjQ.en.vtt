day<00:02:57.720> another<00:02:58.109> player<00:02:58.379> he's<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.829> too<00:02:59.010> similar

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
day another player he's not too similar

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.640 
day another player he's not too similar
but<00:02:59.459> he's<00:02:59.579> tall<00:02:59.819> and<00:02:59.970> got<00:03:00.810> some<00:03:01.049> skill<00:03:01.319> move<00:03:01.500> so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
but he's tall and got some skill move so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.140 
but he's tall and got some skill move so
that's<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.950> reason<00:03:01.980> most<00:03:02.639> of<00:03:02.819> them<00:03:02.909> are<00:03:03.120> in

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
that's the reason most of them are in

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
that's the reason most of them are in
there<00:03:03.510> guys<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.889> like<00:03:05.069> said<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
there guys and then that like said the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.119 
there guys and then that like said the
only<00:03:05.639> reason<00:03:05.879> Moreno<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:06.540> fighter<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
only reason Moreno is that fighter the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.410 
only reason Moreno is that fighter the
silver<00:03:08.129> was<00:03:08.430> Latin<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.060> after<00:03:09.329> the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
silver was Latin because after the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.479 
silver was Latin because after the
school<00:03:09.629> town<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.079> effectively<00:03:10.799> what<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.159> used

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
school town is effectively what I used

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.330 
school town is effectively what I used
to<00:03:11.780> abuse<00:03:12.780> when<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.049> use<00:03:13.200> Latin<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.769> much<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.220> I

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
to abuse when I use Latin so much and I

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.240 
to abuse when I use Latin so much and I
think<00:03:14.790> they<00:03:14.879> kind<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.269> make<00:03:15.420> sense<00:03:15.450> because

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
think they kind of make sense because

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.159 
think they kind of make sense because
Moreno<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.519> me<00:03:17.639> does<00:03:18.239> play<00:03:18.569> quite<00:03:18.840> similar

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
Moreno for me does play quite similar

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.180 
Moreno for me does play quite similar
but<00:03:19.199> he<00:03:19.410> doesn't<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.799> strength<00:03:19.919> of

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
but he doesn't have the strength of

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.220 
but he doesn't have the strength of
course<00:03:20.370> as<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.639> undoes<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.750> goalkeeper

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
course as that undoes so the goalkeeper

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.409 
course as that undoes so the goalkeeper
rufiyaa<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.829> he<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.519> incredible<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> man

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
rufiyaa and he is incredible the man

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.500 
rufiyaa and he is incredible the man
made<00:03:24.599> so<00:03:24.900> many<00:03:24.959> good<00:03:25.230> saves<00:03:25.440> me<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.060> he<00:03:27.060> has<00:03:27.389> it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
made so many good saves me and he has it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.849

good<00:04:00.090> combo<00:04:00.510> because<00:04:00.659> once<00:04:00.900> its<00:04:01.139> back<00:04:01.199> at

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
good combo because once its back at

to get used to meas got his gold game
ratio<00:04:26.219> was<00:04:26.430> actually<00:04:26.760> quite<00:04:26.909> negative

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
ratio was actually quite negative

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.550 
ratio was actually quite negative
for<00:04:27.610> me<00:04:27.729> and<00:04:28.000> if<00:04:28.780> I'm<00:04:28.930> great<00:04:29.169> before<00:04:29.410> use<00:04:29.530> a
