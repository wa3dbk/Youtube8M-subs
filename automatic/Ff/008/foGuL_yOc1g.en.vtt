it's<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.220> far-fetched<00:00:47.549> to<00:00:48.089> think<00:00:48.120> Mario

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it's not so far-fetched to think Mario

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.229

this<00:00:51.540> happening<00:00:52.049> in<00:00:52.229> a<00:00:52.320> drug-induced<00:00:52.710> dream

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this happening in a drug-induced dream

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850

and<00:00:53.460> even<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.940> Mario<00:00:54.299> Brothers<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.839> an<00:00:55.049> end<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and even in Mario Brothers to an end it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.700 
and even in Mario Brothers to an end it
was<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.580> a<00:00:56.699> dream<00:00:56.940> however<00:00:57.299> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:58.080> it<00:00:58.500> goes

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
was just a dream however I think it goes

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.649 
was just a dream however I think it goes
much<00:00:58.979> deeper<00:00:59.040> than<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.790> a<00:01:00.150> dream<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
much deeper than just a dream and

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.170 
much deeper than just a dream and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
theory was presented to me in several

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.429 
theory was presented to me in several
forms<00:01:05.760> many<00:01:06.240> people<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.869> asked<00:01:07.140> various
