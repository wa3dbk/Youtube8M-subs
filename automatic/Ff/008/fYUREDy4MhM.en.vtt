00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.970
 hi how are you doing now that we are like 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.559
 to answer a question that makes us 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.469
 for show 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.680
 bernasconi and good the consultation of him is 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.660
 that apparently has an edger 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 electrical and according to what it says is of the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 more common and they do not work 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.650
 automatic cut automatic cut 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.750
 many times that the cut that has 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.280
 that when one the tanza rotates 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.310
 has a small cutter or some razor 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.100
 or something an edge cited sharp where it happens 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.500
 the dance and it is cut automatically is 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.380
 good that so you always have a 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.660
 graduation sets the dance but good the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.600
 problem that he has apparently is 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.519
 that the dance is cut very quickly 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.199
 when it 's cutting the grass 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.239
 can get to have in general two 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.720
 types of problems or that the engine 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.070
 work at a very high revolutions 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.739
 that could become one of the 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.720
 disadvantages for which good is already 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.210
 a factory problem or have to do 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.790
 see the team by a technician 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.910
 specialized and that you see it working 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.950
 running them to the team and that could 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.930
 be a reason why the tanza is 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.680
 cut but I have some examples of 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.250
 kansas for edgers is that the tanza 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.800
 that you are using be very thin that 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.490
 be very fine the tanza always when one 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.070
 will buy is bought by the diameter 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.320
 of the cup in this case is a rate of 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.220
 25 millimeters 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.560
 and well maybe he has a break of 15 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.870
 millimeters can have 2 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.060
 millimeters if you see that the rate is 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.729
 they cut very fast can then be 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 one of these two variations I as 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.660
 we are taking this opportunity to show you 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.050
 there are different types of dances 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:01.040
 depending on the diameter we can put 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.660
 kansas thicker thinner and also 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 what they see in this case of different 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.160
 colors 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.440
 there are so many that have a round section 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.830
 so if I make a cut that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.709
 this gives me something round or square in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.890
 this case the square that also 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.670
 buy by the section let's say in this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.010
 case is 2.5 like the other but it is 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.950
 square millimeter but it is square 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.100
 says according to the experts that 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.650
 this makes a cut on the lawn or in what 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.540
 that one is going to cut more neat or 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.850
 that a cut type with centuries shortened 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.670
 with scissors because he has 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.130
 edges instead of rounded 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.140
 square but in short I think that 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.599
 an edger always cuts by the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.989
 momentum for the high revolution or the high 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.330
 speed at which the little motor goes 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.970
 has the rimmed good in this case 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.550
 I think your problem would have to be 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.770
 analyze it a little more and see if you 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.300
 problem is the diameter of the tanza that 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.300
 you could live to a diameter of a 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.340
 little bit bigger or see if the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.620
 revolutions of the edgers are very 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.569
 high and they make that cut in the tranza 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.730
 with a very high frequency that 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.350
 it really is very uncomfortable and it does not give you 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.600
 desire to mow the lawn when one 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.489
 so quickly cuts the sauce good 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.040
 I hope that it serves you something 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.040
 explanation and see you next 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.040
 Thank you
