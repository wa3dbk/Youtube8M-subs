00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
thinking there in fact let's just go

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.510 
thinking there in fact let's just go
into<00:03:15.910> Richard<00:03:16.910> now<00:03:18.040> nope<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.190> already<00:03:19.370> did

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
into Richard now nope you already did

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.910 
into Richard now nope you already did
that<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:22.190> can<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:22.670> defog<00:03:23.270> until<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.140> die

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.480 

or<00:03:27.920> can<00:03:28.130> even<00:03:28.250> haunt<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.790> let's<00:03:29.240> turn<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.400> we

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
or can even haunt it let's turn it so we

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.699 
or can even haunt it let's turn it so we
can't<00:03:31.730> do<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.090> stuff<00:03:34.959> now<00:03:35.959> he<00:03:36.020> has<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.440> switch

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
can't do this stuff now he has to switch

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.520 
can't do this stuff now he has to switch
pretty<00:03:37.010> much<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:38.570> what's<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.200> gonna<00:03:39.260> switch

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
pretty much so what's you gonna switch

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.600 
pretty much so what's you gonna switch
to<00:03:39.790> probably<00:03:40.790> heat<00:03:40.970> Transco<00:03:41.480> into<00:03:41.630> Venus<00:03:41.780> or

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
to probably heat Transco into Venus or

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.960 
to probably heat Transco into Venus or
see<00:03:43.610> if<00:03:43.700> we<00:03:43.850> can<00:03:44.980> mega<00:03:45.980> evolve<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.640> kill<00:03:46.820> this

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
see if we can mega evolve and kill this

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.770 
see if we can mega evolve and kill this
thing<00:03:48.220> let's<00:03:49.220> do<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:50.410> fire<00:03:51.410> blast<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:52.540> thick<00:03:53.540> fat

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
thing let's do it fire blast a thick fat

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.570 
thing let's do it fire blast a thick fat
Oh<00:03:54.250> God

hit<00:06:52.160> so<00:06:53.160> yeah<00:06:53.340> I<00:06:53.370> definitely<00:06:53.580> think<00:06:54.300> I<00:06:54.480> would

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
hit so yeah I definitely think I would

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.810 
hit so yeah I definitely think I would
have<00:06:54.720> won<00:06:54.900> the<00:06:55.370> venusaur<00:06:56.370> could<00:06:56.490> have<00:06:56.580> came<00:06:56.700> in

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
have won the venusaur could have came in

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.900 
have won the venusaur could have came in
and<00:06:56.940> Giga<00:06:57.090> Drain<00:06:57.300> did<00:06:57.570> anytime<00:06:57.900> I<00:06:57.930> Mamoswine<00:06:58.410> I

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
and Giga Drain did anytime I Mamoswine I

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.950 
and Giga Drain did anytime I Mamoswine I
think<00:06:59.910> Venus<00:07:00.210> or<00:07:00.390> coulda<00:07:00.570> like<00:07:00.750> killer

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960
