00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
still watch this tutorial because i'm

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.870 
still watch this tutorial because i'm
going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.830> show<00:00:13.889> different<00:00:14.009> variations<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.730> it

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
going to show different variations of it

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.990 
going to show different variations of it
and<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.540> get<00:00:15.660> pretty<00:00:15.809> interesting<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.340> to

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and you can get pretty interesting so to

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.019 
and you can get pretty interesting so to
start<00:00:18.150> off<00:00:18.330> three<00:00:18.990> basic<00:00:19.320> steps<00:00:19.760> first<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
start off three basic steps first is the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.720 
start off three basic steps first is the
pop<00:00:21.240> sucking<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> push<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.130> third

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
pop sucking is the push and the third

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.640 
pop sucking is the push and the third
part<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> directing<00:00:24.750> your<00:00:24.869> land<00:00:25.140> onto<00:00:25.439> your

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
part is directing your land onto your

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.960 
part is directing your land onto your
feet<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> it's<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.300> simultaneous<00:00:27.689> move

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
feet so it's kind of a simultaneous move

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.189 
feet so it's kind of a simultaneous move
it's<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.179> more<00:00:30.420> sequential<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.990> when<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
it's actually more sequential is when I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.500 
it's actually more sequential is when I
right<00:00:31.380> after<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> other<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.420> you're

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
right after the other so first you're

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.450 
right after the other so first you're
going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.750> pop<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:34.890> you're<00:00:35.010> going<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> push

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
going to pop then you're going to push

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.510 
going to pop then you're going to push
then<00:00:36.149> you're<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> land<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.750> feet

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
then you're going to land on your feet

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
then you're going to land on your feet
I'll<00:00:38.520> show<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:45.210> single<00:00:54.140> let's<00:00:55.140> crush

how<00:01:08.610> much<00:01:08.850> easier<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> learn<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
how much easier will be to learn it on a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.840 
how much easier will be to learn it on a
bit<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> mattress<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.090> ah

up<00:02:02.119> um<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> now<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.590> let's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
up um so now that we have that now let's

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.199 
up um so now that we have that now let's
try<00:02:07.920> working<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> top<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> go

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
try working on the top are going to go

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.450 
try working on the top are going to go
down<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.530> trick<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
down the trick is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.670 
down the trick is
up<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.120> contract<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:13.350> you're<00:02:13.470> gonna<00:02:13.560> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
up then you contract so you're gonna be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.980 
up then you contract so you're gonna be
like<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.010> got<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.240> see<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.510> right<00:02:15.600> there<00:02:15.660> I

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
like I got you see that right there I

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.950 
like I got you see that right there I
just<00:02:16.170> got<00:02:16.350> some<00:02:16.470> air<00:02:16.650> time<00:02:16.820> now<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.750> want<00:02:18.900> to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
just got some air time now you want to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.630

weeks<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.810> i'm<00:03:42.900> trying<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.140> figure<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.410> out

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
weeks and i'm trying to figure it out

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.310 
weeks and i'm trying to figure it out
and<00:03:43.650> i<00:03:43.740> just<00:03:43.770> can't<00:03:44.040> do<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.840> one<00:03:46.080> tip

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
and i just can't do it and the one tip

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.450 
and i just can't do it and the one tip
that<00:03:46.350> makes<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.830> move<00:03:47.010> possible<00:03:47.370> which

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
that makes this move possible which

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.510 
that makes this move possible which
people<00:03:47.730> do<00:03:47.820> not<00:03:47.940> know<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.780> use<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:49.050> head

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
people do not know is you use your head

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.590 
people do not know is you use your head
okay<00:03:50.520> so<00:03:50.580> now<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.820> we've<00:03:51.030> taken<00:03:51.240> care<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
okay so now that we've taken care of the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.860 
okay so now that we've taken care of the
three<00:03:51.810> parts<00:03:52.080> pop<00:03:52.830> push<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.610> land<00:03:53.880> alright

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
three parts pop push and land alright

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.120 
three parts pop push and land alright
the<00:03:55.020> landing<00:03:55.320> part<00:03:55.500> will<00:03:55.590> probably<00:03:55.980> be<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the landing part will probably be the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.430 
the landing part will probably be the
hardest<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:57.360> use<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.660> mattress<00:03:57.990> like<00:03:58.110> i<00:03:58.230> said

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
hardest so use the mattress like i said

and you'll be amazed at how much faster
you'll<00:04:00.660> learn<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.900> move<00:04:01.100> now<00:04:02.100> they're

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
you'll learn to move now they're

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.100 
you'll learn to move now they're
different<00:04:02.610> variations<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.270> move<00:04:03.510> this

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110
