hi I'm Sean Newman SonicX the co2 from

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.370 
hi I'm Sean Newman SonicX the co2 from
the<00:00:04.890> mp3<00:00:05.400> car<00:00:05.580> forum<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.150> today<00:00:06.840> I<00:00:06.870> have<00:00:07.080> in

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
the mp3 car forum and today I have in

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.799 
the mp3 car forum and today I have in
front<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.650> me<00:00:07.710> four<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> latest<00:00:09.090> 7-inch

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
front of me four of the latest 7-inch

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.009 
front of me four of the latest 7-inch
touchscreen<00:00:10.110> devices<00:00:10.800> out<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> market

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
touchscreen devices out on the market

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.540 
touchscreen devices out on the market
I've<00:00:13.019> got<00:00:13.200> these<00:00:13.380> four<00:00:13.680> because<00:00:14.070> they're<00:00:14.190> each

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 
I've got these four because they're each

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.270 
I've got these four because they're each
a<00:00:14.760> little<00:00:14.970> bit<00:00:15.059> different<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:16.320> their<00:00:17.010> own

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
a little bit different in their own

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.370 
a little bit different in their own
unique<00:00:17.640> ways<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.480> guess<00:00:18.510> they<00:00:18.780> all<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.140> some

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
unique ways I guess they all have some

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.980 
unique ways I guess they all have some
of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> same<00:00:20.510> specifications<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.720> them<00:00:21.900> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
of the same specifications on them in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.019 
of the same specifications on them in
terms<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> resolution<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
terms of the resolution and the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.790 
terms of the resolution and the
brightness<00:00:24.270> but<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.930> wanted<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.320> put

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
brightness but I just wanted to put

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.590 
brightness but I just wanted to put
together<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.130> quick<00:00:26.279> video<00:00:26.490> differentiate<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
together a quick video differentiate the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.650 
together a quick video differentiate the
differences<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.850> have<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> little<00:00:30.480> put

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
differences so we have the little put

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.889 
differences so we have the little put
669<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> high<00:00:31.980> brightness<00:00:32.220> model

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
669 this is the high brightness model

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.990 
669 this is the high brightness model
that's<00:00:33.899> come<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.230> late<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.590> 2010<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> believe

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that's come out late in 2010 I believe

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.280 
that's come out late in 2010 I believe
and<00:00:36.239> then<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.829> mini<00:00:38.309> touch<00:00:39.140> 707<00:00:40.140> inch

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
and then we have the mini touch 707 inch

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.940 
and then we have the mini touch 707 inch
display<00:00:41.450> again<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.660> came<00:00:42.840> out<00:00:42.989> late<00:00:43.200> 2010

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
display again that came out late 2010

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
now because of the price then we have

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.920 
now because of the price then we have
the<00:00:49.590> element<00:00:49.860> 7<00:00:50.850> inch<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.450> this<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the element 7 inch and this one is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.290 
the element 7 inch and this one is
advertised<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> transflective<00:00:53.370> model<00:00:54.090> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
advertised as a transflective model so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.670 
advertised as a transflective model so
we'll<00:00:54.450> go<00:00:54.570> ahead<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.750> light<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.590> how

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
we'll go ahead and light that up see how

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.459 
we'll go ahead and light that up see how
it<00:00:55.739> compares<00:00:55.950> with<00:00:56.309> some<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.670> other<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
it compares with some of these other and

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
it compares with some of these other and
then<00:00:58.469> last<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.280> least<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.760> Big<00:01:00.329> Mama

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
then last but not least we have Big Mama

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.759 
then last but not least we have Big Mama
the<00:01:00.829> 7-inch<00:01:01.829> lilliput<00:01:02.460> saw<00:01:03.769> touchscreen

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the 7-inch lilliput saw touchscreen

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.379 
the 7-inch lilliput saw touchscreen
device<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.399> that's<00:01:05.549> got<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> surface

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:06.389 
device and that's got the surface

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:09.080 
device and that's got the surface
acoustic<00:01:06.689> wave<00:01:06.929> technology<00:01:07.380> built-in<00:01:08.219> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
acoustic wave technology built-in so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.239 
acoustic wave technology built-in so
let's<00:01:09.420> go<00:01:09.539> ahead<00:01:09.569> and<00:01:09.869> power<00:01:10.439> these<00:01:10.709> up<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.189> if

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:11.249 
let's go ahead and power these up see if

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:13.069 
let's go ahead and power these up see if
we<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.459> get<00:01:11.549> some<00:01:11.609> compare<00:01:12.149> contrast<00:01:12.359> videos

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
we can get some compare contrast videos

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.969 
we can get some compare contrast videos
going<00:01:13.709> and<00:01:13.889> here<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.399> go<00:01:14.990> okay<00:01:15.990> first<00:01:16.469> up<00:01:16.740> here

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
going and here we go okay first up here

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160 
going and here we go okay first up here
we<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.849> lowly<00:01:18.090> put<00:01:18.329> 669<00:01:18.959> high

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
we have the lowly put 669 high

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289 
we have the lowly put 669 high
brightness<00:01:19.409> model<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.819> we<00:01:20.999> have<00:01:21.149> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
brightness model and then we have the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.089 
brightness model and then we have the
mini<00:01:21.479> touch<00:01:21.689> 700<00:01:22.380> over<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:22.679> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.859> left

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:23.099 
mini touch 700 over here on the left

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.050 
mini touch 700 over here on the left
we've<00:01:23.999> got<00:01:24.209> these<00:01:24.389> of<00:01:24.979> these<00:01:25.979> desktops<00:01:26.670> or

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
we've got these of these desktops or

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.300 
we've got these of these desktops or
these<00:01:27.270> displays<00:01:27.779> mirrored<00:01:28.469> so<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.950> should<00:01:29.130> see

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
these displays mirrored so we should see

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
these displays mirrored so we should see
the<00:01:29.429> same<00:01:29.669> thing<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.090> both<00:01:30.119> screens<00:01:30.569> and<00:01:31.020> you

the same thing on both screens and you
can<00:01:31.200> kind<00:01:31.349> of<00:01:31.469> see<00:01:31.609> the<00:01:32.609> difference<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
can kind of see the difference in

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
car especially into high brightness

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.539 
car especially into high brightness
situations<00:02:01.109> and<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.009> again<00:02:02.279> that's<00:02:02.459> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
situations and that again that's a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.039 
situations and that again that's a
little<00:02:02.880> 669<00:02:03.509> go<00:02:04.020> over<00:02:04.139> here<00:02:05.569> this<00:02:06.569> is<00:02:06.749> the<00:02:06.869> mini

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
little 669 go over here this is the mini

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.410 
little 669 go over here this is the mini
took<00:02:07.289> 700<00:02:07.739> and<00:02:08.159> again<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.729> brightness<00:02:09.299> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
took 700 and again the brightness is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.680 
took 700 and again the brightness is
great<00:02:09.659> on<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.140> nice<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.590> sharp

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
great on it it's nice and sharp

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.180 
great on it it's nice and sharp
how<00:02:11.930> much<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.530> coming<00:02:12.860> through<00:02:13.040> on

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
how much of that is coming through on

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.160 
how much of that is coming through on
the<00:02:13.340> video<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.660> mean<00:02:14.780> both<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:14.990> them

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
the video but it's I mean both of them

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.440 
the video but it's I mean both of them
are<00:02:15.350> very<00:02:15.500> very<00:02:15.710> comparable<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.610> these<00:02:17.270> are

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
are very very comparable and these are

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.120 
are very very comparable and these are
at<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.690> default<00:02:18.170> settings<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.830> haven't

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
at the default settings I haven't

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.800 
at the default settings I haven't
adjusted<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.640> brightness<00:02:19.670> or<00:02:20.180> contrast<00:02:20.210> or

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
adjusted the brightness or contrast or

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.630 
adjusted the brightness or contrast or
anything<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.350> you<00:02:21.380> probably<00:02:21.740> could<00:02:22.190> get<00:02:22.490> an

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
anything so you probably could get an

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.010 
anything so you probably could get an
improvement<00:02:22.940> out<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.540> with<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:23.870> a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
improvement out of that with just a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.100 
improvement out of that with just a
little<00:02:24.110> bit<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.410> work<00:02:25.060> but<00:02:26.060> these<00:02:26.540> two<00:02:26.750> devices

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
little bit of work but these two devices

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.100 
little bit of work but these two devices
are<00:02:27.470> pretty<00:02:27.710> comparable<00:02:28.240> now<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.300> mini<00:02:29.870> touch

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
are pretty comparable now the mini touch

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.420 
are pretty comparable now the mini touch
doesn't<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:31.000> hdmi<00:02:32.000> input<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.380> 669<00:02:34.040> does

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
doesn't have hdmi input and the 669 does

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.820 
doesn't have hdmi input and the 669 does
so<00:02:34.700> there's<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.970> big<00:02:35.210> obvious<00:02:35.690> plus<00:02:36.560> for<00:02:36.740> the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
so there's a big obvious plus for the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.550 
so there's a big obvious plus for the
6696<00:02:37.490> excite<00:02:38.060> not<00:02:38.390> has<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> vga<00:02:39.140> connection

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.830

you<00:02:42.530> want<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.830> hook<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.070> up<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.340> computer

you want to hook it up to a computer
mini<00:02:44.840> touch<00:02:45.050> does<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:46.100> very<00:02:46.550> very<00:02:46.820> nice

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
mini touch does have a very very nice

mini touch does have a very very nice

capable management system where
everything<00:02:48.980> just<00:02:49.010> kind<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.460> breaks<00:02:49.760> away

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
everything just kind of breaks away

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.300 
everything just kind of breaks away
there<00:02:50.330> whereas<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.290> little<00:02:51.740> put<00:02:51.920> you've<00:02:52.070> got<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
there whereas a little put you've got to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.830 
there whereas a little put you've got to
plug<00:02:52.430> everything<00:02:52.700> directly<00:02:53.150> into<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.600> back

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
plug everything directly into the back

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.710 
plug everything directly into the back
of<00:02:53.990> the<00:02:54.080> unit<00:02:54.790> other<00:02:55.790> than<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.240> mean<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
of the unit other than that I mean the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.870 
of the unit other than that I mean the
two<00:02:57.080> devices<00:02:57.260> are<00:02:57.650> pretty<00:02:57.860> much<00:02:57.980> even<00:02:58.490> seven

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
two devices are pretty much even seven

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.830 
two devices are pretty much even seven
inch<00:02:59.030> displays<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.680> color<00:03:01.390> looks<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.660> it's

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
inch displays the color looks like it's

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.810 
inch displays the color looks like it's
a<00:03:02.930> lot<00:03:03.110> better<00:03:03.290> on<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.740> 669<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.550> I'm<00:03:04.610> just

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
a lot better on the 669 and I'm just

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.210 
a lot better on the 669 and I'm just
guessing<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:05.480> because<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.470> HDMI

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
guessing that's because of the HDMI

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.780 
guessing that's because of the HDMI
versus<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.970> VGA<00:03:08.450> and<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:10.100> could<00:03:10.310> be<00:03:10.490> just<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
versus the VGA and it could be just the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.240 
versus the VGA and it could be just the
default<00:03:11.000> settings<00:03:11.600> but<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:12.350> do<00:03:12.800> notice<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
default settings but I do notice a

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.070 
default settings but I do notice a
difference<00:03:13.490> in<00:03:13.820> color<00:03:14.030> quality<00:03:14.300> between<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
difference in color quality between the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.040 
difference in color quality between the
two<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:16.310> that's<00:03:16.940> pretty<00:03:17.239> much<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.630> there's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
two but that's pretty much it there's

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.890 
two but that's pretty much it there's
really<00:03:18.520> not<00:03:19.520> that<00:03:19.580> much<00:03:20.000> separating<00:03:20.780> them

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
really not that much separating them

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.240 
really not that much separating them
other<00:03:21.170> than<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.440> fact<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:21.739> one<00:03:21.950> has<00:03:22.100> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
other than the fact that one has the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.330 
other than the fact that one has the
hdmi<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.540> DVI<00:03:23.870> option<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.070> doesn't

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
hdmi and the DVI option and one doesn't

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.740 
hdmi and the DVI option and one doesn't
so<00:03:25.820> we'll<00:03:26.780> go<00:03:26.930> ahead<00:03:27.020> and<00:03:27.170> move<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:28.570> all<00:03:29.570> right

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
so we'll go ahead and move on all right

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.740 
so we'll go ahead and move on all right
now<00:03:29.930> we've<00:03:30.170> got<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.860> 7-inch<00:03:31.730> element<00:03:32.270> display

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
now we've got the 7-inch element display

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.590 
now we've got the 7-inch element display
and<00:03:33.020> we've<00:03:33.709> got<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.250> 7-inch<00:03:34.910> lilliput

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
and we've got the 7-inch lilliput

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.470 
and we've got the 7-inch lilliput
surface<00:03:36.350> acoustic<00:03:36.620> wave<00:03:36.890> display<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.910> you

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
surface acoustic wave display and you

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.270 
surface acoustic wave display and you
can<00:03:38.630> notice<00:03:38.810> right<00:03:39.200> away<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:39.590> both<00:03:40.010> of<00:03:40.040> these

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
can notice right away that both of these

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.840 
can notice right away that both of these
devices<00:03:40.730> are<00:03:41.269> brighter<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.410> mean<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:43.040> think<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
devices are brighter I mean I think the

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.490 
devices are brighter I mean I think the
reason<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:44.300> it's<00:03:44.570> bright<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.110> side<00:03:45.320> is

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
reason that it's bright on this side is

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.920 
reason that it's bright on this side is
because<00:03:45.800> it's<00:03:46.010> transflective<00:03:46.550> and<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.870> a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
because it's transflective and it's a

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.509 
because it's transflective and it's a
brighter<00:03:48.170> on<00:03:48.350> this<00:03:48.530> side<00:03:48.739> because<00:03:49.100> of<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
brighter on this side because of the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.520 
brighter on this side because of the
technology<00:03:50.030> behind<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.930> touch<00:03:51.110> screen<00:03:51.260> that

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530

precise<00:03:55.250> touchscreen<00:03:55.880> on<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.209> device<00:03:56.510> and

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
precise touchscreen on this device and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.060 
precise touchscreen on this device and
I'll<00:03:56.870> definitely<00:03:57.140> give<00:03:57.590> that<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.769> plus

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
I'll definitely give that a plus

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.670 
I'll definitely give that a plus
compared<00:03:58.550> to<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:59.600> other<00:03:59.750> touch<00:04:00.110> screens<00:04:00.470> on

touchscreen feel and sensitivity on that

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.030 
touchscreen feel and sensitivity on that
device<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.269> just<00:04:05.450> amazing<00:04:05.860> alright<00:04:06.860> in<00:04:06.950> the

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
device is just amazing alright in the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.830 
device is just amazing alright in the
last<00:04:07.250> portion<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.760> this<00:04:07.820> little<00:04:08.360> video<00:04:08.540> I'm

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
last portion of this little video I'm

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.300 
last portion of this little video I'm
going<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.019> put<00:04:09.230> together<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.890> will<00:04:10.130> be<00:04:10.280> the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
going to put together it will be the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.370 
going to put together it will be the
comparison<00:04:11.150> between<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.570> surface<00:04:12.110> acoustic

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
comparison between the surface acoustic

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.030 
comparison between the surface acoustic
wave<00:04:12.620> Lilliput<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:14.420> little<00:04:14.600> put<00:04:15.040> 669

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
wave Lilliput and the little put 669

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.920 
wave Lilliput and the little put 669
high<00:04:16.340> brightness<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:17.030> again<00:04:17.419> both<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.690> these

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
high brightness and again both of these

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.320 
high brightness and again both of these
are<00:04:18.080> on<00:04:18.169> HD<00:04:18.590> em<00:04:18.680> on<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.519> can<00:04:19.640> kind<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:19.910> see<00:04:20.120> that

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
are on HD em on you can kind of see that

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.480 
are on HD em on you can kind of see that
the<00:04:20.419> colors<00:04:20.780> are<00:04:21.020> equal<00:04:21.410> themselves<00:04:21.979> out<00:04:22.160> for

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
the colors are equal themselves out for

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.160 
the colors are equal themselves out for
the<00:04:22.580> local<00:04:22.940> devices<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.630> do

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
the local devices so I do

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.650 
the local devices so I do
I think<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.220> default<00:04:25.480> coloring<00:04:26.480> is

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
I think that the default coloring is

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.030 
I think that the default coloring is
what<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.050> difference<00:04:27.410> is<00:04:27.470> between<00:04:27.530> the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
what the difference is between the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.440 
what the difference is between the
little<00:04:28.280> puts<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.760> other<00:04:28.880> models<00:04:29.390> but

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
little puts and the other models but

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.330 
little puts and the other models but
anyways<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.530> just<00:04:30.560> want<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:30.860> put<00:04:31.010> together<00:04:31.100> a

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
anyways I just want to put together a

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.730 
anyways I just want to put together a
quick<00:04:31.670> video<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.420> show<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.660> how<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.990> surface

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
quick video and show you how the surface

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.040 
quick video and show you how the surface
acoustic<00:04:33.980> technology<00:04:34.880> deflects<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.810> white

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
acoustic technology deflects the white

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.460 
acoustic technology deflects the white
compared<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.100> Lilliput<00:04:37.570> 669<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:39.170> I'm

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
compared to the Lilliput 669 and I'm

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.860 
compared to the Lilliput 669 and I'm
going<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.650> start<00:04:39.950> off<00:04:40.100> with<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.460> 669<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.540> i'm

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
going to start off with the 669 and i'm

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.360 
going to start off with the 669 and i'm
just<00:04:41.990> going<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.230> reflect<00:04:42.500> that<00:04:42.770> off<00:04:43.010> of<00:04:43.220> a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
just going to reflect that off of a

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.680 
just going to reflect that off of a
light<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:43.610> I've<00:04:43.880> got<00:04:44.060> here<00:04:44.240> behind<00:04:44.420> the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
light that I've got here behind the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.050 
light that I've got here behind the
camera<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:45.830> can<00:04:45.860> see<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.670> lighting

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
camera you can see that the lighting

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.060 
camera you can see that the lighting
effect<00:04:47.420> is<00:04:47.540> very<00:04:47.780> very<00:04:47.930> blurry<00:04:48.440> on<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:48.920> it

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
effect is very very blurry on that it

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.120 
effect is very very blurry on that it
doesn't<00:04:49.340> do<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.430> good<00:04:49.520> job<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:50.350> isolating<00:04:51.350> that

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
better job out in daylight than the 669

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.750 
better job out in daylight than the 669
and<00:05:42.080> like<00:05:42.470> i<00:05:42.500> said<00:05:42.650> the<00:05:42.890> touch<00:05:43.070> screen<00:05:43.220> on<00:05:43.610> and

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
and like i said the touch screen on and

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.300 
and like i said the touch screen on and
it's<00:05:43.850> very<00:05:44.030> very<00:05:44.090> precise<00:05:44.830> but<00:05:45.830> that's<00:05:46.010> just<00:05:46.160> a

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
it's very very precise but that's just a

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.710 
it's very very precise but that's just a
quick<00:05:46.430> comparison<00:05:46.700> between<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.450> local

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
quick comparison between the local

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.240 
quick comparison between the local
devices<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.380> try<00:05:48.560> to<00:05:48.620> show<00:05:48.740> you<00:05:48.890> how<00:05:49.190> the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
devices to try to show you how the

devices to try to show you how the
surface<00:05:49.700> acoustic<00:05:49.970> wave<00:05:50.210> technology<00:05:50.630> works
