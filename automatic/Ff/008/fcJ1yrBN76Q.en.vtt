00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 if you fail 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 Murtazaliyev 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.019
 to what 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:21.079
 first pilot report 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.079
 as for the place 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.439
 I regret that in this weight class 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.439
 physics and chemistry 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.250
 after 2008 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.250
 now in Russia there 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.940
 fate was decided 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.680
 whose members are humanity 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.880
 later on the olympic games and 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.300
 the sergeant escaped 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 lazio on the site I go 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 but why housing conditions 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.860
 elderly woman 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.210
 residents school 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
 Olympic construction times aggressively 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.160
 the battle will take place 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 a little bit the figure husband is like his brother 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.850
 Musa Murtazaliyev 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.979
 moves are similar but probably it is 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.930
 but there is also exactly Makhach Murtazaliyev on 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.740
 left hand rose 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.970
 and a few 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.780
 dived in feet 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.020
 tsargush perfectly knows of course he 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.300
 grew up on these guys yes 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.260
 imagine 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.170
 and here is this kid who already 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.320
 100 times world champion 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.940
 Serious master ooo, but such 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.260
 athletes like sayti murtazaliyev 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.670
 tver run farniev communities but serious 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 the team therefore 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.200
 so high level appears 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 masters of nations 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.340
 grouping tigers 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 I hear a rumble 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.820
 such a fee a little bit 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.450
 our hammers were called just great cup 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.239
 1 is called 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.479
 signal mich need 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:16.679
 Head Bosc increase everything is clear 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:17.839
 can 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.839
 and adds get 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.389
 less than a minute 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.879
 Denis will say it again 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.260
 after the highest temperature the day before 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.289
 and in the evening 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.959
 at 40 degrees 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.659
 Help running 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.469
 the key episode was the key episode of this 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.469
 period 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.689
 prints today has become 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.539
 after operation 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.989
 it's also good 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.890
 need to prove what you eat 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 leader himself 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.799
 tomorrow we will try to talk alone in 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.049
 live with head coach 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.319
 national team 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.409
 td ivan 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.409
 more detail here this situation 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.949
 what then go 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.289
 that we are people with you 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.379
 what is now there is time earlier what is 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.089
 overs 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.089
 twins 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.489
 really key episode 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.489
 apparently affected here 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.989
 to continue the war such a comparison 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.029
 government 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.239
 but I want to go on, so there are many minutes 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.019
 everywhere in chicago archer such 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.729
 speeds fantastic 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:19.739
 here are hours 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.610
 Had the hint been from the third 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.499
 person 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.499
 lost the ball 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.889
 by the way his older brother 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.219
 still in the russian team 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.650
 performs trains 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.800
 the judges hope that he is in the championship 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.749
 Russia 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.749
 other ways this year being 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.610
 proon 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.430
 in this weight class or can 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.810
 be already in another heavier arabia 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.099
 Qatar on the contrary, it will appear 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.099
 I would like of course 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.699
 see the area on the carpet 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.650
 oksana 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.409
 Well, yes, of course you need to take risks 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.039
 rival 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.039
 Denis is very important ball took 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.569
 feels the edges 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.499
 he feels the time 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:39.219
 although they find opportunities 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:42.219
 look at the scoreboard 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.150
 Murtuzaliev need to risk already 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.620
 went went to attack 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.479
 sprawled good 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.339
 delayed opponent still refers extremely 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.059
 high wages base 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.059
 and there is very little 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.599
 will find a breach in the defense 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.599
 Armenian athlete 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.229
 no percent whistle 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.259
 arbitrator 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.589
 again 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.349
 broke 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.349
 well handed left catch but racing 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.279
 the hip task can also correct 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.159
 I hoped
