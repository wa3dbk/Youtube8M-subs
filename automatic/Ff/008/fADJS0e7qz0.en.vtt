cost me only free goals in seven games
but<00:03:27.160> for<00:03:27.310> some<00:03:27.489> reason<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.880> felt<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.329> a<00:03:28.359> lot

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630

one<00:04:16.840> bit<00:04:17.049> but<00:04:17.229> then<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.590> think<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.430> kind<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.760> got

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
one bit but then I think I kind of got

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.610 
one bit but then I think I kind of got
used<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.329> playing<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.930> abusing<00:04:20.590> that

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
used to playing with it abusing that

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.469 
used to playing with it abusing that
like<00:04:20.919> the<00:04:21.130> height<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.729> team<00:04:21.940> has<00:04:22.240> and

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
like the height that the team has and

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.330 
like the height that the team has and
then<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.690> pace<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.200> two<00:04:23.440> strikers<00:04:23.770> have<00:04:24.130> and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
then the pace the two strikers have and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.399 
then the pace the two strikers have and
I<00:04:25.060> really<00:04:25.360> got<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.570> hang<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:25.960> those<00:04:26.110> chip

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
I'll get it on a volley whether it's

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.270

like<00:04:31.030> they're<00:04:31.330> from<00:04:31.629> an<00:04:31.780> angle<00:04:32.169> I<00:04:32.349> scored<00:04:32.919> so

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
like they're from an angle I scored so

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.770 
like they're from an angle I scored so
so<00:04:33.639> many<00:04:33.819> of<00:04:34.000> them<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.270> was<00:04:34.360> ridiculously

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
so many of them and it was ridiculously

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.110 
so many of them and it was ridiculously
effective<00:04:35.500> which<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:36.189> always<00:04:36.520> great<00:04:36.789> to<00:04:37.000> have

you've got Fellaini in there you've got
the<00:05:19.120> free<00:05:19.330> centre<00:05:19.719> backs<00:05:19.930> in<00:05:20.110> there<00:05:20.319> you've

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
the free centre backs in there you've

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.740

got<00:05:20.500> hunt<00:05:20.919> who's<00:05:21.129> also<00:05:21.340> quite<00:05:21.699> tall<00:05:21.969> Welbeck

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
got hunt who's also quite tall Welbeck

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.089 
got hunt who's also quite tall Welbeck
can<00:05:22.960> get<00:05:23.110> on<00:05:23.199> quite<00:05:23.349> a<00:05:23.409> few<00:05:23.500> headers<00:05:23.919> so<00:05:23.949> it

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
can get on quite a few headers so it

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.909 
can get on quite a few headers so it
works<00:05:24.580> very<00:05:24.789> very<00:05:24.909> nicely<00:05:25.300> in<00:05:25.689> in<00:05:26.199> that<00:05:26.529> regard

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
works very very nicely in in that regard

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.769 
works very very nicely in in that regard
one<00:05:27.099> of<00:05:27.159> the<00:05:27.250> few<00:05:27.520> problems<00:05:27.759> i<00:05:28.029> would<00:05:28.419> say<00:05:28.659> I've

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
one of the few problems i would say I've

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:30.779 
one of the few problems i would say I've
picked<00:05:29.050> up<00:05:29.199> with<00:05:29.349> it<00:05:29.469> is<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.740> lack<00:05:29.919> of<00:05:29.949> forced

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
picked up with it is the lack of forced

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.969 
picked up with it is the lack of forced
arse<00:05:30.969> killers<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.509> think<00:05:31.990> Morales<00:05:32.469> is<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.800> only

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
arse killers I think Morales is the only

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.800 
arse killers I think Morales is the only
force<00:05:33.339> da<00:05:33.490> skillet<00:05:33.849> in<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.029> team<00:05:34.270> I'm<00:05:34.599> just

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
force da skillet in the team I'm just

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.450 
force da skillet in the team I'm just
looking<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.169> squad<00:05:35.409> now<00:05:35.589> to<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.039> side<00:05:36.250> of<00:05:36.400> me

looking to squad now to the side of me
and<00:05:36.520> I<00:05:36.580> do<00:05:36.639> think<00:05:36.940> that<00:05:37.000> it's<00:05:37.180> definitely<00:05:37.300> the

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
and I do think that it's definitely the

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.600 
and I do think that it's definitely the
case<00:05:37.750> which<00:05:38.020> for<00:05:38.589> me<00:05:38.710> is<00:05:38.740> not<00:05:39.159> something<00:05:39.370> I'm<00:05:39.550> a

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610
