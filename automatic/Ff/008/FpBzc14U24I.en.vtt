00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.840 
we got back to touch control here won't
be<00:01:05.190> use<00:01:05.339> understand<00:01:11.420> okay<00:01:13.490> I'm<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.700> really

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
be use understand okay I'm not really

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:25.279 
be use understand okay I'm not really
sure<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:19.970> it's<00:01:23.240> okay<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.300> we<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.780> use<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:24.990> L<00:01:25.140> in

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
sure so it's okay so we can use the L in

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.400 
sure so it's okay so we can use the L in
our<00:01:25.410> button<00:01:25.800> left<00:01:26.520> stick<00:01:27.080> rear<00:01:28.080> touchpad

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
our button left stick rear touchpad

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.760 
our button left stick rear touchpad
motion<00:01:29.310> sensor<00:01:29.960> being<00:01:30.960> an<00:01:31.050> L<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.289> our<00:01:31.380> button

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
motion sensor being an L in our button

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.249 
motion sensor being an L in our button
is<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:32.100> better<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.600> even<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> demo

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
is a bit better that so even on a demo

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
is a bit better that so even on a demo
they<00:01:34.500> give<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:34.740> good<00:01:34.890> good<00:01:35.310> controls<00:01:35.729> let's

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
see it's pretty good the other pod here

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.710 
see it's pretty good the other pod here
indicated<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.940> got<00:01:48.030> some<00:01:48.179> good<00:01:48.300> settings

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
indicated so you got some good settings

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.839 
indicated so you got some good settings
here<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:49.380> demo<00:01:51.890> all<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.190> we're

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
here for a demo all right so we're

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.529 
here for a demo all right so we're
tilting<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> order<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:56.390> play<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> game

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
tilting in order to play the game

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:11.350 
tilting in order to play the game
actually

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.060 

I'm<00:02:12.360> turns<00:02:12.690> into<00:02:12.840> water<00:02:13.230> or<00:02:13.650> something<00:02:19.070> okay

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
I'm turns into water or something okay

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.730 
I'm turns into water or something okay
so<00:02:20.130> liquid<00:02:20.940> water<00:02:21.420> particularly<00:02:21.990> evaporates

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
so liquid water particularly evaporates

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.160 
so liquid water particularly evaporates
on<00:02:22.980> contact<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:23.700> fire<00:02:23.910> water<00:02:24.810> does<00:02:25.020> not

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
on contact with fire water does not

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.199 
on contact with fire water does not
evaporate<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.100> move<00:02:26.310> quickly<00:02:26.610> past<00:02:27.000> heat

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
evaporate if you move quickly past heat

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:38.840 
evaporate if you move quickly past heat
sources<00:02:28.640> okay<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.410> guess<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.610> find

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
sources okay so I guess we have to find

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.880 
sources okay so I guess we have to find
a<00:02:39.030> way<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.150> press<00:02:39.510> both<00:02:39.720> both<00:02:40.080> buttons

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:55.950 

it's<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.640> big<00:02:43.880> move<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:47.840> go

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:04.260 

avoid<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:58.900> good

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:27.080 

well<00:03:04.870> specifically

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.160 

so<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.120> understand<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.660> point<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.990> game

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
so I understand the point of the game

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.690 
so I understand the point of the game
here<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:31.150> gotta<00:03:31.330> quickly<00:03:31.840> get<00:03:32.380> as<00:03:33.130> much<00:03:33.370> fluid

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
here you gotta quickly get as much fluid

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.770 
here you gotta quickly get as much fluid
as<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.150> can<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:35.440> there's<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.740> media<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:37.600> our

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
as you can and there's a media to our

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.030 
as you can and there's a media to our
destination<00:03:38.440> using<00:03:38.590> tilt<00:03:38.950> functions<00:03:39.990> and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
destination using tilt functions and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.060 
destination using tilt functions and
maybe<00:03:42.040> some<00:03:42.810> other<00:03:43.810> stuff<00:03:44.170> in<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.470> future

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:58.380 

okay<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:49.620> actually<00:03:50.620> almost<00:03:50.950> Pierce<00:03:52.680> alright<00:03:53.680> so

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.000 

in<00:03:59.390> it<00:04:02.080> should<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.110> get<00:04:03.260> out<00:04:03.319> of<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.560> water<00:04:03.739> down

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
in it should I get out of the water down

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.510 
in it should I get out of the water down
here

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
here

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.059 
here
if<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.720> goes<00:04:05.810> be<00:04:05.989> the<00:04:06.140> hole<00:04:06.290> below<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.890> red

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
if it goes be the hole below that red

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.780 
if it goes be the hole below that red
line<00:04:07.360> finished<00:04:08.360> loose<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:10.130> no<00:04:10.280> water<00:04:10.520> to<00:04:10.670> get

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
line finished loose and no water to get

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.430 
line finished loose and no water to get
the<00:04:10.970> biggest<00:04:11.510> stuffs<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.020> stories<00:04:12.410> I<00:04:14.349> focus<00:04:15.349> a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
the biggest stuffs the stories I focus a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:37.890 
the biggest stuffs the stories I focus a
little<00:04:15.560> better<00:04:17.260> all<00:04:18.260> right<00:04:18.380> so

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.809 

okay<00:04:38.900> I<00:04:38.930> see<00:04:39.229> that<00:04:39.770> press<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:40.099> button<00:04:40.400> to

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
okay I see that press that button to

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:56.810 
okay I see that press that button to
open<00:04:40.849> the<00:04:41.120> door<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.139> roller<00:04:45.379> coaster

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:04.370 

all<00:04:57.820> right<00:04:59.970> now<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:01.000> need<00:05:01.210> pressure<00:05:01.600> here<00:05:01.960> so

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.450 

I'm<00:05:05.380> guessing<00:05:05.830> if<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.040> don't<00:05:06.190> have<00:05:06.280> a<00:05:06.310> lot<00:05:06.430> of

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
I'm guessing if you don't have a lot of

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.540 
I'm guessing if you don't have a lot of
