00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.240
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.210
 Maracas today would like to show you 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.529
 fight on the test test Odessa 5 I play 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.539
 it seems together with the crane and with stanislav 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.000
 Allah is holy and head-to-head mode 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.259
 under the tap and decided to try to play 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.540
 this mode and in fact I thought 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.090
 what will be forever now 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.710
 drain these modes not fight quite 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.750
 interesting turned out 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.530
 and quite fruitful and so bases like 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.329
 you see located here in the city bye 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 that shines 1 44 enemy in the gut I decide 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.329
 drive up see closer 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.949
 many heavy tanks hulking 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.800
 the enemy is unwieldy in the gut 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.539
 it's pretty good because you can 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.470
 from here on hi for shooting him but 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.760
 Unfortunately, they have not disappeared from the light and not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.540
 can I no longer show and shoot from here 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.550
 I think where interesting can be 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.150
 in the gorge again, no paradise but maybe 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.330
 somewhere near here can go 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 highlight but dangerous because of the gut 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.680
 again to shoot can still Richard 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.490
 gaske quickly required batchatu 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.470
 I do not see, in principle, a lot of opponents here 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 now I was driving back I think that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.360
 throw but luckily no one started 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.780
 shoot me think damn how lucky 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.110
 may be from here already ponaglee 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:53.040
 act see that batchat hiding behind 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 weighing third and quite well here 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.000
 to tank because i'm leaving so 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.900
 way that armor 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.930
 at a large angle with a large slope and 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.850
 in general, no one knocks me 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.780
 you can calmly calm out 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.720
 you can damage 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.570
 it is of course very pleasant pleasant 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.230
 feeling when you do not even punch 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.709
 it happens very rarely lately 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.010
 but such moments are really happy 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.410
 and 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.510
 the game really like just disassemble pkd 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.730
 First I disassemble from 3 and then I see at15 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.390
 by ISU the seventh course did not shoot 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.900
 because its harder to pierce see what 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.590
 in the back already drives up passes us in 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.770
 general need to be distracted do not need them already 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.040
 destroy because san is finite 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.489
 From the back on the cram , the batch will not 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.060
 very well and good butt I'm leaving 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.070
 I understand that you need to push them in principle 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.739
 work me warm main forehead 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:08.200
 I can see here st-1 he stock but 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.799
 still this car is very armored 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.110
 I honestly, when I see Art-1, I 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.140
 I understand that you need to immediately gold and charge 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.860
 Of course, if he is near customs 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.640
 anal go 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.970
 but from this position I decided to shoot 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:31.049
 still cumulative about him i'm fine 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.049
 punching me already can not punch 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:41.230
 it's just a super principle, we seem to be 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:44.769
 so they played well here but for some reason the score 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.870
 equal so far that's not struck all the same 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:51.549
 st-1 on was board the turret shoot 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.090
 leave me out of 4 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:58.420
 look at what shot is just super not 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.599
 I know what it was for dudes but this 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.010
 buzz and I have not experienced for a long time from the fact that 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:08.680
 enemies act well, just super 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.670
 illiterate how anyone there 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.590
 swell and in general demand shoots 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.970
 I leave the tank and there nobody punches 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.880
 it's generally just super 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:24.270
 I see in 120 and he just stands in 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:29.460
 the gut is now counted to the same 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:32.729
 in general, you can eat because shoot 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.650
 Royal Tiger also board it sticks 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.340
 I think this is super now you can 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.410
 more damage to fill a total of 100 dozen 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.840
 she's quite nice when she gets into 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.229
 such conditions armor is really there 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.530
 drags the only thing lately 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:54.729
 I notice that the bottom of the gun for some reason was 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.530
 Does that seem to me so it seems that the earlier 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:01.539
 until stabilization was better now 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.039
 something sometimes comes down too long but 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.930
 maybe it just seems to me here I am 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:12.970
 make a big mistake fix for 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:16.490
 the dense place of the ammunition and in general 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.770
 me recharge now 16 seconds somewhere 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.740
 and so could even more on shoot at 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.500
 Basically I think okay maybe more 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.169
 Well, at least a little damage I can inflict 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:33.910
 With such a recharge do not break the call 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:37.030
 in general, it's just hard and now of course 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.940
 such a slight lull happened 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:45.400
 the enemies all hid off the crane he asks 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:50.840
 help while I can not get anyone 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:55.759
 I left the secret to me for joy I 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.759
 I get to see how many frags have already 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:03.830
 us on a platoon what damage quite good 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:07.069
 Of course it's cool when you put it on 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:11.599
 tyazh and really did not seem this 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:14.990
 fight interesting and fun left 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.870
 get one chinese but his figs still 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.349
 you pour it there behind the stone hid on 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:25.639
 stanislav is coming up right there now 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:27.650
 gotta shoot him a total of 100 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.620
 a dozen quite good tank even in 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.330
 present conditions 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.990
 Of course it is very difficult against monkeys 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:39.620
 play but generally still tank 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.349
 dynamic and interesting cool and me 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:46.669
 like it very much but still can 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:49.550
 be a little worse than before and so thanks 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:52.599
 that looked good luck to you in battles and by the way 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:58.539
 look we have as many as 13 frags per platoon 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:58.539
 in general, for now the result of the battle
