00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
introduced to a new set of weapon gear

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.740 
introduced to a new set of weapon gear
called<00:00:51.899> assassins<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.090> assassins<00:00:54.539> gear

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
called assassins now the assassins gear

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.500 
called assassins now the assassins gear
gives<00:00:55.170> 24<00:00:55.949> power<00:00:56.160> well<00:00:56.550> first<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:57.210> let's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
gives 24 power well first actually let's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.040 
gives 24 power well first actually let's
take<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> look<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.920> chest<00:00:59.460> piece<00:00:59.780> where<00:01:00.780> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
take a look at the chest piece where is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.410 
take a look at the chest piece where is
it<00:01:01.550> alright<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.260> gives<00:01:04.350> 72<00:01:04.860> power<00:01:05.420> 101

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it alright so it gives 72 power 101

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.510 
it alright so it gives 72 power 101
precision<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.020> five<00:01:07.650> percent<00:01:08.220> critical

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
precision and five percent critical

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.910 
precision and five percent critical
damage<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:09.659> we're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> compare<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
damage now we're going to compare that

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.399 
damage now we're going to compare that
to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> Berserker<00:01:11.760> piece<00:01:11.939> which<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.049> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
to the Berserker piece which is the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.890 
to the Berserker piece which is the
exact<00:01:13.830> same<00:01:14.130> three<00:01:14.490> stat<00:01:14.760> however<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> power

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
exact same three stat however the power

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.190 
exact same three stat however the power
arms<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.920> replaced<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.810> precision

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
arms that is replaced with the precision

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.859 
arms that is replaced with the precision
stat<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.159> power<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.729> 101<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> precision

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
stat so power is that 101 and precision

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
stat so power is that 101 and precision
is<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.200> 72<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.780> question<00:01:25.200> now<00:01:25.409> arises<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is at 72 so the question now arises the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
is at 72 so the question now arises the
question<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:26.970> arises<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
question that now arises is what do you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.590 
question that now arises is what do you
choose<00:01:29.090> Assassin's<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.920> Zerkers<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:33.450> all

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
choose Assassin's or Zerkers now we all

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.170 
choose Assassin's or Zerkers now we all
know<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> berserkers<00:01:34.740> gear<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> raw<00:01:35.610> damage

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
know that berserkers gear is raw damage

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.660 
know that berserkers gear is raw damage
Power<00:01:36.750> has<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.409> best<00:01:37.619> scaling<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> game

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

assassins<00:01:45.869> gear<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.590> more<00:01:46.770> precision<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
assassins gear the more precision you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
assassins gear the more precision you
have<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.820> hire<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.210> crit<00:01:48.479> chance<00:01:48.509> which

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
have to hire your crit chance which

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
have to hire your crit chance which
means<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.979> higher<00:01:50.189> chance<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
means the higher chance you have of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.730 
means the higher chance you have of
dealing<00:01:51.720> critical<00:01:52.290> damage<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.780> when<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.560> comes

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
dealing critical damage so when it comes

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.469 
dealing critical damage so when it comes
down<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> trying<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> choose<00:01:56.640> between<00:01:57.000> whether

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479

tendency<00:02:12.270> build<00:02:12.450> I'm<00:02:12.599> currently

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
tendency build I'm currently

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.540 
tendency build I'm currently
changing<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.709> up<00:02:13.800> trying<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> make<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.459> better

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
changing it up trying to make it better

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.280 
changing it up trying to make it better
but<00:02:16.370> basically<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.150> build<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.989> want

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
but basically with this build you want

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.170 
but basically with this build you want
to<00:02:19.650> crit<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.489> reason<00:02:20.730> why<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:20.849> want<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to crit and the reason why you want to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.050 
to crit and the reason why you want to
create<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.629> because<00:02:22.349> I'm<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:23.310> yourself<00:02:23.910> in

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
create is because I'm one yourself in

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.850 
create is because I'm one yourself in
health<00:02:24.209> whenever<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.629> get<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.780> foe<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
health whenever you get a foe and you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.040 
health whenever you get a foe and you
also<00:02:26.040> somehow<00:02:26.340> whenever<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.300> critically<00:02:27.629> hit

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
also somehow whenever you critically hit

now<00:02:29.690> cycling<00:02:30.690> health<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.110> going<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.410> be

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
now cycling health is going to be

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.440 
now cycling health is going to be
getting<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.920> revamped<00:02:32.310> will<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.819> revamp<00:02:33.300> but

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
getting a revamped will not a revamp but

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.690 
getting a revamped will not a revamp but
an<00:02:33.540> improvement<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.680> October<00:02:35.099> 15th<00:02:35.459> patch

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
an improvement in the October 15th patch

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.150 
an improvement in the October 15th patch
so<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.450> will<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.690> even<00:02:36.870> more<00:02:37.230> incentive<00:02:37.830> of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
so that will be even more incentive of

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.250 
so that will be even more incentive of
why<00:02:38.489> getting<00:02:38.910> more<00:02:39.150> crit<00:02:39.420> chance<00:02:39.450> would<00:02:39.930> help

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
why getting more crit chance would help

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.210 
why getting more crit chance would help
on<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.069> vampiric<00:02:41.459> builds<00:02:41.930> um<00:02:42.930> that's<00:02:43.920> why<00:02:44.069> I'm

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
on the vampiric builds um that's why I'm

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.470 
on the vampiric builds um that's why I'm
personally<00:02:44.580> switching<00:02:44.849> over<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.000> assassins

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
personally switching over to assassins

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.170 
personally switching over to assassins
oh<00:02:45.630> yeah<00:02:45.989> now<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.880> situation

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
oh yeah now that this is a situation

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180 
oh yeah now that this is a situation
where<00:02:48.569> Assassins<00:02:49.560> would<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.709> better<00:02:50.069> than

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
where Assassins would be better than

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.870 
where Assassins would be better than
berserkers<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.599> want<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.880> take
