00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.140 
animations so you can change it to Time
Machine<00:05:23.080> so<00:05:23.440> let's<00:05:23.620> try<00:05:23.800> Time<00:05:24.040> Machine<00:05:24.250> this

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
Machine so let's try Time Machine this

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.390 
Machine so let's try Time Machine this
is<00:05:25.360> another<00:05:25.870> one<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.139> my<00:05:26.350> favorite<00:05:26.860> animations

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
so as you can see you have nine

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.560 
so as you can see you have nine
animations<00:05:29.830> to<00:05:30.040> choose<00:05:30.250> from<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.760> you<00:05:30.790> can

stride<00:05:50.410> this<00:05:51.010> tweak<00:05:51.340> allows<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:51.880> to<00:05:52.090> change

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
stride this tweak allows you to change

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.140 
stride this tweak allows you to change
the<00:05:53.320> password<00:05:53.590> style<00:05:54.310> so<00:05:54.700> let's<00:05:54.910> go<00:05:55.090> to

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
the password style so let's go to

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.840 
the password style so let's go to
settings<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:55.930> I'm<00:05:56.830> just<00:05:57.130> gonna<00:05:57.220> show<00:05:57.520> you<00:05:57.580> how

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
settings and I'm just gonna show you how

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.380 
settings and I'm just gonna show you how

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
this works

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.070 
this works
so<00:05:58.600> let's<00:05:58.780> enable<00:05:59.050> stride<00:05:59.590> and<00:05:59.940> then<00:06:00.940> just<00:06:01.210> go

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
so let's enable stride and then just go

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.050 
so let's enable stride and then just go
to<00:06:02.110> my<00:06:02.620> lock<00:06:02.950> screen<00:06:02.979> I<00:06:03.430> show<00:06:03.640> you<00:06:03.700> how<00:06:03.880> this

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
to my lock screen I show you how this

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.140 
to my lock screen I show you how this
works<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.660> how<00:06:04.900> this<00:06:05.050> looks<00:06:05.350> like<00:06:05.610> so<00:06:06.610> let<00:06:07.000> me

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
works and how this looks like so let me

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.700 
works and how this looks like so let me
slide<00:06:07.570> to<00:06:07.720> unlock<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:08.610> here<00:06:09.610> comes<00:06:09.910> a

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
slide to unlock and here comes a

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.330 
slide to unlock and here comes a
password<00:06:11.710> thingy

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
password thingy

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.240 
password thingy
so<00:06:12.970> I<00:06:13.270> can<00:06:13.510> draw<00:06:13.720> my<00:06:13.750> pattern<00:06:14.380> my<00:06:14.890> current

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
so I can draw my pattern my current

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.909 
so I can draw my pattern my current
pattern<00:06:15.520> is<00:06:15.760> the<00:06:16.030> letter<00:06:16.240> K<00:06:16.570> and<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:17.650> am

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
pattern is the letter K and I am

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.820 
pattern is the letter K and I am
unlocked<00:06:18.490> so<00:06:19.240> let's<00:06:19.419> change<00:06:19.690> our<00:06:19.990> password<00:06:20.560> to
