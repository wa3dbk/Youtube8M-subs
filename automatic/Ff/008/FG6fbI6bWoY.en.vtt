00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
initial research we've gathered up

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.850 
initial research we've gathered up
several<00:02:18.860> drawings<00:02:19.370> some<00:02:20.030> three<00:02:20.390> view<00:02:20.599> things

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
several drawings some three view things

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.350 
several drawings some three view things
and<00:02:21.860> as<00:02:21.980> many<00:02:22.160> photos<00:02:22.489> were<00:02:22.849> docked<00:02:23.180> with

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
and as many photos were docked with

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.449 
and as many photos were docked with
history<00:02:23.660> historical<00:02:24.260> photos<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.800> then<00:02:25.280> we

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
history historical photos and then we

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.130 
history historical photos and then we
simply<00:02:25.849> set<00:02:26.060> out<00:02:26.180> drew<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.660> design<00:02:26.959> their<00:02:27.110> own

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
simply set out drew and design their own

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.530 
simply set out drew and design their own
plans<00:02:27.530> did<00:02:28.099> our<00:02:28.250> structural<00:02:28.880> analysis<00:02:29.360> work

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
plans did our structural analysis work

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.259 
plans did our structural analysis work
and<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:29.840> built<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.080> airplane<00:02:36.880> yeah<00:02:37.880> this

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
and then built the airplane yeah this

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.000 
and then built the airplane yeah this
airplane<00:02:38.630> was<00:02:38.810> taken<00:02:39.170> kind<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.560> another<00:02:39.800> level

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
airplane was taken kind of another level

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.430 
airplane was taken kind of another level
with<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> authenticity<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.269> just<00:02:41.930> wiring<00:02:42.349> in

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
with the authenticity so just wiring in

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.930 
with the authenticity so just wiring in
the<00:02:42.530> original<00:02:42.860> oil<00:02:43.069> pressure<00:02:43.310> gauges<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
the original oil pressure gauges and
