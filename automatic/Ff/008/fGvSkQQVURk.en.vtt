supposed to go online after that and I
didn't<00:00:48.450> really<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.350> um<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.489> didn't

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
didn't really know that so um it didn't

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
didn't really know that so um it didn't
really<00:00:50.910> work<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.469> right<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> start

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
really work out so right here I start

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850 
really work out so right here I start
the<00:00:53.219> game<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.789> switch<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> map<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the game I switch the map up and then I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
the game I switch the map up and then I
end<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.030> didn't<00:00:57.210> switch<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
end it because if I didn't switch the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
end it because if I didn't switch the
map<00:00:57.719> i<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.260> spend<00:00:58.530> black<00:00:58.829> screen<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
map i would just spend black screen and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.250 
map i would just spend black screen and
then<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.270> ended<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> game

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
then it would have just ended the game

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.709 
then it would have just ended the game
