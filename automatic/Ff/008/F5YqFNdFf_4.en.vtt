house<00:00:56.550> taking<00:00:56.820> up<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> space<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.449> two<00:00:57.600> days<00:00:57.809> I

house taking up a space for two days I

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.889 
house taking up a space for two days I
my<00:00:59.309> recommendation<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> every<00:01:00.570> time<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> get

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
my recommendation is every time you get

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
my recommendation is every time you get
a<00:01:00.960> full<00:01:01.109> inventory<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.829> sell<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
a full inventory just sell them to a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
a full inventory just sell them to a
merchant<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.879> straight<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.750> some<00:01:04.080> for

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
merchant just straight out some for

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.469 
merchant just straight out some for
whatever<00:01:04.589> 200<00:01:05.070> 500<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.729> adds<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.180> real

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
whatever 200 500 and that adds up real

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.460 
whatever 200 500 and that adds up real
fast<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.439> you're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
fast because you're not going you're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.520 
fast because you're not going you're
going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:08.159> losing<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.960> inventory<00:01:09.960> space<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
going to be losing a inventory space and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.330 
going to be losing a inventory space and
time<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:12.229> my<00:01:13.229> recommendation<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> sell

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
time so my recommendation is to sell

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
time so my recommendation is to sell
that<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> merchant<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> gold

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that to the merchant and what the gold

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950 
that to the merchant and what the gold
that<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.799> pick<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:18.420> hellish

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that you pick up you you around hellish

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.980 
that you pick up you you around hellish
you'd<00:01:19.200> probably<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.619> around<00:01:19.770> 750<00:01:20.759> k<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.180> if

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
you'd probably have around 750 k on if

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.570 
you'd probably have around 750 k on if
you<00:01:22.110> didn't<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.979> by<00:01:23.159> too<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.549> um<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> do

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
many items that are being putting the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.580 
many items that are being putting the
put<00:01:55.680> into<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> game<00:01:56.130> um<00:01:57.079> there<00:01:58.079> might<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.259> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
put into the game um there might be a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.560 
put into the game um there might be a
thousand<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.340> type<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.549> item<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.180> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
thousand of one type of item and you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
thousand of one type of item and you
think<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.079> 10k<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:01.950> someone<00:02:02.219> has

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
think you get 10k for it but someone has

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.240 
think you get 10k for it but someone has
it<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.700> 200<00:02:03.119> GP<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.229> your<00:02:04.829> item<00:02:05.070> never

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it up for 200 GP and so your item never

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.490 
it up for 200 GP and so your item never
sells<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.939> takes<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.390> space<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
sells and just takes up that space so

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
sells and just takes up that space so
that's<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:07.890> recommendation<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
that's my recommendation for that and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.809 
that's my recommendation for that and
then<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> did<00:02:10.170> personally<00:02:10.440> with<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> 750

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
i do not recommend going above perfect

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.640 
i do not recommend going above perfect
squares<00:03:17.159> right<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:17.579> because<00:03:18.030> these<00:03:18.359> also<00:03:18.650> but

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
squares right now because these also but

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.770 
squares right now because these also but
these<00:03:19.829> just<00:03:20.069> don't<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.430> mean<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:21.269> cost<00:03:21.540> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780

these just don't I mean the cost you
know<00:03:21.870> thirty<00:03:22.139> thirty<00:03:22.680> thousand<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.579> have

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
know thirty thirty thousand so you have

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.280 
know thirty thirty thousand so you have
to<00:03:23.730> make<00:03:23.819> three<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.209> those<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.389> so<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:24.900> 90

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
to make three of those and so that's 90

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.269 
to make three of those and so that's 90
k<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.769> then<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.669> need<00:03:27.239> a
