well<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:39.360> would<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.840> natural<00:01:40.590> sound

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
well one would be natural sound

acoustically<00:01:44.450> no<00:01:45.450> trigger<00:01:45.840> added<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:50.360> now

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
acoustically no trigger added and now

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.440 
acoustically no trigger added and now
with<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> sample<00:01:52.500> added<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:57.000> notice<00:01:57.299> how<00:01:57.420> it

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
with the sample added you notice how it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.530 
with the sample added you notice how it
really<00:01:57.750> beefs<00:01:58.110> up<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:59.100> acoustic<00:01:59.579> drum<00:01:59.820> makes

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
really beefs up that acoustic drum makes

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.819 
really beefs up that acoustic drum makes
it<00:02:00.659> sound<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> lot<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.020> fat<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> lot<00:02:01.649> more

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it sound a lot more fat a lot more

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.219 
it sound a lot more fat a lot more
present<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.820> same<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.210> also<00:02:03.509> happen<00:02:03.719> with

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
present the same will also happen with

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
present the same will also happen with
the<00:02:04.320> snare<00:02:04.530> drum<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.460> again

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the snare drum like this again

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.609 
the snare drum like this again
acoustically

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:17.119 

and<00:02:11.450> with<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.780> sample<00:02:13.019> added<00:02:15.829> right<00:02:16.829> so<00:02:17.040> you

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
and with the sample added right so you

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.699 
and with the sample added right so you
hear<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.459> extra<00:02:18.030> little<00:02:18.209> sizzle<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
hear that extra little sizzle in the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.830 
hear that extra little sizzle in the
sound<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.519> because<00:02:20.939> we're<00:02:21.599> blending

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
sound that's because we're blending

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.130 
sound that's because we're blending
those<00:02:22.230> two<00:02:22.560> together<00:02:23.360> now<00:02:24.360> let's<00:02:24.689> also<00:02:24.840> say
