00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.929
 good to all kids here AltaÃ¯r 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.270
 commenting on another game of playing 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.750
 like the big ones and this time it's the turn 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.009
 of richard and let's move warfare 2 the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.160
 truth is that it has been quite difficult 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.929
 the lesson because richard if you have 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.570
 seen their videos have a lot of 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.910
 videos of black ops with the ak-47 that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.730
 means in the call of duty in that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.439
 game I think more in particular but 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.449
 in the end I decided to do it for modern 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.660
 warfare2 and moore warfare2 had to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.200
 do it with the red dot m4 also 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.410
 very used the most used was this the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.720
 rpd and maybe the uba 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.430
 and I put the m4 look at the red dot 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.140
 secondary to look at the point 12 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.900
 so I think it's high school that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.490
 I was scared 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.800
 that entity non- fragmentation stunners and 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.830
 advantages that gathered vulnerable force 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.240
 and ninja and low gusts that yes that 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.060
 it was clear the written the always 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.190
 predictor harrier and pay blow it seems that 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.670
 they have a special affection for him but 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.760
 one saw him use a lot or 130,000 ago 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.040
 no air support and the truth is that the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.750
 result is good in the game was left 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.340
 well what happens that I think is not 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.540
 a very colorful part at the level of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.780
 more aim is the placement I knew 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.490
 where they were going to be we had soft and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.160
 final the basis of that and of gusts of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.310
 low end in a massacre indeed 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.510
 this one I think this is a good example 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.979
 of what it is that what they cool that 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.680
 I love them here but it 's a good example 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.630
 because I knew they had been there 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.700
 up twice this time blanket there 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.619
 I know I will be there and what I do 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.850
 is to concentrate on going up there all 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.610
 the time because I knew they were going to 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.250
 change and thus nullify what is the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.440
 champion site and in fact here I go back 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.100
 to catch them 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.140
 to one and in a few seconds I will kill the other 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.259
 and good centered is a little more in the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.920
 richard theme I met him through 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.009
 willy rex a while ago also when 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.860
 when he had he would not hold back richard 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.930
 but we 20,000 or 30,000 were that 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.660
 they are many but compared to what 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.260
 has now they are quite a few 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.280
 I met him what more because the gameplays 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.830
 of not seeing warfare2 modern warfare 3 no 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.600
 nothing went up but I think some 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.310
 plays and that went up and whites not him 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.000
 Warfare 2 and so white I think what 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.150
 better than richard 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.430
 and what I like about this youtube was what 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.120
 what I like about richard is he does what 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.610
 he wants and says it very clear indeed 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.220
 if you put yourself in his channel now that 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.400
 sure you do it has everything is 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.190
 play and is climbing silent hill 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.410
 dishonored bayern soc recently uploaded 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.840
 dead space 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.880
 he does what he wants before he wanted to go up 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.790
 gameplays up gameplay came out monkey 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.730
 warfare 3 1 liked nothing also has 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.770
 his opinion he liked nothing and has 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.800
 dedicated to the games campaigns 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.780
 which seems totally respectable 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.880
 said that I would like more 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.760
 Well, no, but maybe if it goes up 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.480
 Some campaign would be interesting because 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.849
 with a lot of campaigns 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.860
 and that's what it does not now is 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.360
 central and maximum campaign campaign 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.950
 campaign from time to time uploads a 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.299
 carlos beauty gameplay because he knows 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.510
 who has followers of kahlo beauty 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.659
 just like me for example good you start 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.330
 it is there I was watching it and I follow it 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.000
 watching for clear diet but now I see 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.459
 campaigns because more than anything else so 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.780
 games for example dishonored is a bit 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.370
 that looks great but that I do not 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.860
 I can buy with the amount of games that 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.799
 they are going to leave now it would be a disaster for 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.190
 my economy and I'm seeing it and the 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:58.390
 truth is that I like how it says 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.250
 what he thinks plays well for the truth 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.220
 is that it is one of my favorites 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.490
 and that's why I wanted to climb the second plays 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.970
 like the greats of yours 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.640
 what happens that what yes that 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.370
 it's totally respectable richard but it's 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.890
 a fault to say is not your fault but 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.780
 it is a fault is the irregularity that 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.340
 has because now when the 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.420
 campaigns and you 're very motivated but 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.450
 there was a season a few months ago between 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.150
 some problems that he had health as 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.930
 better give more time to your private life 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.620
 that I repeat that it is totally respectable 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.650
 but 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.780
 It is totally respectable but if you 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.780
 you dedicate to this, people will ask you 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.960
 you do not have now you will have to 100 thousand 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.300
 subscribers I do not know how many have 11 min 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.490
 12 thousand 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.590
 you will almost ask for more than is 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.020
 Obviously, sacrifice your life 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.159
 private because what they want to see is their 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.569
 videos but I think it's totally 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.610
 respectable I totally agree 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.370
 in spending more time the time 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.310
 want your private life 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.100
 because he is in all his rights and that 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.280
 is another of the things that I like about 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.560
 richard what he does what he wants 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.360
 says what he thinks 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.770
 totally respectable respect and I 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.949
 I totally agree on what 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.949
 make 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.850
 commenting a bit on the gameplay you have 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.850
 seen that it's running out I've already pulled out 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.240
 at this point 29-4 something like that and I 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.980
 I have already removed the three streaks 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.310
 and good if you have fixed what I have 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.290
 said the gameplay I get better better by 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.540
 placing your appetite why 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.820
 really for the aim because there 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:52.090
 back forgiven on every road that leads 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:58.610
 in the army and here it ends 7500 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:00.350
 6.232 44 to a red knit meal and 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.270
 I hope you liked it I hope that 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.780
 keep watching the episodes will change 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.780
 the quanta
