00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the plume areas as they were dormant

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.999

downstairs<00:00:31.169> so<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.619> could<00:00:31.770> have<00:00:31.919> an

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
downstairs so that you could have an

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.389 
downstairs so that you could have an
idea<00:00:32.450> what<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.480> expect<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:34.200> guess<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:35.100> still

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
idea what to expect I guess I'm still

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.120 
idea what to expect I guess I'm still
pretty<00:00:36.300> new<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.989> plumeria<00:00:37.559> world<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.100> I

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
pretty new to the plumeria world but I

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:46.220 
pretty new to the plumeria world but I
have<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:44.270> have<00:00:45.270> over<00:00:45.480> wintered<00:00:45.780> these<00:00:45.960> three

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
have I have over wintered these three

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.220 
have I have over wintered these three
years<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.620> row<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.429> feel<00:00:48.269> like<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:49.109> an

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
years in a row so I feel like I'm not an

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.970 
years in a row so I feel like I'm not an
expert<00:00:49.499> but<00:00:50.149> I'm<00:00:51.149> getting<00:00:52.079> better<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.530> knowing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
expert but I'm getting better at knowing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.000 
expert but I'm getting better at knowing
what<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> expect<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.530> first<00:00:55.769> year

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
what to expect this is my first year

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520 
what to expect this is my first year
however<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.609> an<00:00:56.760> inflow<00:00:57.170> trying<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> pull<00:00:58.409> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
however with an inflow trying to pull it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
however with an inflow trying to pull it
through<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.829> winter<00:00:59.239> don't<00:01:00.239> know<00:01:00.300> whether

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
through the winter don't know whether

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.919 
through the winter don't know whether
you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.839> see<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.019> but<00:01:01.499> that<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
you can really see that but that is the

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.140 
you can really see that but that is the
flower<00:01:03.929> spike<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.400> shriveled<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:05.880> it's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
flower spike it's not shriveled up it's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.300 
flower spike it's not shriveled up it's
still<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.810> good<00:01:07.050> shape<00:01:07.110> still<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> good

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
still in good shape still in a good

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
still in good shape still in a good
color<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.300> only<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.690> is<00:01:09.870> all<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
color the only thing is all of the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680 
color the only thing is all of the
little<00:01:11.070> buds<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.460> were<00:01:11.790> there<00:01:12.120> have<00:01:12.390> dried

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
little buds that were there have dried

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.770 
little buds that were there have dried
up<00:01:12.770> but<00:01:13.770> some<00:01:14.479> people<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:17.330> don't<00:01:18.330> cut<00:01:18.570> off<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
up but some people say don't cut off the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
up but some people say don't cut off the
inflow<00:01:19.140> let<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.469> inflow<00:01:19.890> fall<00:01:20.130> off<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.549> its

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
inflow let the inflow fall off on its

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
inflow let the inflow fall off on its
own<00:01:20.880> because<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.329> is<00:01:21.540> possible<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.829> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
own because it is possible that the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
own because it is possible that the
inflow<00:01:23.340> could<00:01:23.700> continue<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.630> produce<00:01:24.899> flowers

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
inflow could continue to produce flowers

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
inflow could continue to produce flowers
for<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.829> next<00:01:26.100> year<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.060> cover<00:01:27.299> my<00:01:27.479> face

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
for the next year as I cover my face

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.600 
for the next year as I cover my face
with<00:01:28.049> my<00:01:28.469> hand<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> yeah<00:01:31.860> things<00:01:32.219> are<00:01:32.340> looking

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
with my hand so yeah things are looking

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.719 
with my hand so yeah things are looking
decent<00:01:32.789> I<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.869> had<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.740> outbreak<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> spider

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
decent I have had a outbreak of spider

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.359 
decent I have had a outbreak of spider
mites<00:01:36.000> down<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> basement<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:38.280> be

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
mites down in the basement to be

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.889 
mites down in the basement to be
expected<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.119> drier<00:01:39.450> air<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
expected it's drier air in the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.800 
expected it's drier air in the
wintertime<00:01:40.640> spider<00:01:41.640> mites<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.210> absolutely

love dry air usually what I do when I
get<00:01:45.899> an<00:01:46.079> infestation<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.799> spider<00:01:47.039> mites

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
get an infestation of spider mites

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.459 
get an infestation of spider mites
usually<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.149> two<00:01:48.180> plants<00:01:48.539> I<00:01:48.810> will

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
usually it's on one or two plants I will

take the the plants upstairs and throw

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.209 
take the the plants upstairs and throw
them<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> shower<00:01:51.810> spray<00:01:52.799> off<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.130> the

to if it will try to zoom in there and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.949 
to if it will try to zoom in there and

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
for ready for springtime over here we've

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.810 
for ready for springtime over here we've
got<00:04:25.600> some<00:04:25.780> lovely<00:04:26.470> leaves<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.490> plant

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
got some lovely leaves on this plant

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.780 
got some lovely leaves on this plant
here<00:04:29.130> still<00:04:30.130> looking<00:04:30.400> really<00:04:30.640> good

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
here still looking really good

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.730 
here still looking really good
surprising<00:04:31.660> because<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.260> really<00:04:32.440> doesn't<00:04:32.680> get

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
surprising because it really doesn't get

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.730 
surprising because it really doesn't get
any<00:04:32.800> Lea<00:04:33.130> any<00:04:33.370> light<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.970> he<00:04:34.150> leaves<00:04:34.620> as<00:04:35.620> you

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
any Lea any light and he leaves as you

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.440 
any Lea any light and he leaves as you
can<00:04:35.950> see<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.280> leaves<00:04:36.460> have<00:04:36.669> also<00:04:36.789> gotten<00:04:37.120> a

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
can see the leaves have also gotten a

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.500 
can see the leaves have also gotten a
lot<00:04:37.599> narrower<00:04:38.760> that's<00:04:39.760> probably<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.270> do

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
lot narrower that's probably to do

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.820 
lot narrower that's probably to do
the<00:04:40.690> lack<00:04:41.200> of<00:04:41.380> light<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.800> lack<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.100> water<00:04:43.830> but

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
the lack of light and lack of water but

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.530 
the lack of light and lack of water but
everything<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.610> still<00:04:45.730> really<00:04:46.150> really<00:04:46.300> nice

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
everything is still really really nice

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.640 
everything is still really really nice
one<00:04:47.500> thing<00:04:47.740> that<00:04:47.920> is<00:04:48.040> is<00:04:48.420> noticeable<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:49.780> the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
one thing that is is noticeable is the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.580 
one thing that is is noticeable is the
new<00:04:50.830> growth<00:04:51.990> hasn't<00:04:52.990> really<00:04:53.170> started<00:04:53.380> to

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
new growth hasn't really started to

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.220 
new growth hasn't really started to
develop<00:04:53.800> yet<00:04:54.390> the<00:04:55.390> leaves<00:04:55.630> are<00:04:55.840> still<00:04:55.990> on<00:04:56.200> it

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
babies here they're doing really really

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.130 
babies here they're doing really really
well<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.730> wanted<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.450> try<00:05:55.600> to<00:05:55.660> grow<00:05:55.900> them

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
well I wanted to try to grow them

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.870 
well I wanted to try to grow them
through<00:05:56.410> winter<00:05:56.650> without<00:05:57.340> having<00:05:57.640> them<00:05:57.760> go

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
through winter without having them go

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.870 
through winter without having them go
dormant<00:05:58.350> but<00:05:59.350> as<00:05:59.800> you<00:05:59.980> can<00:06:00.100> see<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.310> number<00:06:00.670> of

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
dormant but as you can see a number of

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.960 
dormant but as you can see a number of
them<00:06:01.000> have<00:06:01.270> tried<00:06:02.140> to<00:06:02.170> go<00:06:02.320> dormant<00:06:02.560> I<00:06:04.500> think

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
them have tried to go dormant I think

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.120 
them have tried to go dormant I think
these<00:06:06.970> ones<00:06:07.210> over<00:06:07.510> on<00:06:07.630> this<00:06:07.780> side<00:06:07.950> these<00:06:08.950> ones

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
these ones over on this side these ones

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.050 
these ones over on this side these ones
have<00:06:09.280> been<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.520> ones<00:06:09.700> that<00:06:09.850> I've<00:06:09.940> been

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
have been the ones that I've been

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.540 
have been the ones that I've been
growing<00:06:10.240> under<00:06:10.690> the<00:06:10.900> lights<00:06:11.400> they're<00:06:12.400> much

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
growing under the lights they're much

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.460 
growing under the lights they're much
bigger<00:06:12.760> plants<00:06:13.270> much<00:06:13.840> but<00:06:15.300> they<00:06:16.300> do<00:06:16.600> have<00:06:16.960> I

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
bigger plants much but they do have I

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.080 
bigger plants much but they do have I
think<00:06:17.620> this<00:06:18.220> is<00:06:18.340> either<00:06:18.490> humidity<00:06:19.150> issues<00:06:20.040> or

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
think this is either humidity issues or

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.450 
think this is either humidity issues or
it's<00:06:22.090> insect<00:06:23.020> damage<00:06:23.340> might<00:06:24.340> maybe<00:06:24.610> some<00:06:26.460> some

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
it's insect damage might maybe some some

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.530 
it's insect damage might maybe some some
spider<00:06:27.760> mites<00:06:28.090> or

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.150 

white<00:06:31.540> fly<00:06:31.840> or<00:06:32.260> something<00:06:32.440> like<00:06:32.680> that<00:06:32.890> I<00:06:33.130> don't

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
white fly or something like that I don't

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.720
