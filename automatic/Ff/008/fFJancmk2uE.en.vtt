various ways other than just the design
first<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.360> all<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.990> stretch<00:01:16.229> strap

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

personally quite liked the embossing on
here<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:11.280> allowed<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.819> bend

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
here as it allowed you to bend

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.250 
here as it allowed you to bend
and<00:02:13.349> these<00:02:13.680> cuts<00:02:14.450> quite<00:02:15.450> nicely<00:02:15.659> especially

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and these cuts quite nicely especially

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.809 
and these cuts quite nicely especially
around<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.530> thumb<00:02:16.739> we<00:02:17.189> could<00:02:17.370> bend<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.640> back

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
around the thumb we could bend it back

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.720 
around the thumb we could bend it back
from<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.470> pre-made<00:02:19.470> caching<00:02:20.129> position<00:02:20.519> I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
from the pre-made caching position I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.880 
from the pre-made caching position I
found<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.420> very<00:02:21.480> good<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.290> terms<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.590> freedom

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
found that very good in terms of freedom

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.630 
found that very good in terms of freedom
of<00:02:22.980> movement<00:02:23.599> this<00:02:24.599> years<00:02:24.959> they<00:02:25.439> haven't<00:02:25.980> done

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
of movement this years they haven't done

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.080 
of movement this years they haven't done
such<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.299> cuts<00:02:28.430> hopefully<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.519> won't<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.849> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
such with cuts hopefully it won't be a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.600 
such with cuts hopefully it won't be a
drawback<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.590> already<00:02:31.739> feel<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.129> if

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
drawback as I can already feel that if

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.280 
drawback as I can already feel that if
it<00:02:32.819> was<00:02:32.909> very<00:02:33.150> tight<00:02:33.480> along<00:02:33.810> here<00:02:34.079> when<00:02:34.260> I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
it was very tight along here when I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.559 
it was very tight along here when I
tried<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.590> move<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:34.950> thumb<00:02:35.190> back<00:02:35.400> however<00:02:36.269> I

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
tried to move this thumb back however I

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.119 
tried to move this thumb back however I
think<00:02:36.629> with<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> bit<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.140> play<00:02:37.349> time<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.860> can

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
think with a bit of play time I can

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.160 
think with a bit of play time I can
loosen<00:02:38.459> up<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.819> glove<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.840> freedom

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
loosen up the glove and the freedom

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.690 
loosen up the glove and the freedom
movement<00:02:40.290> should<00:02:40.739> be<00:02:40.859> just<00:02:41.129> as<00:02:41.280> good<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.549> see

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
movement should be just as good to see

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.920 
movement should be just as good to see

much tighter fitting on long fingers but

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.229 
much tighter fitting on long fingers but
you<00:03:21.720> need<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.959> keep<00:03:22.079> in<00:03:22.290> mind<00:03:22.500> when<00:03:22.709> you're

you need to keep in mind when you're

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
year's response pros now I'm a size 8

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.569 
year's response pros now I'm a size 8
and<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:30.620> dropped<00:03:31.620> half<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:32.010> size<00:03:32.220> for<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
and I dropped half a size for the

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.140 
and I dropped half a size for the
response<00:03:32.910> pros<00:03:33.239> I've<00:03:33.900> actually<00:03:34.019> kept

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
response pros I've actually kept

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.050 
response pros I've actually kept
predator<00:03:36.150> pros<00:03:36.690> at<00:03:36.900> 8<00:03:37.109> this<00:03:37.530> year<00:03:37.590> because<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
predator pros at 8 this year because the

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.000 
predator pros at 8 this year because the
fingers<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:39.989> slightly<00:03:40.169> tighter<00:03:40.560> around<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
fingers are slightly tighter around the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.789 
fingers are slightly tighter around the
top<00:03:41.299> I<00:03:42.299> could<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:42.870> dropped<00:03:43.079> off<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> size<00:03:43.560> but

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
top I could have dropped off a size but

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.180 
top I could have dropped off a size but
I<00:03:43.859> find<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.250> 8<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.970> just<00:03:45.359> good<00:03:45.510> enough<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.190> I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
I find that 8 is just good enough and I

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.000 
I find that 8 is just good enough and I
find<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.449> didn't<00:03:49.199> actually<00:03:49.319> have<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.799> drop

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
find that I didn't actually have to drop

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.710 
find that I didn't actually have to drop
half<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.340> size<00:03:50.549> although<00:03:51.269> I<00:03:51.480> can<00:03:52.549> also<00:03:53.549> you<00:03:54.480> have

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
half a size although I can also you have

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.420 
half a size although I can also you have
same<00:03:55.079> as<00:03:55.199> last<00:03:55.349> year's<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:56.069> have<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.280> wrap

same as last year's you have the wrap

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.550 
same as last year's you have the wrap
over<00:03:56.639> thumb<00:03:57.030> which<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.540> lot<00:03:58.199> bigger<00:03:58.409> this

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560

the wrap under thumb which is wraps

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.000 
the wrap under thumb which is wraps
around<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:04.109> bit<00:04:04.260> more<00:04:04.440> compared<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.889> last

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
materials that they use now so you

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.070 
materials that they use now so you
should<00:04:48.790> get<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.030> better<00:04:49.330> grip<00:04:49.630> on<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.960> hole

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080
