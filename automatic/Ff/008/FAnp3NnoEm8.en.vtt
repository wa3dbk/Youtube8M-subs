Hey Everyone I'm Khail and
welcome to Kingston's IndieHack.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.920
On today's episode we are going to be tackling some pretty cool video hacks

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.100
that you can do with your GoPo.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.220
And because we can't seem to get him off the set

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.380
we brought back pro photographer Mark Dimalanta!

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.960
-How is it going mam?
-Good to see you. Thank you for having me back.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.380
So we're talking about the GoPro, a device I love.
Do you use all time?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.850
Well, I typically use it for stills.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.940
And the techniques I use
can easily be used to used for video.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.980
I am going to teach you techniques
on how to keep it stable

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.820
and also dealing with the elements. We use these in extreme environments.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.140
I want to teach you the small tricks to make you have the best video footage you can possibly achieve.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.140
Perfect! I need all of the help I can get.
Let's get started.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.460
Alright Mark! Let's jump right into it!
What do I need to get started?

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.600
For today's attack makes you larger GoPros up with
high-capacity very fast microSD cards.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.960
This one, by Kingston, is 128 gigabytes and class 10 which insures you have the  the speed

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.820
and the volume to record anything.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.760
Now, the GoPro was designed to do a lot of crazy stuff.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.720
So let's tackle one the biggest problems which is
stability and getting those steady shots.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.780
One thing you want to do is make sure that your camera stable because

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.380
when you're output is very shaky and jittery it can be
nauseating for the viewer.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.560
A very simple technique that we can use is
stabilizing the camera against, of all places, your chin.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.759
A technique like this is good for if you just want to
follow subject,  for example panning.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.319
The second one: something as simple as a belt and be used to stabilize your own wrist.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.800
This creates a counter tension
against your hand to keep it steady.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.640
And it works far better than just hand-holding alone.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.920
The main thing is to keep it steady so your viewer doesn't  have this jittery shaky view that is hard to watch.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.020
Cool!  That is a good DIY for on the go.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.080
Now, the GoPro is waterproof but surely
you have some hacks for that?

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.140
Yes, they're waterproof but they don't float.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.740
So just imagine you're in the water
and you drop this thing

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.420
in especially murky, dark water.
It is lost.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.820
However, you can buy this from GoPor for $20.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.440
But why not save a few dollars for extra
burritos and spent five bucks!

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.730
These are designed for key chains.
Attach some 3M VHB rated two-way tape.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.990
And it is very simple. Just cut the size that you need,
attach it to the back.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.100
Get a good, strong seal.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.140
-And there goes! 
-Beautiful! Look at that!

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.480
And you will not have to
chase after your camera if you drop it.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.520
I can get some pretty cool shots there too, right?
Hello fish!

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.800
Alright so what about those of us that
want to get different shots using a selfie stick?

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.200
Well, the selfie stick is heavy
so you need more buoyancy.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.380
What you should use is a swim noodle.
They only cost $1 from a store like Walmart.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.780
Cut it to size and just put it on.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.140
If you are at a swimming pool
which is not too turbulent that alone is good enough.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.140
But if you're river kayaking,
jet skiing, surfing in the ocean

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.120
you can use Velcro straps or even duct tape
to secure the rig.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.760
I'm not cool enough to do any of that stuff but
this is perfect for summer!

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.860
Alright, Mark, let's talk about time lapse.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.800
Sure.  One of the most dynamic things you can record with your GoPro

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.000
is a time-lapse montage of images that a shot with an intervals.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.440
Set the camera to time lapse mode set to shoot 1 frame every 5 seconds.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.580
A $5 egg timer can be purchased at any kitchen appliance store.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.340
Set it for one hour.
Set the GoPro with a mount on the timer.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.920
Place it in a field that view that gives you the composition that you want to record.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.400
The best times to shoot are the golden hours:

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.020
a half hour before and after sunrise or sunset.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.660
And let it just do its magic.
One frame every five seconds.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.540
OK Mark, so I hear you have one last crazy trick for us.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.300
Our last hack is a DIY cable slider.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.900
The nice thing about the cable slider is that it's a nice alternative from a drone.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.980
You can use it for aerial shots or if you want to follow a subject from high vantage point.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.540
OK so how would someone make a cable slider?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.520
You can go to a hardware store and get simple pulleys, carabiner fasteners,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.660
simple laundry line hooks, some scrap wood and a
quarter-inch bolt to fix to the GoPro mount.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.320
You can add a counterbalance.
Something as simple as a water bottle will work.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.060
And it makes stable throughout its
travel along the cable.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.900
Cool!  Fun stuff!  Alright Mark,
thank you for all the really cool hacks.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.970
You told us about some pretty cool stuff.
We got to try them out in the field.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.390
We even got a few comparison shots to check out.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.810
But I need know, how did I do?

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.580
The techniques for simple straightforward.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.760
You did a great job giving the viewer
that fantastic, out-of-the-box type of view...

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.400
...you could be the next Christopher Nolan!

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.920
I can only hope!

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.700
So don't just sit there. Get out and try them yourselves.
And don't forget to share them with us.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.740
And also don't forget to subscribe
to the Kingston channel

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.740
so that you can get more Indy Hack
and lots of other videos.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.720
See you guys later!
