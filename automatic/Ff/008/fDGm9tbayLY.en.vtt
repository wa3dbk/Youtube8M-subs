don't<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:54.060> myself<00:01:54.240> doing<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.140> my

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
don't see myself doing that and my

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.649 
don't see myself doing that and my
brother<00:01:55.500> build<00:01:56.340> another<00:01:56.729> building<00:01:57.060> another

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
brother build another building another

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
brother build another building another
skyscraper<00:01:57.960> or<00:01:58.409> something<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.430> before<00:01:59.969> I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
skyscraper or something but before I

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.060 
skyscraper or something but before I
tear<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> down<00:02:00.780> completely<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.860> that's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
tear it down completely because that's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
tear it down completely because that's
probably<00:02:02.369> what's<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> happen<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.060> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
probably what's going to happen here and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.590 
probably what's going to happen here and
i'll<00:02:04.020> probably<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.469> keep<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:06.000> base<00:02:06.210> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
i'll probably just keep the the base of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.630 
i'll probably just keep the the base of
it<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.590> there's<00:02:07.979> nothing<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.550> can

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it you know there's nothing really I can

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.020 
it you know there's nothing really I can
do<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.920> I'll<00:02:10.920> probably<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.760> wanted

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
do with that I'll probably I was wanted

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
do with that I'll probably I was wanted
to<00:02:12.060> show<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.270> guys

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
agree everybody said need to be longer I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.320 
agree everybody said need to be longer I
mean<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.550> going<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.940> second

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
mean if this is going to be the second

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.170 
mean if this is going to be the second
level<00:02:18.690> if<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.590> was<00:02:19.710> going<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.890> put<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:20.520> up

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
level if I was going to put like up

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.390 
level if I was going to put like up
higher<00:02:21.510> maybe<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.560> control<00:02:23.010> center

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
higher maybe the control center

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.730 
higher maybe the control center
initially<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.030> wanted<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.930> that

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
initially I wanted to do it like that

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.680 
initially I wanted to do it like that
one<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.460> was<00:02:26.700> talking<00:02:27.090> about<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.450> i'll

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
one and I was talking about that i'll

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.120 
one and I was talking about that i'll
put<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> link<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.140> where<00:02:28.440> he's<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:28.770> got

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
put a link to where he's actually got

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.680 
put a link to where he's actually got
like<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.640> driver<00:02:30.570> up<00:02:31.050> here<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.710> front<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
like the driver up here in the front and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.360 
like the driver up here in the front and
it<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.200> too<00:02:34.590> short<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:35.160> know<00:02:35.250> it's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it just is just too short you know it's

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.620 
it just is just too short you know it's
a<00:02:35.430> little<00:02:35.520> short<00:02:35.850> little<00:02:36.000> thing<00:02:36.240> ain't<00:02:36.510> going

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
kind of tore apart my the lifeguard boat

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.260 
kind of tore apart my the lifeguard boat
to<00:02:43.110> use<00:02:43.260> some<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.470> those<00:02:43.590> pieces<00:02:43.830> off<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.430> so

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
to use some of those pieces off of it so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.410 
to use some of those pieces off of it so
let<00:02:45.390> me<00:02:45.540> show<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.340> as<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.300> see

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
let me show you that so I as you can see

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.870 
let me show you that so I as you can see
here<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.350> might<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.800> able<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.040> tell<00:02:53.310> but

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
here you might not be able to tell but

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.410 
here you might not be able to tell but
this<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.540> changed<00:02:55.260> up<00:02:55.470> here<00:02:55.740> because<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.490> built

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
this is changed up here because I built

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.690 
this is changed up here because I built
all<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.260> put<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.680> other<00:02:58.800> one<00:02:58.920> so

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
all this up to put on the other one so

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.870 
all this up to put on the other one so
this<00:02:59.820> is<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.060> lot<00:03:00.330> higher<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:01.190> it's<00:03:02.190> wider<00:03:02.459> too

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
this is a lot higher and it's wider too

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.790 
this is a lot higher and it's wider too
if<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.540> kind<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.780> see<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.080> head<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.350> here

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
if you can kind of see it head on here

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.850 
if you can kind of see it head on here
that's<00:03:05.730> more<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.840> style<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.500> like<00:03:07.830> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
that's more like the style of like a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.540 
that's more like the style of like a
cruise<00:03:08.520> line<00:03:08.760> chip<00:03:09.180> with<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:09.750> wider<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.550> I

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
cruise line chip with the wider and I

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.310 
cruise line chip with the wider and I
mean<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.240> probably<00:03:12.270> can't<00:03:12.720> even<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
mean you probably can't even see the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.990 
mean you probably can't even see the
difference<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:13.980> there<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.310> quite<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.850> bit

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
difference but there is quite a bit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.580 
difference but there is quite a bit
different<00:03:15.150> Syria<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:15.930> i<00:03:15.990> gotta<00:03:16.200> say<00:03:16.380> i<00:03:16.410> do

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
different Syria and i gotta say i do

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.699 
different Syria and i gotta say i do
like<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.370> better<00:03:17.670> when<00:03:18.600> i<00:03:18.630> decided<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.530> give

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
like this better when i decided to give

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.550 
like this better when i decided to give
up<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> project<00:03:20.580> i<00:03:20.700> decided<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.239> try<00:03:21.390> to

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
up on the project i decided to try to

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.990 
up on the project i decided to try to
put<00:03:22.560> this<00:03:22.709> back<00:03:22.920> together<00:03:23.100> somewhat<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.910> i

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
put this back together somewhat and i

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.090 
put this back together somewhat and i
put<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.330> over<00:03:24.480> here<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.620> still<00:03:25.890> works

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
put this over here and this still works

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.250 
put this over here and this still works
the<00:03:26.280> same<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.790> top<00:03:27.030> everything<00:03:27.480> but<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.050> a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
the same the top everything but it is a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.850 
the same the top everything but it is a
lot<00:03:28.739> bigger<00:03:28.980> inside<00:03:29.430> there<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.560> just<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.680> lot

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
lot bigger inside there and just a lot

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.300 
lot bigger inside there and just a lot
higher<00:03:32.100> i<00:03:32.489> need<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.910> add<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.530> longer<00:03:34.530> ladder<00:03:34.769> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
higher i need to add a longer ladder to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.790 
higher i need to add a longer ladder to
get<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.730> there<00:03:36.050> but<00:03:37.050> i<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.440> wanted<00:03:37.739> to
