00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
easy base to attack and this is a 6

easy base to attack and this is a 6
important<00:00:22.140> checklist<00:00:22.589> that<00:00:22.679> you<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.009> to

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
important checklist that you have to

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.909 
important checklist that you have to
look<00:00:23.369> out<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.669> and<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:25.080> course<00:00:25.349> I'm<00:00:25.679> going<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
look out for and of course I'm going to

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.489 
look out for and of course I'm going to
go<00:00:26.519> through<00:00:26.849> one<00:00:27.179> by<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.570> using<00:00:28.140> some

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
go through one by one using some

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.249 
go through one by one using some
examples<00:00:29.189> for<00:00:30.029> example<00:00:30.089> this<00:00:30.779> particular

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
examples for example this particular

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.040 
examples for example this particular
base<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.490> motor<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> air<00:00:33.690> defense

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
base that the motor and the air defense

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.830 
base that the motor and the air defense
is<00:00:34.200> relatively<00:00:34.770> exposed<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> bottom<00:00:36.539> of<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
is relatively exposed at the bottom of a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.670 
is relatively exposed at the bottom of a
base<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:38.370> course<00:00:38.719> upgrading<00:00:39.719> powers<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
base and of course upgrading powers of

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.099 
base and of course upgrading powers of
the<00:00:40.770> same<00:00:41.010> time<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.579> usually<00:00:42.109> discouraged

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
the same time is usually discouraged

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.930 
the same time is usually discouraged
because<00:00:43.379> as<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.730> air<00:00:44.910> defense

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
because as you can see that air defense

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.709 
because as you can see that air defense
is<00:00:45.570> upgrading<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> same<00:00:46.770> time<00:00:47.010> making

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
is upgrading at the same time making

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.849 
is upgrading at the same time making
virtually<00:00:48.719> there's<00:00:48.960> no<00:00:49.079> air<00:00:49.320> defense<00:00:49.680> at<00:00:49.829> all

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
virtually there's no air defense at all

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.580 
virtually there's no air defense at all
for<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.670> particular<00:00:50.969> base<00:00:51.420> making<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.379> very

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
for this particular base making it very

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.450 
for this particular base making it very
easy<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.309> my<00:00:53.460> hero<00:00:54.420> attack<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> Hillier

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
easy for my hero attack the the Hillier

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.049 
easy for my hero attack the the Hillier
tobacker<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.500> wizards<00:00:58.949> healers<00:00:59.760> air

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
tobacker and the wizards healers air

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
tobacker and the wizards healers air
units<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.960> there's<00:01:01.199> no<00:01:01.350> air<00:01:01.379> defense<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
units and if there's no air defense is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.880 
units and if there's no air defense is
so<00:01:02.940> easy<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> go<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.230> through<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> base

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so easy to go right through the base

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.000 
so easy to go right through the base
without<00:01:05.550> even<00:01:05.940> looking<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:07.200> next<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
without even looking the next thing is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
without even looking the next thing is
this<00:01:08.550> particular<00:01:08.850> base<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this particular base you can see that

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.280 
this particular base you can see that
there's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> premature<00:01:12.090> Tahoe<00:01:12.480> now<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:13.050> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
there's a premature Tahoe now with the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.590 
there's a premature Tahoe now with the
rest<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> house<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.280> low<00:01:14.640> level<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.270> most

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
rest of the house very low level as most

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.550 
rest of the house very low level as most
air<00:01:15.810> defense<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.400> Morcar<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.670> well<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> so

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
air defense and Morcar as well it is so

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
air defense and Morcar as well it is so
easy<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.490> hero<00:01:20.760> attack<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.270> well<00:01:21.480> you<00:01:21.660> can

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
easy for the hero attack as well you can

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.890 
easy for the hero attack as well you can
use<00:01:21.990> cold<00:01:22.290> water<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.920> well<00:01:23.240> but<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
use cold water as well but because the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.220 
use cold water as well but because the
air<00:01:25.050> defense<00:01:25.410> and<00:01:25.620> Mota<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> suppose<00:01:26.760> I

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
air defense and Mota is I suppose I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.070 
air defense and Mota is I suppose I
prefer<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.470> Here<00:01:28.830> I<00:01:28.950> am<00:01:29.450> using<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.690> healers

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
prefer the Here I am using the healers

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.970 
prefer the Here I am using the healers
with<00:01:31.950> an<00:01:32.310> Pekar<00:01:33.440> obviously<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.710> choose

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
with an Pekar obviously you can choose

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.730 
with an Pekar obviously you can choose
the<00:01:35.130> dragons<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.910> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.530> because<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the dragons if you want to because the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.640 
the dragons if you want to because the
anti<00:01:38.010> fence<00:01:38.190> is<00:01:38.340> already<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:38.910> exposed<00:01:39.720> for

anti fence is already very exposed for

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.410 
anti fence is already very exposed for
this<00:01:40.800> particular<00:01:41.100> base<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
this particular base you can see that I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
this particular base you can see that I
suppose<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.020> defense<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.590> mortar<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.790> did<00:01:44.940> a
