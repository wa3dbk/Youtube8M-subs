 hello everyone with you alexey 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.650
 Tereshchenko fix com today to us on 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.750
 test hit one of the most popular cars 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.880
 delicious lenses one cant called 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.940
 A.F. Necker 51 8gb 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.890
 whose story began back in the distant 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 2002 is the secret to the success of this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.820
 old man who appeared at sunset 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.010
 the era of film photography continues 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 be made so far we will try 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.510
 sort out 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.619
 drove the delivery kit consists 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.320
 the immediate lens itself 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.210
 warranty card and documentation 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.000
 Lens made of frosted 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.340
 black plastic but despite 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 inexpensive body material assembly and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.890
 our hero's fit is on 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.200
 high level play is absent on the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 the lens you will not find anything except 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.699
 narrow focus ring access to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 which can only get 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.590
 switching 3 focus modes to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.899
 the camera in the m and plastic position 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 control ring diaphragm stick Ser 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.189
 yuschem lever of control over 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 the diaphragm has been preserved since 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.270
 film nikonov but given the fact that 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.280
 modern mirrors aperture 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.020
 set manually from the camera or 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.689
 automatically then the significance of the ring 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.850
 It goes by the wayside as the body 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.369
 applied comfortable distance scale 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.070
 focusing in meters and feet which is not 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.140
 lack of many modern decor under 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.600
 front cover is a lens with 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.640
 violet yellowish enlightenment to me 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 really liked the fact that the front lens 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.810
 deeply recessed into the body 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 it creates some sort of blend and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 protects the glass from mechanical 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.650
 damage and accidental touch with your fingers 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.899
 under the back cover we see a lens with 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.970
 pinkish purple enlightenment and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.640
 metal bayonet what is 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.829
 quite an unusual and pleasant decision 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.659
 for budget optics in addition 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.759
 feature of the lens is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.189
 possibility of installation both on apex and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.680
 on dx camera on crope his focal 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.960
 the distance will be 75 millimeters what 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.850
 somewhat reduce its versatility 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.509
 while turning the lens into a great 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 portrait painter 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.379
 dimensions of our guest are 65 on 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.500
 39 millimeters with a mass of 160 grams that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:16.260
 makes 51 its synthesis the smallest and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.750
 easy auto focus lens on nikon 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.330
 aperture lens consists of seven 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.330
 petals flour when it is closed will 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.480
 be shaped 7 dirty nuts optical 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.770
 lens design is simple and consists of 6 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.930
 lenses in 5 groups 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.540
 such simplicity avoids 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.239
 various optical distortions which 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.590
 appear when adding a few more 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.440
 optical elements 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.510
 also objectively afraid of glare and not 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.780
 especially inclined to lose the contest 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.700
 backlight on the open aperture 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.040
 there is a noticeable soft effect which 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.160
 very handy when shooting a portrait so 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.290
 how softens the skin tone of a spherical model 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.659
 aberrations on the open will not by the way 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.030
 when shooting architecture and scenery but 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.280
 pleasant moment is the minimum 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.860
 amount of chromatic aberration and 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.440
 almost complete lack of purple 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.290
 halos on the edges of contrasting elements in 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.269
 frame if on open sharpness optics 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.390
 weakly then covering the diaphragm to 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.239
 values ​​2 and 8 4 we get good 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.640
 lens resolving power won me over 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.310
 the contrast of the clouds in the images at 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.709
 aperture value at 18 sky has 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.590
 natural blue but worth 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.659
 cover the hole to 5 6 and our lungs 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.480
 grayish clouds getting much 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.040
 more voluminous and as if filled with lead 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.739
 shallow depth 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.319
 open space minimal 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.480
 focus distance of 45 centimeters and 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.060
 pretty package let you get 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.760
 beautiful pictures of different flowers Nokama 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.920
 tap relationship is not 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.110
 and summing up I can say that some 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.629
 51 his family is the best solution 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.879
 for nikon cameras for your money when 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.470
 appreciate at 100 dollars a lens combined 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.390
 in itself small dimensions and weight 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.909
 relatively high luminosity 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.500
 and excellent optical properties mainly 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.760
 lens flaw is 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.319
 lack of built-in motor 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.629
 focus because of what it can 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.459
 Use only on cameras with a screwdriver 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.409
 what will be an unpleasant moment for 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.659
 owners of cameras nikon 3 and 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.970
 five thousandth series of links to examples 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.130
 high resolution photos taken with 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.500
 using this lens is also detailed 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.419
