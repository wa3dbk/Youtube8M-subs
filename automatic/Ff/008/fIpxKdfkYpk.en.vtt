00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.389
 do not 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.490
 more pointing 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 hello how about very good no portal 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.840
 coches.net we are going to give us a return in 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 this seat ibiza fr accompanies our 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.800
 favor 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.800
 yes 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.540
 ah 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.870
 we started 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.430
 Well, the engine was ripped 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.960
 I guess it has not been anything because the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.970
 truth is that lately the truth is 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.310
 all federal brands make 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.660
 Absolutely silent cars for 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.620
 some idling engines are not heard 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.540
 nothing and the truth is that neither 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.120
 transmits vibrations that is for now 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.100
 a first point a point for this 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.530
 seat ibiza cold spare on the outside 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.170
 four meters and eight centimeters then of 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.280
 seat ibiza of all life that good in 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.960
 the last touches have barely 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.060
 modified what we already knew in this 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.830
 version of five doors is the version 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.270
 fr that delivers 150 horses gasoline and 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.550
 in this case well then it is 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.710
 associated with this dsg change of seven 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.780
 speeds that I will not tell you anything 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.700
 again or just going wonderfully 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.430
 It is not what there is 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.930
 the group go down in all brands mind 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.340
 this change the truth is that it goes from 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.009
 death where to discover nothing new 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.960
 because it's a car that with this change and 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.130
 this engine does not go phenomenal what seven 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.340
 types that for example when booting from 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.180
 stopped is quite abrupt I mean 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.760
 among that if you step thoroughly 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.290
 traction to mali is not a matter of 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.970
 tires let's just say that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.950
 lose mass traction 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.570
 and then to talk so much backwards 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.610
 as well 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.430
 to go slowly at first to 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.720
 try to touch the one in front cetera is 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.140
 quite rough, you have to walk a lot 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.050
 Be careful if you do not want to park at the touch 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.250
 nothing desirable by the way otherwise 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.660
 What can I tell you? 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.080
 consumptions is around 8 liters 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.240
 every 100 kilometers good 150 horses 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.470
 low front-wheel drive goods 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.330
 I can count that good 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.210
 obviously by asking for some cams here 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.400
 it would be great but the change 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.930
 dsg supports changes in sequences can 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.360
 be change then like the world cup 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.209
 tourism is going backwards and the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.550
 and equipment as you see it and mista 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.930
 has already this aspect of saying travel 1 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.400
 because we've already seen this 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.950
 enough years is fine is very 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.840
 Minimalist few buttons very well 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.480
 good materials 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.400
 the tomtom for 490 for all all 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.690
 great but you have to give it a 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.970
 tap the next one and say 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 we expect more problems 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.520
 we are talking about 20 thousand 500 euros that 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.560
 the good truth as base price 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.840
 well it's there it's there because 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.920
 let's say that the 180 versions 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.750
 horses when they arrive comply 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.430
 example of skoda fabia and so on 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.340
 are a little bit more then well if 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.620
 you want more sporting feeling as there 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.380
 a step on the pole in the fabia arrives 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.850
 to the delimit without a doubt problems the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.700
 sports stations anna and the chassis 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.620
 the suspensions are very well worked 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.970
 they are firm what happens is that if you want 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.140
 go see if you want to upload a port of 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.510
 mountain doing 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.130
 pretty sporty driving you're not going to 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.370
 notice that they are a tad softer than 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.100
 normal but it is obvious there is still a 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.500
 model above and behind I'm going to have it 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.900
 seen the space just is , I 'm not going to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.970
 say that each time three people from 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.000
 fantastic way because it is not 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.670
 well it fits three people but they fit 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.050
 because that way adults 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.880
 can travel comfortably from 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.239
 third day well then it is what 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.270
 there is 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.790
 boot of 260 liters and if you want to know 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.620
 something else I'm not going to tell you a new one 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.299
 meat one more word 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.640
 and you know that this is a small video that 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.769
 accompanies the excess analysis and we do 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.060
 as always portal coches.net the page 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.159
 reference web of the world the engine does not 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.739
 I tell him what and everyone and nothing 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.729
 Well, we are waiting for you in this web video or in 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.900
 the next ones I hope you liked it 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.900
 until next time
