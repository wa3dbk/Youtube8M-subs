00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.370
 easily on the site where I would put it 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.309
 in the description so to start 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.950
 you must have your ipod touch 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.340
 iphone or ipad is plugged in the cord 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.040
 on top like this now you go 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.680
 open redsnow and this will appear 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.320
 so redsnow you open it like these 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 and makes you run as 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.290
 that administrator now that you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.490
 have run redsnow as 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.509
 that administrator you will open it and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.680
 click extra now on select 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.630
 ip sw then you will choose the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.150
 file so you downloaded 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.030
 for your ipod iphone or ipad in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.869
 version 6.0 you open it and you see 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.399

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.119
 you click on jailbreak and now 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.119
 you wait 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.430
 now you appear it's here and 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.060
 you will click on install cydia 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.770
 do next then you will put 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.010

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.820
 so in offline mode 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:35.920
 so that means you turn it off as 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.900
 these were only they were you 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.970
 go past in dfu mode 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.340
 so for those following and my 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.620
 instructions you go first 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.830
 place your finger on the power button 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.780
 place your your other finger on the 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.810
 home button and aprons 10 seconds 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.410
 on both once you have 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.209
 finished you let go the power button is 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.420

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.760

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.830
 I'm waiting for this more than 5 seconds and 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.250

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.800
 jailbreak will launch now you 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.810
