00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.759 
kind of like you know something that you
would<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.489> throw<00:03:10.610> on<00:03:10.970> like<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.560> hook

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
would just throw on like so and you hook

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.860 
would just throw on like so and you hook
it<00:03:12.890> around<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.820> as<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.150> guys<00:03:14.299> can<00:03:14.570> see<00:03:14.630> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
it around you and as you guys can see it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.020 
it around you and as you guys can see it
does<00:03:15.049> have<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:16.070> little<00:03:16.370> frillies<00:03:16.700> at<00:03:16.880> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
does have the little frillies at the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.850 
does have the little frillies at the
bottom<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.840> thought<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.140> was<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:18.380> really

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860

bottom so I thought this was just really
really<00:03:19.100> cute<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:19.640> guess<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:20.030> maybe<00:03:20.570> if

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989
