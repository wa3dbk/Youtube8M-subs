00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
you're the sign and obviously up here

for<00:01:22.330> all<00:01:22.390> this<00:01:22.570> stuff<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.899> washed<00:01:23.080> in

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.700 

thank<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.380> slow

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.149 

here's<00:01:37.280> what<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.760> was<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.210> come

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.459 

kind<00:01:43.729> of<00:01:43.759> hard<00:01:43.939> to<00:01:44.030> imagine<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:44.659> this<00:01:45.049> here

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
kind of hard to imagine that this here

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.469 
kind of hard to imagine that this here
was<00:01:45.740> actually<00:01:45.950> up<00:01:46.399> where<00:01:46.640> I'm<00:01:46.729> standing<00:01:47.060> and

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
was actually up where I'm standing and

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.719 
was actually up where I'm standing and
all<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.719> way<00:01:47.810> down<00:01:48.020> through<00:01:48.259> there<00:01:48.579> and<00:01:49.579> all

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
all the way down through there and all

00:01:49.729 --> 00:02:23.760 
all the way down through there and all
the<00:01:49.759> way<00:01:49.880> through<00:01:50.179> that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.540 

alright<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.940> got

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
alright then you got

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.090 
alright then you got
get<00:02:25.790> out

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.190 

it<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:30.820> ever<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.090> great<00:02:31.300> condition<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:31.810> it's

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
it was ever in great condition but it's

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.180 
it was ever in great condition but it's
all

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
all

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.289 
all
I'm<00:02:33.640> surprised<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.180> bridge<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.660> still<00:02:34.840> there

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.369 

basically<00:02:38.299> from<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.629> point<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.930> these<00:02:39.110> combs

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
basically from the point of these combs

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.430 
basically from the point of these combs
down<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:41.000> whole<00:02:41.239> Road<00:02:41.510> has<00:02:41.719> been

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
down this whole Road has been

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
down this whole Road has been
pretty<00:02:43.860> badly<00:02:44.160> locked<00:02:44.550> down

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.850 

looks<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.570> there's<00:02:48.750> more<00:02:48.930> coming<00:02:49.230> our<00:02:49.380> way<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
looks like there's more coming our way I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.500 
looks like there's more coming our way I
don't<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:50.520> if<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.640> can<00:02:50.730> see<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:50.970> behind<00:02:51.180> me

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
don't know if you can see it behind me

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.890 
don't know if you can see it behind me
or<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:53.210> right<00:02:54.210> now<00:02:54.450> above<00:02:54.900> me

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.690 

was<00:02:58.900> kind<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.290> blue<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.769> over<00:03:00.099> there<00:03:00.280> was<00:03:00.430> blue

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
was kind of blue and over there was blue

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.180 
was kind of blue and over there was blue
a<00:03:00.940> few<00:03:01.690> minutes<00:03:01.840> ago<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.290> was<00:03:02.379> really<00:03:02.739> nice<00:03:02.860> and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
a few minutes ago it was really nice and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.270 
a few minutes ago it was really nice and
bright<00:03:03.489> Sun<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:05.470> now<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.010> looks<00:03:06.129> like

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
bright Sun out but now it looks like

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.979 
bright Sun out but now it looks like
something<00:03:06.549> else<00:03:06.790> is<00:03:06.909> coming<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.480> i<00:03:07.510> guess<00:03:07.659> this

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
something else is coming so i guess this

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.250 
something else is coming so i guess this
was<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.440> eye<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.709> storm

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.730 

that<00:03:11.830> was<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> weird<00:03:12.129> sounding<00:03:12.519> cow
