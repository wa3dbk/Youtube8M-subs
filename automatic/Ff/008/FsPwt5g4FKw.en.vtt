and<00:02:06.689> dynamic<00:02:07.170> punch<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.439> course<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.890> confuse<00:02:08.250> I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
and dynamic punch a course can confuse I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.540 
and dynamic punch a course can confuse I
did<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.209> expect<00:02:09.450> sleep<00:02:10.020> talk<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:11.009> he

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
did not expect sleep talk because he

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.250 
did not expect sleep talk because he
does<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.760> an<00:02:11.970> aroma<00:02:12.239> teeth<00:02:12.510> which<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.959> a

so<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.050> does<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.290> access<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.800> aromatherapy

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
so it does have access to aromatherapy

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.320 
so it does have access to aromatherapy
and<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.090> thought<00:02:16.330> maybe<00:02:16.750> he'd<00:02:17.020> be<00:02:17.050> rest<00:02:18.330> roar

sweep so my opinion on son I think while

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.750 
sweep so my opinion on son I think while
you<00:05:12.930> does<00:05:13.290> have<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.500> lot<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.830> Trek<00:05:14.100> a<00:05:14.310> lot<00:05:14.670> of

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
you does have a lot of Trek a lot of

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.430 
you does have a lot of Trek a lot of
checks<00:05:14.970> for<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.300> like<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:15.780> know<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:15.990> Dragons

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
checks for it like you know the Dragons

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.160 
checks for it like you know the Dragons
channel<00:05:16.980> or<00:05:17.130> mega<00:05:17.460> Alakazam<00:05:17.970> etc<00:05:18.480> it's<00:05:18.690> still

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
channel or mega Alakazam etc it's still

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.490 
channel or mega Alakazam etc it's still
a<00:05:19.500> pretty<00:05:20.010> big<00:05:20.310> threat<00:05:20.670> in<00:05:20.910> um<00:05:21.510> in<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:22.290> you<00:05:22.470> I

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
a pretty big threat in um in you you I

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.780 
a pretty big threat in um in you you I
think<00:05:22.650> if<00:05:22.890> his<00:05:23.010> build<00:05:23.280> had<00:05:23.490> been<00:05:23.640> more

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
think if his build had been more

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.100 
think if his build had been more
offensive<00:05:24.300> he<00:05:24.390> definitely<00:05:24.690> could<00:05:24.840> have<00:05:24.900> just

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
offensive he definitely could have just

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.070 
offensive he definitely could have just
over<00:05:25.320> power<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.650> me<00:05:25.830> with<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.460> shear<00:05:26.670> force<00:05:27.080> no

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
over power to me with the shear force no
