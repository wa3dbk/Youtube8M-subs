simply fall off the seeds will come

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.780 
simply fall off the seeds will come
right<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.290> like<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:43.520> know<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
right out just like that I know that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.389 
right out just like that I know that
some<00:01:45.030> people<00:01:45.229> cut<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> pumpkin<00:01:46.560> first<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
some people cut the pumpkin first and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
some people cut the pumpkin first and
pull<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> seeds<00:01:48.869> first<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> bake<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
pull out the seeds first and bake it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.069 
pull out the seeds first and bake it
that<00:01:50.070> way<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.240> find<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that way but I just find that this is

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.980 
that way but I just find that this is
just<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.649> easy<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> seeds<00:01:53.850> pull<00:01:54.840> out

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
just as easy because the seeds pull out

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319 
just as easy because the seeds pull out
really<00:01:55.350> nicely<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.700> don't<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> add

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
really nicely and I don't have to add

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.410 
really nicely and I don't have to add
any<00:01:57.360> olive<00:01:57.990> oil<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.590> anything<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.850> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
any olive oil or anything like that to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.570 
any olive oil or anything like that to
the<00:02:01.380> pumpkin

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:23.250 

oh<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:20.260> drop<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.680> my<00:02:20.800> lack<00:02:21.040> mm-hmm<00:02:21.930> I'm<00:02:22.930> not
