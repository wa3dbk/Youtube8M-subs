00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello, this is Miguel Noguera and this 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.540
 summer I was in formentera we were all 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.400
 the brothers to the boat of my brother-in-law 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.320
 tomeu and the issue is that the boat gives 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 incredible jumps I propose the figure of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.679
 this guy who writes below his 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.120
 ass has a little notebook and goes 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.190
 writing about the experience itself 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.199
 of the jump I also have this other boat 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.939
 it's like like the boat to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.680
 herself filled with water and we have to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.900
 the water and is calm chicha and goes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.880
 pretty fast this did not occur to me and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 formentera but this comes from a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 advertisement that is a garden pool 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.579
 but nothing or is like with a very 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.079
 big not what did happen in 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.969
 formentera was that at the time of vermouth 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.500
 of Maria Antonia with fear that she 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.480
 will fly the potatoes by the wind said 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.879
 bring some clothespins that we're going to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.890
 paint each potato on the plate and I thought 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.050
 it's totally unviable otherwise 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.879
 bilbao years ago in an ultra show I said 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 that christ could not use the word 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.350
 look rhetorically in the gospels 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.350
 can you say I could not say Christ in the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.379
 Bible looks I tell you one thing for me 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.050
 I messed up the uncle used look at the point 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.000
 This is the chronic prescription that I have 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.369
 so many months hitting the evil that is already 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.820
 well that is already good 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.770
 institutionalize a fold 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 6 mateo 8 4 jesus said he looks at him I do not know 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.479
 tell anyone uses the word look 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.490
 rhetorically if I have the pictures of the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 little mobile the paradox here not the old 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.330
 and the new thing who does not illuminate who this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.070
 uncle who is me 5 who is a politician 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.050
 Ukrainian where he was poisoned with 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.700
 dioxin is the face creed as well as very 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.979
 little is not all the face that looks 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 a little to the ugly king of the Lord the rings 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.820
 it is possible once out of this state 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.920
 from lethargy a detoxed feeling 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.479
 nostalgia possible that there was something good 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.340
 that is lost to heal you say pussy 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.619
 when that element is very toxic 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.170
 I would recover it I think it's not all 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.789
 bad all bad all negative that more 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.320
 put a google search that came out 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.910
 bob dylan as if he had noticed 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.229
 that I was looking for him in google and 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.630
 there is like a zoom and you what are you doing 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.940
 looking at me when a program fails and that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.770
 they inform you the same computer 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.050
 informs in third person that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.030
 program does not respond open office is not 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.800
 Answer is like me I have a computer 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.869
 done the work that but this heat does not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.550
 answer no I do not know that you spend little 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.920
 companionship we go to the images and 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.720
 on paper can this man who has 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.489
 fell asleep before checking the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.090
 reflexes of the kid with the hammer and 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.340
 this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.720
 is dead on the bike gives you a 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.700
 heart attack on the bike and there goes to the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.099
 Uncle the medium magazine seem the same 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.900
 means teaching there is here the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.360
 naked boy also the cover a little 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.519
 eroticism esotericism shaking hands in the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 hug will not give up the formal greeting in 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.910
 medium of affection shaking hands and then 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.459
 fuck and this one has to be in a chorus 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.230
 and only smiles does not sing to the uncle left over 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.540
 just laugh they accept they do not accept equal no 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.340
 not a single note and in this fight careful 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.200
 that is with bronco gel badly tilted 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.540
 all the weight in the end and this to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.760
 open open the flower bud with 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.250
 knife accelerates the process and this old 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.110
 that the cakes illegally in the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.569
 highway on the highway what madness of 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.610
 woman also and the latter will return like this 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.920
 of the holiday will return and without a wedge 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.959
 without a face wedge returns Jorge returns 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.049
 javier tie the 5 without a wedge and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.910
 suddenly as you present as I eat you 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.099
 samples to the world not like how to start 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.060
 there is a new reaction seen a bit already 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:11.879
 to fill the black does not smoke black the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.990
 final that I say it because it is already understood 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.370
 the idea does not return like that if a wedge 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.370
 with something you have to fill it
