hat<00:03:54.799> on<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.160> there's<00:03:55.910> some<00:03:56.180> small<00:03:56.540> chance

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
hat on and there's some small chance

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.629 
hat on and there's some small chance
that<00:03:56.959> it'll<00:03:57.199> actually<00:03:57.379> work<00:03:57.709> because<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.489> did

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
that it'll actually work because it did

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.670 
that it'll actually work because it did
work<00:03:58.790> for<00:03:59.090> them<00:03:59.239> in<00:03:59.299> 2004<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.230> mean<00:04:00.530> they<00:04:00.650> they
