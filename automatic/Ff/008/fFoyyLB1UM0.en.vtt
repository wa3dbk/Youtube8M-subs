00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.870
 only history is the builder also a bit boring thought 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.469
 at least the designers are out of otherwise news and that is after all the 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.730
 Makers of the vaccine Kampala series 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.900
 In the next strategy game Age of Mythology brings a lot of fresh 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.609
 Wind in with the divine powers and the fabulous super 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.939
 especially the Greeks are reminiscent of the game on the high seas on the Edge of the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.550
 employees series we send our workers had to build buildings 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.890
 and are always looking for raw materials 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.680
 for example, there is a deterioration in the left rear 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.950
 in wood production, the eye is covered with Wonderful Schrum falling trees 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.790
 But spoils us more for the new resource private 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.859
 these gods art currency is with every nation 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.139
 In a different way the Greeks generated here, for example 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.690
 Make people stand firm at the temple 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.920
 Under is worth it because mistakes usually need them 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.530
 to spare the coal 0 2 spared special forces 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.350
 the opponent attacking our settlement here, for example, does not have 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.260
 slept 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.000
 The saying beings are not only big and strong, they are also masters 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.060
 individual special attacks the friendly Zyklop demonstrated and 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.060
 Going straight Schieder with Prof 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.590
 In this bird meadows, there is a lot of trouble with the and rubbish hackers 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.410
 jaw 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.600
 who annoy a Frost Giant with arrows and the girls clique 7 inches 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.940
 wants to be warned of the risks and side effects of 1 breath 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 The Egyptians at now cheaper make it big jumps 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.620
 and thus also a Steinbauer unreachable act of terrorism come 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.340
 so that's not enough of the local superpowers 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.539
 for example, when their city walls suddenly together BrÃ¼hl we are in 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.649
 Old weak gingerbread cottage then the opponent has one of his divine ones 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.549
 Superfly Crichton used every time you reach a new era 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.889
 you get such a visitor extra gift that you then become one 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.220
 can use any time 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.690
 depending on which God so Lord let them offer you access 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.410
 others of these very varied superviel crichton 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.590
 for example, if you paralyze your opponent's food production 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.300
 wants then a grasshopper Swabians is still recommended 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.199
 more voracious than a pack of gangster editors 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.789
 A little polar cold air serves enemy armies without further ado 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:27.939
 freeze 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.099
 The Tornado teacher's enemy camp is always gladly taken 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.540
 jumbled and destroyed what is not nailed down and the nail is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.839
 Insatiable breezes are particularly effective near forests 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.289
 no enemy wood production sensitive weaknesses 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:48.849
 something more subtle is the effect of this SP will force after Gotha 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.700
 They make it dark for a minute in the whole game world 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.560
 and that hits more buildings is degraded very handy if they are 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.109
 just a treacherous little one 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.780
 the graphics are very clear and detailed but still one is 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:07.319
 3d engine at work quite zoom in on the Rhine during this procedure 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.659
 Scene and again that comes we ever wanted to practice this out of ours 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.029
 Cut out vegetable beds 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:18.299
 that looks like pretty much bombs from what else - at Christoph Marthaler 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.649
 the interesting mix of proven ones is brewing together 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.460
 real-time strategy standard 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.390
 and dozens of Gotthelf's abilities and mythological say meadows 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.040
 be three for their hard drive next fall
