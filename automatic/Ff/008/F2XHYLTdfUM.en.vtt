the<00:02:13.470> lamp<00:02:13.710> when<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.040> bought<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:15.110> couple<00:02:16.110> of

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
the lamp when I bought it a couple of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.040 
the lamp when I bought it a couple of
relatives<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.390> same<00:02:18.720> lamp

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
relatives I have have this same lamp

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.020 
relatives I have have this same lamp
will<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:19.980> one<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.250> these<00:02:20.370> ones<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
will have one of these ones it's the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
will have one of these ones it's the
same<00:02:21.240> model<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.690> think<00:02:22.170> they<00:02:22.260> got<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.560> when<00:02:22.710> they

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
same model I think they got it when they

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.270 
same model I think they got it when they
had<00:02:23.160> their<00:02:23.370> first<00:02:23.640> baby<00:02:24.740> so<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.190> know

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
had their first baby so that you know

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.830 
had their first baby so that you know
the<00:02:26.460> baby<00:02:26.640> woke<00:02:26.910> up<00:02:27.030> doing<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.630> could

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the baby woke up doing that they could

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960 
the baby woke up doing that they could
put<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.800> bigger<00:02:29.040> blind<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:29.730> what<00:02:29.850> was

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
put a bigger blind and just see what was

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.220 
put a bigger blind and just see what was
happening<00:02:30.000> without<00:02:30.390> turning<00:02:30.660> overhead

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
happening without turning overhead

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.950 
happening without turning overhead
lights<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.650> things<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:33.660> set

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
lights and things like that this set

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.320 
lights and things like that this set
uses<00:02:34.350> 4d<00:02:34.950> size<00:02:35.220> batteries<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.940> did<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.210> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
uses 4d size batteries and did it the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.950 
uses 4d size batteries and did it the
battery<00:02:36.720> down<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.230> lift<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:41.540> light<00:02:42.540> looking

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
battery down you lift the light looking

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.780 
battery down you lift the light looking
for<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.230> fluorescent<00:02:43.710> tubes<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:44.520> under

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
for the fluorescent tubes and then under

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:57.890 
for the fluorescent tubes and then under
the<00:02:44.910> reflective<00:02:46.190> plate<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.270> reflective

the reflective plate and the reflective
cake<00:02:58.260> here<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.640> where<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.030> batteries<00:03:00.360> go<00:03:00.800> 4d

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
cake here is where the batteries go 4d

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.750 
cake here is where the batteries go 4d
cells<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.570> then<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.800> tubes<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.520> take

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
cells and then to get the tubes you take

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.200 
cells and then to get the tubes you take
this<00:03:05.970> cap<00:03:06.330> off<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.050> would<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.290> use<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.710> a

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
this cap off and you would just use a a

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.210 
this cap off and you would just use a a
coin<00:03:09.210> or<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.780> knife<00:03:10.200> or<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.620> key<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.730> get<00:03:11.880> those

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
coin or a knife or a key to get those

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.600 
coin or a knife or a key to get those
those<00:03:14.220> screws<00:03:14.640> open<00:03:15.770> as<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.980> say<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.160> think<00:03:17.520> this

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
those screws open as I say I think this

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.680 
those screws open as I say I think this
is<00:03:17.820> for<00:03:18.120> what<00:03:18.450> tubes<00:03:18.840> in<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:20.420> as<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.570> can

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
is for what tubes in it and as you can

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.160 
is for what tubes in it and as you can
see<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.960> can<00:03:22.110> just<00:03:22.290> have<00:03:22.410> one<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.920> bond<00:03:27.080> or<00:03:28.080> you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
see you can just have one to bond or you

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:37.190 
see you can just have one to bond or you
can<00:03:28.320> put<00:03:28.470> both<00:03:28.710> tubes<00:03:29.040> on<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:36.200> mainly

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
can put both tubes on and I mainly

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.050 
can put both tubes on and I mainly
bought<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.710> just<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.190> house<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.880> case

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
bought this just to have a house in case

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.720 
bought this just to have a house in case
there<00:03:39.300> are<00:03:39.330> any<00:03:40.010> power<00:03:41.010> families<00:03:41.490> when<00:03:41.640> I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
there are any power families when I

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.100 
there are any power families when I
don't<00:03:41.970> think<00:03:42.180> I've<00:03:42.420> used<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.900> few<00:03:42.930> times

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
don't think I've used it a few times

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.560 
don't think I've used it a few times
showing<00:03:43.590> earth<00:03:43.890> hour<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:44.910> taken<00:03:45.120> parking

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
showing earth hour I have taken parking

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.910 
showing earth hour I have taken parking
is<00:03:45.720> there<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> couple<00:03:46.170> of<00:03:46.290> times<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:46.800> has

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
is there a couple of times and this has

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.440 
is there a couple of times and this has
been<00:03:47.100> great<00:03:47.340> for<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.670> because<00:03:47.820> it's<00:03:48.270> nice

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
been great for that because it's nice

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.470 
been great for that because it's nice
and<00:03:48.690> bright<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:50.610> can<00:03:50.820> carry<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.270> with<00:03:51.420> me

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
and bright and I can carry it with me

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.449 
and bright and I can carry it with me
around<00:03:51.750> house<00:03:52.080> when<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.380> need<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.100> is<00:03:53.250> just

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
around house when I need to this is just

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.900 
around house when I need to this is just
fantastic

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.090 

and<00:03:59.390> having<00:03:59.930> a<00:04:00.080> having<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.650> twin<00:04:02.830> tubes<00:04:03.830> is

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
and having a having the twin tubes is

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.550 
and having a having the twin tubes is
certainly<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:06.250> nice<00:04:07.250> feature<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:09.290> can't

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
certainly a nice feature you can't

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.650 
certainly a nice feature you can't
really<00:04:09.740> see<00:04:09.890> how<00:04:10.190> quickly<00:04:10.460> the<00:04:11.210> tubes<00:04:11.510> are

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
really see how quickly the tubes are

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.600 
really see how quickly the tubes are
starting<00:04:12.020> up<00:04:12.080> because<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.590> cameras<00:04:13.280> although

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
starting up because the cameras although

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.940 
starting up because the cameras although
auto<00:04:14.060> exposure<00:04:14.870> is<00:04:15.230> trying<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.620> compensate

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
auto exposure is trying to compensate

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.160 
auto exposure is trying to compensate
for<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:17.470> amount<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.680> light<00:04:19.780> but<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.900> cheap

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
for the amount of light but the cheap

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.680 
for the amount of light but the cheap
stack<00:04:21.560> up<00:04:21.709> every<00:04:22.040> time<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:23.180> course<00:04:23.480> when<00:04:23.660> the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
stack up every time of course when the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.630 
stack up every time of course when the
batteries<00:04:24.140> go<00:04:24.320> flat<00:04:24.350> they<00:04:24.920> take<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> bit<00:04:25.610> longer

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
batteries go flat they take a bit longer

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.520 
batteries go flat they take a bit longer
to<00:04:26.060> start<00:04:26.330> up<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:26.600> they<00:04:26.750> don't<00:04:26.930> glow<00:04:27.200> very

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
to start up and they don't glow very

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.960 
to start up and they don't glow very
brightly<00:04:27.800> when<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.160> battery<00:04:28.430> start<00:04:28.730> going

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
brightly when the battery start going

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.060 
brightly when the battery start going
flat<00:04:29.270> but<00:04:29.510> that's<00:04:29.800> what<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:30.830> expect<00:04:33.070> anyway

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
flat but that's what you expect anyway

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.620 
flat but that's what you expect anyway
that's<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.400> video<00:04:34.670> about<00:04:34.940> this<00:04:35.210> camping

lantern<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.260> don't<00:04:36.500> actually<00:04:36.860> know<00:04:37.010> who<00:04:37.880> would

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
lantern I don't actually know who would

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.370 
lantern I don't actually know who would
manufactured<00:04:38.720> by<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:39.050> it's<00:04:39.170> certainly

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
manufactured by but it's certainly

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.200 
manufactured by but it's certainly
branded<00:04:39.920> with<00:04:40.010> being<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.310> Jones<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.730> branding

and<00:04:42.020> I'm<00:04:42.110> particular<00:04:42.500> set<00:04:42.800> was<00:04:42.950> made<00:04:43.160> in<00:04:43.370> china

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
and I'm particular set was made in china

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.820 
and I'm particular set was made in china
and<00:04:43.940> then<00:04:44.600> there's<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:44.870> carry<00:04:45.110> handle<00:04:45.200> on<00:04:45.650> the

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
and then there's a carry handle on the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.000 
and then there's a carry handle on the
top<00:04:46.010> 40<00:04:47.170> then<00:04:48.170> at<00:04:48.260> the<00:04:48.350> back<00:04:48.530> there<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.800> have<00:04:48.980> a

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
top 40 then at the back there you have a

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.780 
top 40 then at the back there you have a
little<00:04:49.220> diagram<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.940> how<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:51.010> open<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:54.790> light

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
little diagram of how you open the light

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.730 
little diagram of how you open the light
on<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.390> front<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:56.840> you<00:04:56.870> could<00:04:57.050> also<00:04:57.230> use<00:04:57.380> this

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
on the front so you could also use this

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.030 
on the front so you could also use this
as<00:04:57.950> a<00:04:58.000> work<00:04:59.000> light<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.690> you<00:04:59.750> would<00:05:00.020> stand<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.530> up

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.350 

might<00:05:04.040> be<00:05:04.160> best<00:05:04.340> if<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.640> do<00:05:04.700> this<00:05:04.910> on<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.180> floor

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
might be best if I do this on the floor

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.900 
might be best if I do this on the floor
you<00:05:05.540> would<00:05:05.690> stand<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.230> up<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.820> then<00:05:07.820> lift<00:05:08.240> the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
you would stand it up and then lift the

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.260 
you would stand it up and then lift the
lock<00:05:10.910> picking<00:05:11.240> up<00:05:12.670> it's<00:05:13.670> not<00:05:13.820> very<00:05:13.880> well

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
lock picking up it's not very well

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.090 
lock picking up it's not very well
balanced<00:05:14.600> yeah<00:05:14.840> if<00:05:15.140> she<00:05:15.560> can't<00:05:15.770> really<00:05:15.890> do

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
balanced yeah if she can't really do

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.220 
balanced yeah if she can't really do
because<00:05:16.370> it's<00:05:16.520> not<00:05:16.640> very<00:05:16.790> well<00:05:17.030> balanced<00:05:17.570> I

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.540 

guess<00:05:21.230> you<00:05:21.410> would<00:05:21.560> only<00:05:21.710> do<00:05:22.040> that<00:05:22.070> if<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.370> have

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
guess you would only do that if you have

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.670 
guess you would only do that if you have
it<00:05:22.640> hanging<00:05:22.880> from<00:05:23.210> something<00:05:23.690> like<00:05:24.260> a<00:05:24.290> tent

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
it hanging from something like a tent

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.930 
it hanging from something like a tent
pole

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.400 

um<00:05:30.940> yeah<00:05:31.390> that's<00:05:31.600> better<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:31.960> can<00:05:32.110> say<00:05:32.320> about

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
um yeah that's better I can say about

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.630 
um yeah that's better I can say about
