00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
hey guys it's the FPS beasts and I was

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.190 
hey guys it's the FPS beasts and I was
playing<00:00:09.090> some<00:00:09.450> zombies<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.290> my<00:00:10.469> cousin<00:00:10.950> and

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
playing some zombies with my cousin and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.490 
playing some zombies with my cousin and
he<00:00:13.200> was<00:00:13.349> over<00:00:13.650> by<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.830> UM<00:00:14.450> PhD<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.870> my<00:00:16.170> earlier

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
he was over by the UM PhD on my earlier

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.460 
he was over by the UM PhD on my earlier
video<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.310> strategy<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.539> uh<00:00:18.570> um<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.289> didn't

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
video the strategy so uh um I didn't

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.880 
video the strategy so uh um I didn't
want<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> get<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.890> his<00:00:20.039> way<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:21.590> like<00:00:22.590> cuz<00:00:22.800> you

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
want to get in his way and like cuz you

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.230 
want to get in his way and like cuz you
know<00:00:23.010> we're<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.340> high<00:00:23.460> rounds<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:24.150> we

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
know we're on the high rounds and if we

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.120 
know we're on the high rounds and if we
got<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.449> our<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:25.199> definitely<00:00:25.590> go<00:00:25.680> down<00:00:25.710> we

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
got in our way we definitely go down we

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
got in our way we definitely go down we
couldn't<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.430> anything<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.390> found<00:00:28.080> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
couldn't do anything so I found this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.780 
couldn't do anything so I found this
amazing<00:00:29.060> new<00:00:30.060> strategy<00:00:30.630> um<00:00:31.160> just<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
amazing new strategy um just like the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
amazing new strategy um just like the
one<00:00:33.230> by<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.340> PhD<00:00:35.340> flopper<00:00:36.230> all<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> do

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
one by a PhD flopper all you have to do

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
one by a PhD flopper all you have to do
is<00:00:38.040> keep<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.700> circles<00:00:39.090> underneath

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
is keep on going in circles underneath

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.209 
is keep on going in circles underneath
the<00:00:39.690> rocket<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.440> course<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> open<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the rocket of course you got to open it

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.940 
the rocket of course you got to open it
up<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> stuff<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.989> exactly<00:00:43.379> like<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
up and stuff but it's exactly like the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.209 
up and stuff but it's exactly like the
strategy<00:00:44.820> by<00:00:45.329> PhD<00:00:45.930> flopper<00:00:46.079> maybe<00:00:47.010> even

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
strategy by PhD flopper maybe even

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.729 
strategy by PhD flopper maybe even
easier<00:00:47.780> because<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.559> go

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
easier because you don't have to like go

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.529 
easier because you don't have to like go
in<00:00:49.860> between<00:00:50.010> zombies<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:50.760> whatever<00:00:51.000> you're

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
in between zombies or whatever you're

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.729 
in between zombies or whatever you're
actually<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> circle<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
actually just going in a circle and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.350 
actually just going in a circle and
there<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.399> stay<00:00:53.640> right<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.120> between

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
there they just stay right in between

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
there they just stay right in between
the<00:00:54.780> square<00:00:55.559> unless<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> walk<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the square unless you walk on the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.220 
the square unless you walk on the
outside<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> circle<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> just

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
outside of the circle they kind of just

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.180 
outside of the circle they kind of just
follow<00:00:58.559> behind<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.129> I<00:01:00.170> mean<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.440> really

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
follow behind you I mean it's really

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
follow behind you I mean it's really

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.199 

the<00:02:18.840> RPK<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.709> better<00:02:19.860> but<00:02:20.760> you're<00:02:20.970> still

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the RPK which is better but you're still

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.690 
the RPK which is better but you're still
gonna<00:02:21.450> die<00:02:21.720> today<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.410> guess<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:23.280> not

gonna die today I guess it's really not
for<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.209> area<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.690> it's<00:02:24.989> close

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
for that area because it's close
