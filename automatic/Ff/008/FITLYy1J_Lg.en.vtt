00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.130
 Hello my name is Andrew with you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.590
 team sca games 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:18.650
 today i begin my creation course 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 character in programs like 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:30.990
 Autodesk May 2015 image 4 r7 today in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 in this lesson we will look at the character and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.540
 we will seek and references 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 Well let's start the first thing we 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.469
 see this huge shoulder pad cleaning so 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.980
 let's highlight it in red so 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:59.370
 need for less have this program 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:03.049
 photoshop did not guess select it later 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.920
 our character has a ring 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:11.610
 square but the city floor 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:16.850
 so then heaps heaps of belts and leather 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:23.960
 belts so chain so earlier 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.960
 taco pizza armband 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.460
 scraps along the gloves 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:38.310
 so here we have the same situation on 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:44.890
 only take defense gloves so 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:50.140
 brass knuckles where to let here so then we 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:02:03.310
 see a loincloth with a belt here 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:06.040
 she so then later boots cooler without 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.369
 boot on one leg only 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:20.910
 dear no boots he has 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:20.910
 metal insert that is so spikes 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:32.680
 three spikes and the rest of the floor is made 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 from the skin of wool and back too 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:45.900
 there is a thorn real so brutal 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.900
 this leg he, too, is no longer a bandage 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.440
 go away I take off my lessons do not write 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:08.110
 Here we have a bandage so well, in general, then all 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.270
 our org doesn't really like a lot of subjects 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.459
 wearing yourself 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.520
 that the most difficult thing is the worker is his 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.320
 anatomy she's quite complicated she 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:24.670
 looks like pitching on some 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:27.489
 typical q but still ok i mean 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.780
 tolerable, that is, you can take some pitching 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:37.350
 and just do it 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:39.990
 people think so anatomy will not lose 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.890
 you yourself perfectly see only here 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.890
 label all sorts of cubes and all that 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.940
 anatomy is a good thing if u know 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:02.760
 especially 3 summer residents barely summer residents 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.040
 never hurts though no i should 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 know every one that's what i can say so 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 then our rca has a beard like how 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:17.180
 he is pakira . . 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.180
 iron increasingly lich king 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.440
 below the knees cartridges 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.440
 So 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:43.620
 often so well, in general, all with analysis 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.780
 the character we finished here seems to me 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.020
 nothing else to allocate that is and 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.410
 prove difficult to explain is usually a 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.430
 jock 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.430
 only green
