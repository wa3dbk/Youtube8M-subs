00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.630
 Schierke unusual interview nine kilometers above the earth but after so 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.020
 a kambeck after almost a year that you can also see the clouds beautiful 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.399
 literally 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.060
 the right one was the first time I was here even after eleven months 

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.289
 again played from the beginning as a goal two goals is prepared from op 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.130
 have already experienced worse times 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.170
 he often has to talk about it that is so favorite opponent 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.410
 the player goes and then players always say no Every game is new Otto 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.820
 are 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.310
 Energie Cottbus and Lars Ricken that has something 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.030
 yes right through Cottbus Hannover Nuremberg that are percent 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.270
 why my team only owns our own percent should they also directly 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.580
 after a minute 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.020
 Percent again confirms percent so that there is more even during the game 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.410
 to be bought from module 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.940
 In the Free State situations learned with Marcus Brans Sammer has been completed 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 the rehearsed 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.880
 REALTECH ponds on the Alexa are designed to be ours before the game 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.710
 Already afterward depending on how you look 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.400
 Oil the flyer at the 8th of the other sci-elections which are responsible for the corners 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.200
 that's synonymous for Hall AXA theme shoot 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.810
 yes, and then percent came closer and hopefully sir Alex run 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.800
 who played the sixteenth and awkward Marine percent that he did so 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.220
 Well, the company always stayed with it and that's the way it is 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.240
 there is still the 2 0 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.530
 3 2 on 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 I never praised Stefan's work but also said I think so 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.260
 understandable only potential for upward that it is likely to divide 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.259
 After such a long break, you can not immediately be on or percent 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.690
 Of course, men did not notice the longer the game 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.060
 lasted all the better 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.490
 if I come in then too 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.500
 Gerlinde Zietlow eleven months the first game and of course if I now no 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.440
 certain rhythm percent on hardware with relatively much games then i want 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.590
 of course, finally have to get off 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.190
 so now not be a one-time thing but percent of the fair 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.940
 on Friday against Bochum the unique opportunity 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.760
 now finally to be first if it's just maybe movies 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.240
 makes it but I think then he is the unrest the Ems in two weeks in the club 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.840
 also ruled a bit 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 Percent then maybe even way first and we can do more with Bella 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.719
 other percent go to the next tasks 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:13.259
 every victory is important but how important was this after the user 1 in Gladbach 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.159
 after the 1 1 in Hannover age year restlessness came up environment 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.620

 certain Sawasiah of fitness and percent I still know everything 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.579

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.359
 for team captains 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.449
 we have sworn our record on the last three weeks 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.279
 Colombier we can maybe the 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.759
