sounds<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:26.819> digital<00:02:27.269> if<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.450> could

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
sounds a little digital if you could

really hear about starts to kind of like
fuzz<00:02:35.160> out<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> little<00:02:35.550> bit<00:02:35.700> but<00:02:35.849> that's<00:02:35.910> cool

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
fuzz out a little bit but that's cool

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.710

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
else is there what can we do here those

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.699 
else is there what can we do here those
are<00:02:42.209> pretty<00:02:42.330> much<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.569> main<00:02:42.690> things<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.170> you

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
are pretty much the main things like you

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.949 
are pretty much the main things like you
can<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:43.950> scratch<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:44.489> good<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.730> both

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:03:03.920 

try<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.110> over<00:02:52.260> here<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.720> fast

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
try that over here so all the fast

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.449 
try that over here so all the fast
scratches<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.379> could<00:03:04.470> pretty<00:03:04.620> much<00:03:04.709> do<00:03:04.980> so

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
scratches you could pretty much do so

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.920 
scratches you could pretty much do so

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:16.880 
you won't even tell you can't even see a
difference<00:03:07.290> here<00:03:07.769> are<00:03:07.829> differences<00:03:15.890> one

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890

thing<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.069> notice<00:03:17.310> about<00:03:17.340> sarado<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.030> if<00:03:18.180> you

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
thing I notice about sarado is if you

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.449 
thing I notice about sarado is if you
leave<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.860> needle<00:03:19.860> on<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.040> record<00:03:20.129> with<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
leave the needle on the record with the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.479 
leave the needle on the record with the
power<00:03:20.640> off<00:03:21.650> kind<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.680> vibrate<00:03:23.069> the<00:03:23.280> turns<00:03:25.489> it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
doesn't move around at all so that's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.470 
doesn't move around at all so that's
pretty<00:03:48.299> good<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.430> little<00:03:50.430> tiny<00:03:53.239> differences<00:03:54.239> I

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
pretty good so little tiny differences I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.759

mean<00:03:54.780> if<00:03:54.900> you're<00:03:54.989> juggling<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.590> leave

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
mean if you're juggling and you leave

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.030 
mean if you're juggling and you leave
the<00:03:56.660> record<00:03:57.660> on<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.019> might<00:03:58.169> make<00:03:58.650> those<00:03:58.799> noises

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the record on it might make those noises

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.680 
the record on it might make those noises
you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.310> always<00:03:59.519> turn<00:03:59.639> it<00:03:59.790> off<00:03:59.940> or<00:04:00.540> whatever

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
you can always turn it off or whatever

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.089 
you can always turn it off or whatever
if<00:04:01.049> you're<00:04:01.230> not<00:04:01.349> using<00:04:01.590> Serato<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:03.060> uh<00:04:04.099> just

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
if you're not using Serato but uh just

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.520 
if you're not using Serato but uh just
kind<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.310> like<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.430> minor<00:04:05.700> thing<00:04:09.349> alright<00:04:10.349> so

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
kind of like a minor thing alright so

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.360 
kind of like a minor thing alright so
there<00:04:10.680> you<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:10.919> tractor<00:04:11.579> cerrado<00:04:13.370> pretty

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
there you have it tractor cerrado pretty

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.500 
there you have it tractor cerrado pretty
much<00:04:14.549> couldn't<00:04:14.819> tell<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.000> difference<00:04:15.030> if<00:04:15.419> I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
much couldn't tell the difference if I

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.879 
much couldn't tell the difference if I
was<00:04:15.630> blindfold<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.260> wouldn't<00:04:16.590> know<00:04:16.650> what<00:04:16.829> the

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
was blindfold I wouldn't know what the

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.050 
was blindfold I wouldn't know what the
hell<00:04:17.039> you're<00:04:17.190> using<00:04:17.400> unless<00:04:17.760> you're<00:04:17.880> going

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
hell you're using unless you're going

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.390 
hell you're using unless you're going
super<00:04:18.690> slow<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.139> you've<00:04:19.260> seen<00:04:19.410> earlier<00:04:19.530> but

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
super slow as you've seen earlier but

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.319 
super slow as you've seen earlier but
you<00:04:20.519> know<00:04:20.579> who<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.820> hell<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.000> gonna<00:04:21.060> do<00:04:21.209> that

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
you know who the hell is gonna do that

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.540 
you know who the hell is gonna do that
well<00:04:21.570> maybe<00:04:22.109> yeah<00:04:22.590> maybe<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.099> probably<00:04:23.460> be

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
well maybe yeah maybe you probably be

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.159

doing that

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.719 
doing that
something<00:04:24.530> real<00:04:24.740> super<00:04:25.219> funky<00:04:25.550> slow

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
something real super funky slow

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.270 
something real super funky slow
scratches<00:04:26.150> but<00:04:26.620> it's<00:04:27.620> not<00:04:27.740> really<00:04:27.949> much<00:04:28.069> of<00:04:28.129> a

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
scratches but it's not really much of a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.350 
scratches but it's not really much of a
big<00:04:28.430> difference<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.849> mean<00:04:28.969> there's<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.150> lot<00:04:29.210> of

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.969 
big difference I mean there's a lot of
advantages<00:04:30.289> that<00:04:30.830> Serato<00:04:31.610> has<00:04:31.849> scratch<00:04:32.300> video

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979
