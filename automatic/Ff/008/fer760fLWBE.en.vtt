tutorial to start off there are three

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.280 
tutorial to start off there are three
types<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.730> redstone<00:00:09.059> there's<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.870> redstone

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
types of redstone there's the redstone

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.919 
types of redstone there's the redstone
wire<00:00:10.730> there's<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.940> redstone<00:00:12.300> torch<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
wire there's the redstone torch and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.010 
wire there's the redstone torch and
there's<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.830> redstone<00:00:14.190> repeater<00:00:15.020> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
there's the redstone repeater the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.560 
there's the redstone repeater the
redstone<00:00:16.410> wire<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.640> wire<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.240> acts<00:00:18.449> as

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
redstone wire is the wire that acts as

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.050 
redstone wire is the wire that acts as
electricity<00:00:19.109> which<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.160> send<00:00:20.400> currents<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
electricity which can send currents to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.859 
electricity which can send currents to
other<00:00:21.270> items<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.020> turn<00:00:22.199> them<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.890> off<00:00:23.100> the

other items to turn them on or off the
redstone<00:00:24.869> torch<00:00:25.170> acts<00:00:25.920> as<00:00:26.310> renewer<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
redstone torch acts as renewer to the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.660 
redstone torch acts as renewer to the
redstone<00:00:27.420> wire<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.960> can<00:00:28.500> either<00:00:28.890> send<00:00:29.400> or

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
redstone wire and can either send or

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150 
redstone wire and can either send or
receive<00:00:30.119> information<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:32.009> also

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
receive information it can also

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.360 
receive information it can also
replenish<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.360> electricity<00:00:34.079> after<00:00:34.350> every<00:00:34.739> 15

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
replenish the electricity after every 15

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.430 
replenish the electricity after every 15
redstone<00:00:35.850> wires<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.510> after<00:00:36.899> every<00:00:37.079> 15

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
redstone wires because after every 15

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.130 
redstone wires because after every 15
red<00:00:37.620> still<00:00:37.860> wires<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.640> power<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> lost<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
red still wires the power is lost so you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
red still wires the power is lost so you
can<00:00:40.290> use<00:00:40.410> redstone<00:00:40.710> torches<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
can use redstone torches for that the

it you'll notice it's at different
settings<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.739> will<00:00:49.950> see<00:00:50.700> how<00:00:50.940> much<00:00:51.000> time<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
settings this will see how much time it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.990 
settings this will see how much time it
takes<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> Redstone<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> pass<00:00:52.800> through

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
takes for the Redstone the pass through
