00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 in one of the previous stories we 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.810
 told about the Highland fold cat breed 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.269
 this is a variation of scottish 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.130
 breed deck well honestly cat the most 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.710
 known as Scottish Fold 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.020
 Today we will tell about the Straight cats 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.460
 with erect ears representatives all 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.029
 the same Scottish breed 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.920
 this breed includes four 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.519
 animal species are not Scottish 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.710
 there are short-haired Scots to them 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.849
 Fold as well as this 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.769
 the breed that we speak 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.960
 shorthair straight ie it 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.600
 cat with straight ears and also have 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 longhair look of this breed they can 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.790
 be also folds too straight more often 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 just one litter and straights are born 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.460
 and funds 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.500
 because it is forbidden to knit among themselves 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.989
 two lop-eared cats and a pair of parents 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 it's always stripe plus fold to me 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.680
 There is an opinion in the professional environment that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.899
 this breed to cross the British 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 shorthair breed to date 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.340
 the day is wrong when that breed is obvious 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.050
 the blood of the british was taken from here and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.270
 many similarities between the Scots and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.480
 British both in appearance and 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.610
 character must say that like all 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.030
 semi-longhair and shorthair 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.380
 cats of course they are more mobile than 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.280
 longhair cats 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 but they differ little temper and 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.000
 british cats and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.570
 I have to say in favor of straights slide 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.320
 and more tender and so alienated 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.450
 can say such domesticated yes then 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.690
 have more contact 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.690
 they don't disappear when the house comes 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.970
 strangers on the contrary they are enough for themselves 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.530
 boldly lead and probably it's all the same 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.230
 blood shedding 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.820
 folds all kinds of scotch have 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.100
 almost identical standard 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.260
 requirements and specifications of course for 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.510
 exclusion of ears is permissible for them 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.400
 a huge number of colors eye color 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.410
 these cats should match the color 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.210
 wool are found Scottish from 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.140
 beautiful green eyes 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.390
 green eyes according to the standard are inherent in two 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.970
 it is gold and silver in ours 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 the nursery now focuses precisely on 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.340
 business 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.630
 with for the eyes of cats scottish fold 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.510
 Scottish Straight 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.709
 and this representative is over exactly 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.970
 silver 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.310
 brindle straight exactly green 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.980
 Does the builder's eyes require any 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 special care special care they 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.330
 they do not require unpretentious enough 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.150
 during their shedding of course better 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.760
 combing wool they have no colds 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.750
 it is soft and slightly structured 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.860
 different from the same british 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.890
 combed during molting and in 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.020
 no care principle besides 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 that these cats are easy to care they also 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.200
 have a great character breed 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.130
 not aggressive 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.250
 self-sufficient on the one hand it can 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.970
 do without a master if the master of the house 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.170
 no but on the other hand and they are very and to 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.520
 they are attached to a person 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.810
 sociable they are good contact with children 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.209
 what Scots have you been 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.760
 Straight or Fold Shorthair or 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.290
 longhair is guaranteed one you 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.290
 get great animals
