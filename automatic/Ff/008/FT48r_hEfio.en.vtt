yeah he got a little depressed in one

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
yeah he got a little depressed in one
scene<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.159> Superman

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549

opinion<00:03:01.250> on<00:03:01.400> if<00:03:01.610> I<00:03:01.760> think<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.150> going<00:03:02.330> to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
opinion on if I think this is going to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.300

some<00:04:05.810> good<00:04:06.680> things<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.220> here<00:04:08.019> but<00:04:09.019> ultimately

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
some good things in here but ultimately

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.110 
some good things in here but ultimately
I<00:04:09.560> need<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:09.889> see<00:04:10.069> more<00:04:10.280> before<00:04:10.459> I<00:04:10.670> can<00:04:10.819> actually

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120

I need to see more before I can actually
make<00:04:11.269> my<00:04:11.389> opinion<00:04:11.810> on<00:04:11.989> if<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:12.319> think<00:04:12.560> this<00:04:12.709> is

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
make my opinion on if I think this is

going<00:04:12.889> to<00:04:12.950> be<00:04:13.069> a<00:04:13.100> good<00:04:13.280> movie<00:04:13.579> it<00:04:13.730> seems<00:04:14.090> dark

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
going to be a good movie it seems dark

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.590 
going to be a good movie it seems dark
and<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.900> scares<00:04:15.319> me<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:17.060> should<00:04:17.389> scare
