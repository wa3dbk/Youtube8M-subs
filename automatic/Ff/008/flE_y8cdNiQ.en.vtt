 character creation and empire choice 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.150
 planitia 2 is massive 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.580
 multiplayer shooter from the first 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.289
 individuals with a deep degree of customization 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 character 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.599
 but before we get to this deal 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 with character creation screen just 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.420

 empire prefer sovereignty to van 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.510
 new conglomerate or tyrant of the republic but 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.100
 before we do it the best way 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.719
 for me to demonstrate why 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 each empire is unique especially 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.250
 just show and discuss a few in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.840
 game video 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 let's start with sovereignty anus fraction 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.739
 techno cities think that humanity 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.019
 should develop re- opening 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.010
 using lost technology in the bath 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.670
 times aliens and weight this time foggy 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.049
 culture academic intellectuals and 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.000
 techies who believe that fate 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.710
 humanity is to further 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 study and research technology is alien 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.070
 if your not bowed to your side 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.020
 ideology bath maybe it will 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.119
 technology their weapons lack 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.430
 ballistic drop remote very 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.680
 fast reload no recoil and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.250
 very fast-firing automatic 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.290
 rifles 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.600
 then but don't worry it only 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.470
 initial guns in the process of customization 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.720
 their planet side 2 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.270
 you can improve change and open 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.000
 new weapon even more fancy as 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 in society with other empires 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 another vase there is a tank on the grader 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.579
 specializing in mobility and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.619
 maneuverability and it is real 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.570
 sniper rifle as magician raider 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.079
 allow you to quickly hide from any 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.659
 threats 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.360
 and in the heavens the wheel of its maneuverability 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.119
 brightness with using as a drive 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.710
 magnetic field he can do such 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.770
 which no other is capable of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.399
 conventional aircraft 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.920
 militaristic government of the republic 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.910
 tyrant with might and main use their imperial 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.980
 authoritarian my to reason 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.840
 and spend a good and spread friendship 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.910
 all possible methods tear 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.860
 conservative nation trying to bring back 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.410
 contact with homeland and combine all three 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.540
 warring factions weapons tyrant republic 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.640
 distinguished by the highest rate of fire 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.900
 the spaciousness of their stores whole 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.800
 designed to inflict 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.390
 lasting maximum good in 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.310
 while the rate of fire of weapons 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.470
 tyrants maximum is compensated 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.690
 its not high damage that equalizes it 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.430
 with the weapons of the rest of the nations continues 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.950
 speed theme tank tyrant republic 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.390
 prowler which is the fastest of the big ones 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.850
 tanks its distinguishing feature 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.570
 system of paired implements increasing 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.120
 rate of fire 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.470
 as well as its unique feature 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.620
 the ability to log in fixed or 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.790
 siege mode 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.810
 it allows you to increase your 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.920
 rate of fire up to 300 percent 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.680
 last but not least 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.420
 goes the Republic fighter masks he 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.790
 quite gelin but its main advantage 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.140
 is speed which allows 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.610
 mosquito slip away from many 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.610
 trouble the fastest way 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.630
 finally we have a new conglomerate this 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.030
 rebel group 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.730
 idealistic freedom fighters 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.620
 nc fights against republic pressure 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.750
 tyrant new conglomerate is 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.640
 separatist organizations fighting for 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.560
 then to stay free from 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.390
 dominant terran republic they 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.160
 believe that any form of control is 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.490
 oppression and better be miserable on 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.040
 free than slave also end zhahnut 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.860
 first zhahnut tank face and then 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.270
 bear the beating 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.370
 all c weapons possess low 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.500
 rate of fire long lasting 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.040
 recharge well frees only in 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.450
 the way is to get out of it 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.580
 fighter conglomerate river by 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.560
 fact this is the slowest shooting 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.160
 flying attack aircraft among all three 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.040
 empire 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.560
 but still he is beautiful 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.530
 survivability ammunition and booking 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.300
 superior to other analogues and by the way 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.550
 if the river does hit you 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.070
 will she do something 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.320
 in an awesome way 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.290
 us goes van guard battle tank new 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.120
 conglomerate is the slowest in its 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.410
 niche and rate of fire and 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.690
 mobility but he has the best armor 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.690
 and the power of the weapon is just overwhelming 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.140
 also in the presence of a special feature and drags 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.970
 able to absorb huge damage and so 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.680
 now you can decide who is behind 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.420
 shed your blood but don't worry 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.130
 You can create a lot on one account. 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.620
 characters so if you wish you can 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.180
 play for all three empires what after 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.010
 viewing this material we will do 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.600
 thing that does not quite get the essence and we will not 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.340
 choose Orthodox true tyrants 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.960
 let's cheat him 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.850
 Headphone types are imba and graders 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.250
 recoilless pupae just select and 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.750
 pay next select server based 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.180
 on the region that is closest to your 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.210
 klaatsay house next now we need to enter 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.850
 and I'll choose some kind of crazy to 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:14.150
 she came to fish blue choose 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.380
 race understand no autobahn nick choose 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.380
 floor and drove
