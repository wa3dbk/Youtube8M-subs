00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.270
 Good advertising is an effective advertisement. A company that does not exist is Galoob, 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.890
 which as part of the promotion of its series of Micro Machines resins has been commissioned 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.700
 creating a series of racing games based on the brand. 21 years after the premiere 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.020
 our Galoob review facility no longer exists and no one produces anymore 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.360
 cars, but the series of games advertising them is still remembered today. 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.880
 It all started with Micro Machines on NESa created by Codemasters 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.390
 in 1991. The Code Masters were pretty good at the world of the world, because 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.210
 in the days of Nintendo's full control over the games that went to their console, 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.250
 these developers have released unlicensed games to the market without blessing 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.400
 Mario's home. In most cases, unlicensed titles were channeled 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.040
 monsters not worth the attention. Small Machines, however, were completely different and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.910
 they have absorbed the childhood of many a player. 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.470
 The game allows you to play in single or double mode. As one player 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.080
 we will face three computer opponents in the fight for the cup. 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.050
 We choose our character, and then three drivers who will come with us in 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.220
 lists. Each of the computer characters has a different level 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.940
 skills, so the strategic choice of opponents can greatly facilitate the game. 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.620
 Three lost races mean the end of the game, both for us and for ours 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.070
 enemies, and defeated drivers are replaced for the next so long, 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 until we eliminate them all. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.510
 Of course, it all comes down to the races themselves, and these are simply 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.210
 quintessence of playability. We will take 9 small cars behind the wheel 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.780
 machines including jeeps, motor boats, tanks, and even helicopters. Everyone from 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.350
 Types of resilants are racing on their thematic set of routes. Motor boats - 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.410
 in a bathtub full of rubber ducks, cars on the desk, and my favorite 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.870
 formulas on billiard tables. Of course, different vehicles are heading 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.140
 differently, and the boards themselves focus on different types of obstacles. Fast 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.950
 Sports cars will fight with sharp turns and jumps between 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.400
 desks, and slow, armored and equipped with Warriors skewers bypassed 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.770
 patches of glue and tried to avoid collisions that may end with an explosion. 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.790
 The level of difficulty of the game increases extremely quickly which is also a big disadvantage and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.100
 the advantage of the game. The disadvantage, because due to the small field of view forces us to 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.400
 memorizing routes and playing on the feel, an advantage, though frustrating, level 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.680
 the difficulty is honest and punishes us only for our own mistakes, and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.710
 it is very difficult to beat races that previously seemed impossible 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.710
 satisfying. 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.170
 Even today, detailed graphics and track plans are impressive. On the kitchen 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.700
 tables you will find oranges, spilled milk, boxes of flakes that 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.590
 they build a sense of scale. In the two-man mode, two are available for us 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.570
 options. In addition to the championships, we can also choose the single race mode in which 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.330
 The main task of the players is not to be left behind. When the slower player disappears from 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.980
 screen, the winner will receive a point. The one who tilts the balance wins 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.780
 points to your website or finish the race in the first place. 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.140
 All this is complemented by a memorable soundtrack, which unfortunately 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.120
 it only accompanies us in the interface. During racing, we only hear 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.650
 engine rumbling and sound effects, which is a pity, because the music in the game is holding 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.260
 an extremely high level and every excuse to have more would be 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.240
 good. I would also attach to the lack of training mode in which 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.070
 you could practice harder routes. Micro Machines in single mode 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.160
 He does not give us any choice of routes, so he forces us to come back again 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.670
 go through the tournament to practice the annoying races. 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.540
 Some games age like milk and a few years after the premiere, to the players' surprise 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.530
 they turn out to be virtually unplayable. Micro Machines is not one of those games. 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.990
 Over 20 years after the premiere, it is as playable as it was on the day of purchase and even today 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.960
 pulls in completely. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to vacuum your pegasus, fire up 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.180
 iconic golden five and choose Spider. Give me a thumbs up if you've also played 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.860
 Spider. Everyone played Spider, no?
