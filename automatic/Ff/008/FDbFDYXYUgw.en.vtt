here<00:00:31.160> that<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.610> see<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:34.250> memory<00:00:35.960> tools<00:00:38.809> but

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
here that you see here memory tools but

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.830 
here that you see here memory tools but
there<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> 8<00:00:42.149> gigabytes<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
there we go this is the 8 gigabytes of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.100 
there we go this is the 8 gigabytes of
memory<00:00:44.030> hopping<00:00:45.030> over<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.860> i'll<00:00:46.860> assume

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
memory hopping over to this i'll assume

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
memory hopping over to this i'll assume
this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> data<00:00:49.559> doubler<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
this is the data doubler now this is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.959 
this is the data doubler now this is
actual<00:00:51.000> SSD<00:00:52.219> so<00:00:53.219> 120<00:00:54.059> gigabyte<00:00:54.480> owc<00:00:55.440> SSD<00:00:56.190> about

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
actual SSD so 120 gigabyte owc SSD about

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
actual SSD so 120 gigabyte owc SSD about
240<00:00:57.809> read/write<00:00:58.320> speeds<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.859> it's<00:00:58.980> gonna<00:00:59.070> be

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
240 read/write speeds so it's gonna be

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.090 
240 read/write speeds so it's gonna be
blazing<00:00:59.730> fast<00:01:00.620> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.829> plowing

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
blazing fast kind of just plowing

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.160 
blazing fast kind of just plowing
through<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.850> unboxing<00:01:03.660> since<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
through this unboxing since there's so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.530

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
from owc is the data doubler so it has

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450 
from owc is the data doubler so it has
instructions<00:01:12.020> like<00:01:13.020> i<00:01:13.170> said<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.680> will<00:01:14.010> allow

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
instructions like i said this will allow

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
instructions like i said this will allow
