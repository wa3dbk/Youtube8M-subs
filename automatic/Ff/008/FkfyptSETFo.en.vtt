00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.349
 hello to all welcome to this little 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 video contest I introduce myself I 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.349
 call me it chirac or follow in has 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.610
 maybe from you who is me 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.079
 know since I'm busy on 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.809
 youtube of all that is universe 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.910
 naruto so nothing to see of course 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.520
 with call of duty but today I 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.370
 here to earn you 5 codes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.100
 a fleet on xbox one I specify well 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 xbox one since three other videos have 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.809
 been posted on the channel 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 with regard to the xbox the ps3 and the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.429
 So what are we interested in? 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.769
 in this video it's the xbox one 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.059
 that's it, listen, I'm talking to you 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.120
 little bit of gameplay so I'm you 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.539
 saw it at the silent wrist vector 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.729
 I'm in a flash with five more 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 members of the team cod qg the team sky 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.740
 so we are six and we are one 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.690
 attempt to perfect in light so that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.909
 does that make it an imperfect 16-0 in 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.010
 lightning since clerics and split into 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.660
 two games of 2 8 points all 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.820
 simply and so we try 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.680
 to tame semap since they come 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.810
 to go out and I'm not hiding that it's 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.570
 a real pleasure to discover it since 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.000
 not only do we start with call of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.070
 duty ghost to know the maps well 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 know all the spots and company and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 second round I'm not hiding 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.160
 I was a judge had avoided spoliation 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.470
 watching videos to let me 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.210
 fully discover these maps 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 here we go back on the small 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.930
 contest so listen to the skin if 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 activision offers us the possibility 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.680
 thanks to them by passing from 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 save 5 codes 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 so what is in this dense 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.299
 in this code 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.890
 hunt claude here is behind this 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.060
 weapon there that you see at the moment that 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.100
 is called the mavericks and a new 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.810
 weapon that comes out and comes in two 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.979
 different weapons ends two types 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 of different weapons since there is one 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.450
 that you just saw and also the same 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.640
 but sniper version so it's a small 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.290
 mic mac which allows to use it as 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.989
 that sniper and it's obviously a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.370
 sniper finally has real snipers in the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.520
 category of rifles sniper rifles 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.660
 like him and it's round the 119 and the wing 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.770
 which is rather not bad so I you 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.360
 give my opinion about america but 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.950
 first, I'll talk about the 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.250
 four new maps which has that one 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.840
 what's called containment then 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.850
 honestly I tell you a whole 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.269
 little bit my life for two seconds 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.150
 I stopped call of duty on mw2 at 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.190
 the time to start all the tricks 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.470
 shot and all the antics I stopped 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.420
 there and since that time and I have more 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.580
 never touch up a call of duty I'm 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.200
 am more interested at least and I am 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.030
 income on ghost i wanted to do 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.380
 a little come back on this game and I'm 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.750
 income on ghost so I do not hide from you 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.430
 not that the transition between mw2 is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.260
 kid to be very difficult for me 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 as much at the level of the weapons 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.579
 of the strengths of the killstreaks that 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.930
 I was completely late had 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.579
 really many things that I do not 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.040
 did not know at all 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.120
 we at the time played with 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.070
 go-go opposition forces and ninja 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.900
 So that was really it was 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.720
 really another another universe and 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.030
 for nothing to hide from you was not the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.010
 all at all fan of these ghost maps 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.780
 now i have taken the habit of course 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.340
 but all that to come 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.600
 what I wanted to tell you at the base 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.470
 when I saw the four 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.390
 maps of ce2 ce2 is tlc I loved the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.799
 four I played the four and I liked 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.630
 the four so I'm going to make you a 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.840
 little quick description there is one 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.489
 who is really nice she is not 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.140
 too big not too small there are plenty 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.030
 spots everywhere it's really nice 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.010
 there is a bridge too which is a little bit 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.109
 in radiation can see it on the map 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.370
 top left and a radiation bridge 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.709
 which will confuse you a bit 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.790
 radars and you can you have the 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.410
 possibility of destroying it 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.850
 simply by having the spes of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.790
 colic am we will call it like that 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.019
 the package klm that will destroy besides 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.700
 you will finally see a video 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.970
 there is also another brand that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.830
 is called flood which is smaller 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.480
 a little bit are in the swamps with 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.730
 little corridors is all really 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.520
 really really nice a third 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.800
 map so that's called bay view which is 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.280
 really nice to see I want to say 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.870
 beautiful to see 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.330
 it makes me think about doing 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.430
 math that I could see in video on mw3 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.450
 it is colored there is a aquarium ya 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.700
 clothing stores 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.980
 it's in the city it's really nice 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.630
 and finally the last one is the remake of 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.940
 scrap yards for those who were playing so 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.220
 at the time of mw2 it's a single map 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.080
 is called so will be innichen kid and 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.090
 which is honestly I think one of 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.170
 best maps for now on 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.660
 ghost because I really find her 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.360
 perfect neither too big nor too small 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.820
 exactly like this one with full 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.410
 of places in floor height finally 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.960
 in short I love it in my punishment 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.030
 and so what about the little more 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.280
 of this dlc so it will be the weapons the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.780
 mavericks and the sniper mavericks then 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.940
 same I give my opinion frankly 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.860
 I loved 7.7 mavericks 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.880
 she is really nice she is for me 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.030
 do not find it right away and is 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.340
 neither too weak I really find it 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.560
 versatile jean louis vielajus 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.870
 personally with an inviting aim 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.010
 laser and a silencer simply I 'm 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.230
 see the handle because I do not find 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.620
 that it's really necessary with the 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.740
 not necessarily necessarily unstable 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.540
 we are at 10 0 out of 7 out of 7 is clear 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.580
 So we are with the whole team 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.560
 defend 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.599
 of the world six members of the soho team 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.639
 qg then there is bobby the man is not telling himself 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.659
 of stupidity there are exact in the part 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.430
 exact bobby lol me even though they're jce 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.419
 Tisot Tintin good striker and he 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.639
 request more complicated than that no 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.009
 the call of a so we are so his nose to 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.900
 13.0 so listen to it happens rather 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.280
 good for us and for it to happen 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.659
 good for you what I propose to you 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.430
 it is to simply leave a 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.870
 little comment in the section of 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.849
 comments from this video where you 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.000
 say that you are participating for this code 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.009
 a slot on xbox one simply 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.629
 try to be offered a little bit your 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.569
 message for not that they pass as 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:56.979
 that sure spam on youtube because you 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:58.870
 have I think the usual of contests 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.669
 and it's true that sometimes the sails and 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.349
 messages when they look alike 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.180
 troop goes on as spam so 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.770
 do not hesitate to participate in the 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.060
 comments section because that's 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.039
 true that eventually we can maybe 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.050
 not all can afford to put 15 or 20 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.300
 euros in a video game like that in more 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.650
 of the initial price of the video game so 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.479
 listen to it 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.539
 and besides I take advantage of it for 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.949
 thank you for activision for this little 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.840
 contest do not hesitate to 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.779
 participate in any case really good dlc 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.090
 for this first dlc of ghost we start 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.860
 very very strong will it really 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.839
 United Nations at the level of weapons that 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.180
 maps true a real happiness of them 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:37.120
 discover and play with and the mode 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.069
 party so we are at 15 0 and there 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.310
 the 16th point was put and I leave you 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:46.169
 with this small package kmm destruction of 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.169
 bridges that's good base of manas all that
