00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.420
 hello welcome, I will show you how 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.030
 make a curved wall in frost 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.560
 for this case I'm going to draw a line 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.020
 any curve of any radius 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.710
 random around here for example but this 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.599
 line can belong to both a drawing 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.840
 what are we doing in 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.809
 scripts the same as an imported plane 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.650
 touched or any other format that 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.160
 allow us to import the program 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:50.670
 let's make a wall in this case 1 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 meter high by 0 25 wide 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.989
 for this we will take the surface that 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.829
 we have created the wall we drag 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.710
 on the plane line 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.290
 to which our future will belong 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.830
 Wall 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.490
 and we will click on the tool 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.000
 follow me to be with nothing right 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.930
 we select the surface and the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.880
 we drag on the line of the plane 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.850
 we only have left in the case that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.850
 there are visible edges select them 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.630
 and using the right button 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:36.150
 the smoothing tool smoothes edges 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.620
 the wall will be completely smooth and 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.080
 on this wall we can apply 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.840
 materials we can turn it into a 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.000
 component in a group 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.600
 we can modify its scale we can 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.729
 modify its height in this case medium 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.790
 subway can we measure one meter and 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.520
 medium 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.740
 and we can perform the operations that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.820
 we want about him I hope that I have 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.700
 served something 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.700
 thanks for watching the video and greetings
