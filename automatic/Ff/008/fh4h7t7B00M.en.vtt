00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello to all I find you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.339
 today two new videos a little 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.950
 particular since it is to make a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.230
 point on the channel last week 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.030
 in the in my box I told you that I 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 thought my life was going to change very 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.500
 soon I was not thinking go 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.180
 to do so quickly after saying 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.520
 since in fact I graduated so 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.920
 September 2013 of my degree 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 engineer and for a year 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.160
 in fact I looked for work I 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 do some missions here and there 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.510
 but really nothing very concrete and there 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.450
 in fact very recently, to tell the truth 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.829
 Friday I received a call so 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.200
 from a company to tell me that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.140
 I was caught in cdi 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.030
 so how do you say that it was 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.469
 a little bit not unexpected but let's say 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.200
 I did not expect to receive the snj and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.149
 when I spent interview all that's it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.309
 I did not feel it badly but not no 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.660
 more super super good so I 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.430
 was expecting to see a cdd but not a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.760
 celi live right now 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.230
 So here then I moved right 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.969
 it's not very far actually it's at 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 reindeer side 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.030
 so in brittany you know that I am 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.439
 in Normandy so that's Brittany 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 Normandy I go to the enemy camp 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.159
 in quotation marks actually never really 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.450
 had war but hey it's because the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.280
 mont saint michel we never know tried 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 breton silo normand all that stuff 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 pushes a bit like a good brief blow 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.740
 I become that I move enough 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.180
 quickly since i actually start my 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.420
 mission September 22 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.820
 yes it's next week a little 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.009
 next monday anyway so suddenly 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.240
 here is a little speed for me I 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.640
 think my channel is going to be put aside 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 for a few weeks so I think 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 not that there will be ten mailbox masts there 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 may not have other 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.590
 videos what I do not have time 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 tours because here it is necessary that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.729
 I'm finishing my mission there right now 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.560
 next week what's so suddenly I 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.770
 will not have time to turn it's going 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.939
 to be a little weird I think the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.770
 time I find a new home 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.790
 when we do well you will not have this 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.100
 decor so here is a little lost 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.869
 in my words because I do not know too much 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 iron I go how it will 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.490
 pass I just know that my channel is going 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.540
 stay a little bit in stand by a few 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.800
 weeks the blog will always be 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.110
 day since here I have chronicles 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.560
 which are very programmed since a few 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.830
 time so there the blog will always know in 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.780
 action but the chain will be a little bit 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.550
 paused the time of a few 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.890
 weeks the time I turn back the 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.020
 time that I settle comfortably 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.830
 not that I'm showing you that things a 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.570
 little messy 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.000
 so you see that now I'm attacking 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.620
 cardboard so no it's another 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.300
 history 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.410
 knowing that they are pretty well there are a lot of 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.540
 books that I will take especially 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.190
 all those who worship pale masts 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.520
 necessarily all this shelf there and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.870
 finally that I surely learn it too 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.510
 the jennifer harman however who 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.970
 accompanies me everywhere series I think 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.260
 that are important to me 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.000
 so there are still not bad so 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.500
 this is going to make a big change 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.820
 for me it is also a very big 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.970
 change since I'm going to leave two 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.050
 areas the family housing even though I 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.480
 had left for my studies but there 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.800
 it had been a year since I had returned from 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.770
 people I do to do my little 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.380
 deco I can buy myself I hope the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.450
 glio tech that I want even if it costs 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.390
 relatively expensive but I'm sure 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.190
 will talk again my I think in a video 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.890
 not immediately but in a few 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.209
 time so here I am sorry there goes there 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.620
 have few videos in the next 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.060
 weeks but in any case if you want 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.380
 continue to see from my opinion so to 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.269
 go to the blog because he will be 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.530
 always up to date 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.630
 I hope that your side is all right 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.130
 that everything is going well for you that the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.330
 return went well in the meantime 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.190
 I wish you very nice readings 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.080
