00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
good I mean this I would much rather

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.130 
good I mean this I would much rather
play<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.580> game<00:02:33.819> because<00:02:34.209> I'll<00:02:34.480> for<00:02:34.989> one

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
play this game because I'll for one

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.270 
play this game because I'll for one
thing<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.319> think<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.560> animation<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.099> better

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
thing I think the animation is better

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.759 
thing I think the animation is better
for<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:36.790> thing<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.209> I've<00:02:37.420> ever<00:02:37.599> seen<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.140> any

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
for one thing then I've ever seen in any

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.170 
for one thing then I've ever seen in any
of<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.010> raw<00:02:39.190> games<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.580> only<00:02:39.760> game<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:39.970> I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
of the raw games the only game that I

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.880 
of the raw games the only game that I
would<00:02:40.390> actually<00:02:40.510> say<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:41.170> better<00:02:41.530> than<00:02:41.709> this

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
would actually say is better than this

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.030 
would actually say is better than this
is<00:02:42.099> there<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.970> an<00:02:43.150> old<00:02:43.330> Japan<00:02:43.720> game<00:02:44.019> back<00:02:44.769> for

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
is there is an old Japan game back for

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.759 
is there is an old Japan game back for
the<00:02:45.160> saturn<00:02:46.090> way<00:02:46.510> back<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:46.959> day<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.470> was

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
the saturn way back in the day it was

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.319 
the saturn way back in the day it was
probably<00:02:48.130> better<00:02:48.280> than<00:02:48.489> this<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.239> game

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
probably better than this but this game

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.390 
probably better than this but this game
is<00:02:49.480> also<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:50.019> not<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.470> button<00:02:51.099> masher

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
is also just not a button masher

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.460 
is also just not a button masher
actually<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.000> takes<00:02:52.239> skill<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:52.810> actually<00:02:53.290> work

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
actually it takes skill to actually work

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.940 
actually it takes skill to actually work
this<00:02:53.620> game<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:53.920> have<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:54.099> work<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:55.530> bonus<00:02:56.530> body

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
this game you have to work a bonus body

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.890 
this game you have to work a bonus body
part<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.549> have<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> lot<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.420> these<00:02:58.629> types

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
part you have to do a lot of these types

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.610 
part you have to do a lot of these types
of<00:02:59.049> things<00:02:59.579> you<00:03:00.579> can't<00:03:00.790> just<00:03:00.910> bash<00:03:01.120> my<00:03:01.620> buttons

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
of things you can't just bash my buttons

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.729 
of things you can't just bash my buttons
it's<00:03:03.269> skill<00:03:04.269> its<00:03:04.540> timing<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> lot<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.590> this

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
it's skill its timing to a lot of this

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.350 
it's skill its timing to a lot of this
particularly<00:03:06.700> when<00:03:06.879> you're<00:03:07.000> talking<00:03:07.239> about

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
particularly when you're talking about

was the one for the saturn and I could
take<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:32.920> game<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.519> could<00:03:33.910> create<00:03:34.180> some<00:03:34.599> mojo

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
take that game I could create some mojo
