00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.529
 so hello to all welcome to my 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.509
 workshop here I'm a little sorry for 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.730
 decor since you see boxes in 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.260
 back background is not very pretty but I 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 explains why it's because 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.580
 we are for once in my 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.410
 workshop so this is a piece that is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.420
 really reserved to store my 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 material to create the jewels of which I 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.380
 do not create an oath here is in everything 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.510
 case I store the material sometimes I 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.980
 do it here when when it's more like 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.710
 winter but we never had to do 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.240
 outside or on my coffee table finally that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 it's a little bit my habits here 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 so that's why you see 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.550
 crates we are in the workshops so I 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.469
 congratulate you and a little bit of course 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 it's not great I like it because 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.340
 it's really a warehouse here 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.320
 you see all the cases that I have 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
 and cereals material and so I you 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 make profits to show you everything 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.160
 As you speak about if aluminum track 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.539
 with the small football team 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.050
 reels in his color expenses 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.960
 preferably the main stake of the game mm 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.719
 that I obviously use also due is 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.850
 sometimes 4 if I want to make big 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.729
 necklaces and were not here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.170
 I have my goal so usual I think I 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.090
 you had already presented small goal 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.820
 this one who will serve me to make a 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.020
 aluminum necklace i will show you 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.960
 our technique that what I use 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.920
 So here we will usually need 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.330
 two son 2mm here are color 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.580
 chocolate you can obviously take 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 another color it does not matter I 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.460
 will explain the technique 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.710
 obviously this is the technique whatever 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.040
 is the color so it's 2000 m on 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.400
 will drop it so here I have a son who 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.710
 is about 40 cm and the other one 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.360
 did 30 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.860
 so here I am putting both of them one 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.689
 next to each other 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.979
 So it's really important for 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.960
 masters one next to the other they stand 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.579
 do not overlap so enter spicy from 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.689
 as had already been done in a 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.600
 other video we really put it so 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.689
 they are not overlapping 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.430
 and so really side by side 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.299
 here you see very well that the son and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.610
 side by side 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.130
 he is he is tight a little one against 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.540
 the other without overlapping and I'm going 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.429
 explain why I'm doing this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.700
 exactly what the technique is there 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.520
 in 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.160
 so I'm going to take another son 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.270
 of a millimeter the same color could 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.310
 take another color if you have 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.720
 want to add more colors that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.690
 can be the same color as the pearls 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.520
 then but hey here as I do not know 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.660
 not too much what I want to do after if 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.540
 I will stay in the same ranges of 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.700
 colors or not I take son rank 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.819
 chocolate so the same color as 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.110
 the other I have more or less a meter here 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:41.560
 in hand so I'll take this son if 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.750
 and put me on the side of the necklace I 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.160
 started regardless of the little side 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.550
 does it matter whether it's the left or 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.519
 right and I'll go surrounded so 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.680
 with my smallest son I surrounded 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:58.560
 the other two should go 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.390
 to create one so I would leave here here 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.170
 so I will try not to go out the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.660
 camera 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.980
 it's a bit of a concern judge yourself 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.600
 know so here so people really roll 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.640
 it's all a full 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.190
 the technique is very recent so it's okay 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.530
 obviously stick two sons together 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.120
 the fact of putting two field necessarily 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.930
 I have a thickness that is more 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.540
 important 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.730
 eidos so also a longer hold 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.459
 important of the collar once it 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.010
 will be made it will turn on 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.510
 or maybe more to stay Malian 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.100
 but still have some 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.049
 keep telling you about the return of 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.959
 couscous with the problem with 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.519
 aluminum those who are deformed as 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.799
 and as you use it when you 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.260
 the plow the farm and therefore the savannah 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.450
 maintain a minimum 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.040
 so it's a technical fall too and 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.049
 it will allow you to be able to 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.209
 work both sides of the necklace I 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.709
 will show you next why I 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.180
 do that what is it going to give so 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.819
 for now see what it gives 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.079
 we already know it's pretty 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.840
 completely further is the one that 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.920
 when I superimposed the two 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.780
 two nets 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.030
 it intertwines and I had them very it's 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.590
 also but in another way in a 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.569
 other of my videos so do not hesitate to 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.489
 watch the other videos for 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.500
 find this technique 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.389
 I will talk about it again in 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.280
 forgetful of so do not bother yourself if 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.500
 you miss something it will come back 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.630
 in two videos the techniques that 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.520
 I use are still even if they 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.770
 are numerous 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.110
 I regularly use the same ones so 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.630
 it still comes back from time to time 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.030
 so here I do not know if you see 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.100
 what it gives here I think so 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.740
 this time still quite well despite 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.200
 my light a little bit a little bit 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.940
 dark one since we are in the workshop so 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.370
 we had put out neither in my living room 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.380
 I have a better better light 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.430
 in my living room 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.240
 and here it is here is the choker 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.530
 so I 'm going to do a second video 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.700
 so this one is not too 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.440
 long to load for some 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.810
 people who have enough computers 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.090
 slow so I'm doing the second part 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.350
 obviously to show us how I 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.229
 work the front so that's 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.400
 really the bfr of the necklace the round of 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.570
 neck that is felicien or send there it goes 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.520
 it is quite rigid 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.340
 he is very good and very well round as 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.500
 it's well rounded and so it's going to freeze 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.610
 provided a lot less so I you 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.789
 found immediately in the second 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.789
 video
