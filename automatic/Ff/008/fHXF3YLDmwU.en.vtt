00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:48.110

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.440

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:19.740

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:22.470
 flight I do not know what the matter is the board 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.340
 slender whether we have something in my village 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.410
 battery plus everything written here 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.920
 batteries died so what's the point at all 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.650
 my brain just does not digest 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.560
 slender with each click of the left button 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.090
 mouse appears near the slender and cameras 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.740
 I can’t click to be reborn but 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.960
 then you have to stop the video and 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.900
 restart 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.380
 no video passing you wait 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.410
 a little bit 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.200
 all here I restarted the game server 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.800
 now continue but already on a snowmobile 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.580
 by the way 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.410
 skim tony stark Like before all lan I went 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.500
 I'll be about andrew connects 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.020
 i will ride a snowmobile because as 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.420
 I understood nothing good from the fact that I 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.390
 I will walk on foot and it’s not snow 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.270
 will give but in principle 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.910
 from the fact that the snowmobile is also small 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:29.190
 success since I'm clumsy drivers 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.140
 crashing into everybody weapons all over 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.459
 There is no visibility here Iskin also not to change 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.690
 can not be the friend did not see will not 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.760
 complain about it before his campaign somewhere 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.760
 near our slander by the way 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.210
 I want to contact the developers of this 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.450
 regime seems to me or slender not 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.260
 shifts its place when last 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.840
 time I was in this forest sailed along the river 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.110
 the slender was in the same place and 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.830
 Now this has not changed I apologize for 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.790
 voice is a little unwell the truth in 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.790
 the river cold bathed 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:17.370
 what's the escort act regret to me 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.410
 the awkwardness of his driving fell on 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.350
 I had to leave the trees of mercy 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:29.550
 your snowmobile he got stuck 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:31.200
 walk through the woods if that 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 as bears bears i hide from 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.150
 tree tree 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:43.110
 I hope he does not know how to climb though 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:49.680
 snowman cool not snowman waving dude 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:54.120
 come on come in faster so where are you from 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:59.310
 forest in the forest took the buttons okay no no not 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.710
 interesting again blood stains still 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.770
 as I recall in a normal game 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.280
 Slender original all the time moved 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.260
 rollers of the turn he cleaned up after you or 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.420
 in the unfinished versions he flew 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.390
 so in this mode for garry's mod he 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:19.260
 just doesn't move stands in one place 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:23.360
 maybe he appears randomly but sense 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:28.350
 from this a little small sense 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.600
 so we have the end of the card yes here in 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.080
 Basically, I'm confused and even 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.320
 I do not know 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.390
 keep playing with my friend here for 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.800
 I did not find all my presence here 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:43.470
 Slender that even though I already have something 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.380
 Interesting found again our snowman 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:53.060
 he hike now he pursues us herringbone 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:57.620
 I found a Christmas tree and where you can warm up and 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.570
 again these blood stains but i found the basement 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.140
 here's a snowman site in the forest wandered and wandered 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.450
 dun kop basement went down thinking here 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.890
 there will be a dungeon there to roam from slander 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.870
 No Christmas tree here 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:16.440
 Well, I want to say probably either not very 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.480
 suitable cards for this though more 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.580
 I do not see the appropriate except how to say everything 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.730
 cellars but hit the woods too cool 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:30.440
 with shooting and battery the more complete 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:33.240
 not yet spent on the channel but 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.400
 coolness in this mode, I can not see 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.470
 there is better 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:41.700
 noted many people likes 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:45.300
 well where's the slender mode ask for my 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.380
 tediousness but I hate it's stupid 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.400
 exercise in the woods 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:55.460
 especially one dude you somehow 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.710
 we will have to share with you to be 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:03.260
 success in search I did not find it once 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:07.330
 only saw die found now 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.330
 this annoying blue light from the camera 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.780
 the campaign wo n't come to you 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.440
 as I probably won't be anyway 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:19.870
 it makes no sense to continue playing guys 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.810
 watching a video I want to warn not 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.340
 download 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.800
 mode can someone or I would 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.250
 Krivoruk or something else either on the map 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:33.880
 on the other write a percentage can 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:38.650
 put over for dislike but still in this 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.510
 map I do not see sense 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.900
 didn't see him for not hunting you 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:47.130
 stay in one place you have monthly 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.080
 blood constantly appears with you 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:56.170
 no luck character in the course of this woman 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:58.440
 Well, I wanted to say goodbye saddened we 

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.700
 I will shoot another mode spread 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:05.850
 you probably all the same 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.850
 finish goodbye
