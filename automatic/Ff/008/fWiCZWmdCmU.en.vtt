00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.040
 Congratulations. 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.040
 You are still alive. 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.860
 But before you go 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.100
 I want to play another game. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.320
 Another game? 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.400
 I want to play .. Monopoly. 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.660
 What?! 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.330
 No! 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.170
 What about Scrabble? 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.170
 Play Bogle? Do you like or Bogle? 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.820
 I want to go home! 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.960
 Forget the Bogle. What about some hungry hippos? 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.460
 Let me get out of here! 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.080
 Well, okay okay. 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.660
 But let me ask you something else ... 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.340
 How do you feel about the consequences? 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.080
 Lots and lots of consequences ... 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 How will he see his end 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.730
 Oooh! What do you do? 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 This is madness! 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.930
 I'm sorry... 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.800
 I have to shoot you to save my family. 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.500
 No no! 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.480
 M - Maybe something changed! 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.820
 Your wife may have been free and trying to contact you by phone now. 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.240
 Liberation? 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.120
 Telephone? 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.070
 Yes really! Remember the phone ?! 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.130
 The phone that you made very little effort to reach before you cut your foot! 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.920
 That's true. 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.880
 Where is the phone? 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.220
 No longer there. 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.740
 Just disappeared 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.930
 No sense at all! 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.670
 What happened to the phone? (gunshot) 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.760
 Oh ... ah ... Hoo Hawa! 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.380
 How does this happen? 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.980
 I have no idea! 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.100
 This whole scenario is totally unbelievable. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.010
 I know! 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.410
 I was sleeping under water earlier! 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.150
 How did I get out of the shock? 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.590
 Who is responsible for all this?!?!?! 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.240
 He did not die, he did not die! 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.680
 You are not dead! 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.420
 You are not dead! 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.560
 game over. 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.060
 Well now he is dead. 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
 Hey .., that man is a cancer patient
