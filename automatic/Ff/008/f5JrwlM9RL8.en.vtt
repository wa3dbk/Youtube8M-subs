no<00:03:46.209> freaking<00:03:46.540> way<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.690> would<00:03:46.840> otherwise<00:03:46.959> know

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
no freaking way I would otherwise know

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.440 
no freaking way I would otherwise know
that<00:03:47.620> some<00:03:48.400> reviewers<00:03:48.700> some<00:03:48.910> applauded<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
that some reviewers some applauded the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.210 
that some reviewers some applauded the
game<00:03:49.600> for<00:03:49.780> questions<00:03:50.110> like<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.500> Saint<00:03:50.860> adds<00:03:51.100> a

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
game for questions like the Saint adds a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.949 
game for questions like the Saint adds a
level<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.580> realism<00:03:51.970> but<00:03:52.269> I<00:03:52.360> have<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.540> opposite

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
level of realism but I have the opposite

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.990 
level of realism but I have the opposite
opinion<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.590> think<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.280> system<00:03:54.430> puts<00:03:54.760> too<00:03:54.970> much

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
opinion I think the system puts too much

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000 
opinion I think the system puts too much
stress<00:03:55.450> on<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.660> player<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.320> get<00:03:56.470> too<00:03:56.680> worried

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
stress on the player you get too worried

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.410 
stress on the player you get too worried
about<00:03:57.070> ensuring<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.820> answer<00:03:58.120> all<00:03:58.269> the

social links on the correct day to do
them<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:02.290> makes<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.500> harder<00:04:02.739> just<00:04:02.890> play

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
them and it makes it harder just play

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.110 
them and it makes it harder just play
the<00:04:03.190> game<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.430> enjoy<00:04:03.489> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120

I'm<00:04:04.540> just<00:04:04.720> not<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> big<00:04:04.930> fan<00:04:05.080> of<00:04:05.350> need<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.739> map

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
I'm just not a big fan of need to map

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.350 
I'm just not a big fan of need to map
out<00:04:06.130> my<00:04:06.160> whole<00:04:06.489> game<00:04:06.670> experience<00:04:07.150> before<00:04:07.330> I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
out my whole game experience before I

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.780 
out my whole game experience before I
even<00:04:07.450> play<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.870> game<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.350> mean<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.310> choices

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
even play the game I mean the choices

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.490 
even play the game I mean the choices
are<00:04:09.940> really<00:04:09.970> just<00:04:10.269> an<00:04:10.390> illusion<00:04:10.660> there's<00:04:11.290> only

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
are really just an illusion there's only

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.199 
are really just an illusion there's only
ever<00:04:11.650> one<00:04:11.769> right<00:04:12.250> answer<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.790> others<00:04:13.060> are

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
ever one right answer and others are

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.670 
ever one right answer and others are
wrong<00:04:13.510> answers<00:04:13.959> because<00:04:14.470> they're<00:04:14.590> either

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
wrong answers because they're either

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.920 
wrong answers because they're either
worth<00:04:14.980> less<00:04:15.190> points<00:04:15.549> or<00:04:15.670> no<00:04:15.790> points<00:04:16.090> at<00:04:16.180> all<00:04:16.299> so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
worth less points or no points at all so

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.240 
worth less points or no points at all so
basically<00:04:17.140> there's<00:04:17.380> only<00:04:17.500> one<00:04:17.680> correct<00:04:17.890> path

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
basically there's only one correct path

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.650 
basically there's only one correct path
in<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.519> game<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:18.850> any<00:04:18.970> other<00:04:19.120> path<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.479> take

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
in the game and any other path you take

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.060 
in the game and any other path you take
is<00:04:19.810> an<00:04:19.959> inferior<00:04:20.350> path<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.739> will<00:04:20.799> lead<00:04:20.859> you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
is an inferior path that will lead you

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.650 
is an inferior path that will lead you
not<00:04:21.280> being<00:04:21.489> able<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.760> see<00:04:21.880> everything<00:04:22.120> the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
not being able to see everything the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.930 
not being able to see everything the
game<00:04:22.780> has<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.140> offer<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:24.580> way<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.729> obtain

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
game has to offer and the way to obtain

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.430 
game has to offer and the way to obtain
the<00:04:25.210> true<00:04:25.390> ending<00:04:25.660> of<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.840> game<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.140> not<00:04:26.289> at

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
the true ending of the game is not at

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.580 
the true ending of the game is not at
all<00:04:26.530> obvious

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
all obvious

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
all obvious
I'm<00:04:27.620> going<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.830> give<00:04:27.949> it<00:04:28.070> away<00:04:28.160> but<00:04:28.340> you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
I'm going to give it away but you

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.950 
I'm going to give it away but you
basically<00:04:28.850> do<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.210> very<00:04:29.389> opposite<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.870> what

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
basically do the very opposite of what

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.600 
basically do the very opposite of what
the<00:04:30.110> game<00:04:30.260> is<00:04:30.410> telling<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:30.889> do<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.460> what

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
the game is telling to do and what

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.650 
the game is telling to do and what
you've<00:04:31.730> been<00:04:31.790> taught<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.419> entire

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
you've been taught to you the entire

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.689 
you've been taught to you the entire
game<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:33.320> understand<00:04:34.160> this<00:04:34.220> is<00:04:34.370> part<00:04:34.580> of<00:04:34.610> the

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
game I understand this is part of the

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:35.860 
game I understand this is part of the
fog<00:04:34.970> came<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.449> game<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.810> you're

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
fog came to the game that you're

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.000 
fog came to the game that you're
supposed<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.169> be<00:04:36.229> struggling<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.710> find<00:04:36.889> the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
supposed to be struggling to find the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.500 
supposed to be struggling to find the
right<00:04:37.160> path<00:04:37.400> even<00:04:37.760> though<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:37.880> can't<00:04:38.180> see<00:04:38.240> it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
right path even though you can't see it

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.760 
right path even though you can't see it
but<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.080> don't<00:04:39.169> think<00:04:39.440> it's<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.620> most

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
but I don't think it's the most

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.110 
but I don't think it's the most
appropriate<00:04:40.010> way<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.400> handle<00:04:40.639> something<00:04:40.940> as

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
appropriate way to handle something as

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.790 
appropriate way to handle something as
