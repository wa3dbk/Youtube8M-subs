00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.620
 suddenly and inexplicably, I discovered the reaver (= robber), 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.860
 who was suspiciously on my way 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.630
 again, I did not feel anything of the time-distortion or the special feeling of displacement, 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 I had felt when I met the Reaver (= robber) in Wilhelm's chapel 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.500
 here germinated in me, the same nameless fear, 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.199
 which I had experienced once, when Janos showed me the Reaver (= robber) for the first time 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:38.179
 I immediately felt pushed back by the blade, yet irresistible, attracted to her 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.280
 So, Raziel, here we are 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.010
 now you have no choice but to attack me 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 and I'm not as crazy as I let you believe 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.739
 we still have some things to do you knew that I was the Serafan to Janos 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.099
 you would lead, you bastard you have accompanied every one of my features 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.700
 my fate gives you pleasure it was a pleasure as long as it lasted 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.110
 I do not think Raziel Malek, this creature can not escape, 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.110
 he poses a danger to the circle of poor misguided Raziel, 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.650
 did you really think you had what it takes to change my story? 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.909
 i am the time-stream-driver i already knew all your intentions before 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.409
 you could even develop it, you silly fool 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.509
 Malek, no, call your dogs, they should be with you 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.069
 Carcasses are no good 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.520
 Lord Möbius, there are difficulties, the circle is being attacked 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.439
 consider Malek, the one here, is the real danger for us 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.660
 what are you actually breeding here, Möbius you poisoned creature, 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.870
 Did you really believe I would watch you go around? 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.270
 and everything will spoil what comes your way 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.940
 I confess, I have underestimated you so far, Möbius 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.600
 but this mistake, I will not repeat it again wrong, Raziel 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.780
 Now, Malek shut the door 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.159
 with the help of his staff, Möbius incapacitated my spiritual blade, 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.469
 disarmed me and left me only one weapon to choose from 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.010
 and yet I must confess that there is no shortage of alternatives, 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.590
 but blind rage that let me take the Reaver (= robber) 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.440
 in my anger it was as if my hand was acting of its own accord 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.840
 and now the same hand grabbed the book with relentless hardness 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.829
 and I felt a peculiar tingle, a distant feeling of longing, 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.599
 when the now useless spiritual blade tried in vain 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.239
 to entwine her physical twin
