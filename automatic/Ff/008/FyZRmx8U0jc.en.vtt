00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.050
 the signs it only remains to press 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.640
 longer on the button that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.090
 matches the players you want 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.090

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 if you press down to the symbol 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.340

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.770
 post or not if you let it press 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.780
 longer up to the red symbols 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 the screen reader will place himself in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.710
 periphery for shooter like here with 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 thomas heurtel who asks for a screen to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.850
 nico batum who can quiet shooter 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.410
 in his chair the time that the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.190
 Spanish defense include some 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.680
 thing there are many ways to use 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 a pick and roll to mark here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.549
 some possibilities on the same phase 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.260
 of play you can use 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.360
 the screen in order to create enough space 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.369
 so that the ball carrier can 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.080
 shoot if you have indoor that has 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.710
 no mittens and who knows how to shoot at 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.630
 three points 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.180
 you can pass him the ball in the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.869
 corner this clash or if you have a winger 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.640
 athletic 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.400
 you can choose the alley-hoop option 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.070
 pressing l 2 and square with 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.130
 players like gerald greenlay griffin that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 can quickly become a massacre here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.060
 other examples showing a screen 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.710
 well posed can completely destabilize 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.210
 A defense 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.890
 do not hesitate to attack the basket with 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 athletic leaders like westbrook 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.399
 or pink or here we can 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.320
 direct shooter after the screen has passed 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.659

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.590
 sandwich attack the basket or the
