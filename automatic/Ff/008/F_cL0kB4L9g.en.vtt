00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.410
 Hi everyone, beauty 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:12.150
 here is a sketchbook page at 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.130
 I 'm just going to shoot this video more 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.320
 to talk about the material I 'm 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.090
 using had some questions in the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 facebook fan page 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.779
 the material you used and how you do it 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.699
 geek 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.580
 I'm not going to tell you how to do it here. 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.649
 now with the drawing as it puts itself of this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.160
 shape but I'll show more or less 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.399
 a material I'm using now that the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 time goes by, I'll change material or 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.800
 I'm discovering other materials or two 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.760
 pens and are testing the possibility 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 to work with them then material that 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.660
 I use it first in the back of the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.100
 pentaho 05 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:11.040
 I use graphite pencil 3 b2b eu 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 I find it very dry that 4b is very soft and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.159
 much faster and can cause 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.270
 a dirt person does not work then 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:26.880
 use 3p from pintec 0 5 to 10 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.640
 to make an end 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.380
 As I said now I have almost 12 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.689
 a little more years I'm using 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.790
 to micron or know this 03 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.049
 that the contusion at the moment because the 02 already 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.240
 was starting as it was very thin 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.970
 but always alternates between 2003 04 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:57.930
 I intend to make comics in the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:02:00.840
 sofitel suzano 50 years but 03 to another 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.979
 material that I use as a marker does not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.180
 as the finale can still be this one 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.280
 aptel's brush 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.890
 and as it is called in witch or witch pm 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.010
 So there's no podium in the backpack and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.530
 nor a coop of water nor what heaven at last 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.160
 have to be careful 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.540
 I'm using this brush here to 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.270
 make black fill or 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 this one here that I do not know where to 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:39.370
 mark anyway but it's all in Japanese 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:45.310
 here I found freedom in the square of 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:50.230
 Freedom, because you use it for me, it's to do. 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.820
 the black the black line of the drawing has 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.530
 other brands have a placemark 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.120
 that I use right because it was bitter to 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.670
 make shade and lipstick good, okay, that's okay 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.270
 old man and also the expense does not have here 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:11.950
 brand but has two ends on this side 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:15.760
 here is uncertain 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:21.000
 this is the one here and here it points to a little pen 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.620
 ethnographic dances very fine with this 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.549
 which has other colors 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.170
 there are quite large but how are these 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.190
 markers are water based 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:38.470
 so they do not make very good mess 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.160
 course is with a brush stroke on top of the 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.700
 other 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.330
 then the marking and strength is 1 with 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:53.070
 I find it interesting to use 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:55.930
 players of the alcohol base that glue nÃ© 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.950
 are shades of gray three shades of gray 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.989
 cold and three shades of hot ash 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.120
 She's just alcohol, unfortunately. 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.500
 through the sheet then usually in the 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.500
 verse will be spotted 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.880
 but it is good that you have used them in 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.579
 paintings I've done here in the 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.560
 sketchbook, right? 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.030
 I make a base before with the marker and 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.139
 then makes the body 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.139
 So it's finally good to walk with 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.650
 It's cooler, right but it's very expensive then 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.169
 September wins 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.730
 the advantage of this is that o gray 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.980
 contrasts between each of the defendants is 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.430
 very big so be careful at the time 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:40.110
 to wear because it looked more like 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.940
 Of course it's a very big contrast. 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:49.630
 of a party of that role, I do not think 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:53.260
 we apply the design ok now and to do 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:05:05.340
 the colors used these three systems 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:06.970
 core sakineh which is a lap top castel use 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:12.370
 normal 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:17.919
 Why will not the layout of the 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:33.250
 pen does not have problems about this 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:44.169
 Then the red is red and I use 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:47.880
 and then I'm with him 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.880
 so it's a little bad 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:56.400
 is this to work efficiently 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:10.960
 we are here to do what is a 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:13.660
 of the few red and pink attacks 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.409
 he had no money in the store is a 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.919
 castle form 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:21.050
 I do not think any abrastur professional 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:24.729
 The difference is that I realized it's okay. 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.439
 soft they they miss much more 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.800
 segment in the paper when not step 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:33.589
 You have to force so much so I'm saying 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.259
 sometimes for testing but I prefer 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:38.959
 even the most bums that think I've 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:42.259
 I'm more accustomed to making ends of 

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:44.629
 stylus pencil here at the end I do not use the 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:52.249
 computer that can break 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:57.110
 all graphite and pencil 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:07:01.399
 using a stylus 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.009
 otherwise I do not know, I think it's so 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:07.939
 we have this here it's clean type does not use 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:10.969
 too much rubber then it was too much 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:14.059
 subject using that accumulates here 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:19.189
 graphite than here this week that is 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:20.869
 clean and active only support 0 when the 

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:23.990
 graphite but does not get away with this 

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:25.399
 mass is the rubber cover but this one 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.079
 that I got used to 

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:34.039
 whetten a few years good is this 

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:36.110
 materials I'm always asking am 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:39.979
 doing everything with camera security in 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:43.699
 hand then I hope in the near future and 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:48.499
 get a tripod maybe make a guy 

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:50.679
 example of drawing in this way here 

00:07:48.499 --> 00:07:52.939
 since some people have shown 

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:58.689
 have been curious to know how 

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:58.689
 done it good, it's alright guys
