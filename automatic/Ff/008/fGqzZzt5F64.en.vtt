00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.189 

think<00:00:53.190> about<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.750> why<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> putting<00:00:55.020> an

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
think about it why are you putting an

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
think about it why are you putting an
extra<00:00:55.350> wood<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> there<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.239> gap

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
away from me and every time I do it away

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.000 
away from me and every time I do it away
from<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.480> digs<00:02:22.720> down<00:02:22.930> too<00:02:23.200> deep<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.770> pulls

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.310 
take another little piece of bow dart
like<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.239> I'll<00:02:52.630> go<00:02:52.870> through<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.200> and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
like this and I'll go through it and

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.110 
like this and I'll go through it and
burnish<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.459> gives<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.910> nice

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
burnish it with it that gives that nice

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.020 
burnish it with it that gives that nice
gloss<00:02:55.630> look<00:02:56.080> all<00:02:56.440> natural<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.250> we'll<00:02:57.700> also

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
gloss look all natural and we'll also

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.140 
gloss look all natural and we'll also
compress<00:02:58.540> any<00:02:59.110> edges<00:02:59.680> that<00:03:00.250> are<00:03:00.310> left<00:03:00.640> upon<00:03:00.970> it

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
compress any edges that are left upon it

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.210 
compress any edges that are left upon it
right<00:03:01.330> there<00:03:01.570> now<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.080> thing<00:03:02.290> about<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.590> is

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
right there now the thing about that is

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.490 
right there now the thing about that is
you<00:03:03.730> have<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.970> do<00:03:04.090> at<00:03:04.270> least<00:03:04.480> once<00:03:04.989> maybe<00:03:05.380> twice

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
you have to do at least once maybe twice

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.160 
you have to do at least once maybe twice
a<00:03:05.920> year<00:03:06.250> or<00:03:06.580> that<00:03:06.700> compressor<00:03:07.239> will<00:03:07.360> lose<00:03:07.600> that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
a year or that compressor will lose that

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.449 
a year or that compressor will lose that
compression<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.770> don't<00:03:08.890> have<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.070> come<00:03:09.250> back

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
compression you don't have to come back

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.570 
compression you don't have to come back
and<00:03:09.700> do<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.880> again<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.920> all<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.190> ones<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.549> ever

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
and do it again but all the ones I ever

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.449 
and do it again but all the ones I ever
do<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.269> never<00:03:14.110> put<00:03:14.290> any<00:03:14.470> type<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.650> oil<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.280> it

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
do I never put any type of oil on it

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.220 
do I never put any type of oil on it
anything<00:03:15.820> else<00:03:16.209> just<00:03:16.510> because<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.080> natural

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
anything else just because the natural

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.789 
anything else just because the natural
beauty<00:03:17.739> itself<00:03:18.570> speaks<00:03:19.570> speaks<00:03:20.260> volumes

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
beauty itself speaks speaks volumes

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.160 
beauty itself speaks speaks volumes
really
