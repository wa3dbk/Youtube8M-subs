not<00:01:57.030> scratching<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.810> case<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.620> that<00:01:58.830> it's

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
not scratching the case see that it's

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.850 
not scratching the case see that it's
kind<00:01:59.160> of<00:01:59.310> fading<00:01:59.640> away<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:01.650> keep

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
kind of fading away you just keep

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:11.089 
kind of fading away you just keep
repeating<00:02:02.010> that<00:02:03.530> until<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:05.370> gone

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:21.860 

I<00:02:18.290> found<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.469> just<00:02:20.000> now<00:02:21.000> lightly<00:02:21.480> licking

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
I found that just now lightly licking

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.210 
I found that just now lightly licking
the<00:02:21.989> sugar<00:02:23.359> make<00:02:24.359> it<00:02:24.540> come<00:02:24.750> off<00:02:24.930> easier<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:29.099> it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the sugar make it come off easier and it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.170 
the sugar make it come off easier and it
gets<00:02:29.579> a<00:02:29.790> good<00:02:29.819> little<00:02:30.269> treat

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:45.070 

so<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.959> looks<00:02:36.140> like

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.140 

you
