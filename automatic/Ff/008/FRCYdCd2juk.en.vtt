a new document etc I am not sure how to

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.230 
a new document etc I am not sure how to
do<00:04:31.620> this<00:04:31.770> for<00:04:32.040> PowerPoint<00:04:32.790> right<00:04:32.940> now<00:04:33.090> because

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
do this for PowerPoint right now because

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.880 
do this for PowerPoint right now because
it's<00:04:33.420> not<00:04:33.480> there<00:04:33.840> but<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.140> assume<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.680> have<00:04:34.800> to

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890

it's not there but I assume you have to
drag<00:04:35.130> your<00:04:35.310> powerpoints<00:04:35.910> into<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.270> app<00:04:36.390> but

drag your powerpoints into the app but

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.510 
drag your powerpoints into the app but
overall<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.500> think<00:04:37.770> this<00:04:37.950> is<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.100> great<00:04:38.310> app

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
overall I think this is a great app

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.190 
overall I think this is a great app
