00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
go straight on with what I think the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.250 
go straight on with what I think the
problem<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.920> fix<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.960> won't

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
problem is and the fix and and I won't

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
be able to show it but I'll hopefully be

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
be able to show it but I'll hopefully be
able<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> working<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.640> rather<00:00:54.270> then

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
able to see it working so rather then

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
able to see it working so rather then
we're<00:00:54.570> into<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> iPhone<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.649> what<00:00:56.550> I'm<00:00:56.640> going

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
main bar doubt that I can try to do now

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.289 
main bar doubt that I can try to do now
and<00:01:02.359> then<00:01:03.359> taking<00:01:04.049> off<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.739> go

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
what are the covers this cover here on

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
what are the covers this cover here on
the<00:01:08.670> underside<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> main<00:01:09.510> board<00:01:09.979> what<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the underside of the main board what I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.270 
the underside of the main board what I
will<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> allow<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.950> audio

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
will do is allow me to get to the audio

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
will do is allow me to get to the audio
I<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.119> able<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.630> take<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> look<00:01:16.049> at

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
I see to be able to just take a look at

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.320 
I see to be able to just take a look at
it<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.009> hopefully<00:01:17.250> apply<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.759> fix<00:01:18.180> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it and then hopefully apply this fix to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
it and then hopefully apply this fix to
get<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.570> working<00:01:18.750> its<00:01:19.020> cover<00:01:19.259> off<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.740> another

get it working its cover off now another

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.840 
get it working its cover off now another
component<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.240> am<00:01:21.600> looking<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.790> one

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
component I am looking at is this one

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.320 
component I am looking at is this one
here<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.900> audio<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.259> say<00:01:26.180> well<00:01:27.180> I'm

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
here that's the audio I say well I'm

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
here that's the audio I say well I'm
what<00:01:28.140> I'm<00:01:28.259> gonna<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.770> I've<00:01:28.950> done<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
what I'm gonna do I've done this in the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.359 
what I'm gonna do I've done this in the
past<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.240> quite<00:01:30.600> some<00:01:30.930> successes<00:01:31.710> put<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
past with quite some successes put a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.080 
past with quite some successes put a
very<00:01:32.939> small<00:01:33.329> piece<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> plastic<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:35.090> there's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
very small piece of plastic on there's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.179 
very small piece of plastic on there's
going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> thickness<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
going to be the thickness of

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
going to be the thickness of
approximately<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.729> credit<00:01:39.090> card<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.750> what

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
approximately a credit card and what

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 
approximately a credit card and what
that<00:01:40.500> does<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.950> sits<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.090> put<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that does it sits on there you put the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.200 
that does it sits on there you put the
cover<00:01:42.570> back<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.950> puts<00:01:44.159> pressure<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.670> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
cover back on it puts pressure on this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.690 
cover back on it puts pressure on this
and<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.479> forces<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.470> IC<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.549> make

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and just forces the IC down to make

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.620 
and just forces the IC down to make
contacts<00:01:48.299> again<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.369> case<00:01:50.399> any<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
contacts again just in case any of the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.410 
contacts again just in case any of the
contact<00:01:52.079> isn't<00:01:52.439> working<00:01:52.829> properly<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
contact isn't working properly on the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590 
contact isn't working properly on the
solder<00:01:54.600> joints<00:01:55.130> then<00:01:56.130> I'll<00:01:56.640> put<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.180> phone

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
solder joints then I'll put the phone

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.350 
solder joints then I'll put the phone
back<00:01:58.259> together<00:01:58.799> again<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.759> tests<00:02:00.000> again

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
back together again on more tests again

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.929 
back together again on more tests again
but<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> confirm<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:02.549> anyone<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
but this just to confirm for anyone that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.600 
but this just to confirm for anyone that
might<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.180> watching<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.899> YouTube<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
might be watching on YouTube this is the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.779 
might be watching on YouTube this is the
fix<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.270> we've<00:02:06.420> used<00:02:06.689> quite<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> few<00:02:07.350> times<00:02:07.789> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
fix that we've used quite a few times it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.859 
fix that we've used quite a few times it
is<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.179> fix

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
is a fix

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.199 
is a fix
oops<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.979> found<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.430> reliable<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
oops and now we found it reliable it's

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.540 
oops and now we found it reliable it's
not

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
not

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.520 
not
permanent<00:02:13.240> effects<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.690> permanent<00:02:14.140> fix<00:02:14.320> would

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
permanent effects a permanent fix would

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.000 
permanent effects a permanent fix would
be<00:02:14.940> reball<00:02:15.940> in<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.360> icre<00:02:17.020> flowing<00:02:17.470> by<00:02:17.620> taking

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
be reball in this icre flowing by taking

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.310 
be reball in this icre flowing by taking
it<00:02:18.130> off<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.640> putting<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.600> back<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.140> some

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
it off and putting it back on with some

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.860 
it off and putting it back on with some
new<00:02:20.470> solder<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.610> quite<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.360> dangerous

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
new solder that is quite a dangerous

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.260 
new solder that is quite a dangerous
thing<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.110> do<00:02:23.350> with<00:02:24.010> sensitive<00:02:24.520> devices<00:02:24.850> like

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
thing to do with sensitive devices like

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.740 
thing to do with sensitive devices like
this<00:02:25.890> I've<00:02:26.890> done<00:02:26.950> correctly<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:28.270> be<00:02:28.420> okay

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
this I've done correctly it can be okay

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.170 
this I've done correctly it can be okay
but<00:02:29.140> still<00:02:29.380> don't<00:02:29.830> correctly<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.490> can<00:02:30.790> cause

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
but still don't correctly it can cause

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.170 
but still don't correctly it can cause
problems<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:32.710> like<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> say<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> very

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
problems so this like I say is a very

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.170 
problems so this like I say is a very
safe<00:02:34.690> hopefully<00:02:35.500> fix<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.820> yeah<00:02:36.940> we'll<00:02:37.090> see

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
safe hopefully fix but yeah we'll see

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.180 
safe hopefully fix but yeah we'll see
that<00:02:37.360> working<00:02:37.540> again<00:02:37.750> hopefully<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.740> rather

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
that working again hopefully so rather

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.850 
that working again hopefully so rather
than<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:39.670> have<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.690> material<00:02:41.650> this<00:02:41.800> is

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
than here we have the material this is

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.570 
than here we have the material this is
actually<00:02:42.340> from<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.170> expired<00:02:44.170> credit<00:02:44.410> card<00:02:44.860> it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
actually from a expired credit card it's

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.910 
actually from a expired credit card it's
just<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.940> right<00:02:46.030> thickness<00:02:46.330> really<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.080> allow

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
just the right thickness really to allow

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.600 
just the right thickness really to allow
this<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.490> be<00:02:48.580> put<00:02:48.760> down<00:02:49.290> comfortably<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.710> to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
this to be put down comfortably and to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.410 
this to be put down comfortably and to
press<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.270> IC<00:02:52.660> down<00:02:52.960> so<00:02:53.770> like<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.760> covers

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
press the IC down so like so this covers

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.790 
press the IC down so like so this covers
gonna<00:02:55.570> go<00:02:55.810> back<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.230> then<00:02:56.590> we're<00:02:56.710> gonna

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
gonna go back on then we're gonna

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.500 
gonna go back on then we're gonna
reassemble<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.490> iPhone<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.150> test<00:02:58.360> again

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
reassemble the iPhone and test again

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.510 
reassemble the iPhone and test again
okay<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.320> put<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.500> back<00:02:59.620> together<00:02:59.800> I<00:03:00.190> just

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
okay just put it back together I just

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.480 
okay just put it back together I just
need<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.910> put<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.240> cover<00:03:01.630> back<00:03:01.900> on<00:03:02.260> sim<00:03:03.190> card

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
need to put the cover back on sim card

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.430 
need to put the cover back on sim card
back<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.880> while<00:03:04.030> switch<00:03:04.270> on<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.870> hopefully

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
back in while switch on and hopefully

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.210 
back in while switch on and hopefully
we'll<00:03:05.680> get<00:03:06.460> some<00:03:06.730> soft<00:03:07.030> s
