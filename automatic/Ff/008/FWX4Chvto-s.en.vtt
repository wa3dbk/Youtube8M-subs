the<00:00:28.250> 5<00:00:28.430> lug<00:00:28.640> system<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:29.390> with<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.840> new<00:00:29.990> system

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
the 5 lug system so with the new system

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.499 
the 5 lug system so with the new system
you've<00:00:30.470> got<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.619> greater<00:00:30.980> pio<00:00:31.490> pio<00:00:31.820> or<00:00:32.029> point<00:00:32.390> of

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
you've got a greater pio pio or point of

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.600 
you've got a greater pio pio or point of
power<00:00:32.720> with<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.620> new<00:00:33.770> shoes<00:00:34.010> so<00:00:34.040> at<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.400> five

through<00:00:36.890> those<00:00:37.129> through<00:00:37.699> the<00:00:37.730> lug<00:00:38.000> system

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
through those through the lug system

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.799 
through those through the lug system
you've<00:00:39.650> got<00:00:39.830> a<00:00:39.860> extended<00:00:40.760> medial<00:00:41.270> bridge<00:00:41.480> here

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
shoe so I've got here the distance elite

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.579 
shoe so I've got here the distance elite
which<00:00:56.239> they<00:00:56.360> just<00:00:56.570> came<00:00:56.690> out<00:00:56.839> with<00:00:56.960> last<00:00:57.199> year

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
which they just came out with last year

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.500 
which they just came out with last year
which<00:00:58.129> is<00:00:58.159> still<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.640> classic<00:00:58.850> four<00:00:59.330> lug

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
which is still the classic four lug

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.310 
which is still the classic four lug
system<00:01:00.049> but<00:01:00.949> five-minute<00:01:01.670> tarsals<00:01:02.120> 5<00:01:02.809> lugs<00:01:03.140> so

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
system but five-minute tarsals 5 lugs so

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.289 
system but five-minute tarsals 5 lugs so
everything<00:01:03.860> is<00:01:04.010> starting<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.670> change<00:01:04.879> but<00:01:05.089> I

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
everything is starting to change but I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.050 
everything is starting to change but I
think<00:01:05.540> it's<00:01:05.659> changing<00:01:06.020> for<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.320> better<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:07.850> if

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
think it's changing for the better so if

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.240 
think it's changing for the better so if
