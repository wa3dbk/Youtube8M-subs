00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.950
 here we have 250 grams of strawberries that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.490
 as you see we have removed the white 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.640
 of the interior and we cut them a little 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.680
 below so they settle well in the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.070
 plate 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.460
 apart we have 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.880
 100 grams of spread cheese of the type 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.940
 philadelphia 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.940
 5 tablespoons of sugar glass 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.309
 four spoonfuls of cream 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.020
 and a cookie a cookie 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.840
 Look to the shit of the cesario 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.950
 this is going to be all to do our 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.950
 stuffed strawberries 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.960
 here on this flight we are going to take the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.379

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.189
 the part of the strawberries 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.520
 but 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.799
 and finally the cream 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.190
 Now let's mix well 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.460
 we have to make a paste 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.320
 and when we have it well mixed 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.320
 we will put it in the pastry bag 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.250

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.860

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.890

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.890

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.370

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.360
