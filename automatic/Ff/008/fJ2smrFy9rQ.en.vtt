hello guys did i'll be teaching you how

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.539 
hello guys did i'll be teaching you how
to<00:00:02.310> generate<00:00:02.790> emc<00:00:03.300> Tekkit<00:00:04.009> same<00:00:05.009> she's<00:00:05.339> very

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
to generate emc Tekkit same she's very

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.889 
to generate emc Tekkit same she's very
useful<00:00:05.850> as<00:00:05.970> most<00:00:06.180> as<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.450> know<00:00:06.660> for

useful as most as you know for

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.509 
useful as most as you know for
generating<00:00:07.230> diamonds<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:07.980> everyone<00:00:08.309> likes

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
generating diamonds and everyone likes

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.850 
generating diamonds and everyone likes
diamonds<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.389> what<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.230> greater<00:00:10.530> than<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
diamonds and what is greater than the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.830 
diamonds and what is greater than the
lazy<00:00:11.190> man's<00:00:11.519> way<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> generate<00:00:12.000> three

five relays mark threes or they can be

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
five relays mark threes or they can be

of this big and replacing our relays and
the<00:02:06.790> way<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.940> do<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.270> without<00:02:07.510> using<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.230> aid

the way to do that without using the aid
of<00:02:08.440> blocks<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:09.010> to<00:02:09.160> hold<00:02:09.369> shift<00:02:09.730> and<00:02:09.940> that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
of blocks is to hold shift and that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.940 
of blocks is to hold shift and that
allows<00:02:10.240> you<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.480> place<00:02:10.690> blocks<00:02:10.990> on<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.680> sides

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
allows you to place blocks on the sides

end of this little are stowed regular

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.270 
end of this little are stowed regular
wire<00:05:42.280> now<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.060> block<00:05:43.360> which<00:05:43.570> is<00:05:43.600> on<00:05:44.100> we<00:05:45.100> want

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
wire now the block which is on we want

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.850 
wire now the block which is on we want
to<00:05:45.340> place<00:05:45.520> a<00:05:45.760> right<00:05:46.660> on<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.870> wire<00:05:47.080> and<00:05:47.320> you<00:05:47.560> can

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
to place a right on a wire and you can

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.750 
to place a right on a wire and you can
see<00:05:48.040> that<00:05:48.280> makes<00:05:48.940> the<00:05:50.280> objective<00:05:51.280> wired<00:05:51.490> we're

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
see that makes the objective wired we're

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.240 
see that makes the objective wired we're
like<00:05:51.940> a<00:05:51.970> 90<00:05:52.300> degrees<00:05:52.510> angle<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:53.110> it<00:05:53.650> sticks

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
like a 90 degrees angle and it sticks

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.120 
like a 90 degrees angle and it sticks
sticks<00:05:55.210> for<00:05:55.960> lack<00:05:56.080> of<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.260> better<00:05:56.290> word<00:05:56.470> to<00:05:56.950> the

sticks for lack of a better word to the
red<00:05:57.340> I'll<00:05:57.520> 01<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.210> now<00:05:58.930> we<00:05:58.990> place<00:05:59.230> our<00:05:59.410> timer

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
red I'll 01 it now we place our timer

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.910 
red I'll 01 it now we place our timer
aside<00:06:01.330> like<00:06:01.480> this<00:06:01.630> and<00:06:01.840> isn't<00:06:02.080> easy<00:06:02.350> to<00:06:02.560> see<00:06:02.740> it

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920

these diamonds or keep on coming through
you<00:06:44.000> may<00:06:44.180> notice<00:06:44.570> after<00:06:44.690> a<00:06:44.840> while<00:06:44.990> at<00:06:45.170> the<00:06:45.200> the

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
you may notice after a while at the the

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.080 
you may notice after a while at the the
rate<00:06:45.950> of<00:06:45.980> diamonds<00:06:46.370> begins<00:06:46.640> to<00:06:46.760> slow<00:06:46.940> down

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
rate of diamonds begins to slow down

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.610 
rate of diamonds begins to slow down
like<00:06:47.150> this<00:06:47.420> this<00:06:47.630> is<00:06:47.720> because<00:06:47.960> of<00:06:48.050> a<00:06:48.110> backlog

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
like this this is because of a backlog

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.080 
like this this is because of a backlog
of<00:06:48.680> light<00:06:49.220> it's<00:06:49.460> not<00:06:49.610> the<00:06:49.700> fact<00:06:49.820> that<00:06:49.910> you've

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
of light it's not the fact that you've

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.580 
of light it's not the fact that you've
broken<00:06:50.420> your<00:06:50.600> machine<00:06:50.990> it's<00:06:51.170> just<00:06:51.320> the<00:06:51.410> fact

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
broken your machine it's just the fact

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.120 
broken your machine it's just the fact
that<00:06:52.660> the<00:06:53.660> light<00:06:54.140> takes<00:06:54.410> time<00:06:54.680> to<00:06:54.860> go<00:06:54.980> inside

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
that the light takes time to go inside

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.130 
that the light takes time to go inside
the<00:06:55.460> condenser<00:06:56.000> and<00:06:56.120> it<00:06:56.510> will<00:06:56.600> slow<00:06:56.780> down<00:06:56.810> it

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
the condenser and it will slow down it

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.480 
the condenser and it will slow down it
but<00:06:57.320> it's<00:06:57.410> still<00:06:57.530> a<00:06:57.590> rate<00:06:57.770> of<00:06:57.800> about<00:06:57.980> one<00:06:58.100> every

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
but it's still a rate of about one every

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.120 
but it's still a rate of about one every
