00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 at age 20, the adlers win mannheim against 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.740
 the thomas sabo ice tigers and so on 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.330
 nice good evening and warm 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.099
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 I welcome both trainers to mine 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.150
 right tray tuomie of the nürnbergern 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.830
 and to my left hans zach as always 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.780
 I pass the word to our first 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 Guest trainer would have asked for her comment 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 Please have a thank you 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.850
 Congratulations to Hans original mannheim 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 it was good balanced game of mine 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.039
 opinion and the auto clichés 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.510
 said if you can not score goals 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.520
 then you can not win a game that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.809
 was the preliminary round have to drive with us 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 If we are maybe his goal 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.020
 then it will not be 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 guess who the game is still open 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.460
 Definitely had some chances 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.379
 they could only once and then have 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
 as I said we can we can 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.950
 not the balance and ultimately then 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.760
 has won mannheim deservedly 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.440
 Thank you very much Mr. Toni Mr. Zach 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.059
 Congratulations on winning her comment to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 play please yes it was a hard one 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.799
 Contested match a great game with 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.409
 to fight fast 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.030
 that's what the spectator wants to see 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.159
 and I am satisfied with the team 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.490
 as she has always played 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 better 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 but we need patience and I anyway 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.369
 Every spectator should know that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.560
 not every press representative 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.869
 Lose game bad about not every one 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.720
 won kind only good pages 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.939
 that is you have to respect the opponent 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.299
 the against in the league are very strong 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.829
 we want to become strong and then 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.939
 it depends on the small things of who 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.390
 can prevail 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.970
 We know that and we work on it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.759
 and hats off to the team like her 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.350
 also in the pressure situation speaks 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.360
 table space or whatever 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.479
 the table space does not matter because 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.829
 For me it's just about the work of everyone 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.140
 day and then you will in the end also 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:05.380
