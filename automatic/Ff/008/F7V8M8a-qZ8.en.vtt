 ohio years and let's go in the first phase I 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.719
 I will not put it to show you the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.460
 story of the game because if you 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.450
 see if you get someone for your 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.370
 smartphone 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.570
 The game is very light, little season. 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 megas it uses your device 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.590
 and yet the game brings a lot of graphics 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 neat as you can see 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.399
 are various details in the animation and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.890
 textures are very pretty are textures 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.180
 very well defined are many phases 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.039
 for you are exploring too 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.969
 you have some power neighbors that can 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.280
 being caught for example you can 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.899
 be attacking 500 enemies 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.399
 the gameplay closely resembles the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.769
 Mario, how can you see us jump? 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 on the head and two opponents on top of them 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.460
 and we end up defeating them you have 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.200
 by the double also what is very useful was 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.180
 Only now he's going to show us it's just 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 press the jump button twice here 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.900
 the pineapple we can play it's just played 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.549
 a pine tree here we have a number 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.630
 limited but you can get 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.220
 also during the gameplay the phases they 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.509
 You have to reach the end of the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.400
 rainbow how are you with a sick 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.860
 here you have it until the end of the rainbow and 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.579
 will collect the maximum of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.630
 gold there along the way 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.189
 We got here one more little business. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.990
 first things that are invincible 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.759
 type and some things very similar to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.799
 But this one I would say is the best 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.079
 Cup is the sea ​​is one of the best 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.329
 2d platform that we have there to 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.189
 smartphone today be android 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.630
 windows phone or sick 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.790
 Look, there's only one cannon here that's cool. 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.770
 he plays people for cool front is 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.390
 I would tell you most of the games 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 which coulson copy from may to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.960
 smartphone or tv bad gameplay or 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.790
 when the quality is not bad 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.920
 graphics are not so good and we 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.600
 here at the end of the rainbow we finished 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.729
 This phase we will follow one more here 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.930
 for you to check the game has 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.369
 I always advertise for being a game 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.959
 free you may be paying up 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.319
 I want to take the advertisements but I do not 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.980
 I think we need to go, then, world 2 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.470
 in the world 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.640
 phase two do not look back only one 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.750
 little here back that has 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.840
 some coins for us is 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.129
 collecting the cool dad let's see if 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.049
 I can get it here 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.670
 this is a power but it was not just more 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.840
 some scores the podcast here more 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.310
 time 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.930
 I was not even fixing it, but we have 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.640
 time then another similarity and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.989
 with Mario then it's a game that I 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.700
 I recommend it if you want a game of 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.590
 platform what is a game really 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.360
 copy and May and this is one of 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.549
 the best options you'll have for the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.349
 your smartphone or tablet is worth it 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.849
 even you catch it and good if you 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.200
 did you like the video do not want to leave your 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.120
 I liked it very important to realize that 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.040
 Do you want more videos like this? 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.930
 games in different gaming channel 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.060
 platform and look at the game has check 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.950
 point are the phases that are longer 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.319
 Are you going to go check-in from there? 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.120
 If you die, you're still alive. 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.049
 interesting this is one more thing that 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.030
 other games 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.370
 so there is no copy of the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.900
 mario neto opa that we think it is 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.400
 always on the pitch 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.590

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.049
