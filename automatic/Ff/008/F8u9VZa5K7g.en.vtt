 Hello everyone, Yepikhin Sergey, we are 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.480
 We continue to get acquainted with unusual 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.000
 accessories from brookstone 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.699
 Thanks for this to our friends from the store 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.890
 poppies no goal we will have a review very 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.199
 unusual accessory I do not even know how 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.359
 correctly call it so 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.170
 portable laser bluetooth 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.140
 keyboard 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 so a little weird and frightening 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.810
 the wording is hidden small 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.000
 accessory intended for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 turning any flat surface into 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 keyboard for your computer 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.239
 smartphone or tablet dimensions 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.640
 brookstone virtual keyboard a little 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.680
 exceed the size of a regular matchstick 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.420
 box so wear such a thing with 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
 does not represent any problems 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 plus there is a carbine ring so 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.760
 that can be hanged on a bunch of keys or 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.890
 somewhere else 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.840
 delivery is as simple as possible 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.149
 directly device cable 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.520
 microusb for charging and accompanying 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.590
 documents know take a closer look at 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.110
 the device itself the body is made of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.119
 plastic which is partially rubberized with 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.470
 bottom and back side to work 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.720
 gadget must be located 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.270
 vertically so rubberized case 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.320
 By the way, there is no risk of any 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 push accessory 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.850
 will fall and break the front side 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.990
 display and sensor and also closed 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.909
 protective glass 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.430
 it is certainly not gorilla glass but seemingly 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.409
 also quite reliable solution here 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 same is the power button 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.740
 directly laser which has 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.810
 class 2 so that doesn't mean 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.939
 small display showing different 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.829
 system information and two sensors 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 recording movement of fingers 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.970
 owner works accessory with any 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.490
 device supporting work 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.979
 external board, install the usual 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.079
 bluetooth pair and go true layout 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 there is only one english and 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.579
 simultaneously under windows and os then 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.340
 which of course is extremely uncomfortable and is 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.740
 the main disadvantage of this product with the usual 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 keyboards and i type blindly easily 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.610
 and here this trick will not work 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.469
 because you beat your fingers on the table and 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.600
 muscle memory just doesn't work 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.860
 is it possible to work normally more quickly 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.550
 no than yes 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.190
 pressing break up surprised 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.230
 very accurate but anyway any 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.830
 the worst keyboard will be at times 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.690
 more convenient 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.150
 does such a keyboard fit 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.620
 Mobile version for the tablet is also unlikely 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.630
 Do not always have the opportunity to find 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.180
 flat surface where you could 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.220
 comfortably position the accessory tablet 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.550
 and myself there already stated work time 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.770
 makes up just a measly 4 hours 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.960
 here mobile office brookstone price 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.630
 virtual keyboard us is about 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.520
 $ 100 without taxes in Russia 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.830
 did find such an accessory free 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.080
 selling is very problematic therefore 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.690
 There is no specific price, but follow the site 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.300
 poppies shop is not all appear soon 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.580
 Of course, such an accessory is nowhere 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.220
 suitable as a full input device 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.530
 to solve work problems but as a gift 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.470
 the concept itself will fit the order 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.310
 technology is quite interesting it is only 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.020
 attempt at writing 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.810
 interesting to see what it will pour out 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.970
 in the future that's all we wanted 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.100
