00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
just to pick it up I was kind of

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.370 
just to pick it up I was kind of
hesitant<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.710> um<00:02:45.900> by<00:02:46.900> reading<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.230> back

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
hesitant because um by reading the back

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.420 
hesitant because um by reading the back
of<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.530> book<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.710> didn't<00:02:48.040> really<00:02:48.220> want<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
of the book and didn't really want to

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.320 
of the book and didn't really want to
make<00:02:48.520> me<00:02:48.580> read<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:48.960> but<00:02:49.960> I<00:02:50.880> guess<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:51.910> can't

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
make me read it but I guess you can't

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.540 
make me read it but I guess you can't
really<00:02:52.590> depend<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> what<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> back<00:02:54.400> of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
really depend on the what the back of

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.390 
really depend on the what the back of
the<00:02:54.610> book<00:02:54.760> says<00:02:55.060> until<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.690> really<00:02:55.990> read<00:02:56.170> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the book says until you really read it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.200 
the book says until you really read it
so<00:02:57.400> yeah<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:58.840> book<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.080> about<00:02:59.470> um<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.460> girl
