 temperature in the boiler that keeps it going so pool and that's why you go for it 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.429
 labor banks

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.410

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 meat from the barbecue canada the grill has 2 bodies on the two sides 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.830
 among other things, briquettes through charcoal because it is also easy to get old 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.520
 add 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.100
 2 are still under the grid 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.659
 Split brackets so you get the briquettes 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.009

 indirectly that could easily cook these their eyes as if they were heavy too 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:23.450
 is becoming 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 indirect cooking 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.530
 add the run container and it's all more with demo containers optional with us 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.650

 and under the briquette rosa darts set the system too long 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.820

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.699
 weber is that five years after the purchase all parts are still available 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:48.219

 mechanically, too many more accessories are available with the spit 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.390
 so you have much more to do with it 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.340

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.889
 want 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.750
 is that your product is poor 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.070
 so put the heat source above the briquettes to buy maintenance 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.600
 and with indirect screaming you actually make a convection oven for your barbecue 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.580
