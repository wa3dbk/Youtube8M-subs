I'm<00:00:06.390> gonna<00:00:06.600> do<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> short<00:00:07.140> clip<00:00:08.750> of<00:00:09.750> how<00:00:09.930> a<00:00:09.960> bat

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
I'm gonna do a short clip of how a bat

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.650 
I'm gonna do a short clip of how a bat
is<00:00:10.740> being<00:00:11.100> rolled<00:00:11.310> here<00:00:11.610> at<00:00:11.820> East<00:00:12.090> Coast<00:00:12.360> bat

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
is being rolled here at East Coast bat

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.950 
is being rolled here at East Coast bat
wall<00:00:13.220> gross<00:00:14.220> we<00:00:14.430> put<00:00:14.640> it<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.049> perpendicular

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
wall gross we put it in perpendicular

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:28.029 
wall gross we put it in perpendicular
somebody<00:00:18.960> married<00:00:19.259> a<00:00:19.289> flyswatter

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.010 

it's<00:00:29.039> barely<00:00:29.369> touching<00:00:30.499> set<00:00:31.499> this<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.949> zero

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
it's barely touching set this to zero

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
it's barely touching set this to zero
my<00:00:34.020> first<00:00:34.380> compression<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.340> usually<00:00:36.060> would

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
my first compression I usually would

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
my first compression I usually would
have<00:00:37.790> 30,000<00:00:42.560> hear<00:00:43.560> it<00:00:51.740> then<00:00:52.740> I<00:00:52.830> go<00:00:52.950> down

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
have 30,000 hear it then I go down

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:04.060 
have 30,000 hear it then I go down
another<00:00:53.430> 30<00:00:53.790> which<00:00:54.330> is<00:00:54.360> 60,000

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.280 

I<00:01:04.100> believe<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:04.910> back<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.780> perpendicular

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
I believe this back and perpendicular

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.390 
I believe this back and perpendicular
takes<00:01:10.540> about<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.780> hundred<00:01:12.200> thousandths<00:01:12.800> of<00:01:13.040> a

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
takes about a hundred thousandths of a

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.420 
takes about a hundred thousandths of a
compression<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:15.170> my<00:01:15.350> next<00:01:15.590> conversion<00:01:16.190> would

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
compression so my next conversion would

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.380 
compression so my next conversion would
be<00:01:16.580> another<00:01:16.850> 30<00:01:17.090> which<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.420> 90<00:01:17.930> thousands<00:01:19.390> and

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
be another 30 which is 90 thousands and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.100 
be another 30 which is 90 thousands and
I<00:01:20.480> do<00:01:20.540> that

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
I do that

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.580 
I do that
and<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.650> would<00:01:21.770> do<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.040> eight<00:01:22.220> times<00:01:23.590> all

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
and I would do that eight times all

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.070 
and I would do that eight times all
around<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:25.130> bat<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:26.360> bets<00:01:26.660> already<00:01:26.930> been

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
around the bat this bets already been

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:43.690 
around the bat this bets already been
rolled<00:01:27.230> so<00:01:39.460> then<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.640> turn<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:43.370> know<00:01:43.460> these

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
rolled so then I turn it you know these

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.680 
rolled so then I turn it you know these
bets<00:01:43.970> are<00:01:44.150> numbered<00:01:44.510> 1<00:01:45.020> 2<00:01:45.290> 3<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.010> go<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:47.570> the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
bets are numbered 1 2 3 so it go to the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.070 
bets are numbered 1 2 3 so it go to the
next<00:01:47.900> point<00:01:48.340> that's<00:01:49.340> cool

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
next point that's cool

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.150 
next point that's cool
same<00:01:51.080> thing<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.010> touching<00:01:53.890> snug<00:01:54.890> tight

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
same thing and it's touching snug tight

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.880 
same thing and it's touching snug tight
set<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.760> 0<00:01:56.030> which<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.240> what<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.600> is<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:57.020> go

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
set it to 0 which is what it is you go

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.840 
set it to 0 which is what it is you go
out<00:01:57.920> there<00:01:59.860> listen<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.950> kid<00:02:01.160> goes<00:02:01.370> back<00:02:01.640> we

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
out there listen the kid goes back we

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.750 
out there listen the kid goes back we
saw<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.180> know<00:02:02.210> with<00:02:02.510> dirty<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.740> 70,000

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.699 

do<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:08.410> I'll<00:02:09.410> do<00:02:09.560> this<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.830> about<00:02:10.010> 20<00:02:10.369> times

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
do this I'll do this is about 20 times

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.830 
do this I'll do this is about 20 times
when<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.860> hear<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.070> crackle

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.309 

another<00:02:17.770> third<00:02:18.750> well<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.840> don't<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.140> do

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
another third well you don't have to do

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.300 
another third well you don't have to do
dirty<00:02:20.620> everyone<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.670> usually<00:02:22.599> do<00:02:22.750> like<00:02:22.780> 15<00:02:23.590> 15<00:02:24.099> I

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
dirty everyone I usually do like 15 15 I

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.170 
dirty everyone I usually do like 15 15 I
just<00:02:24.489> do<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:25.140> tearing<00:02:26.140> up<00:02:26.380> them<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:27.370> know<00:02:27.940> how

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
just do a a tearing up them I know how

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.750 
just do a a tearing up them I know how
much<00:02:28.390> compression<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.010> max<00:02:30.220> will<00:02:30.489> go<00:02:30.580> down

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
much compression on the max will go down

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.330 
much compression on the max will go down
so<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:32.560> used<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.890> another<00:02:33.340> 10<00:02:33.670> another<00:02:34.180> 15<00:02:35.340> until

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
so I used to another 10 another 15 until

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.760 
so I used to another 10 another 15 until
my<00:02:36.459> max

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:03:07.770 

many<00:02:42.770> times<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:46.060> don't<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.300> do<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.600> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.930 

tension<00:03:09.040> smoke<00:03:10.040> tight<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.230> zero<00:03:13.150> again

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
tension smoke tight this is zero again

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.580 
tension smoke tight this is zero again
30<00:03:16.940> thousands<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.720> first<00:03:18.020> one

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
30 thousands on the first one

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.990 
30 thousands on the first one
no<00:03:18.769> I'm<00:03:18.890> probably<00:03:19.010> gonna<00:03:19.310> be<00:03:19.519> in<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.700> way<00:03:19.820> it

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
no I'm probably gonna be in the way it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.910 
no I'm probably gonna be in the way it
because<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.300> had<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.480> only<00:03:21.170> way<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.410> get<00:03:21.590> set<00:03:21.769> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
because I had a only way to get set the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:04:04.800 
because I had a only way to get set the
camera<00:03:22.340> up

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:15.030 

that<00:04:10.470> at<00:04:11.470> 60,000<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.910> I<00:04:13.030> believe<00:04:13.360> parallel<00:04:14.110> on

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
that at 60,000 and I believe parallel on

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:25.500 
that at 60,000 and I believe parallel on
a<00:04:15.099> flyswatter<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.800> much<00:04:24.419> might<00:04:25.419> have

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
a flyswatter not that much might have

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.220 
a flyswatter not that much might have
been<00:04:25.630> mistaken<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:26.139> think<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.410> first

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
been mistaken I think the first

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:37.560 
been mistaken I think the first
unparalleled<00:04:29.280> my<00:04:30.280> perpendicular<00:04:31.210> was<00:04:32.110> 3/4<00:04:36.570> of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
unparalleled my perpendicular was 3/4 of

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.940 
unparalleled my perpendicular was 3/4 of
pressure<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.880> one<00:04:40.120> is<00:04:40.270> 5/8<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.080> which

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
pressure and this one is 5/8 and which

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.540 
pressure and this one is 5/8 and which
is<00:04:42.070> only<00:04:42.250> honey<00:04:42.490> thousands<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:45.280> could<00:04:45.430> be

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
is only honey thousands it could be

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.940 
is only honey thousands it could be
wrong<00:04:45.729> I<00:04:46.060> got<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.389> already<00:04:46.540> down<00:04:46.960> on<00:04:46.990> my

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.360 

I<00:04:52.050> like<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.200> roll<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.560> back<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:53.770> forth<00:04:53.980> so<00:04:54.280> you

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
I like to roll it back and forth so you

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:22.440 
I like to roll it back and forth so you
can<00:04:54.460> hear<00:04:55.260> yeah<00:04:56.260> break<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:56.890> up

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:54.780 

yeah
