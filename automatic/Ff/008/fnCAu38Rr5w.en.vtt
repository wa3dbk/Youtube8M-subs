00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.550
 the german basketball 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.670
 national team has chosen for the em 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.009
 In 2015, the team from 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 national coach mickey mutapcic defeated 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.520
 in the final group match Luxembourg 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.260
 with 118 to 66 and is thus beside 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.090
 group winners Poland at the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.369
 european championship in the coming year 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.560
 there 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.070
 which at the end looked so clear 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 Slowly started the dbb team did 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.530
 difficult at first 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 aggressively to find the rhythm almost 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.750
 It took three minutes to get to Lucca 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 staiger in his 100 country match the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 scored first points 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.469
 The host could in the first 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.659
 half the time the mistakes of the German use 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.659
 and so make the game balanced 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.390
 too rarely was the favorite nice 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.850
 played out points like here through 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.920
 bike service the first one 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.710
 load capacity of the baskets tested and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.370
 thus a short phase of domination 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.370
 heralded 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.370
 Germany took off a strong 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:36.530
 Partie made again maxi glue the 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:40.960
 style and thanks to the new spain 36 too 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.000
 23 was the lead after 16 minutes 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.250
 and as if it had mutapcic in time out 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.960
 his team knew the 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.470
 Luxembourg in the last three minutes 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.850
 defended before the half-time 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.850
 to the disbelief of the German 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.530
 the hosts came up to three counters 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.450
 what about more than 1000 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.450
 spectators were celebrated frenetically 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.680
 that's half time in German 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.860
 cabin was gone a little louder 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.900
 you had to guess what in the cabin 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.400
 Happens, there is also a beautiful cabin 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.170
 We have the first half actually 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.230
 also controlled we only have at the end 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.350
 have to accept this run 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.670
 that was relatively unfavorable and that has 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.370
 Something angered me and the address 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.960
 showed effect 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.450
 After the page change, the 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.200
 dbb pick just under the boards 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.200
 dominant 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.800
 and finally hit the dice too 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:57.520
 from the outside like here by robin benzing 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:00.490
 in contrast to 51 to 40 luxembourg succeeded in 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.810
 This phase hardly anything and Germany 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.810
 could settle decisively 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.310
 built until the end of the third quarter 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.999
 the team the lead 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.999
 continuously at 79 to 51 out 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.590
 the final quarter then all around 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.049
 German 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.090
 led by daniel theis of the 13th of his 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.939
 17 points in the last ten minutes 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.689
 The team was not scored now 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.689
 to stop more 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.560
 suitable for the fiftieth country game 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.140
 bastian doreth blew up with his 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.640
 three to the 101 62 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.640
 the 100 points mark 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.000
 as johannes volkmann to the 113 to 64 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.000
 everything is already clear 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.700
 the bottom line on one at the end 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.920
 unilateral partial sets karsten tadda to 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.920
 118 to 66 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.590
 and so the conclusion is not always one 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.949
 easy em qualification 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.330
 but somehow positive if you ever 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.860
 so review the last few weeks 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.490
 can he think of the first 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.370
 That was quite a fight both 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.070
 in training as well as in the games that 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.009
 we did not play on the level 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.720
 as we all imagined 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.580
 But that is still very positive 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.110
 that we're actually fighting over this 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.690
 qualified 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.310
 if other things did not go that way 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.720
 how they should run for us or how 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.919
 we would have made that happen then 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.930
 We always fought and I thought that was 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.580
 very positive 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.729
 So I think we had a good one 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.979
 summer with the team and I think we 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.289
 We also have a good team 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.840
 understood and played very well and the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.400
 but guest from the beginning and shown me 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.380
 In any case, I'm looking forward to next 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:13.750
 year that we play the em and yes me 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.580
 I think everyone has suffered a lot 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.729
 it was a very very difficult 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.110
 situation for us 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.669
 In the end, we qualified 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.300
 I think that is crucial 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.240
 and I think so too 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.280
 rationally analyze where we are 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.650
 now start the next time and 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.930
 then I always think on a good way 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.530
 that you are fine for the next few years 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.820
 put up 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.240
 we are not at our level 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.240
 played 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.270
 as I have already said in it 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.110
 that we have a great talent though 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.450
 some players do not have 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:00.360
 nec talent and performance shown and 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:03.150
 comes from the need to run this and 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.420
 they would be better next year, too 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.420
 do
