00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.430 
first tattoo I was 15 when I got my
first<00:00:55.050> tattoo<00:00:55.679> I<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:57.089> it's<00:00:57.359> very<00:00:57.480> young<00:00:57.839> but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
first tattoo I know it's very young but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.389 
first tattoo I know it's very young but
I<00:00:59.010> did<00:00:59.579> go<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.179> adult<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:01.010> they<00:01:02.010> knew<00:01:02.249> my
