I feel as if mainstream politics is is
it's<00:00:06.660> as<00:00:06.990> if<00:00:07.170> they're<00:00:07.379> asking<00:00:07.830> us<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.849> choice

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
it's as if they're asking us the choice

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.259 
it's as if they're asking us the choice
between<00:00:09.389> bad<00:00:09.840> versus<00:00:10.349> worse<00:00:10.759> to<00:00:11.759> me<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.000> seems

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
between bad versus worse to me it seems

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.970 
between bad versus worse to me it seems
like<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.570> two<00:00:12.719> sides<00:00:12.960> are<00:00:13.139> very<00:00:13.170> very<00:00:13.620> similar

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
like the two sides are very very similar

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.240 
like the two sides are very very similar
and<00:00:15.230> I'm<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> use<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.680> example<00:00:17.039> of
