need to do is make sure that means

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.940 
need to do is make sure that means

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
that so you can see that if the timber

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.540 
that so you can see that if the timber
is<00:01:16.110> rotten<00:01:17.110> it<00:01:17.200> will<00:01:17.350> be<00:01:17.500> soft<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.100> it'll<00:01:18.340> come

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
need a small amount to fill that so

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.449 
need a small amount to fill that so
that'll<00:02:28.250> be<00:02:28.370> enough<00:02:28.640> there<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.209> expensive

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
that'll be enough there it's expensive

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.370 
that'll be enough there it's expensive
about<00:02:31.459> 20<00:02:31.760> bucks<00:02:31.910> for<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.120> little<00:02:32.300> tin<00:02:33.170> like

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
about 20 bucks for a little tin like

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.720 
about 20 bucks for a little tin like
that<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.739> you<00:02:33.800> don't<00:02:33.920> want<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.160> be<00:02:34.250> wasting<00:02:34.459> it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
that so you don't want to be wasting it

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.460 
that so you don't want to be wasting it
if<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:34.910> don't<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:37.750> keep<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.930> lid<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.140> so

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
if you don't have to keep the lid on so

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.160 
if you don't have to keep the lid on so
we<00:02:39.530> don't<00:02:39.770> get<00:02:39.950> any<00:02:40.010> rubbish<00:02:40.520> in<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.170> now

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
we don't get any rubbish in it and now

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.880 
we don't get any rubbish in it and now
the<00:02:42.230> catalyst<00:02:42.890> now<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.700> catalyst<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.330> usually

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
the catalyst now the catalyst is usually

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.420 
the catalyst now the catalyst is usually
has<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.920> die<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.910> can<00:02:47.390> see<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.840> red

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
has a die so you can see this is red

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.530 
has a die so you can see this is red
different<00:02:49.430> brands<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:49.940> different<00:02:50.330> color

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
different brands have different color

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.009 
different brands have different color
but<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.530> principle<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.100> same<00:02:52.360> how<00:02:53.360> do<00:02:53.420> a

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
but the principle is the same how do a

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.690 
but the principle is the same how do a
color<00:02:55.450> when<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.600> mix<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.959> catalyst<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.700> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
color when you mix the catalyst and the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.800 
color when you mix the catalyst and the
bulb<00:02:59.660> together<00:03:00.459> will<00:03:01.459> determine<00:03:01.880> how<00:03:02.269> rapidly

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
bulb together will determine how rapidly

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.830 
bulb together will determine how rapidly
it<00:03:03.650> sets<00:03:05.140> if<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:06.440> hot<00:03:06.650> weather<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:08.150> need<00:03:08.420> far

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
it sets if it's hot weather you need far

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.509 
it sets if it's hot weather you need far
less<00:03:08.870> catalyst<00:03:09.560> because<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.190> chemical

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
less catalyst because it's a chemical

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.300 
less catalyst because it's a chemical
reaction<00:03:10.670> in<00:03:11.630> colder<00:03:12.200> weather<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.799> need<00:03:12.980> more

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
reaction in colder weather you need more

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.900 
reaction in colder weather you need more
catalyst<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.840> get<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.290> set<00:03:15.560> see<00:03:16.549> how<00:03:16.700> that's

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
catalyst to get it to set see how that's

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.400 
catalyst to get it to set see how that's
going<00:03:17.180> pink<00:03:17.600> now<00:03:17.810> from<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.769> red<00:03:18.980> catalyst

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
going pink now from the red catalyst

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.940 
going pink now from the red catalyst
okay<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.470> that's<00:03:21.799> mixed<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.250> nicely<00:03:22.459> that's<00:03:22.880> a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
okay so that's mixed in nicely that's a

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.830 
okay so that's mixed in nicely that's a
that's<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:25.100> little<00:03:25.310> bit<00:03:25.489> darker<00:03:26.000> than<00:03:26.180> you

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
that's a little bit darker than you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.470 
that's a little bit darker than you
would<00:03:27.019> have<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.350> for<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.430> summers<00:03:28.880> David<00:03:29.329> it's

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
would have it for the summers David it's

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.199 
would have it for the summers David it's
because<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.380> temperature<00:03:30.769> today<00:03:31.209> we're

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
because of the temperature today we're

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.670 
because of the temperature today we're
putting<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.660> little<00:03:32.900> bit<00:03:33.019> more<00:03:33.200> catalyst<00:03:33.590> and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
putting a little bit more catalyst and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.220 
putting a little bit more catalyst and
we<00:03:33.799> normally<00:03:33.950> would<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.600> should<00:03:35.600> give

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
we normally would and that should give

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.039 
we normally would and that should give
us<00:03:36.350> about<00:03:36.470> 25<00:03:37.220> minutes<00:03:37.459> working<00:03:37.820> time<00:03:38.239> before

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
us about 25 minutes working time before

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.819 
us about 25 minutes working time before
that<00:03:39.230> sets<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:40.579> we<00:03:42.430> work<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.640> in<00:03:43.790> where<00:03:44.450> the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
that sets so we work it in where the

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.789 
that sets so we work it in where the
rotten<00:03:45.829> timber<00:03:46.130> was<00:03:46.359> get<00:03:47.359> it<00:03:47.480> right<00:03:48.320> down<00:03:48.590> in

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
rotten timber was get it right down in

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.630 
rotten timber was get it right down in
there<00:03:50.049> we<00:03:51.049> overfill<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.799> little<00:03:52.130> bit<00:03:52.310> because

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
there we overfill a little bit because

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
there we overfill a little bit because
as<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.209> starts<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.810> as<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:55.100> starts<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.549> set<00:03:55.910> you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
as it starts to as it starts to set you

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.000 
as it starts to as it starts to set you
can<00:03:56.840> actually<00:03:57.019> work<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:59.030> bog<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.769> shape<00:04:00.769> it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
can actually work the bog and shape it

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.789 
can actually work the bog and shape it
with<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> sharp<00:04:01.700> chisel<00:04:02.350> rather<00:04:03.350> than<00:04:03.590> having

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
with a sharp chisel rather than having

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.220 
with a sharp chisel rather than having
to<00:04:03.980> wait<00:04:04.010> for<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.670> set<00:04:04.880> rock-hard<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.750> then

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
to wait for it to set rock-hard and then

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.819 
to wait for it to set rock-hard and then
sand<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.799> all<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.510> so<00:04:08.510> by<00:04:08.959> doing<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.560> can

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
sand it all and so by doing that you can

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.400 
sand it all and so by doing that you can
cut<00:04:10.340> down<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.760> amount<00:04:10.850> of<00:04:11.209> sanding<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.260> have

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
cut down the amount of sanding you have

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.840 
cut down the amount of sanding you have
to<00:04:12.530> do<00:04:12.680> considerably<00:04:13.660> just<00:04:14.660> overfill

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
to do considerably just overfill

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
to do considerably just overfill
overfilled<00:04:16.850> slightly<00:04:18.639> it<00:04:19.639> roughly<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.840> shape

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
overfilled slightly it roughly the shape

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.170 
overfilled slightly it roughly the shape
of<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.970> timber<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.300> were<00:04:23.479> filling<00:04:24.410> and

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
of the timber that you were filling and

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.279 
of the timber that you were filling and
that'll<00:04:26.180> do<00:04:26.360> it's<00:04:26.539> a<00:04:26.600> bit<00:04:26.750> rough<00:04:27.020> and<00:04:27.139> ready

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
that'll do it's a bit rough and ready

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.860 
that'll do it's a bit rough and ready
looking<00:04:27.680> but<00:04:27.889> we'll<00:04:28.460> find<00:04:28.639> a<00:04:28.850> point<00:04:29.060> where<00:04:29.750> it

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
looking but we'll find a point where it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.140 
looking but we'll find a point where it
won't<00:04:30.020> be<00:04:30.229> rock<00:04:30.440> hard<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.580> will<00:04:31.700> be<00:04:31.849> firm

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
won't be rock hard but it will be firm

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.060 
won't be rock hard but it will be firm
enough<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.479> shave<00:04:32.840> down<00:04:33.169> with<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.470> sharp<00:04:33.770> chisel

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
enough to shave down with a sharp chisel

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.120 
enough to shave down with a sharp chisel
so<00:04:34.940> with<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.419> sharp<00:04:35.659> chisel<00:04:35.930> I'll<00:04:36.140> be<00:04:36.289> able<00:04:36.409> to

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
so with the sharp chisel I'll be able to

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.550 
so with the sharp chisel I'll be able to
shave<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.550> off<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.300> get<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.840> very<00:04:39.230> close<00:04:39.530> to

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
shave it off and get it very close to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.370 
shave it off and get it very close to
the<00:04:39.830> final<00:04:40.070> shape<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.730> thereby<00:04:41.720> minimizing

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
the final shape and thereby minimizing

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.440
