00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 so let's take a sequence and do not forget 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.850
 to click liked and if you like 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.020
 to help people spread the word. 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.300
 in another thing I did not say here I 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 I advise you to follow the three 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.019
 levels of basic course you have there 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 the flash channel is the basic 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.369
 practice an intermediate script to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 do this little game because it's a bit 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.810
 the more complex we are going to do the following is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.050
 I live here there are those who leave the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 Pieces Of The Letter P 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.109
 Then what will we do to 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.390
 correct if I want to apply animation in 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.059
 space without right clicking on the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.500
 lc to and comes with shift clip on top 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.050
 which is a double click on top of that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.489
 contour is missing here because it is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 missing a little bit more of it 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.610
 found z so I can undo 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.149
 again 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.129
 sure what happens I can do it 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.149
 following is easier to do this way 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.570
 here o 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.570
 You're going to get him out of here. 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:03.870
 group he found x I'm going to cut 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.979
 he and I will do the following I will put the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.810
 Peak again where he was 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 I'll even open a double click on it 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.049
 of a control v to stick it in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 here of the object that was grouped 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.090
 perfectly positioned with 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.979
 the same mouse pointer you can 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.290
 finish positioning now 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.780
 that object there does the same thing here 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.320
 in the album you have low of that object 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.070
 you have that other list object or 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 take the here with a double click 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.700
 here to go and select everything against the xv 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.930
 beauty ready the professional to score 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.380
 again 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.860
 ok click on the control to go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.009
 paste that object from yesterday is together 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.020
 there with the object group ok perfect done 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.719
 this correction I had left there myself 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.509
 I'll select all the letters with shift 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.610
 it's clicking on them the mayor I'm going to give 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.729
 a f 8 so that I can convert this 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.250
 object on a graphical chart call this 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.289
 perfect space graphic 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.360
 the chart will save these objects and 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.340
 selling a double click on it button 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.170
 right and distribute 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.430
 layers to have each letter one layer 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.190
 independent if you want you can 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.540
 separate and is renaming click the layer 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.310
 the sp 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.680
 the ce and is each letter line with its name 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.569
 perfect match this layer 1 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.160
 you delete the layer and spare 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.760
 send it already existed previously 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.940
 When you click, I created the chart. 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.349
 Perfect 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.790
 every letter that how I want it 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.280
 classical interpolation will have to be 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.799
 grateful f8 and will convert into graphics if 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.349
 you want is names the symbol is aline 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.760
 just to keep even his organization 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.209
 within the library not having 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.180
 need in f8 and converts each 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.670
 one of the letters a perfect graph of one 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.900
 control hyphen for you to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.340
 I just want more or less 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.290
 animation with the second comes here in 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.840
 frame 25 in series key frame for 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.209
 all of them and clicking on the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.500
 letters on the chalkboard one day you will have 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.810
 that click on the frame that I want it to 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.700
 She starts from below to start with the aek is 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.410
 this is the first law and click on 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.720
 because it is he who will change the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.120
 position and not 4 25 if you do not 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.829
 This is going to be no problem, I want it. 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.450
 Let these lyrics start here below 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.160
 so clicking here 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.569
 in the first position, remembering that 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.660
 goes upstairs because when 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.549
 inserted the keyframe in position 25 she 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.769
 It was already up there is better because 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.500
 You do not have to reposition it later. 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.180
 again this would give a big job c 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.430
 and lyrics and perfect beauty and here you 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.069
 classic interpolation to 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.959
 each of these intervals then they will 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.900
 to rise there to form 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.150
 according to the council the object against 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.380
 enter to realize but to come 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.970
 thing that is going to happen is that the animation 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.319
 There's no story she's staying at the club. 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.950
 but after that happens, people 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.200
 will stop there nothing happened 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.010
 still because nothing happened 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.169
 We'll have it here, I passed it, it's embarrassing, right? 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.700
 you will not have where you are 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.739
 is down here so could not 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.389
 happen and that has to stay here in 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.459
 The sign that signs the animation is 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.650
 happening but it's happening there 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.900
 Down, see if that's all right. 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.359
 how I changed the starting position of the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.940
 lyrics, the movie clip also changes 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.800
 beauty position she stayed there but he 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.840
 it is not running that it is not 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.210
 executed 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.300
 here he really needs 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.800
 of 25 pictures to perform I'll have here 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.550
 down the new one it will work 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.650
 right 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.720
 so I came here in the text layer that the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.510
 layer of it I will create a key frame 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.880
 here is that only insert frame in the 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.610
 layer 25 is where he graduated from 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.460
 I control and now I believe that 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.690
 It's going to work, I will not be ashamed. 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.870
 there again then let's visualize 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.880
 perfect 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.930
 it arrives and shows however that what 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.240
 it happens there it does not stop there's no stop 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.760
 he stays there he keeps my excitement 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.680
 and loop'll put a stop inside 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.740
 of the clip defend the click on top of 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.600
 space is here at the end of it you do 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.020
 can be a new layer if 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.450
 do not want to put on a 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.340
 a key frame and can be 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:23.090
 give this if not with this layer here 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.830
 Beauty actions in this last keyframe the 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.039
 right-click actions places our 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.080
 first action of our project which is 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.110
 stop remembering that I 'm working with 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.360
 the 3.0 version of the basic course 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.330
 I teach using 2.0 from there people 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.360
 do classes there using the version the guardian 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.550
 script that flash programming and 3.0 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.950
 just put a stop there beauty 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.210
 perfect nor can I go back to scene one 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.610
 Let's test this against him. 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.860
 here also and if in this initial area we 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.780
 we need to give a catch stop 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.450
 is also continuous in loop running 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.539
 with her and it's no use is nothing 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.270
 I come here and had layer do the 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.370
 same process I did there actions 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.500
 father did not put a key step if I 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.880
 put a key frame here 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.660
 he will put this action on the first 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.539
 field then stop there same thing perfect 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.610
 If you want, you can change, that's what I do. 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.289
 here left parenthesis and yesterday was in 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.810
 end when you are programming 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.490
 but I'll put it higher 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.680
 that code it so that you can 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.660
 not have as difficult a difficulty as 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.789
 great here in program 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.410
 Let's see if everything went well with our 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.360
 entry will be that and we will in 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.159
 next lesson implement a 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.380
 beginning to the game for this to us 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.340
 starting to program our game is 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.199
 Perfect 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.330
 notice that you do not have to stop it 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.900
 A hug is still going on and even the 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.900
 next class
