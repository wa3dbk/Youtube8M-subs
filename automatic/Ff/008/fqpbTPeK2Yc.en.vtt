inside<00:01:13.440> of<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:13.830> they're<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
inside of here they're going to be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.390 
inside of here they're going to be
almost<00:01:15.000> flush<00:01:15.660> with<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.620> so<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:16.950> you'll<00:01:17.160> see

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
almost flush with this so as you'll see

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.210 
almost flush with this so as you'll see
is<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.700> rubber<00:01:17.910> seal<00:01:18.650> dry<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.010> all<00:01:20.130> the

is the rubber seal dry that one all the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.130 
is the rubber seal dry that one all the
way<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.450> yourself<00:01:21.810> something

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
way back then you get yourself something

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.890 
way back then you get yourself something
small<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> stick<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.070> punch<00:01:23.400> whatever

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
small to stick in there a punch whatever

small to stick in there a punch whatever
stick<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.050> a<00:01:25.080> punch<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:26.840> then<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.020> pry

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
stick out a punch in there then you pry

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.270 
stick out a punch in there then you pry
this<00:01:28.890> set<00:01:29.190> all<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.460> back<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:32.010> reason

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
this set all the way back and the reason

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
this set all the way back and the reason
you<00:01:32.370> put<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.670> punch<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.480> as<00:01:33.960> you're

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you put this punch in is as you're

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.680 
you put this punch in is as you're
prying<00:01:34.620> this<00:01:34.860> set<00:01:35.160> back<00:01:35.370> it's<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.390> try

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
prying this set back it's going to try

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.220 
prying this set back it's going to try
to<00:01:36.750> push<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.410> set<00:01:37.740> back<00:01:38.460> towards<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.570> road

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
to push this set back towards the road

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.230 
to push this set back towards the road
you<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> holds<00:01:41.670> everything<00:01:41.910> in<00:01:42.180> place

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you do that holds everything in place

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.080 
you do that holds everything in place
and<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.850> leave<00:01:45.060> everything

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and then you just leave everything

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.320 
and then you just leave everything
jammed<00:01:45.900> in<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:47.010> this<00:01:47.370> is<00:01:47.580> today<00:01:48.030> there

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
jammed in there and this is today there

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.210 
jammed in there and this is today there
