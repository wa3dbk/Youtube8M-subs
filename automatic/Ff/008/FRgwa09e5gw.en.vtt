00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
all we just line up these two power pins

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
all we just line up these two power pins
with<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:03.930> power<00:01:04.140> pins<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
with the two power pins here on your

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
with the two power pins here on your
phone<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.790> you're<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.060> make<00:01:06.240> sure<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
those are pretty pretty nice and neat I

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100

guess<00:01:11.310> there's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> good<00:01:12.330> connection<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.930> an

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
guess there's a good connection that an

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
guess there's a good connection that an
adhesive<00:01:13.860> strip<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.939> reverse<00:01:15.210> side<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
adhesive strip on the reverse side of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.810 
adhesive strip on the reverse side of
the<00:01:15.630> charge<00:01:15.900> will<00:01:16.080> hold<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.530> place<00:01:16.820> while

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the charge will hold that in place while

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:29.120 
the charge will hold that in place while
you<00:01:18.060> replace<00:01:19.310> your<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.580> cover<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:28.130> it's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
pretty simple now you can see the actual

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.170 
pretty simple now you can see the actual
thickness<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> device<00:01:32.579> hasn't<00:01:32.939> really

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
thickness of the device hasn't really

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.510

exactly the same the back feel is a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
exactly the same the back feel is a
little<00:01:37.320> bit<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.590> filled<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.159> maybe<00:01:38.340> but

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759

the charging icon is now happened let me

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.849 
the charging icon is now happened let me
also<00:03:26.760> try<00:03:27.090> this<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.660> Galaxy<00:03:28.230> Nexus<00:03:28.260> 4

also try this this is a Galaxy Nexus 4

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.770 
also try this this is a Galaxy Nexus 4
which<00:03:29.070> is<00:03:29.100> natively<00:03:29.790> compatible<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.630> can

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
which is natively compatible so we can

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.199 
which is natively compatible so we can
also<00:03:30.900> try<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.620> again<00:03:32.400> I'm<00:03:32.760> not<00:03:32.850> sure<00:03:32.970> exactly

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
also try that again I'm not sure exactly

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.090 
also try that again I'm not sure exactly
where<00:03:33.570> on<00:03:33.720> here<00:03:33.959> we<00:03:34.079> need<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.350> place<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:34.980> we

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
where on here we need to place it but we

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.410 
where on here we need to place it but we
can<00:03:35.390> experiment<00:03:38.030> no<00:03:39.030> no<00:03:39.420> beep<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:39.900> far<00:03:41.269> maybe<00:03:42.269> a

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
can experiment no no beep so far maybe a

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.020 
can experiment no no beep so far maybe a
little<00:03:42.540> more<00:03:42.690> there<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.620> go<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.880> have

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
little more there you go so you do have

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.699 
little more there you go so you do have
to<00:03:45.120> be<00:03:45.209> careful<00:03:45.359> with<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.750> placement<00:03:45.989> if<00:03:46.350> you

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
to be careful with the placement if you

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.530 
to be careful with the placement if you
don't<00:03:46.859> get<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.070> quite<00:03:47.280> right<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:48.180> won't<00:03:48.359> hear

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
don't get it quite right you won't hear
