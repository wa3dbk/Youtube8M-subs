something will look at later when we do
some<00:00:44.850> flying<00:00:45.350> one<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> things<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.770> were

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
some flying one of the things we were

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
some flying one of the things we were
just<00:00:47.039> discussing<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.000> length<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.390> time

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
just discussing was the length of time

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.729 
just discussing was the length of time
that<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.050> fly<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.469> electric

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that you can fly with an electric

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
that you can fly with an electric
helicopter<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> IC<00:00:51.329> model<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.079> can

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
helicopter with a IC model you can

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.110 
helicopter with a IC model you can
actually<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.829> level<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.579> fuel<00:00:53.879> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
actually see the level of the fuel in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
actually see the level of the fuel in
the<00:00:54.210> fuel<00:00:54.420> tank<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> judge<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.160> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the fuel tank and you can judge when to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.279 
the fuel tank and you can judge when to
land<00:00:56.550> from<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.899> sort<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.199> thing

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
land from that with this sort of thing

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.979 
land from that with this sort of thing
you<00:00:58.949> need<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.370> run<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> timer<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.780> good

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you need to run a timer it's a good

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
you need to run a timer it's a good
practice<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.590> into<00:01:01.890> right<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.399> when

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
practice to get into right from when

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
practice to get into right from when
you're<00:01:02.730> learning<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.510> fly<00:01:03.719> set<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> timer<00:01:05.010> when

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you're learning to fly set a timer when

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
you're learning to fly set a timer when
we're<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.060> doing<00:01:06.299> hovering<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.619> where

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
we're just doing hovering you know where

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.270 
we're just doing hovering you know where
maybe<00:01:08.400> paretic<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.210> i<00:01:09.330> am<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.799> gently

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
maybe paretic as i am now or just gently

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.250 
maybe paretic as i am now or just gently
hovering<00:01:11.700> around<00:01:11.820> maybe<00:01:12.720> even<00:01:12.960> doing<00:01:13.229> a

hovering around maybe even doing a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
hovering around maybe even doing a
little<00:01:13.409> fly<00:01:13.710> around<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.250> front<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.610> us<00:01:14.760> you're

little fly around in front of us you're

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.270 
little fly around in front of us you're
not<00:01:15.540> using<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.140> energy<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.650> at<00:01:17.159> the

power as we did earlier the flight time

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
power as we did earlier the flight time
will<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.680> slightly<00:01:23.009> longer<00:01:23.310> than<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.729> we're

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
will be slightly longer than if we're

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.480 
will be slightly longer than if we're
doing<00:01:24.090> let's<00:01:24.270> say<00:01:24.390> 3d<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> suggest

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
doing let's say 3d and what I suggest

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.280 
doing let's say 3d and what I suggest
you<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.390> instructions<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.200> your

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
you do is if the instructions for your

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
you do is if the instructions for your
helicopter<00:01:28.770> don't<00:01:29.009> give<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.880> lent<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
helicopter don't give you a lent the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.719 
helicopter don't give you a lent the
time<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.960> will<00:01:31.110> fly<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.560> fly<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.340> for

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
time that it will fly for fly it for

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
time that it will fly for fly it for
half<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> time<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.590> let's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
half the time that you think so let's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
half the time that you think so let's
say<00:01:34.950> three<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.400> four<00:01:35.670> minutes<00:01:35.820> land<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
say three or four minutes land it and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
say three or four minutes land it and
then<00:01:37.409> charge<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> battery<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.820> what<00:01:38.939> you'll

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
then charge the battery and what you'll

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
then charge the battery and what you'll
see<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.570> much<00:01:39.750> capacity<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.530> put<00:01:40.740> in

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
see is how much capacity you put in

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.170 
see is how much capacity you put in
because<00:01:41.009> what<00:01:41.250> we're<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.549> interested<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
because what we're really interested in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.690 
because what we're really interested in
is<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:43.020> running<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> batteries<00:01:43.920> below<00:01:44.250> about

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is not running the batteries below about

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.969 
is not running the batteries below about
eighty<00:01:44.939> percent<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.509> their<00:01:45.630> capacity<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.860> this

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
eighty percent of their capacity so this

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.469 
eighty percent of their capacity so this
particular<00:01:47.220> helicopters<00:01:47.790> flying<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> 5

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
amp pack 5 thousand million per hour so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.590 
amp pack 5 thousand million per hour so
we<00:01:51.360> don't<00:01:51.540> want<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.810> much<00:01:52.049> below<00:01:53.390> 4500<00:01:54.390> four

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
we don't want to go much below 4500 four

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.560 
we don't want to go much below 4500 four
thousand<00:01:55.020> six<00:01:55.200> hundred<00:01:55.259> milliamps<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.420> we'd

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
thousand six hundred milliamps so we'd

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870 
thousand six hundred milliamps so we'd
fly<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.810> performing<00:01:58.409> its<00:01:58.560> charge<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.189> C<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
fly it performing its charge and C and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.249 
fly it performing its charge and C and
then<00:02:00.060> gradually<00:02:00.329> increase<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.140> probably

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
then gradually increase it and probably

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.959 
then gradually increase it and probably
within<00:02:01.530> two<00:02:01.829> or<00:02:01.860> three<00:02:01.979> flights<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.850> would

within two or three flights you would

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.999 
within two or three flights you would

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
get to the situation where you know how

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429 
get to the situation where you know how

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
towards 3d will do that with an icy

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
see what we mean they're so climb over

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.560 
see what we mean they're so climb over
you<00:03:42.160> can<00:03:42.310> see<00:03:42.400> it's<00:03:42.549> all<00:03:42.670> very<00:03:43.000> smooth<00:03:43.390> and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
you can see it's all very smooth and

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.110 
you can see it's all very smooth and
calm<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.650> head<00:03:44.829> speed<00:03:45.160> it's<00:03:45.549> very<00:03:45.850> very

calm and the head speed it's very very
consistent<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.859> can<00:03:47.980> hear<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.280> blade

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
minutes of flying around and that's

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.759 
minutes of flying around and that's
fairly<00:04:09.370> hard<00:04:09.730> 3d<00:04:10.299> if<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.019> actually<00:04:11.170> did<00:04:11.530> this

you<00:04:13.989> probably<00:04:14.230> add<00:04:14.470> another<00:04:14.500> minute<00:04:15.160> onto<00:04:15.459> the

what<00:05:03.710> I'll<00:05:03.830> do<00:05:04.009> now<00:05:04.220> is<00:05:04.250> we've<00:05:04.669> been<00:05:04.819> flying

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
what I'll do now is we've been flying

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.550 
what I'll do now is we've been flying
for<00:05:05.210> two<00:05:05.449> or<00:05:05.569> three<00:05:05.629> minutes<00:05:05.870> with<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.289> stops

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.230 
for two or three minutes with the stops
I'm<00:05:07.189> just<00:05:07.370> going<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.580> lately<00:05:07.729> I'm<00:05:07.939> going<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.150> do

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
I'm just going to lately I'm going to do

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.730 
I'm just going to lately I'm going to do
another<00:05:08.449> power<00:05:08.780> climb<00:05:09.080> out<00:05:09.259> and<00:05:09.379> you'll<00:05:09.530> see

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
another power climb out and you'll see

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.740 
another power climb out and you'll see
that<00:05:09.919> it's<00:05:10.069> much<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.280> same<00:05:10.460> as<00:05:10.789> before<00:05:11.120> hardly

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
that it's much the same as before hardly

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.360 
that it's much the same as before hardly
any<00:05:11.900> difference<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.400> three<00:05:13.400> two<00:05:13.610> one<00:05:15.159> you<00:05:16.159> can

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
any difference so three two one you can

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.950 
any difference so three two one you can
hear<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:17.000> blades<00:05:17.240> aren't<00:05:17.539> loading<00:05:17.870> up

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
hear that the blades aren't loading up

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.279 
hear that the blades aren't loading up
at<00:05:18.110> all<00:05:18.319> and<00:05:18.949> we've<00:05:19.069> already<00:05:19.250> used<00:05:19.400> probably

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
at all and we've already used probably

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.570 
at all and we've already used probably
fifty<00:05:21.289> sixty<00:05:21.620> percent<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:22.099> the<00:05:22.219> battery's

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
fifty sixty percent of the battery's

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.240 
fifty sixty percent of the battery's
capacity<00:05:22.810> so<00:05:23.810> electric<00:05:24.469> flight<00:05:24.710> really<00:05:25.099> is

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
capacity so electric flight really is

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.399 
capacity so electric flight really is
the<00:05:25.430> way<00:05:25.580> forward<00:05:25.639> for<00:05:26.090> people<00:05:26.629> that<00:05:26.840> like<00:05:27.020> a

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
the way forward for people that like a

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.770 
the way forward for people that like a
consistent<00:05:28.189> easy<00:05:28.430> setup<00:05:28.879> and<00:05:29.449> land<00:05:29.689> the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
consistent easy setup and land the

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:37.119 
consistent easy setup and land the
Machine<00:05:30.050> now<00:05:35.349> you'll<00:05:36.349> see<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.889> blades

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
Machine now you'll see that the blades

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.950 
Machine now you'll see that the blades
take<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.430> lot<00:05:37.639> longer<00:05:37.789> to<00:05:38.000> slow<00:05:38.330> down<00:05:38.569> because

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
take a lot longer to slow down because

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.089 
take a lot longer to slow down because
they're<00:05:39.139> larger<00:05:39.590> and<00:05:39.680> they've<00:05:39.770> got<00:05:39.800> more

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
they're larger and they've got more

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.280 
they're larger and they've got more
energy
