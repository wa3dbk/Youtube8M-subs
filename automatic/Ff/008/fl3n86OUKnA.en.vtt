00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.010
 the son of a fireman 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.230
 it was an afternoon in the park 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.219
 of heat in the middle of January 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.519
 where my father and I shared and July 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.219
 the ball bounced from side to side 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.859
 no time 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.599
 I sat in the shade 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.589
 under a tree without breath 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.819
 and without anyone knowing 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:24.849
 and so 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.029
 alone 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 silent 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929
 I just asked him for heaven 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.530
 that the siren does not sound 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.310
 we enjoyed the afternoon 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.340
 at the time of nap 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.400
 the heat was not spoken at all 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.550
 but just go to a party shared with dad 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.660
 with mom and the girls 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.980
 we played and king and masters 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.230
 but the siren sounded 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.560
 my father 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.350
 of that my forehead 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 and left in the race 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 like to be swallows looking for the first day 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.060
 so I stayed 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.500
 very sad 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 my key but never and of penalties 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 later 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.700
 After a while we all feel a mole of sirens 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 and we saw how people ran the catwalk 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.310
 we went like this running 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.990
 we also 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.290
 to the scene 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.940
 a boy who looked at me 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.110
 he told me 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.720
 and if I were jo 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.730
 That's when I saw it 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.710
 completely soaked 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 leaning over the young man hitting him in the chest 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.270
 wanting to resurrect him and begging him to heaven 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.420
 God would not be injured 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.880
 still being so small 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.030
 a silence of atur day 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 I did not understand all that when my father carried the dead boy in his arms 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.720
 from toronto 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.370
 all the anger 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.760
 it became a shame 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.870
 for playing the old man with such lightness 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.460
 I started to understand 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.890
 the reason for absences 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.999
 sometimes on birthdays other times at school at the family appointment 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.729
 a stormy night 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.269
 so 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.289
 so I could know 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.909
 that that siren touch could make the difference between life and death 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.569
 Now maybe I'm big 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.919
 sharing that inner flame 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.969
 and I know that God has put the firefighters inside 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.689
 over the years 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.519
 only org use is what I feel 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.499
 when someone asks me 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.729
 who what your son does 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:45.949
 libido 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.839
 and supportive 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.349
 risked by a genius 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.349
 he did not ask his name or ask his creed 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.539
 he does not care if he is very poor 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.979
 or have a lot of money 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.429
 and maybe he talked about his life 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:02.759
 The son 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.559
 my old man is a fireman 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.829
 I beg god to put me isea they love each other and chest 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.959
 he wanted can save lives 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.109
 to sweat 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.899
 it's what I want 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.039
 and when the years go by 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.319
 my son day is sincere 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.529
 with pride and joy 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.949
 my father is a light bulb 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.519
 Now I can understand it 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.969
 more clear 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.819
 lighter could not be 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.419
 it forces us 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.509
 the pain 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:37.229
 of others
