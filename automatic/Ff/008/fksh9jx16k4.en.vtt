00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 so today we talk about maneuvers 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.910
 skate separated five maneuvers to 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.910
 you 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.590
 the five separate exit 1a you imagine 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.320
 The first that came into my mind was the 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.990
 was done will in the iron bar 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.290
 leaving the flip without catching a maneuver 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.580
 street taken to the vertical that I read 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.910
 very well this new reality that is 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.160
 a lot said she's the one you bet and let's go 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.379
 see what happens right friend turning 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.120
 I do not believe it because in the 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.820
 I did not even think or imagine that I was 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.500
 on top of the mosque back then it's a 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 those believe so 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 It only ends when it ends. 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.570
 I think the output was one of the other 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.460
 memorable was to make a fake a beat 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.020
 and fit a look just as it was 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 including ending up here until the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 end of house row in backyard and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.740
 stayed there is this really was one that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.960
 It was not a becky flip slide but when it is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.250
 one that can when it goes wrong hurts 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.250
 very good when I left and I got it right 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 relieved 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.049
 When I'm working on a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.360
 a video part of a video from 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.240
 skateboarding is what we really have the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.590
 more difficult and one that comes in mind 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.549
 I worked a lot, I really liked it. 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.420
 also the way was to hit everything was the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.209
 270 new channels of beck an oil 3 medium 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.439
 it's almost 36 falling out of big fake and over there 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.479
 comes out of rain 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.759
 So it 's like the news I took to 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.439
 the body and that gives a 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.429
 show in the end was a battle and also 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.579
 many shades 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:06.039
 but when I came back it was a series of 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.840
 a more memorable feeling then this 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.650
 There he went there on the vert when he was still 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.700
 wood 270 backside ollie fake 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.700
 great thing about the law that was there the field is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.870
 It came in the head just to change I'll try. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.410
 so I got off the back of the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.540
 720 and turn 180 at the end and there's a 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.810
 fake everything fake 900 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.290
 by then it was already flowing better and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.630
 That was the way I thought it was. 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.310
 Let's see, let's see what's over. 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.130
 being the best shape for me so fake 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.130
 of the fake indy 900 in the bottle 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.030
 trying to bring one side of the district to 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.810
 the mega came in the head a flip oil 36 on the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.980
 In case it is then give mole fpeg skate and dawn 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.750
 360 with your body 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.510
 it is a much more technical work indeed 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.400
 much more difficult until 911 and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.120
 mentioned earlier that it is difficult 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.709
 more difficult than many new ones 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.540
 so let's try and let's see which one 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.549
 It was still here in the stars. 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.590
 align them all at speed and 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.599
 Technique the flip the body 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.599
 so when did it take but when did it leave? 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.440
 this is it 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.290
 the maneuvers there thinking soon see 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.260
 That's 1 to 1 but grows more is just seen if 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.549
 subscribe skate life though here already has 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.900
 more 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:05.150
 So it's today's day of five more. 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.790
 maneuvers or less so I remembered 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.980
 did not speak and did not go 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.920
 It's today's day to remember everything. 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.049
 Everyone's quiet, right, I do not want 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.910
 send friends and you guys 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.310
 beauty alright 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.310
 Enough of that, turns off crime.
