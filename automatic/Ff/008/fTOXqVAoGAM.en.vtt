00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello guys and welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.200
 video as you see I am in gta 5 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.210
 in history they are exactly at sandy 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.099
 shore where there are all these murals 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.920
 depicting all these aliens 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.500
 written because today I will show you a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.350
 another secret another mystery of this 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.150
 I really play a lot here 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.180
 interesting then I tell you right away that 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.240
 to do to see this more than anything else 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.330
 mystery you must come here at night and with 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.120
 the full moon girls to know when 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.370
 there is the full moon here on the calendar 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 lunar is basically the next moon 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.469
 full will be on 12 July 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.660
 then just do the calculations today is a lot 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.610
 I told you four days before to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.510
 who did not know one day in gta 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.879
 corresponds to 48 minutes in real life 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.800
 so guys or die the thought times 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.079
 or save the game todt times fin 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.730
 when it did not arrive precisely at 12 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.670
 July, so to speak, you have to do two 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.460
 calculations and then you have to come here precisely 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 at night and when there is a full moon 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 you will have discovered precisely if you did i 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.619
 exact calculations if you see the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.500
 full moon 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 then you must come near this one 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.439
 car here where these three are 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.540
 people 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 right now I can't do it because 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.479
 it is not yet night there is not yet the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.520
 full moon 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.040
 you must go near these three 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820
 people and hit this one on the chest 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.549
 naked 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.979
 you have to go against it until you do 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.960
 will get angry and threaten at that point 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 you move away and at this distance 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 here the character we say 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.100
 that man should pull out of the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.619
 pocket a cell phone and call someone 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.860
 boys and here the fun begins because 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.869
 will talk about a secret moon party 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.340
 full where he will go 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.579
 reach out to all his friends a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.530
 this holiday you follow this person 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.310
 for the whole duration we say of the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.049
 call 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.240
 I tried to follow it but it doesn't lead to 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.520
 no part you try the same a 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.009
 follow him maybe you have better luck e 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.250
 in practice no one knows where this party is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.960
 guys don't know if it's real or if it is 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.179
 false this thing here because many 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.740
 people in gta talk about things then 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.320
 do not carry 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.780
 no part , however, so to speak 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.090
 it's very strange because we're talking 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.550
 of aliens quan gta that as well 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.370
 you know it's all connected there's a connection 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.200
 really very particular then 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.180
 now I've told you a little bit about it 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.310
 This mystery consists, however, I want 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.280
 let him also see you guys I wanted 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.960
 take this introduction for a moment 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.510
 because then I don't have much time in 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.090
 let you see it, that is, in doing it 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.250
 see and explain it at the same time 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.040
 so thank you I leave you waiting for that 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.120
 the moon becomes complete and then the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.220
 return to you 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.140
 and here I am as you see behind the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.270
 my shoulders the moon according to my opinion 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.790
 it should be full 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.130
 I did spend exactly more than 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.780
 a week let's say about the game 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.090
 I showed him the moon that was me 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.920
 it seems that many of you are killed on Sunday 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.340
 those times I passed one 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.200
 week and now it's Tuesday the boys 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.230
 so just a moment so you too 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.210
 you know a little bit of orientation we go immediately 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.210
 here to disturb our friends 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.610
 this should have been enough 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.090
 guys we see here he is taking the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.090
 phone 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.930
 four are the year 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:58.129
 it follows there will be the auction 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.129
 then as no dry 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.120
 approached kim arrived seems 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.120
 baldini parma 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.889
 furious compiler 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:31.189
 ah yes 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.020
 to form in the head 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:01.129
 the ICANN tribal tech serious expense 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
 6 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.069
 I believe there is perfect as you have seen 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.800
 they went to annoy people 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:22.050
 when there was a full moon at night though 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.669
 the person did nothing he pulled 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.409
 outside the phone though he didn't 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.810
 no call 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.030
 so I wanted to try again and then me 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.120
 I am killed and I went on by two 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.509
 days and then I came back here to sandy 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.699
 shore to the field of lippi when they were 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.650
 six seven in the evening I think because he was there 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.650
 still the light was still sunset 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.139
 and of success what you have seen 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.349
 guys I made you feel two 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.360
 completely different calls 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:54.030
 then the pistard method again 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.830
 it works perfectly guys because 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.960
 I told you to come here at night 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.750
 when there was a full moon and all 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.229
 I stay because in the forums it says so 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.060
 I had neither tried it yet though 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.360
 as you saw it didn't work like that 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.889
 maybe it will also work as with the 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.650
 bicester method guys that is 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.539
 infallible I went to a schedule 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.729
 completely different from what 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.219
 they all said and it worked 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.639
 equally well it worked 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.740
 because we received two calls 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:28.580
 completely different so I hope 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.960
 that this video has intrigued you 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.180
 so I hope so many of you 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.650
 come here again in this field 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.330
 here at sandy shore 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.449
 try again to hear again 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.449
 maybe the call let's see if 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.889
 something happens if something changes here 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.349
 around 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.060
 if there are new special events that 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:49.860
 appear around los santos 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.240
 there must be something because all of them 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.699
 these things here 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.330
 these mini easter eggs maybe are 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.819
 only ministers and apart and maybe 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.889
 I'm not even more for an easter egg 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.630
 great and I hope I made myself understood 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.539
 let's say maybe they were put 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.849
 only here individually maybe not 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.969
 they are combined with something bigger and 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.740
 maybe so I made myself understood better and 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.319
 no kids i invite you to 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.330
