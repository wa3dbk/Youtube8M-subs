I<00:03:42.750> like<00:03:42.930> when<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.770> Sengoku<00:03:44.100> Estrella<00:03:44.610> is

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
I like when the Sengoku Estrella is

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.370 
I like when the Sengoku Estrella is
flying<00:03:44.940> towards<00:03:45.270> him<00:03:45.390> he<00:03:45.780> starts<00:03:46.050> shooting<00:03:46.320> at

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
flying towards him he starts shooting at

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.810 
flying towards him he starts shooting at
him<00:03:46.530> at<00:03:46.620> first<00:03:46.860> but<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.220> doesn't<00:03:47.520> work<00:03:47.640> so

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
him at first but that doesn't work so

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.220 
him at first but that doesn't work so
then<00:03:47.970> he<00:03:48.060> starts<00:03:48.330> shooting<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.720> boulders<00:03:49.080> so

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
then he starts shooting the boulders so

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.440 
then he starts shooting the boulders so
we<00:03:49.320> can<00:03:49.470> create<00:03:49.650> all<00:03:49.740> this<00:03:50.010> dust<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:51.120> still

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
we can create all this dust but still

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.660 
we can create all this dust but still
this<00:03:51.780> sangoku<00:03:52.350> Estrella<00:03:52.740> is<00:03:52.860> awesome<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.550> an

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
this sangoku Estrella is awesome like an

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.490 
this sangoku Estrella is awesome like an
actual<00:03:54.000> samurai<00:03:54.360> it's<00:03:54.810> using<00:03:55.140> these<00:03:55.290> two

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
swords and it's just cutting through

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.360 
swords and it's just cutting through
everything<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.960> even<00:03:58.170> manages<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:59.130> cut

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
through his beam DBZ style which was

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.100 
through his beam DBZ style which was
just<00:04:01.740> really<00:04:02.250> awesome<00:04:02.520> but<00:04:03.300> towards<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.930> end

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
just really awesome but towards the end

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.410 
just really awesome but towards the end
of<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.320> battle<00:04:04.680> like<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.250> tallgeese<00:04:05.970> ends<00:04:06.330> up

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420

getting destroyed he gets his arms cut
off<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.460> then<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:08.910> starts<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.210> try<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.450> push

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
off and then it starts to try to push

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.180

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
and then eventually the Sengoku straight

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.590 
and then eventually the Sengoku straight
has<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.040> weird<00:04:14.370> ability<00:04:14.640> where<00:04:15.270> it<00:04:15.450> just

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
has this weird ability where it just

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.210 
has this weird ability where it just
powers<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:16.080> real<00:04:16.290> quick<00:04:16.530> they<00:04:16.950> don't<00:04:17.100> really

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
powers up real quick they don't really

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.099 
powers up real quick they don't really
show<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.520> much<00:04:17.820> I'm<00:04:18.150> guessing<00:04:18.690> right<00:04:18.720> here

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109

that when he was being pushed back he
was<00:04:36.360> using<00:04:36.509> his<00:04:36.690> two<00:04:36.900> swords<00:04:37.259> to<00:04:37.410> brace

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
was using his two swords to brace

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.110 
was using his two swords to brace
himself<00:04:37.830> in<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.280> ground<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.699> don't<00:04:38.729> know<00:04:38.910> just

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
himself in the ground I don't know just

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.029 
himself in the ground I don't know just
something<00:04:39.930> about<00:04:40.020> this<00:04:40.289> battle<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.770> me<00:04:40.889> was

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
something about this battle to me was

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.620 
something about this battle to me was
just<00:04:41.220> really<00:04:41.430> entertaining<00:04:41.910> and<00:04:42.240> it<00:04:42.330> was<00:04:42.449> just

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
just really entertaining and it was just

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.779 
just really entertaining and it was just
frankly<00:04:42.990> pretty<00:04:43.199> well<00:04:43.380> animated<00:04:43.830> too<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.430> it

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
frankly pretty well animated too and it

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.850 
frankly pretty well animated too and it
just<00:04:44.970> made<00:04:45.120> me<00:04:45.270> realize<00:04:45.419> wow<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.560> beginning

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
just made me realize wow the beginning

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.350 
just made me realize wow the beginning
of<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.009> series<00:04:47.280> was<00:04:47.430> kind<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.669> slow<00:04:47.970> with<00:04:48.210> some

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
of the series was kind of slow with some

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.059 
of the series was kind of slow with some
of<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.509> battles<00:04:48.810> but<00:04:48.930> there<00:04:49.139> potentially

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
of the battles but there potentially

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.800 
of the battles but there potentially
going<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.340> get<00:04:50.550> even<00:04:50.729> crazier<00:04:51.300> as<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.539> series

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
going to get even crazier as the series

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.749 
going to get even crazier as the series
goes<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:52.139> because<00:04:52.440> they<00:04:52.560> introduced<00:04:52.979> a<00:04:53.190> lot<00:04:53.669> of

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
goes on because they introduced a lot of

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.189 
goes on because they introduced a lot of
other<00:04:54.000> characters<00:04:54.449> at<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.900> end<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.139> the

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
other characters at the end of the

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.570
