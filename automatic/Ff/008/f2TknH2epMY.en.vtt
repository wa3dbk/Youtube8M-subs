00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
I just love shooting the shotgun

hi<00:00:23.779> I'm<00:00:24.020> Gila<00:00:24.349> ash<00:00:24.590> of<00:00:24.770> LSP<00:00:25.220> shooting<00:00:25.579> school

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
hi I'm Gila ash of LSP shooting school

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.420 
hi I'm Gila ash of LSP shooting school
we're<00:00:27.169> going<00:00:27.290> to<00:00:27.349> talk<00:00:27.559> for<00:00:27.800> just<00:00:27.829> a<00:00:28.070> couple<00:00:28.219> of

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
we're going to talk for just a couple of

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.150 
we're going to talk for just a couple of
minutes<00:00:28.730> here<00:00:28.849> about<00:00:29.149> the<00:00:29.480> rabbit<00:00:29.869> target<00:00:30.320> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
minutes here about the rabbit target the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.220 
minutes here about the rabbit target the
rabbit<00:00:31.579> target<00:00:31.910> is<00:00:32.000> very<00:00:32.090> confusing<00:00:32.809> to<00:00:32.960> most

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
rabbit target is very confusing to most

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.380 
rabbit target is very confusing to most
people<00:00:33.530> simply<00:00:33.770> because<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:34.460> appears<00:00:34.969> to<00:00:35.059> be

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
people simply because it appears to be

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.529 
people simply because it appears to be
moving<00:00:35.960> about<00:00:36.649> 35<00:00:37.430> or<00:00:37.640> 40<00:00:37.879> percent<00:00:38.239> faster

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
moving about 35 or 40 percent faster

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.829 
moving about 35 or 40 percent faster
than<00:00:39.320> it<00:00:39.440> really<00:00:39.559> is<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:41.239> reason<00:00:41.539> I<00:00:41.629> say

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
than it really is and the reason I say

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.380 
than it really is and the reason I say
it<00:00:42.140> appears<00:00:42.800> to<00:00:43.039> be<00:00:43.159> moving<00:00:43.489> that<00:00:43.609> way<00:00:43.789> is<00:00:43.999> it's

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
it appears to be moving that way is it's

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.779 
it appears to be moving that way is it's

the tarmac accelerating it appears to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.440 
the tarmac accelerating it appears to
have<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:15.920> lot<00:01:16.160> of<00:01:16.280> speed<00:01:16.520> but<00:01:16.790> once<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.210> leaves

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
have a lot of speed but once it leaves

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.540 
have a lot of speed but once it leaves
the<00:01:17.720> tarmac

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
the tarmac

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.310 
the tarmac
it<00:01:19.550> begins<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.090> float<00:01:20.330> because<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:20.960> further

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
it begins to float because it's further

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.920 
it begins to float because it's further

and further and further away from the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.140 
and further and further away from the
background<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.680> it's<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.980> background<00:01:25.550> that

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
background so it's the background that

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.320 
background so it's the background that
gives<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.600> brain<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.020> illusion<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.560> speed

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
gives the brain the illusion of speed

gives the brain the illusion of speed
how<00:01:29.330> do<00:01:29.390> we<00:01:29.570> solve<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.990> problem<00:01:30.370> number<00:01:31.370> one

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
how do we solve the problem number one

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.280 
how do we solve the problem number one
slow<00:01:33.320> down<00:01:33.610> it's<00:01:34.610> not<00:01:34.880> going<00:01:35.360> as<00:01:35.600> fast<00:01:35.870> as<00:01:36.170> you

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
slow down it's not going as fast as you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.620 
slow down it's not going as fast as you
think<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.740> is<00:01:36.790> don't<00:01:37.790> move<00:01:38.000> -<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:38.330> see<00:01:38.510> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
think it is don't move - you see the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.310 
think it is don't move - you see the
target<00:01:39.640> most<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.910> time<00:01:41.180> Vicki<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.260> I

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
target most of the time Vicki and I

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.440 
target most of the time Vicki and I
would<00:01:42.590> tell<00:01:42.830> you<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.730> always<00:01:43.880> look<00:01:44.090> at<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
would tell you to always look at the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.420 
would tell you to always look at the
front<00:01:44.660> of<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.810> target<00:01:45.200> but<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.680> rabbit<00:01:45.860> we

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
front of the target but on the rabbit we

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.790 
front of the target but on the rabbit we
don't<00:01:46.610> do<00:01:46.730> that<00:01:46.880> because<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.750> bouncing<00:01:48.410> the

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
don't do that because it's bouncing the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.220 
don't do that because it's bouncing the
Front's<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.400> constant<00:01:49.970> transition<00:01:50.540> we<00:01:51.050> would

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
Front's in constant transition we would

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.460 
Front's in constant transition we would
tell<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:52.640> look<00:01:53.390> at<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.720> center<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.350> the

tell you to look at the center of the

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.070 
tell you to look at the center of the
target<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:55.010> you<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.670> make<00:01:55.970> your<00:01:56.210> eyes<00:01:56.390> focus

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
will appear to slow down it won't bounce

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.460 
will appear to slow down it won't bounce
as<00:02:03.140> much<00:02:03.380> but<00:02:04.340> you'll<00:02:04.520> get<00:02:04.760> a<00:02:04.820> true<00:02:05.300> read<00:02:05.750> for
