okay<00:00:08.069> first<00:00:08.309> thing<00:00:08.460> we're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.910> do<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.240> go

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
okay first thing we're going to do is go

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.390 
okay first thing we're going to do is go
ahead<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.750> remove<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.200> taillights<00:00:10.650> your

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
ahead and remove the taillights your

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.830 
ahead and remove the taillights your
four<00:00:11.610> screws<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.000> hold<00:00:12.179> it<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.360> place<00:00:12.480> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
four screws that hold it in place to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.110 
four screws that hold it in place to
taillight<00:00:13.710> back<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.490> remove<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.910> from<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
taillight back and remove it from the

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.510 
taillight back and remove it from the
electrical<00:00:15.509> connector<00:00:15.980> there's<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> small<00:00:17.279> tab

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
electrical connector there's a small tab

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.920 
electrical connector there's a small tab
we<00:00:17.580> have<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.820> push<00:00:17.880> down<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.539> then<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.869> can

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
we have to push down and then we can

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.810 
we have to push down and then we can
pull<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.260> apart<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.980> these<00:00:20.189> are<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.550> tight

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
pull it apart and these are really tight

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.550 
pull it apart and these are really tight
so<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.480> may<00:00:21.570> take<00:00:21.600> some<00:00:21.900> effort<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.260> pull<00:00:22.439> apart

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
so it may take some effort to pull apart

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.769 
so it may take some effort to pull apart
now<00:00:23.400> our<00:00:23.490> driver<00:00:23.730> side<00:00:23.850> has<00:00:24.210> some<00:00:24.330> extra<00:00:24.600> wires

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
now our driver side has some extra wires

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.170 
now our driver side has some extra wires
hooked<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> wire<00:00:25.769> harness<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.460> we

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
hooked up to the wire harness that we

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.570 
hooked up to the wire harness that we
can't<00:00:27.449> disconnect<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.039> can't<00:00:29.250> completely

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
can't disconnect so we can't completely

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.490 
can't disconnect so we can't completely
remove<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> taillight<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.990> we'll<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.349> that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
remove the taillight and we'll see that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.360 
remove the taillight and we'll see that
sit<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:33.469> okay<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.620> taillights<00:00:34.920> remove<00:00:35.190> we

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
sit as is okay our taillights remove we

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.799 
sit as is okay our taillights remove we
go<00:00:35.550> ahead<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.880> start<00:00:36.059> installing<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.600> wire

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
go ahead and start installing the wire

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.530 
go ahead and start installing the wire
harness<00:00:37.260> working<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> driver's<00:00:38.850> side<00:00:39.059> we'll

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
harness working on a driver's side we'll

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389 
harness working on a driver's side we'll
take<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> 4-pole<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> wire<00:00:40.559> harness<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
take the 4-pole of the wire harness and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
take the 4-pole of the wire harness and
run<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.760> through<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.969> bodywork<00:00:42.390> down<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
run it through the bodywork down to the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.630 
run it through the bodywork down to the
bottom<00:00:45.140> we'll<00:00:46.140> also<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> same<00:00:46.770> thing<00:00:47.039> with

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
