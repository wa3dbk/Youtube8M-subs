00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 credible and your diner this is not true

 nerve your face let's start with the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.570
 first story and it comes from the hand of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 Gonzalo looked the other day he was in 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.960
 a friend's house and we got into the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 chat roulette but without putting the camera 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.360
 suddenly a guy came out and started singing 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.430
 and tell us hello pretty that such and things 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 so to laugh a while we follow the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 roll and we talk the same is to say that it is 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.640
 you put in the roulette chat for 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.360
 hit a little truth after we 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.670
 asked for the face 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.860
 and we told him but instead of giving us the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.180
 name put us a link with your profile 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 so after talking to him 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.230
 for a while you will exchange the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.750
 joke we gave him to add friends without giving us 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.000
 account that the computer was in the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.350

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.620
 We started talking to him and saying 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.080
 joke then my friend has just removed 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.090
 the shirt and things like that is to say that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.240
 for a while you were heating up 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.560
 the waiter is the shirt that if you take 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.930

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.670
 a couple of hottest girls and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.110
 after ten minutes of telling 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.030
 guards enters his mother in the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.610
 room and he tells us that he has the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 facebook application on your mobile and that 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.280
 all messages are arriving 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.940
 caught or a bad fraggle rock or go 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.380
 cazadotes were there putting you 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.510
 feverish with a boy who does not 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.910
 you knew nothing and it turns out that the mother 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.310
 from the mobile I was seeing everything 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.690

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.150
 message for you I laugh in your face 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.370
 and also in that of your friend is already 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.380
 let's go with the second story and it's coming 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.260
 by the hand of Alberto LÃ³pez also 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.989
 known as mister caponata one night 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.360
 my mother put the beans to dinner and 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.570
 as my stomach was very delicate it gave me 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.310
 severe diarrhea and vomiting but that's not 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.290
 it's the worst if your mother knows you're from 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.090
 delicate stomach because it gives you those 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.880
 so weird things so you end up with 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.730
 diarrhea and vomiting asked me daily 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.459
 next when I went for catechesis I 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.980
 I shit on the road and when I got there I did not 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.350
 I thought of something else to sit down with 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.610
 the cake next to the girl that I 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.700
 I used to like I was seven 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.580
 Alberto because when you shit for the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.120
 you did not go home or you went to 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.980
 a bath or I do not know or you kill yourself but 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.810
 especially because you sat next to 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.150
 the girl that you liked Alberto starts 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.010
 to think that you do not have much of here 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.840
 I'm sorry I'm the one who tells you 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.420
 I was staring at Maxwell's face 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.690
 it's normal you're sitting on your own 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.490
 shit and I cunning I told him if you'll see if 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.980
 I just stepped on shit and did not give me time 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.080
 to clean my shoe and she believed it 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 well, what happens is that I think 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.430
 it smells pretty different if you step on a 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.190
 bit of shit so you're sitting 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.810
 about your own fucking cake so 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.790
 the girl should not have many 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.900
 lights and even if that were true if I 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.160
 I would have been the girl 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.770
 up and changed site 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.320
 quickly but as the catechist passes 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.690
 by my side he realized and made me 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.600
 drop my pants to what is 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.950
 uncovered the cake never better said and 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.849
 he gave a tremendous shame 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.560
 what disgusting alberto real uncle the 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.190
 nice the catechist made you 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.500
 get off your pants in front of everyone 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.060
 with catechists like that who does not want 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.410
 to do the communion I hope that that you 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.420
 will teach that the next time you 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.190
 streets above do not go to class and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.049
 especially do not sit on top of you 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.600
 own cake of fuck dear Alberto 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.700
 lopez and that Mr. caponata does not 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.020
 It is another to laugh in your face 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.880
 finally I will read a story of 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.620
 those that I tell you are fake and so that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.479
 you tell me about why I think 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.950
 which are fake so measure commenting 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.660
 all the putadas that are happening to him 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.250
 I am going to leave the story 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.229
 simply by emphasizing why 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.630
 I think they are facebook for me 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.889
 you understand one day I was in my house 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.410
 watching TV and as usual 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.240
 when I look at the phone and saw that it was 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.669
 calling my girlfriend responded to that 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.350
 I wish I had not done it 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.900
 She told me she was alone in her house and that 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.000
 outside you understand me I went to his house we 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.340
 We started watching TV and started the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.260
 reciprocal touches when we entered 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.450
 hungry she told me that if I did something to her 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.510
 of eating naked later we would have everything 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.340
 the sex that I would like 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.470
 that you take to your girlfriend's house 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.480

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.660
 especially if your girlfriend is hungry 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.940
 I do not know why he did not eat everything 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.320
 the salami 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.880
 and I started cooking and I told him 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.710
 missing an ingredient for the dish that 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.140
 I was doing she told me I was going to 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.180

 what gave me a terrible shame and 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.070
 I wanted to cover myself with the first thing I saw 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.199
 so I picked up a pan that had already 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.120
 used and left to rinse thinking 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.889
 it was cold I leaned on my parts and 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.500
 I ended up in the emergency room because the pan 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:34.139
 I was light ariel there were no more things in 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.940
