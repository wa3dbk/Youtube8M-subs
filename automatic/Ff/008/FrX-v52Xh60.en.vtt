00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
before I've definitely seen that body it

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.770 
before I've definitely seen that body it
looks<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.739> our<00:03:09.950> design<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:10.879> little<00:03:11.629> bit

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
looks like our design is a little bit

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.479 
looks like our design is a little bit
different<00:03:12.290> than<00:03:12.439> what<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.799> remember<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.340> don't

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
different than what I remember I don't

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.020 
different than what I remember I don't
remember<00:03:13.639> being<00:03:14.209> soul<00:03:15.280> bulky<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.790> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
remember being soul bulky like that and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.080 
remember being soul bulky like that and
such<00:03:17.269> but<00:03:17.569> I<00:03:17.599> think<00:03:17.930> realistic<00:03:19.090> realistically

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
such but I think realistic realistically

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.759 
such but I think realistic realistically
for<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.299> fighting<00:03:20.569> game<00:03:20.719> it<00:03:20.989> makes<00:03:21.409> a<00:03:21.650> little

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
for a fighting game it makes a little

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.250 
for a fighting game it makes a little
more<00:03:21.919> sense<00:03:22.069> I<00:03:22.489> suppose<00:03:23.060> for<00:03:23.419> what<00:03:24.019> she's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
more sense I suppose for what she's

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.750 
more sense I suppose for what she's
doing<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.709> wrestler<00:03:25.189> and<00:03:25.280> things<00:03:25.489> like<00:03:25.700> that

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
doing as a wrestler and things like that

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.339 
doing as a wrestler and things like that
