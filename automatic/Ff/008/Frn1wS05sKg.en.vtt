00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 at least the agreement what I want but the expression 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.700
 in the democratic charter 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.209
 of santo domingo north 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.689
 The company has set up a pilot project for 30 homes started with two 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.640
 the famous houses at low cost that has a price of 2 108 million pesos and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.640
 will be located at the entrance of which Carlos 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 the deceased are captain joseph are the construction of a textile mill 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.050
 announcing from brazil in 2007 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.620
 the installation of natural gas plants by the government 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.570
 Venezuelan 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.590
 and the construction of three power plants by investors from 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.380
 the inc 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 united states colombia than brazil 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.700
 After a trip to Italy and Spain in May of last year 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.790
 President Fernandez brought news that businessmen from both nations 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.010
 they were interested in investing in the country 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 what happened to these ads florence 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 interested wine 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.870
 one of the entrepreneurs that we contacted there 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.060
 percent for percent in digital 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.600
 because he is interested 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.680
 from the following install a vineyard 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.680
 to produce and not in the Dominican Republic 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.090
 one of the most important results of these trips ensures martínez 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.369
 is precisely to get potential investors to visit the country because 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.660
 that will allow us then I took 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.150
 a decision 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.010
 is favorable 1 martínez points out the specific case of the mother country knows you 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.010
 what in the case of Spain continuously 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.200
 he moved out new investment projects 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.420
 from the trip of the president for example we already have Spanish investment 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.770
 in an aria 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.420
 not traditional 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.670
 but even if it is the central bank statistics 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.979
 on the flow of investments according to country of origin 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.210
 it can be established that it is not possible to speak of growth in the case of 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.840
 Spain 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.900
 can see a decline after 2007 added that investments are 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.470
 recorded an atypical growth and amounted to 604 points 6 million 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.249
 Dollars 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.050
 the position in the following two years 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.660
 They fell 180 points 9 x 150 points 9 million dollars respectively 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:32.109
 to be placed in 299 points 3 million in 2010 a flow similar to 2006 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.539
 It should be noted that Spain was trapped in the crisis 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.289
 financial world during those two years 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.629
 but the president's trip was made in the middle of this crisis and the announcement of the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.549
 projects too 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.749
 eddy martínez also pondered the supposed increase in investments is 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.279
 united states winning 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.619
 the main investor in the Dominican Republic many the 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.129
 sectors 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 efele that 2004 2004 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.919
 the situation want to president Fernandez is a situation 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.669
 still difficult 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.569
 percent had to position again 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.279
 to our country as a stable country and that really had an effect 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.229
 is positive 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.009
 the optimism of martínez contradictions and numbers that is not 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.079
 here a reduction 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:28.409
 53 points 6 percent of investments in the United States between 2006 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.899
 and 2010 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:35.219
 after so many trips 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:38.319
 four of the 25 projects that 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.009
 a scientific witness 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:45.889
 the petrocaribe agreement through which venezuela finances long-term 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.349
 the sale to the country of 50 thousand barrels per day of oil at a low rate of 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.329
 interest 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.309
 a donation from the government of taiwan for 50 million dollars for the 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:04:00.180
 cybernetic park the establishment of flights from chile towards the kingdom 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.520
 joined the beginning of the process of modernization of television 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.429
 according to a decree of the executive 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:12.699
 in front of this balance it is necessary to ask are the trips of the president the best 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:17.749
 alternative to attract foreign investment as of 10 of the 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:21.139
 President's trips we can say that the measurements 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.319
 of millions of dollars have been received in the country 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.279
 they are important figures 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.080
 peres happened in time 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.080
 I will see that even after 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.240
 of the president 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.490
 per cent not to be occupying your position 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.809
 we will see the results of those trips 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.509
 in question the tinell pact 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:48.240
 in 2006 for example Fernandez traveled to the Asian continent with a delegation 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.039
 composed of 45 people 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.300
 a press report from that time indicates that only the trip to Taiwan 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.030
 one of the four countries visited 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.920
 it had cost three million pesos in air transport but this is a sum 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.140
 calculated from the fare in economy class where they did not travel 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.600
 president the first lady and the ministers the cost of the passage was 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.990
 triple in first class analysts also criticize the economic burden 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.140
 that these trips represent for the country
