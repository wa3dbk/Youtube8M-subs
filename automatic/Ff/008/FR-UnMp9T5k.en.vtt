00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.950
 wait 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.940
 there is 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.380
 already when they are downloaded, it does not weigh 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:59.030
 mega the image they have to 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:02.510

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.950
 but they go to the desk or where they have 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.950
 saved the steps of the writer 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.580
 wait now when you have it in the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.610

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.430
 as it sounds it is h 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.240
 r is the banna you change after they go to 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.170

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.480
 point minecraft and come to pink and in 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.970
 where I did minecraft they will click 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.410
 right to open with winrar file 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.540
 archive 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.380
 and here wait for them to open up what 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.380
 it's the world 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.940
 let's hope 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.770
 there are many tutorials on this 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:07.970
 but what nothing else explain in the 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:12.120
 videos that I've seen is that 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.940
 this nothing else explain what 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.930
 it happens in the image here and they do not explain what 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.959
 which is the other part for them to grasp 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.829
 good they go love when they are opened 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.519
 they join master as well and you have to look for the 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:32.269
 who says to throw you give suppress or give 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.639
 right click and delete here wait and 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.079
 already when they are eliminated they will pass what 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:41.450
 it is the image here and they will give it in accept 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.880
 later they will be the wild card and they will 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.050
 bean 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.110
 they go 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.280
 options 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.050
 options 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.560
 and they are going to open this document of 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.620
 text in which they will look where it says 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.040
 where you say skin and here it will appear 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.810
 that thus default something like this is going to 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.030
 appear what you have to do 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:12.319
 is to put char png as it is here in 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.560
 where he says skin and they give him in guard 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.229
 and they will have what is their corner 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.519
