00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
showing that she's pregnant versus I say

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.810 
showing that she's pregnant versus I say
Sarah<00:00:17.740> or<00:00:18.359> Sheila<00:00:19.359> Ward<00:00:20.109> well<00:00:20.980> no<00:00:21.220> Gina<00:00:21.490> showed

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
Sarah or Sheila Ward well no Gina showed

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.040 
Sarah or Sheila Ward well no Gina showed
a<00:00:21.850> little<00:00:22.689> bit<00:00:22.930> but<00:00:23.230> was<00:00:23.640> pretty<00:00:24.640> darn<00:00:25.359> docile

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
a little bit but was pretty darn docile

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.339 
a little bit but was pretty darn docile
um<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.730> Coco<00:00:28.150> here<00:00:28.449> has<00:00:28.750> shown<00:00:29.080> the<00:00:29.199> most

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
um but Coco here has shown the most

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.499 
um but Coco here has shown the most
signs<00:00:29.710> out<00:00:30.039> of<00:00:30.160> all<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.429> hamsters<00:00:30.880> so<00:00:31.300> it's<00:00:31.449> a

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
signs out of all the hamsters so it's a

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.630 
signs out of all the hamsters so it's a
little<00:00:31.720> more<00:00:31.869> obvious<00:00:32.050> uh<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:34.480> one<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:36.460> see

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
little more obvious uh for one you see

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.460 
little more obvious uh for one you see
that<00:00:36.820> giant<00:00:37.060> nest<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:39.010> is<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.310> giant<00:00:39.730> nest

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
that giant nest that is a giant nest

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.830 
that giant nest that is a giant nest
reason<00:00:41.470> why<00:00:41.650> I<00:00:42.010> know<00:00:42.130> it's<00:00:42.430> a<00:00:42.490> giant<00:00:42.790> nest<00:00:43.120> is

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
reason why I know it's a giant nest is

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.100 
reason why I know it's a giant nest is
because<00:00:44.290> she<00:00:44.440> normally<00:00:44.770> sleeps<00:00:45.040> in<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.310> nest

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
because she normally sleeps in the nest

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.990 
because she normally sleeps in the nest
that's<00:00:47.110> about<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.800> size<00:00:48.010> of<00:00:48.340> zazzles<00:00:48.880> right

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
that's about the size of zazzles right

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.410 
that's about the size of zazzles right
there

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
there

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.710 
there
where's<00:00:49.690> just<00:00:50.080> enough<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.830> kind<00:00:51.040> of<00:00:51.160> bury<00:00:52.060> into

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
where's just enough to kind of bury into

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.830 
where's just enough to kind of bury into
but<00:00:53.080> not<00:00:53.740> quite<00:00:54.600> large

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
but not quite large

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.940 
but not quite large
just<00:00:56.380> enough<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.800> bury<00:00:57.070> into<00:00:58.350> instead<00:00:59.350> she<00:00:59.680> has

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
just enough to bury into instead she has

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.140 
just enough to bury into instead she has
a<00:01:00.310> nest<00:01:01.000> that's<00:01:01.330> kind<00:01:01.630> of<00:01:01.660> like<00:01:01.810> Sheila's

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
a nest that's kind of like Sheila's

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.490 
a nest that's kind of like Sheila's
obviously<00:01:04.150> Sheila<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.570> not<00:01:04.780> pregnant<00:01:05.019> she's

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
obviously Sheila is not pregnant she's

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.980 
obviously Sheila is not pregnant she's
just<00:01:05.800> naturally<00:01:06.070> done<00:01:06.550> this<00:01:06.760> most<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.870> her

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
just naturally done this most of her

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.020 
just naturally done this most of her
life<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.470> made<00:01:08.650> giant<00:01:08.920> nests<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:12.610> is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
life is made giant nests and so that is

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.940 
life is made giant nests and so that is
one<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.450> pregnancy<00:01:14.020> signs<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> fact

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
one of the pregnancy signs is the fact

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.260 
one of the pregnancy signs is the fact
that<00:01:15.070> her<00:01:16.000> behavior<00:01:16.240> in<00:01:16.990> sleeping<00:01:17.800> has

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
that her behavior in sleeping has

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.610 
that her behavior in sleeping has
changed<00:01:19.270> when<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.570> comes<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:20.050> comfort<00:01:20.500> and

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
changed when it comes to comfort and

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.220 
changed when it comes to comfort and
sleeping<00:01:21.070> where<00:01:21.940> she<00:01:22.390> made<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.570> giant<00:01:23.020> nest

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
sleeping where she made a giant nest

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.600 
sleeping where she made a giant nest
versus<00:01:23.740> small<00:01:24.550> nest<00:01:25.080> also<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.280> see<00:01:27.490> right

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
versus small nest also you can see right

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.800 
versus small nest also you can see right
here<00:01:28.530> she's<00:01:29.530> storing<00:01:29.950> her<00:01:30.220> food<00:01:30.520> in<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.880> kind<00:01:31.690> of

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
here she's storing her food in a kind of

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.560 
here she's storing her food in a kind of
odd<00:01:32.050> place<00:01:32.500> which<00:01:33.400> normally<00:01:34.090> it's<00:01:34.270> kind<00:01:34.480> of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
odd place which normally it's kind of

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.090 
odd place which normally it's kind of
scattered<00:01:34.990> throughout<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.440> whole<00:01:35.560> place<00:01:35.710> but

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
scattered throughout the whole place but

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.880 
scattered throughout the whole place but
instead<00:01:36.190> she's<00:01:36.610> actually<00:01:37.230> keeping<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.560> one

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
instead she's actually keeping it in one

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.270 
instead she's actually keeping it in one
place<00:01:39.840> versus<00:01:40.840> scattering<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:41.920> throughout

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
place versus scattering it throughout

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
place versus scattering it throughout
the<00:01:43.030> entire<00:01:43.440> cage<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:45.190> can<00:01:45.340> also<00:01:45.490> see

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
the entire cage and you can also see

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.420 
the entire cage and you can also see
right<00:01:46.420> here<00:01:46.630> she<00:01:46.930> took<00:01:47.680> all<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.070> bedding<00:01:48.280> that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
right here she took all the bedding that

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.080 
right here she took all the bedding that
was<00:01:48.700> there<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.120> brought<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:49.960> over<00:01:50.080> there

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
was there and brought it over there

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.700 
was there and brought it over there
also<00:01:52.680> you'll<00:01:53.680> notice<00:01:53.979> that<00:01:55.409> she'll<00:01:56.409> stay<00:01:56.680> in

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
also you'll notice that she'll stay in

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.660 
also you'll notice that she'll stay in
her<00:01:57.010> nest<00:01:57.780> most<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.020> time<00:01:59.520> except<00:02:00.520> maybe

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
her nest most of the time except maybe

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.660 
her nest most of the time except maybe
to<00:02:00.880> drink<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.510> maybe<00:02:02.320> run<00:02:03.040> on<00:02:03.190> her<00:02:03.370> wheel<00:02:03.549> a

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
to drink and maybe run on her wheel a

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.920 
to drink and maybe run on her wheel a
few<00:02:03.940> times<00:02:04.409> or<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:06.159> gather<00:02:06.460> food<00:02:06.850> for<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.750> most

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
few times or to gather food for the most

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.870 
few times or to gather food for the most
part<00:02:08.140> you'll<00:02:08.259> notice<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.679> she<00:02:08.920> sleeps<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.580> lot

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
part you'll notice that she sleeps a lot

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.370 
part you'll notice that she sleeps a lot
and<00:02:11.350> KOCO<00:02:12.350> has<00:02:12.380> been<00:02:12.770> sleeping<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.250> lot<00:02:14.380> hasn't

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
and KOCO has been sleeping a lot hasn't

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.220 
and KOCO has been sleeping a lot hasn't
really<00:02:15.770> been<00:02:15.920> as<00:02:16.270> interested<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.360> running<00:02:18.110> in

really been as interested in running in

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.080 
really been as interested in running in
her<00:02:18.380> wheel<00:02:18.560> though<00:02:18.800> obviously<00:02:19.130> sometimes<00:02:19.760> she

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
her wheel though obviously sometimes she

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.270 
her wheel though obviously sometimes she
does<00:02:20.830> um

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
does um

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.180
