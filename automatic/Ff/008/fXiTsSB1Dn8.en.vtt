this does not include did this and this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.460 
this does not include did this and this
is<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.480> fix<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:24.930> we're<00:02:25.050> not<00:02:25.140> gonna<00:02:25.230> be<00:02:25.350> using

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
is the fix but we're not gonna be using

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.750 
is the fix but we're not gonna be using
that<00:02:25.620> we're<00:02:25.740> gonna<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.920> using<00:02:25.980> modloader<00:02:26.460> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
that we're gonna be using modloader and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640 
that we're gonna be using modloader and
the<00:02:26.850> dragon<00:02:27.030> mount<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.140> messes<00:02:28.260> up<00:02:28.500> we

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
the dragon mount so if it messes up we

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
the dragon mount so if it messes up we
will<00:02:28.770> use<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.160> modloader<00:02:29.580> fix<00:02:29.970> hopefully<00:02:30.750> we

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
will use the modloader fix hopefully we

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
will use the modloader fix hopefully we
won't<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.200> problem<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.760> couldn't<00:02:33.030> close
