00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:11.246
Hey, Piratinha!

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:13.940
One more day of training!

00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:26.741
Good morning!

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.287
Another day of work, Piratinha!
Let's go!

00:00:37.513 --> 00:00:39.258
Caveirinha knows that!

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:50.136
Jubal was trying to speak English,

00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:52.656
but they speak Portuguese
in Portugal!

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:58.602
You're so dumb.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.268
I'm dumb,
but you're even more!

00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:11.041
You had told me that once,
but I forgot.

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.972
- You're twice as dumb!
- I know!

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.114
I didn't try
to speak English at least!

00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:22.644
I was just kidding.

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.071
- "Elevations."
- "Elevations!"

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:13.630
Did you see his face?

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:14.998
He couldn't believe it!

00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:40.092
Gabriel, what do you have to say
about their affection?

00:03:40.257 --> 00:03:41.738
It's very cool,

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.248
we don't come here very often,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.025
it's quite far away,

00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:48.438
but whenever we're here
they come support us,

00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:50.851
it's great to receive
their affection,

00:03:51.244 --> 00:03:54.997
and we're trying to pay them back.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.177
Look how many jerseys!

00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:01.007
You're going to be exhausted!
