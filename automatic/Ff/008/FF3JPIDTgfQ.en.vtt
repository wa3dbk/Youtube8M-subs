00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
though about the amazing ongoing fallout

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.180 
though about the amazing ongoing fallout
between<00:04:06.450> Matt<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.290> foggy<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.010> yeah

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
between Matt and foggy and this yeah

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.880 
between Matt and foggy and this yeah
because<00:04:08.910> they<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.720> think<00:04:10.020> they<00:04:10.350> nailed<00:04:10.620> that

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
because they I think they nailed that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.550 
because they I think they nailed that
from<00:04:11.310> being<00:04:11.610> dead<00:04:11.850> every<00:04:12.330> every<00:04:13.170> question

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
from being dead every every question

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.650 
from being dead every every question
that<00:04:14.100> foggy<00:04:14.610> should<00:04:14.970> have<00:04:15.060> realistically

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
that foggy should have realistically

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.710 
that foggy should have realistically
asked<00:04:16.080> I<00:04:16.200> think<00:04:16.410> he<00:04:16.530> asked<00:04:16.950> every<00:04:17.850> answer<00:04:18.090> was

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
asked I think he asked every answer was

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.479 
asked I think he asked every answer was
honest<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:19.799> completely<00:04:20.130> dissatisfied

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
honest but completely dissatisfied

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.920 
honest but completely dissatisfied
because<00:04:21.000> how<00:04:21.239> could<00:04:21.390> it<00:04:21.480> be<00:04:21.510> anything<00:04:21.780> but

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
because how could it be anything but

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.200 
because how could it be anything but
yeah<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.740> thought<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.190> was<00:04:23.310> great<00:04:23.730> even<00:04:24.060> just

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
yeah I thought it was great even just

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.640 
yeah I thought it was great even just
the<00:04:24.300> opening<00:04:24.660> bit<00:04:24.870> like<00:04:25.020> are<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.200> even<00:04:25.380> really

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
the opening bit like are you even really

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.820 
the opening bit like are you even really
blind<00:04:26.240> its<00:04:27.240> purpose<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.169> does<00:04:28.380> take<00:04:28.650> this

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
blind its purpose it does take this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.350 
blind its purpose it does take this
relationship<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.580> think<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.940> comics

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
relationship that I think in the comics

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.239 
relationship that I think in the comics
if<00:04:30.900> all

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:31.249 
if all

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.039 
if all
in<00:04:31.339> different<00:04:31.549> ways<00:04:31.729> and<00:04:32.239> certain<00:04:32.929> things

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:33.049 
in different ways and certain things

00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:34.419 
in different ways and certain things
were<00:04:33.229> taken<00:04:33.499> for<00:04:33.649> granted<00:04:33.679> and<00:04:34.159> kind<00:04:34.369> of

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:34.429 
were taken for granted and kind of

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:37.149 
were taken for granted and kind of
really<00:04:34.639> strips<00:04:35.239> it<00:04:35.359> down<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.629> like<00:04:35.779> what<00:04:36.679> would

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
really strips it down to like what would

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.769 
really strips it down to like what would
happen<00:04:37.549> if<00:04:37.669> he<00:04:37.789> found<00:04:37.969> out<00:04:38.209> that<00:04:38.269> all<00:04:38.629> this

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:38.779 
happen if he found out that all this

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.729 
happen if he found out that all this
time<00:04:38.989> he'd<00:04:39.229> been<00:04:39.379> mislead<00:04:40.159> yeah<00:04:41.709> they<00:04:42.709> they

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:42.739 
time he'd been mislead yeah they they

time he'd been mislead yeah they they
were<00:04:42.979> not<00:04:43.069> operating<00:04:43.669> on<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:43.849> footing<00:04:44.119> that

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:44.149 
were not operating on the footing that

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:46.389 
were not operating on the footing that
he<00:04:44.329> assumed<00:04:44.599> yeah<00:04:44.749> we<00:04:44.929> see<00:04:45.469> in<00:04:45.649> many<00:04:45.949> superhero

he assumed yeah we see in many superhero

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.039 
he assumed yeah we see in many superhero
stories<00:04:46.699> when<00:04:46.849> someone<00:04:47.149> finds<00:04:47.569> out<00:04:47.719> like

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:48.049 
stories when someone finds out like

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:49.719 
stories when someone finds out like
they're<00:04:48.229> often<00:04:48.499> like<00:04:48.649> that<00:04:48.919> five<00:04:49.249> seconds<00:04:49.669> of

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
they're often like that five seconds of

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.309 
they're often like that five seconds of
shocked<00:04:49.909> oh<00:04:50.299> my<00:04:50.509> god<00:04:50.689> and<00:04:51.019> they're<00:04:51.109> like<00:04:51.229> oh

shocked oh my god and they're like oh
that's<00:04:51.379> really<00:04:51.709> cool<00:04:51.949> but<00:04:52.219> you<00:04:52.639> don't<00:04:52.819> really

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:52.909 
that's really cool but you don't really

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.119 
that's really cool but you don't really
think<00:04:53.029> about<00:04:53.239> how<00:04:53.479> much<00:04:53.659> lying<00:04:54.289> goes<00:04:54.619> into<00:04:54.979> it

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
think about how much lying goes into it

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
think about how much lying goes into it
so<00:04:55.279> especially<00:04:55.519> if<00:04:55.729> you're<00:04:55.849> someone<00:04:56.119> that's

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:56.149 
so especially if you're someone that's

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.359 
so especially if you're someone that's
really<00:04:56.569> close<00:04:56.929> to<00:04:57.169> the<00:04:57.259> main<00:04:57.409> character<00:04:57.919> he's

00:04:58.359 --> 00:04:58.369 
really close to the main character he's

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:59.769 
really close to the main character he's
been<00:04:58.519> lying<00:04:58.729> to<00:04:58.939> him<00:04:58.999> for<00:04:59.179> years<00:04:59.389> in<00:04:59.659> there

00:04:59.769 --> 00:04:59.779 
been lying to him for years in there

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.139 
been lying to him for years in there
coming<00:05:00.649> across<00:05:00.769> obviously<00:05:01.219> there's<00:05:01.789> partly

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:02.149 
coming across obviously there's partly

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:04.449 
coming across obviously there's partly
disabled<00:05:02.629> and<00:05:02.839> foggy<00:05:03.769> then<00:05:03.949> questions

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:04.459 
disabled and foggy then questions

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:05.799 
disabled and foggy then questions
everything<00:05:04.939> that<00:05:05.089> he<00:05:05.179> said<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.569> that's<00:05:05.659> what

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:05.809 
everything that he said and that's what

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.269 
everything that he said and that's what
people<00:05:06.019> should<00:05:06.139> react<00:05:06.619> I'm<00:05:06.769> guessing<00:05:07.189> if

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:07.279 
people should react I'm guessing if

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.649 
people should react I'm guessing if
there<00:05:07.459> was<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.639> superhero<00:05:08.089> you<00:05:08.299> know<00:05:08.449> it<00:05:08.509> was

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
there was a superhero you know it was

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.569 
there was a superhero you know it was
too<00:05:08.869> much<00:05:09.110> but<00:05:09.499> maybe<00:05:09.649> I'm<00:05:09.860> just<00:05:10.009> used<00:05:10.309> to

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:10.579 
too much but maybe I'm just used to

00:05:10.579 --> 00:05:14.229 
too much but maybe I'm just used to
people<00:05:11.149> accepting<00:05:11.899> yeah<00:05:13.059> okay<00:05:14.059> I<00:05:14.089> thought

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:14.239 
people accepting yeah okay I thought

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:15.279 
people accepting yeah okay I thought
you're<00:05:14.360> gonna<00:05:14.449> say<00:05:14.659> oh<00:05:14.689> you<00:05:14.929> were<00:05:15.019> used<00:05:15.169> to

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
you're gonna say oh you were used to

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.659 
you're gonna say oh you were used to
people<00:05:15.439> lying<00:05:15.739> to<00:05:15.979> you<00:05:16.069> I<00:05:16.099> was<00:05:16.399> like<00:05:16.459> that

people lying to you I was like that

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:17.439 
people lying to you I was like that

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
would be horrible

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.669 
would be horrible
yeah<00:05:18.019> I<00:05:19.659> feel<00:05:20.659> like<00:05:20.779> this<00:05:21.139> is<00:05:21.289> a<00:05:21.319> trope<00:05:21.649> that

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:21.679 
yeah I feel like this is a trope that
