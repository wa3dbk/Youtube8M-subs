00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
now we're back to the original size what

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:39.949 
now we're back to the original size what
you<00:03:38.340> want<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.579> do<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:39.599> make<00:03:39.810> your

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
you want to do you make your

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.379 
you want to do you make your
freeze-frame<00:03:40.469> so<00:03:41.099> and<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.609> split<00:03:41.939> your<00:03:42.150> video

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
freeze-frame so and you split your video

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.520 
freeze-frame so and you split your video
up<00:03:42.689> grab<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.859> second<00:03:44.310> half<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.299> video

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
up grab that second half of the video

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.140 
up grab that second half of the video
drag<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.680> around<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:47.190> little<00:03:47.280> bit<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.819> give<00:03:48.030> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
drag it around a little bit and give you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.729 
drag it around a little bit and give you
a<00:03:48.209> little<00:03:48.419> space<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.720> put<00:03:49.169> your<00:03:49.319> free<00:03:49.500> spring

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
a little space to put your free spring

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.890 
a little space to put your free spring
in<00:03:50.750> drag<00:03:51.750> your<00:03:51.900> freeze-frame<00:03:52.470> down<00:03:53.870> make<00:03:54.870> it

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
in drag your freeze-frame down make it

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.420 
in drag your freeze-frame down make it
whatever<00:03:55.530> length<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:55.889> want<00:03:56.190> your

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
whatever length you want your

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.580 
whatever length you want your
freeze-frame<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.209> last<00:03:57.979> let's<00:03:58.979> just<00:03:59.220> say

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
freeze-frame to last let's just say

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.979 
freeze-frame to last let's just say
three<00:04:01.590> or<00:04:01.650> four<00:04:01.799> seconds<00:04:02.329> put<00:04:03.329> it<00:04:03.449> in<00:04:03.569> between

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
three or four seconds put it in between

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.309 
three or four seconds put it in between
your<00:04:04.260> two<00:04:04.620> video<00:04:04.949> clips<00:04:05.189> and<00:04:05.900> then<00:04:06.900> make<00:04:07.109> sure

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
your two video clips and then make sure

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.920 
your two video clips and then make sure
they're<00:04:08.510> together<00:04:09.510> again<00:04:09.870> seamlessly<00:04:10.829> and

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
they're together again seamlessly and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.479 
they're together again seamlessly and
now<00:04:12.930> let's<00:04:13.379> look<00:04:13.560> at<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.859> again<00:04:13.979> and<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:14.370> what

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
now let's look at it again and see what

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:22.350 
now let's look at it again and see what
we<00:04:14.639> got

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.059 

and<00:04:22.930> that's<00:04:23.229> how<00:04:23.379> you<00:04:23.439> do<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.710> freeze-frame

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069 
and that's how you do the freeze-frame

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.640 
and that's how you do the freeze-frame
effect<00:04:24.870> very<00:04:25.870> easy<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.289> do

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
effect very easy to do

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.279 
effect very easy to do
that's<00:04:26.830> also<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:28.240> freeze-frame<00:04:28.539> is<00:04:28.960> also

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
that's also the freeze-frame is also

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.770 
that's also the freeze-frame is also
capturing<00:04:29.830> an<00:04:29.949> image<00:04:30.069> from<00:04:30.879> your<00:04:30.939> video<00:04:31.330> if

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
capturing an image from your video if

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.990 
capturing an image from your video if
you<00:04:32.349> didn't<00:04:32.560> get<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.740> by<00:04:33.039> now<00:04:33.069> but<00:04:33.310> that's

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
you didn't get that by now but that's

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.670 
you didn't get that by now but that's
