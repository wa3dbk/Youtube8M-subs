00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi friends, I thought it was there and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.350
 South Park completely abandoned and in fact 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.269
 it's not good to forget old friends like you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 know lately we are the main 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.259
 We pay attention to the adventure Winnie the Pooh 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 from him companies but south park not 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.740
 not going to throw too 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 especially as creating a true story 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.640
 yellow cable and you have gained considerable experience 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.640
 and a huge amount of footage 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.560
 You have accumulated a huge number of photos of the same 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.570
 I need to animate the style of the South Park 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.930
 all this valuable material used in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.930
 community benefits 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.950
 remember this wonderful green meadow 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.790
 which were our first lessons 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.380
 by animation 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.070
 then with eric carmine as 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.680
 Leading glorious were times precisely 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.350
 so the next issue is mid-show we 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.930
 decided to devote to the south park yes friends 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.360
 my today south park ds goes on 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 a new level in the past there are times 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.930
 when you had a long time and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.240
 tedious to manually animate each 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 movement patterns our life is fast 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.470
 broke into no tags it's animated 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.540
 pre-programmed models 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.740
 basic movements 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 in fact, you only need 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.460
 show about her measurements where to go and what 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.060
 speak and everything else she does 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.310
 herself 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 and in our first lit lessons they 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.000
 marks we showed how it is done on 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 example winnie the pooh and k . 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.460
 and today we will do the same 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.780
 only with the characters of the south park 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.369
 A little problem is only 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.869
 that recently we have become 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.700
 so serious and important 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.159
 we try to make cartoons more or less 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 clean in terms of copyright therefore 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.759
 we can't just take it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.070
 boy's planet blue caps and bard 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.579
 market coat for it will be a violation 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.549
 copyright 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.229
 but nothing prevents us to take the boy well 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.000
 at least in a crimson hat and blue 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.130
 bones and such a boy no 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.600
 copyright no longer be here 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.969
 such a funny thing this very 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.859
 copyright so let's draw 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.990
 some such abstract character 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.469
 South Park and we will do from it to 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.960
 German 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.329
 but if you absolutely need a path 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.100
 boy blue or green cap then 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.860
 write to us and we will make you an old friend 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.990
 let's say the people of these boys can take 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.970
 so using one of the many 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.250
 existing networks of avatar crackers to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 which of course you know we created here 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.880
 such a cute little man in Kiev 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.610
 southern folder left cut it to 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.560
 parts and assemble from these parts a model 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.150
 All these operations are described in detail in 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.070
 our great cartoons lessons on 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.820
 the animations you can find on 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.610
 our portal 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.680
 Jenner of any machines rub ourselves of course 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.510
 did not pop up modelku again for just 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.730
 used one of the ones we already had 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.660
 models as a template replaceable 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.640
 parts using the replay function to judge you 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.640
 you can also create your own models and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.000
 in the end we have got here so they 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.620
 label let's call it with batch to 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.070
 it was immediately clear that this is a resident south 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.280
 park 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.560
 well go gently it will be a park not so 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.500
 what he is able to know how to park 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.500
 turn around her 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.379
 and most importantly can talk 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.030
 automatic animation of all these 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.849
 action detailed in our 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.629
 the first lessons dedicated to them are tags 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.909
 today we are with you in more detail 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.680
 consider the movement of the hands as we already 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.819
 told previous lessons at 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.530
 conversation hands start automatically 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.209
 move towards 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.640
 where you can do this movement 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.090
 stronger or weaker with the parameter 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.590
 hands motion on your own in the cancel tank 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.290
 of course you can like the good old 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.510
 times to animate hands manually each 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.790
 part separately 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.040
 engage and hand responsible layers 9 through 14 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.439
 just roll them with the parameter 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.930
 rotation immediately you see which part on 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:53.269
 what layer is as you see nothing 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.709
 complicated here there is it we all went to 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.959
 our animation tantrum lessons 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.639
 Partners, these lessons you will find on our 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.519
 portal wife Rafah not mishn-Row 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.900
 in the same place about business of loading lies and this 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.730
 great park tag 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.400
 which you can download and use 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.109
 in their cartoons well, I'm on it with you 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.109
 say goodbye to new meetings
