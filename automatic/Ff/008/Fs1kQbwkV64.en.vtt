doing the answer to this probably isn't

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.500

as<00:00:48.539> juicy<00:00:48.840> SS<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.770> might<00:00:50.399> want<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.969> only

because<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.930> never<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.829> got<00:00:53.039> caught<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
because I never really got caught like I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.860 
because I never really got caught like I
did<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> lot<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.980> dumb<00:00:56.370> shit<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.420> said<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> lot

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
did a lot of dumb shit and I said a lot

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
did a lot of dumb shit and I said a lot
of<00:00:58.020> stuff<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.260> probably<00:00:58.890> would<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.100> got<00:00:59.280> me

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of stuff that probably would have got me

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.139 
of stuff that probably would have got me
in<00:00:59.760> some<00:01:00.660> form<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> trouble<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.789> gotten

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
in some form of trouble if I gotten

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.729 
in some form of trouble if I gotten
caught<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> didn't<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.870> caught<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.439> ever

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
caught but I didn't get caught like ever

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280 
caught but I didn't get caught like ever
I<00:01:05.129> think<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.240> worst<00:01:06.479> situation<00:01:07.080> where<00:01:07.260> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I think the worst situation where I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.929 
I think the worst situation where I
almost<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:08.070> caught<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.430> probably<00:01:08.640> should

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
almost got caught and I probably should

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.910 
almost got caught and I probably should
have<00:01:08.970> got<00:01:09.150> caught<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.500> too<00:01:10.710> long

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
have got caught it was not too long

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
have got caught it was not too long
after<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.310> got<00:01:11.430> my<00:01:11.580> first<00:01:11.760> apartment<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.330> my

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
Quinn hmm a good question for a lot of

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.120 
Quinn hmm a good question for a lot of
reasons<00:06:31.750> this<00:06:32.200> is<00:06:32.380> just<00:06:32.560> as<00:06:32.740> tough<00:06:32.890> as<00:06:33.040> the

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
reasons this is just as tough as the

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.400 
reasons this is just as tough as the
last<00:06:33.310> question<00:06:33.669> I'd<00:06:33.850> probably<00:06:34.330> have<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:34.960> say

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
last question I'd probably have to say

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.100 
last question I'd probably have to say
Catwoman<00:06:36.160> but<00:06:36.850> it<00:06:36.970> would<00:06:37.120> really<00:06:37.390> have<00:06:37.720> to<00:06:37.900> be

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
Catwoman but it would really have to be

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.870 
Catwoman but it would really have to be
based<00:06:38.890> on<00:06:39.070> comparison

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
based on comparison

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.720 
based on comparison
I<00:06:39.910> would<00:06:40.180> need<00:06:40.300> to<00:06:40.360> see<00:06:40.510> how<00:06:41.350> the<00:06:42.130> specific

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
I would need to see how the specific

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.270 
I would need to see how the specific
catwoman<00:06:43.270> looks<00:06:43.560> against<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:44.710> specific

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
catwoman looks against the specific

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.730 
catwoman looks against the specific
Harley<00:06:45.610> Quinn<00:06:45.880> but<00:06:46.540> in<00:06:46.720> general<00:06:47.050> I'd<00:06:47.470> probably

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
Harley Quinn but in general I'd probably

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.920 
Harley Quinn but in general I'd probably
have<00:06:47.980> to<00:06:48.100> go<00:06:48.220> with<00:06:48.400> Catwoman<00:06:48.850> so<00:06:49.390> there<00:06:49.780> you<00:06:49.900> go
