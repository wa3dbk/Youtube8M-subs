00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.219 
directly above your crease in most of
the<00:01:53.909> video<00:01:54.180> she's<00:01:54.450> not<00:01:54.630> looking<00:01:54.780> completely

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the video she's not looking completely

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.889 
the video she's not looking completely
straight<00:01:55.649> she's<00:01:55.890> more<00:01:56.070> looking<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:57.030> way<00:01:57.270> or

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
straight she's more looking this way or

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.780 
straight she's more looking this way or
this<00:01:58.229> way<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.189> both<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> them

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
this way so you can see both of them

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
this way so you can see both of them
instead<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.299> completely<00:02:00.659> straight

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.200 

and<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.010> also<00:02:09.190> really<00:02:09.610> do<00:02:09.760> want<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.030> bring

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
and you also really do want to bring

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.870 
and you also really do want to bring
this<00:02:10.420> all<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.900> way<00:02:10.930> into<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.530> nose<00:02:11.790> into<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
this all the way into the nose into the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.570 
this all the way into the nose into the
boom<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:14.050> no<00:02:14.170> taking<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.500> darker<00:02:14.920> gray<00:02:15.130> I'm<00:02:15.430> just

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
boom so no taking a darker gray I'm just

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.100 
boom so no taking a darker gray I'm just
going<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.820> kind<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.030> go<00:02:16.150> over<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.540> line<00:02:16.810> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
going to kind of go over that line and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.900 
going to kind of go over that line and
then<00:02:17.650> blend<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.160> little<00:02:18.400> bit<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.700> blend

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
then blend it out a little bit and blend

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:36.710 
then blend it out a little bit and blend
it<00:02:19.000> up

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.110 

this<00:02:37.470> look<00:02:37.650> also<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.340> goes<00:02:38.520> up<00:02:38.730> right

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
this look also kind of goes up right

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.790 
this look also kind of goes up right
into<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.450> brow<00:02:39.630> bone<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:39.900> gets<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.620> dark

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
into the brow bone and gets really dark

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.430 
into the brow bone and gets really dark
over<00:02:41.190> here<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:48.270> what<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.540> also<00:02:48.660> does<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.230> kind

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
over here so what it also does is kind

00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:04.500 
over here so what it also does is kind
of<00:02:49.500> connect<00:02:50.030> here

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.390 

basically<00:03:05.319> what<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:05.560> doing<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.950> going<00:03:06.159> in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
basically what I'm doing is going in

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.630 
basically what I'm doing is going in
between<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.849> copper<00:03:07.150> plate<00:03:07.360> color<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
between the copper plate color and the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.679 
between the copper plate color and the
topographic<00:03:09.640> color<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:10.060> I'm<00:03:10.150> using<00:03:10.329> for<00:03:10.629> the

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
topographic color that I'm using for the

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.229 
topographic color that I'm using for the
darker<00:03:10.959> right<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.519> kind<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.790> blending

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
darker right and just kind of blending

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.979 
darker right and just kind of blending
along<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.260> colors<00:03:14.650> with<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> small<00:03:16.030> brush<00:03:16.269> so

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
along the colors with a small brush so

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.759 
along the colors with a small brush so
it<00:03:17.110> gets<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.379> be<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> seamless<00:03:17.890> kind<00:03:18.879> of<00:03:19.000> blend

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
it gets to be a seamless kind of blend

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.050 
it gets to be a seamless kind of blend
and<00:03:20.769> now<00:03:20.890> i'm<00:03:20.980> just<00:03:21.129> going<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.280> deepen<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
and now i'm just going to deepen the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.610 
and now i'm just going to deepen the
crease<00:03:22.209> a<00:03:22.360> little<00:03:22.540> bit<00:03:22.930> more<00:03:23.170> just<00:03:23.440> with<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
crease a little bit more just with the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:34.270 
crease a little bit more just with the
color<00:03:23.799> carbon

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.460 

so<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.939> want<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.239> line<00:03:36.480> your<00:03:37.290> upper<00:03:37.349> waterline

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
so you want to line your upper waterline

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
going from one side or into the tear

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.839 
going from one side or into the tear
ducts<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.079> now<00:03:46.860> line<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.250> waterline<00:03:47.670> with<00:03:47.700> a

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
ducts and now line the waterline with a

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.850 
ducts and now line the waterline with a
pale<00:03:48.120> yellow<00:03:48.150> color<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.379> also<00:03:49.530> use<00:03:49.650> a

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
lashes I don't really think that they

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.750 
lashes I don't really think that they
used<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:10.319> know<00:04:10.349> any<00:04:10.680> type<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:10.950> one<00:04:11.340> strip

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
used you know any type of one strip

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.330 
used you know any type of one strip
lashes<00:04:12.650> but<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.769> ones<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.010> I'm<00:04:14.159> going<00:04:14.280> to

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
lashes but the ones that I'm going to

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.240 
lashes but the ones that I'm going to
use<00:04:14.400> their<00:04:14.609> number<00:04:14.790> 35<00:04:15.889> I'm<00:04:16.889> going<00:04:17.130> to

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
use their number 35 I'm going to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.340 
use their number 35 I'm going to
deconstruct<00:04:17.609> these<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.810> do<00:04:18.989> construct

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
deconstruct these so do construct

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.990 
deconstruct these so do construct
basically<00:04:19.829> means<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.310> chop<00:04:20.609> these<00:04:20.760> up<00:04:20.820> a

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
basically means to chop these up a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.640 
basically means to chop these up a
little<00:04:21.030> bit<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.690> make<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.840> look<00:04:22.079> exactly<00:04:22.229> like

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
little bit to make it look exactly like

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.050 
little bit to make it look exactly like
we<00:04:22.830> wanted<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.070> look<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.699> will<00:04:23.880> be

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
we wanted to look so I will be

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.490 
we wanted to look so I will be
deconstructing<00:04:24.840> these<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.169> when<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.350> come

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
deconstructing these and when I come

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.730 
deconstructing these and when I come
back<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.979> will<00:04:26.130> see<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:27.030> lashes<00:04:27.600> on<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.590> I'm
