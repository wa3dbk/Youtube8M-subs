once you stick it into the refrigerator

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.309 
once you stick it into the refrigerator
you're<00:04:09.790> not<00:04:10.000> going<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.450> be<00:04:10.540> able<00:04:10.659> to<00:04:10.959> do<00:04:11.140> this

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
you're not going to be able to do this

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.849 
you're not going to be able to do this
step<00:04:11.680> so<00:04:12.129> it'll<00:04:13.090> be<00:04:13.209> hard<00:04:13.420> by<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.049> time<00:04:14.379> it

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
step so it'll be hard by the time it

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.099 
step so it'll be hard by the time it
comes<00:04:15.069> out<00:04:15.430> and<00:04:15.790> you'll<00:04:16.479> just<00:04:16.600> be<00:04:16.690> popping

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
them out of the molds or you'll be

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.189 
them out of the molds or you'll be
taking<00:04:19.030> them<00:04:19.269> out<00:04:19.449> of<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.600> cookie<00:04:19.900> cutters
