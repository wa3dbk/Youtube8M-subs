00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.660
 you want to hear me 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.620
 the heart of darkness must remain seeking you 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.499
 using it will lead to serious damage 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.509
 you don't know where it is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.679
 true 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.879
 no 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:18.279
 you never looked for it no matter rascel 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.609
 listen to me 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.710
 you must understand that every creature is bound by a fixed path 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.039
 we are all connected 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.960
 at the wheel of destiny 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.829
 believe me I am even better than you 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.730
 all but one 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.630
 because of your recreation you are the only unattached creature among you 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.630
 everyone who really enjoys free will 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.820
 now it's a terracina choice 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.960
 which surely I will have to do according to your indications 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 your checkers arrived at the bottom of that inna 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.520
 and now my powers are even superior to yours 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.230
 and me and mine 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.610
 your creature will also be your mind yes 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.940
 Now 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.770
 let's get it over with 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.770
 once and for all 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.430
 my grandfather smokes zimmer chi 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.610

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 neil simon 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.000
 woe to the vanquished 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.020
 Rio found the heart of darkness 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.210
 to add weapons 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.559
 keytar gone 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.679
 the madness of that place had fueled my anger 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:24.019
 and when it subsided, you did not feel your face was bennet victorious 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.230
 I had only the usual certainty that once again we had entered blindly 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.709
 in the trap of our enemies I didn't know for sure if keine was 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.899
 really decided to destroy me 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.129
 and it seemed that I would never know
