00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.250
 do not 

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.250
 and 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.490
 it was key to understand 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.340
 that there was much more to find 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.070
 freedom that we could move away not only 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.890
 of these images that mention that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.960
 it's really like an idea as very 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.520
 Stereotyped correct examination 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.430
 think them and colors a series of 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.130
 courtyards but also in a series of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.410
 speeches whenever we heard or 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.140
 We remembered Legorreta, we kept quiet 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.990
 in the mouth and legorreta in them 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.230
 topical the idea of 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.960
 Mexicans united the idea of color the 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.960
 let alone idea of strength 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.760
 where designation of origin but 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.280
 we thought there was much more that there was 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.000
 the whole background of your relationship is not 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.400
 only with embargo but with villagra 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.440
 like muffled bread madaleno with august 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 values ​​and it really is what we 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.870
 interested vulgar out there and then 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.070
 also rummage with those relationships 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.660
 international that was also brewing 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.260
 from the subject of the pritzker its 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.410
 let's say its vocation to establish some 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.100
 links to some global leagues that 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.190
 recent years resulted in commissions 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.450
 sports of the world I think what 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.420
 interesting is when the dialogue 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.750
 the conversation 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.750
 broad or structure make up 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.550
 I think that initial hypothesis that 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.230
 we had to think that there were in the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.780
 narratives in experiences and 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.409
 experiences of ricardo legorreta other 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 way of understanding 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.819
 architectural production beyond the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.880
 iconography that had been so dominant 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.960
 I think it was the common thread and this 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.150
 product 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.900
 right in that sense 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.800
 the book title back to what is 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.660
 as well as the degree of architecture 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.660
 which is in the space where we can 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.140
 there is a a previous interview at two 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.810
 interviews that he collects in the book that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.490
 was decisive in this project that is 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.190
 that more than interview was a discussion 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.069
 a discussion in which we were surprised 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.969
 how clear it was 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.459
 ricardo legorreta speech and in this 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.480
 first interview the castle does not 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.560
 I will say how nice but it did define very well 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.959
 what were going to be the topics that are going 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.310
 playing that until we did this 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.709
 highlight it in one of the first 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.629
 pages because he was gathering not only 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.420
 the projects or the topics that we 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.120
 we try to define in a first script 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.010
 but he pointed it out as the anecdotes that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.470
 OK 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.239
 and from there that served as 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.069
 script that we had thought for 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.219
 four interviews and finally about 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.239
 those images that we have are so 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:08.060
 engraved architecture 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:12.019
 it does not arise only from that of that image 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.870
 which has given us so far is tiffany 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.730
 well experiences that can be so 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.090
 as dramatic as the one he tells us 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.489
 visit the trail in chicago which is almost 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.560
 as his first idea of a humanism of 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.170
 face to light the idea that the building 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.420
 public could be constructed from 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.950
 other conditions and I see in that 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.620
 conversion in the series conversions that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.049
 you see connected the key moment of 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.599
 when light becomes a factor 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.520
 dominant on their way every title up 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.820
 that linked epiphany 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.160
 what is that its construction moment 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.290
 identities and identity need 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.090
 distilled I thought 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.280
 attractive and then reconfigures 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.200
 otherwise with the last years of 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.680
 his life and with the conformation of the way 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.680
 office
