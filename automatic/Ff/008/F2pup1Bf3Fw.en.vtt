00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:15.469
 ready fixture which 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.469
 called earth on i face mill appearance 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:29.000
 devices 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:33.930
 you have a gearbox 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 flesh of the front bridge elk elongated for 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 increasing the width of the grip as they 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:45.180
 short initials are inserted into the bridge 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:51.500
 oil seals individual shop oil leaks not 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.500
 was the gearbox turned upside down 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.370
 securely fastened 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.699
 tested ahead is a stepladder to 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.240
 the reducer did not tear off and they did not unscrew 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.420
 turned the brain protection and dust 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:21.049
 protects the stones and is very beautiful 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:23.400
 develops breast mounted on pipes 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.310
 when deep can 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.380
 rise and do not need to strain 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.780
 know worth ratchet 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.939
 and with increasing load adjustable 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.939
 here is the discharge thrust bearing 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.960
 upper 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.619
 6 days twice the diameter of the rank 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.770
 the bottom of this is about 220 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.079
 turns covered power take 540 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.560
 shaft for cutting knives made from chisel 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.500
 pipes with a diameter of 100 millimeters 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.320
 the thickness is very decent enough to live 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.190
 all made 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.270
 cook hard rigidly to the pipe and 4 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.270
 knives in the same plane 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.350
 this is enough at such speeds 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.209
 do structural soil who wants what 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.540
 argue about welding 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.819
 I will not argue because it's easier for me 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.340
 make a new knot new knives i cook 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.459
 them again 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.780
 milling depth is reached from 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.019
 supporting paw bolt pipe and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.230
 adjusting holes need to be raised 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.220
 above below protection on target before doing with 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.459
 time to dust there is not so dad at home 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.110
 when working by and large much is not 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.350
 hits contradicting here's the welded 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.069
 knives 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.459
 so as not to wind up weeds if 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.880
 he is big here too 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.670
 to cut everything tested 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.680
 everything seems to be thought of to be several times 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.440
 reworked hole this is done 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.200
 Valya he is 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:25.570
 the pin is inserted here is fixed 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.269
 same-sex chain is removed from this board 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.840
 and it turns out two times more turns 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:37.720
 on the shaft through one side through their garden 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:40.049
 elite box all drive shaft and full 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.049
 forward
