people keep asking what am i doing and
what<00:00:06.509> crazy<00:00:06.899> contraption<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.770> Joe<00:00:07.980> boy

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
what crazy contraption is Joe boy

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.000 
what crazy contraption is Joe boy
building<00:00:08.639> now<00:00:09.019> to<00:00:10.019> explain<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> little<00:00:10.830> bit

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
building now to explain a little bit

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.270 
building now to explain a little bit
about<00:00:11.190> what<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.030> why<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.690> works<00:00:13.280> this

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
about what this is and why it works this

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.359 
about what this is and why it works this
is<00:00:14.340> an<00:00:14.639> aquaponic<00:00:15.210> system<00:00:15.680> we<00:00:16.680> start<00:00:16.920> off<00:00:17.100> with

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
is an aquaponic system we start off with

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.390 
is an aquaponic system we start off with
a<00:00:17.400> 500<00:00:18.150> gallon<00:00:18.210> tank<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:19.500> contains<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:20.130> large

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
a 500 gallon tank that contains a large

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.759 
a 500 gallon tank that contains a large
quantity<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> fish<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.320> case<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.710> only

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
quantity of fish in this case we only

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.670 
quantity of fish in this case we only
have<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.730> it's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> big<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.590> it's<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
have one but it's a big one and it's a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.990 
have one but it's a big one and it's a
bottom<00:00:25.980> feeder<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.609> cleaning<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
bottom feeder it's just cleaning the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.310 
bottom feeder it's just cleaning the
tank<00:00:27.180> while<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
tank while we get it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.269 
tank while we get it
primed<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.220> ready<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:31.590> actual<00:00:31.949> crop

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
primed and ready for the actual crop

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.299 
primed and ready for the actual crop
which<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:32.820> hoping<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.480> tilapia<00:00:34.309> so

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
which we're hoping to be tilapia so

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.180 
which we're hoping to be tilapia so
we've<00:00:36.149> got<00:00:36.360> an<00:00:36.480> aerator<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.070> all

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
we've got an aerator and you can see all

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
we've got an aerator and you can see all
the<00:00:38.250> bubbles<00:00:38.430> coming<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.899> secondary

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the bubbles coming up and a secondary

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
the bubbles coming up and a secondary
aerator<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.100> emergency<00:00:41.460> backup<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:42.030> valve

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
aerator for emergency backup a valve

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
aerator for emergency backup a valve
system<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> we've<00:00:45.660> got<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.960> water

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
system and so we've got a lot of water

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.330 
system and so we've got a lot of water
flow<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.489> water<00:00:47.730> comes<00:00:48.180> through<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:49.559> grate

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
flow and the water comes through a grate

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
flow and the water comes through a grate
in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> bottom<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> tank<00:00:51.329> rises<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.230> goes

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
in the bottom of the tank rises up goes

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.180 
in the bottom of the tank rises up goes
across<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> swirl<00:00:54.629> filter<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
across and into a swirl filter that is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.680 
across and into a swirl filter that is
where<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> particulates<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.329> removed

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
where the particulates are then removed

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.880 
where the particulates are then removed
from<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> water<00:00:58.489> separated<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
from the water separated and then that

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
from the water separated and then that
the<00:01:01.890> swirling<00:01:02.280> motion<00:01:02.609> allows<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> occur

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the swirling motion allows that to occur

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.039 
the swirling motion allows that to occur
and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:05.010> drains<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.700> into<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> sump

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and then it drains out into the sump

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
and then it drains out into the sump
tank<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.520> take<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.880> over<00:01:09.150> there<00:01:09.330> I'm

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
tank and the some take is over there I'm

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
tank and the some take is over there I'm
gonna<00:01:09.689> pass<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.200> only<00:01:10.500> electrical<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.040> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
gonna pass the only electrical that we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.510 
gonna pass the only electrical that we
actually<00:01:11.610> need<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.090> run<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> UPS<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:14.369> is

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
actually need I run on a UPS and that is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.370 
actually need I run on a UPS and that is
an<00:01:14.670> aerator<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> fish<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:15.659> die<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
an aerator so the fish don't die and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.800 
an aerator so the fish don't die and
then<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> actual<00:01:17.759> pump<00:01:18.090> does<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> sump

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
then the actual pump does in the sump

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.460 
then the actual pump does in the sump
tank<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.590> only<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.250> single<00:01:20.670> pump<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.630> 145

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
tank it's only one single pump it's 145

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.730 
tank it's only one single pump it's 145
watts<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.119> draws<00:01:24.479> less<00:01:25.110> than<00:01:25.350> half<00:01:25.590> of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
watts and so it draws less than half of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.240 
watts and so it draws less than half of
the<00:01:25.860> power<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.340> computer<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.890> we'll<00:01:29.100> move

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the power of a computer and we'll move

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.050 
the power of a computer and we'll move
on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.610> side<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> sump<00:01:30.930> tank

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
on the side here and go to the sump tank

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.620 
on the side here and go to the sump tank
the<00:01:33.060> sump<00:01:33.420> tank<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.930> located<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:36.299> we

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the sump tank is located here and we

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
the sump tank is located here and we
have<00:01:36.750> 10<00:01:36.960> goldfish<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.729> pump<00:01:39.030> as

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
have 10 goldfish in there and a pump as

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.990 
have 10 goldfish in there and a pump as
you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.810> there

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
you can see there

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.530 
you can see there
the<00:01:42.000> pump<00:01:42.270> runs<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.690> line<00:01:42.900> up<00:01:43.260> this<00:01:43.409> way<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
the pump runs a line up this way and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.300 
the pump runs a line up this way and
there's<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> valve<00:01:45.870> that<00:01:45.990> goes<00:01:46.140> back<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
there's a valve that goes back to the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.910 
there's a valve that goes back to the
main<00:01:47.520> fish<00:01:47.790> tank<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.320> course<00:01:49.500> about

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
main fish tank this is of course about

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
main fish tank this is of course about
coming<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> fish<00:01:50.790> tank<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.270> pouring

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
coming from the fish tank and pouring

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.160 
coming from the fish tank and pouring
back<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> sometimes<00:01:53.600> after<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.690> follow<00:01:54.900> this

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
back in sometimes after you follow this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.460 
back in sometimes after you follow this
valve<00:01:55.440> you<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> first<00:01:56.670> head<00:01:57.320> we<00:01:58.320> are

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
valve you get to the first head we are

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.180 
valve you get to the first head we are
we're<00:01:59.570> preparing<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.780> grow<00:02:00.930> bed<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> then

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
we're preparing the grow bed and then

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.280 
we're preparing the grow bed and then
the<00:02:02.280> second<00:02:02.700> bed<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.119> along<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.630> way<00:02:05.990> goes<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the second bed is along this way goes to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.639 
the second bed is along this way goes to
the<00:02:07.440> second<00:02:07.770> bed<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.840> center<00:02:10.200> over<00:02:10.619> here

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the second bed in the center over here

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.790 
the second bed in the center over here
you'll<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.310> what<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:11.730> call<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:12.380> bell<00:02:13.380> siphon

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you'll see what we call a bell siphon

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.430 
you'll see what we call a bell siphon
and<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.850> ahead<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.060> remove<00:02:15.239> this<00:02:15.570> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and we can go ahead and remove this and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.580 
and we can go ahead and remove this and
if<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.680> look<00:02:16.830> inside<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:18.090> will<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
if you look inside you will see that the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.229 
if you look inside you will see that the
bell<00:02:19.950> siphon<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:22.640> raising<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.760> lowering<00:02:23.820> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
bell siphon is raising and lowering the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.979 
bell siphon is raising and lowering the
water<00:02:24.570> in<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:26.250> device<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:26.910> if<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.600> pull<00:02:27.840> this

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
water in the device so if I pull this

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:36.290 
water in the device so if I pull this
out<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:33.810> simply<00:02:34.380> has<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:35.040> pipe<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.000> goes<00:02:36.060> on

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
out it simply has a pipe that goes on

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.160 
out it simply has a pipe that goes on
the<00:02:36.390> side<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:37.260> creates<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.830> siphon<00:02:38.250> and

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the side that creates the siphon and

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.870 
the side that creates the siphon and
there's<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.320> water<00:02:40.470> level<00:02:40.830> rising<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.430> as

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
there's the water level rising and as

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.130 
there's the water level rising and as
soon<00:02:42.060> as<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.239> reaches<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.570> top<00:02:42.750> they'll<00:02:42.930> start

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
soon as it reaches the top they'll start

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.229 
soon as it reaches the top they'll start
spilling<00:02:43.470> into<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.400> with<00:02:45.000> this

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
spilling into it but with this

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.810 
spilling into it but with this
particular<00:02:45.620> rubber<00:02:46.620> hose<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.489> actually

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
particular rubber hose it actually

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.440 
particular rubber hose it actually
creates<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.150> seal<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.790> won't<00:02:50.790> actually<00:02:50.970> stop

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
creates a seal so it won't actually stop

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.630 
creates a seal so it won't actually stop
emptying<00:02:52.110> out<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.440> container<00:02:52.709> until<00:02:53.250> after

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
emptying out the container until after

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.420 
emptying out the container until after
it<00:02:53.700> gets<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> bottom<00:02:54.329> level<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.840> this<00:02:55.049> of

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
it gets to the bottom level of this of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.610 
it gets to the bottom level of this of
that<00:02:56.430> plastic<00:02:56.820> tube<00:02:57.030> which<00:02:57.750> then<00:02:57.959> starts<00:02:58.380> air

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
that plastic tube which then starts air

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.039 
that plastic tube which then starts air
coming<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.519> breaks<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> siphon<00:03:00.329> and<00:03:00.510> fills

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
coming in breaks the siphon and fills

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.720 
coming in breaks the siphon and fills
the<00:03:01.170> tank<00:03:01.320> back<00:03:01.530> up<00:03:01.790> it's<00:03:02.790> set<00:03:03.150> up<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:06.350> go<00:03:07.350> in

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the tank back up it's set up to go in

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.750 
the tank back up it's set up to go in
drain<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.870> refill<00:03:10.730> approximately<00:03:11.730> every

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
drain and a refill approximately every

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.620 
drain and a refill approximately every
15<00:03:12.510> minutes

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.670 

and<00:03:17.630> there's<00:03:18.410> another<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:18.770> over<00:03:19.040> here

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.770 

until<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.640> one<00:03:23.849> is<00:03:24.060> almost<00:03:24.329> getting<00:03:24.540> ready

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
until this one is almost getting ready

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.300 
until this one is almost getting ready
to<00:03:24.900> drain<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:26.459> see<00:03:26.610> how<00:03:26.700> high<00:03:26.879> up<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.239> is

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.210 

then<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> have<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.360> MFT<00:03:32.630> track<00:03:33.069> this<00:03:34.069> is

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
then I have the MFT track this is

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.620 
then I have the MFT track this is
something<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.580> I<00:03:34.610> added<00:03:34.910> on<00:03:35.120> just<00:03:35.480> to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
something that I added on just to

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.930 
something that I added on just to
experiment<00:03:36.170> with<00:03:36.319> and<00:03:36.680> we've<00:03:37.550> got<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> water

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
experiment with and we've got a water

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.180 
experiment with and we've got a water
level<00:03:38.120> over<00:03:38.569> there<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.739> gives<00:03:39.980> water

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
level over there and that gives water

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.040 
level over there and that gives water
just<00:03:40.459> along<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.760> bottom<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.090> all<00:03:41.239> these<00:03:41.450> this

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
just along the bottom of all these this

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.100 
just along the bottom of all these this
is<00:03:42.200> where<00:03:42.349> we<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.530> plant<00:03:42.770> our<00:03:42.830> seeds<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.900> get

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
is where we can plant our seeds and get

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.830 
is where we can plant our seeds and get
plants<00:03:45.470> ready<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.860> go<00:03:46.720> completely<00:03:47.720> without

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
plants ready to go completely without

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.530 
plants ready to go completely without
soil<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.470> then<00:03:48.709> move<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:49.940> actual<00:03:50.300> plant

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
soil and then move to the actual plant

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.860 
soil and then move to the actual plant
bed<00:03:54.040> underneath<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.190> plant<00:03:55.430> bed<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.940> 100

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
bed underneath the plant bed is 100

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.170 
bed underneath the plant bed is 100
gallon<00:03:57.080> tank<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.530> 100<00:03:58.489> gallon<00:03:58.730> tank<00:03:58.940> its

gallon tank and 100 gallon tank its
purpose<00:03:59.660> is<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.680> be<00:04:00.830> able<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.180> fill<00:04:02.180> up<00:04:02.209> and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
purpose is to be able to fill up and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.220 
purpose is to be able to fill up and
keep<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.980> same<00:04:04.160> level<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:04.760> water<00:04:05.060> out<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:06.049> some

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
keep the same level of water out of some

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.330 
keep the same level of water out of some
tank<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:07.720> make<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.840> easier<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.260> move<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.160> large

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
tank and make it easier to move a large

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.830 
tank and make it easier to move a large
quantity<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.790> mater<00:04:11.000> from<00:04:11.360> one<00:04:11.540> spot<00:04:11.780> to

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
quantity of mater from one spot to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.039 
quantity of mater from one spot to
another<00:04:11.989> and<00:04:12.970> allow<00:04:13.970> us<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.180> do<00:04:14.269> repairs<00:04:14.630> and

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
another and allow us to do repairs and

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.590 
another and allow us to do repairs and
so<00:04:15.170> forth<00:04:15.440> when<00:04:15.590> need<00:04:15.739> be<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:17.000> swirl<00:04:17.419> filter

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
so forth when need be the swirl filter

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.080 
so forth when need be the swirl filter
that<00:04:17.900> we<00:04:17.989> discussed<00:04:18.440> is<00:04:18.650> over<00:04:18.919> here<00:04:19.220> it's

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
that we discussed is over here it's

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.960 
that we discussed is over here it's
relief<00:04:20.419> valve<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.900> down<00:04:21.079> there<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.970> the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
relief valve is down there and the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.240 
relief valve is down there and the
piping<00:04:23.870> isn't<00:04:24.110> really<00:04:24.260> much<00:04:24.410> I<00:04:24.680> mean<00:04:24.889> is<00:04:25.010> just

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
piping isn't really much I mean is just

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.810 
piping isn't really much I mean is just
enough<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.639> get<00:04:25.930> from<00:04:26.930> there<00:04:27.160> from<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.400> main

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
enough to get from there from the main

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.650 
enough to get from there from the main
tank<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.770> swirl<00:04:30.770> filter<00:04:30.919> but<00:04:31.850> we've<00:04:32.510> added

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660
