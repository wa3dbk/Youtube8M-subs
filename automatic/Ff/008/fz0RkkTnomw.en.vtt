00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
other frogs some of them said it makes

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
other frogs some of them said it makes
me<00:00:56.969> look<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> cat<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.899> try<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> explain<00:00:58.859> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
me look like a cat I try to explain to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
me look like a cat I try to explain to
them<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> they<00:00:59.430> are<00:00:59.460> not<00:00:59.699> true<00:00:59.969> claws<00:01:00.239> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
them that they are not true claws this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
them that they are not true claws this
is<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.559> no<00:01:01.859> outer<00:01:02.129> coating<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
is because there is no outer coating of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
is because there is no outer coating of
keratin<00:01:03.270> surrounding<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> bone<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> claw

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
keratin surrounding the bone of the claw

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.060 
keratin surrounding the bone of the claw
which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.460> present<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.000> real<00:01:06.240> claws<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.960> see

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
which is present in real claws I see

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.100 
which is present in real claws I see
so<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.610> exactly<00:01:08.760> does<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.330> defense<00:01:09.780> work

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so how exactly does your defense work

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.399 
so how exactly does your defense work
well<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.700> claws<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.180> only<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.780> my<00:01:12.900> hind<00:01:13.140> feet

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
well the claws are only on my hind feet

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
well the claws are only on my hind feet
when<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> am<00:01:14.070> threatened<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> reaction

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
when I am threatened I have a reaction

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
when I am threatened I have a reaction
where<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> break<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> bones<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.860> own<00:01:17.009> toes

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
where I break the bones in my own toes

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.820 
where I break the bones in my own toes
or<00:01:17.640> metatarsals<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.990> fracture<00:01:19.439> creates<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
or metatarsals the fracture creates a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
or metatarsals the fracture creates a
pointed<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.490> hooked<00:01:20.700> bone<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.750> smaller

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
pointed and hooked bone with smaller

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.410 
pointed and hooked bone with smaller
free-floating<00:01:22.740> bones<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.250> their<00:01:23.400> tips<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
free-floating bones at their tips you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.060 
free-floating bones at their tips you
see<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> sharp<00:01:25.049> tip<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.590> claw<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
see the sharp tip of my claw is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.039 
see the sharp tip of my claw is
connected<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> bone<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.270> toe<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
connected to the bone of my toe with a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
connected to the bone of my toe with a
piece<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.439> cartilage<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.520> whole<00:01:29.729> structure

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
piece of cartilage this whole structure

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.300 
piece of cartilage this whole structure
is<00:01:30.240> attached<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> muscle<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:31.979> believe

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
is attached to a muscle what I believe

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
is attached to a muscle what I believe
happens<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> muscle<00:01:33.420> contracts<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
happens is the muscle contracts as a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.469 
happens is the muscle contracts as a
reaction<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> danger<00:01:34.920> which<00:01:35.729> pulled<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.270> claw

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
reaction to danger which pulled my claw

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
reaction to danger which pulled my claw
downward<00:01:37.020> causing<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.009> pierce<00:01:38.280> through

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
downward causing them to pierce through

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240 
downward causing them to pierce through
