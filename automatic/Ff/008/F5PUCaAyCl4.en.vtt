a<00:00:28.019> bunch<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.470> stereotypes<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.220> I've

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
a bunch of just stereotypes that I've

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.370 
a bunch of just stereotypes that I've
heard<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.390> don't<00:00:30.449> think<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:30.869> fair<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
heard and I don't think it's fair that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.530 
heard and I don't think it's fair that
they<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.550> labels<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:33.030> people<00:00:33.180> especially

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
they put labels on people especially

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.870 
they put labels on people especially
people<00:00:34.200> who<00:00:34.469> think<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> sport<00:00:35.700> which

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
people who think that it's a sport which

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.110 
people who think that it's a sport which
it<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.590> especially<00:00:37.590> because<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:38.070> work<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:38.850> hard

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
it is especially because we work so hard

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.010 
it is especially because we work so hard
it<00:00:39.570> requires<00:00:40.230> their<00:00:40.940> determination<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it requires their determination and it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.229 
it requires their determination and it
requires<00:00:43.590> strength<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> ability

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
