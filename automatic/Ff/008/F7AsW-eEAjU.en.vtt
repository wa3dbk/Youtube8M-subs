 Hello dear friends with you Olga 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.750

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:41.750
 cook chestnuts legs probably heard 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.910
 about chestnuts is an edible chestnut 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.559
 edible chestnut and found in the south 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.720
 Russia and southern Europe usually in the forests 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.170
 wild chestnuts grow 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.539
 I had to meet in Italy 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.280
 woodlands consisting exclusively 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.830
 from chestnuts that are more than a hundred years old 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.619
 some of them were under 30 years old this 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.710
 huge old trees that brings 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.310
 a huge amount of fruit from chestnuts 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.259
 you can make flour from this flour 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.520
 prepare various dishes 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.570
 different types of pasta bread and so data 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.580
 edible chestnuts are also possible 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.369
 cook at home 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.369
 and today i will show you how this is done 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.500
 first we have to wash chestnuts dear 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.030
 friends after we washed the chestnuts 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.530
 put some water in the pot 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 no matter how much chestnut you have 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.170
 water should cover chestnut on top i 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.930
 add a little salt and various 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.450
 spices in this case I added black 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.360
 pepper and a little cloves 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.700
 chestnuts should boil with us a few 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.550
 minutes this is done in order to easily 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.979
 skin has separated 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.700
 when the water boils we turn off the fire 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.690
 small chores and cook another chestnut 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.930
 a few minutes to 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.040
 identify ready or chestnuts we can 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:30.420
 just pierce 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:35.030
 their knife if the legs pass through 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.030
 chestnut means chestnuts can already be taken out 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.150
 really you understand that chestnuts have become 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.150
 soft drain 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.250
 light the griddle and incise and 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.250
 every chestnut 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.709
 This can be cut both along and 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.749
 across see how they change shape 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.870
 begin to disclose this is done for 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:24.420
 that they have not gone too far and here 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:31.799
 already the typical smell of chestnuts fills 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:37.109
 their kitchen needs to be turned over so they 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:51.389
 not burnt on top we sprinkle a little 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:53.540
 salt and cover with a chestnut lid 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.829

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.969
 chestnut shell 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.150
 Here is the brushed chestnut 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.770
