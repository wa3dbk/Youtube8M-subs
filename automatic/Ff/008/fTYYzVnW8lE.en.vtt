a few meters would sweep across

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
buildings in Tokyo and and and damage it
in<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.190> way<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.340> would<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.090> sort<00:00:48.270> of

in a way that would be sort of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.360 
in a way that would be sort of
immediately<00:00:48.899> recognizable<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:49.710> Tokyo<00:00:50.100> being

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
immediately recognizable as Tokyo being

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
immediately recognizable as Tokyo being
hit<00:00:50.520> by<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.700> huge<00:00:51.000> tsunami<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.930> Tokyo<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.250 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a
vast<00:00:53.750> agglomeration<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:55.129> of<00:00:56.480> urban<00:00:57.480> scape<00:00:58.050> and

vast agglomeration of of urban scape and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
vast agglomeration of of urban scape and
it<00:00:58.980> certainly<00:00:59.190> stretches<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.030> out

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it certainly stretches all the way out

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.020 
it certainly stretches all the way out
to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> east<00:01:01.590> coast<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.340> as
