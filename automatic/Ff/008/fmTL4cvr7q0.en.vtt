other hands pull it over like this and
then<00:03:51.199> pull<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:51.979> hair<00:03:52.099> through<00:03:52.310> with<00:03:52.400> this

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
then pull the hair through with this

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.749 
then pull the hair through with this
hand<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.590> keep<00:03:54.859> doing<00:03:55.009> this<00:03:55.220> back<00:03:55.549> and

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:55.759 
hand then I keep doing this back and

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.379 
hand then I keep doing this back and
forth<00:03:55.849> because<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:58.400> pony<00:03:58.639> will<00:03:58.939> not<00:03:59.120> move

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
forth because your pony will not move

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.229 
forth because your pony will not move
when<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.019> done<00:04:00.199> this<00:04:00.500> way<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:03.759> know<00:04:04.759> they're<00:04:05.209> a

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
when it's done this way I know they're a

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.640 
when it's done this way I know they're a
little<00:04:05.299> stretched<00:04:05.689> out<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.109> I<00:04:06.169> got<00:04:06.319> to<00:04:06.439> go<00:04:06.500> that

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
little stretched out so I got to go that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.449 
little stretched out so I got to go that
extra<00:04:06.949> bit<00:04:07.780> but<00:04:08.780> as<00:04:09.169> you<00:04:09.530> can<00:04:09.769> see<00:04:09.979> it<00:04:10.310> is

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
extra bit but as you can see it is

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.770 
extra bit but as you can see it is
exactly<00:04:11.030> where<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:11.989> started<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:13.189> it<00:04:13.430> never

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
exactly where I started it and it never

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.490 
exactly where I started it and it never
moves<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:16.250> also<00:04:16.400> helps<00:04:16.849> to<00:04:17.060> keep<00:04:17.659> my<00:04:18.289> hair<00:04:18.469> from

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
moves it also helps to keep my hair from

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.990 
moves it also helps to keep my hair from
getting<00:04:18.739> tangled<00:04:19.009> up<00:04:19.340> sometimes<00:04:19.759> in<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
getting tangled up sometimes in the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.930 
getting tangled up sometimes in the
ponytail<00:04:20.150> holder<00:04:20.419> um<00:04:20.979> so<00:04:21.979> there<00:04:22.699> you<00:04:22.820> go

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
ponytail holder um so there you go

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.219

brain<00:04:37.310> that's<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.330> best<00:04:38.539> way<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:38.780> can<00:04:38.990> explain

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
brain that's the best way I can explain

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.890 
brain that's the best way I can explain
but<00:04:42.020> for<00:04:42.560> an<00:04:42.650> example<00:04:43.479> we'll<00:04:44.479> just<00:04:44.660> start<00:04:44.810> with

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
but for an example we'll just start with

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.460 
but for an example we'll just start with
pony<00:04:45.229> I've<00:04:45.440> got<00:04:46.720> as<00:04:47.720> your<00:04:47.960> hair<00:04:48.110> reaches<00:04:48.440> a

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
pony I've got as your hair reaches a

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.110 
pony I've got as your hair reaches a
certain<00:04:48.710> light<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.370> can't<00:04:49.610> break<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:49.940> all

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
certain light you can't break it all

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.420 
certain light you can't break it all
behind<00:04:50.240> your<00:04:50.539> head<00:04:50.690> anymore

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
behind your head anymore

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.249 
behind your head anymore
that's<00:04:52.430> just<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.849> way<00:04:52.940> things<00:04:53.000> are<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:56.259> you

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
that's just the way things are so you

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.409 
that's just the way things are so you
start<00:04:57.530> your<00:04:57.560> braid<00:04:57.800> lalala<00:04:58.729> everything's

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
start your braid lalala everything's

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.650 
start your braid lalala everything's
awesome<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.789> then<00:05:01.789> you<00:05:01.940> realize<00:05:02.270> that<00:05:02.300> you

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
awesome and then you realize that you

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.969 
awesome and then you realize that you
can't<00:05:02.930> quite<00:05:03.229> stretch<00:05:03.979> down<00:05:05.080> so<00:05:06.080> what<00:05:06.949> I

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
can't quite stretch down so what I

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.770 
can't quite stretch down so what I
usually<00:05:07.220> do<00:05:07.610> is<00:05:08.470> I<00:05:09.470> get<00:05:09.530> ready<00:05:10.210> like<00:05:11.210> I'm<00:05:11.599> going

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
to do the next one and then when I flip

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.350 
to do the next one and then when I flip
my<00:05:14.500> hands<00:05:15.500> are<00:05:15.650> still<00:05:15.889> there<00:05:16.130> so<00:05:16.430> especially

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
when you're looking in a mirror you can

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.219 
when you're looking in a mirror you can
see<00:05:18.740> what's<00:05:19.280> supposed<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.639> go<00:05:19.759> next<00:05:20.229> so

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229

felt<00:05:24.229> you're<00:05:24.919> going<00:05:25.069> to<00:05:25.130> go<00:05:25.220> behind<00:05:25.729> when<00:05:26.090> you

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
felt you're going to go behind when you

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.839 
felt you're going to go behind when you
flip<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.330> over<00:05:26.479> your<00:05:26.720> shoulder<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:27.759> then<00:05:28.759> you

flip it over your shoulder and then you

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.960 
flip it over your shoulder and then you
just<00:05:29.060> continue<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.449> braid<00:05:29.750> now<00:05:30.970> sometimes

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
just continue to braid now sometimes

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.879 
just continue to braid now sometimes
they'll<00:05:32.300> get<00:05:32.449> a<00:05:32.509> little<00:05:32.690> twisted<00:05:33.020> to<00:05:33.530> one<00:05:33.650> side

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889
