00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
instead of using scrapbooking paper I

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.860 
instead of using scrapbooking paper I
decided<00:04:16.729> to<00:04:16.940> use<00:04:17.030> scrap<00:04:17.359> booking<00:04:17.630> paper

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
decided to use scrap booking paper

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.689 
decided to use scrap booking paper
because<00:04:18.289> it's<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.560> little<00:04:18.709> bit<00:04:18.919> easier<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.579> it

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
because it's a little bit easier and it

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.640 
because it's a little bit easier and it
has<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:19.850> lot<00:04:20.150> of<00:04:20.269> color<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.870> that's<00:04:21.380> something

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
has a lot of color and that's something

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.040 
has a lot of color and that's something
that<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.889> wanted<00:04:22.190> for<00:04:22.340> my<00:04:22.490> project<00:04:22.970> now<00:04:23.750> I'm
