00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.180

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:45.590
 he is practically the darkest now all 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.750
 I will shade this horror with a brush 2 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.459
 buyincoins site figure is an analogue 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.680

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:11.620
 [music] 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.450
 In order to know all the transition I will add 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.260
 a bit of my foundation 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:07.600
 color joints 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:07.600
 [music] 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:37.620
 on top cover it all with powder and here we are 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.780
 a little highlighter is needed for 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.270
 Nephites add and rapidly protruding places

 [music] 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.490

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.560

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.780
 natural face shapes and hide 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.850
 some flaws 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.890
 for example, I have a round face and I 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.960
 she wore a dark tint around the contour 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.940
 that visually give effect with no longer 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.470
 will come but the conduct was more 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.150
