00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.873
 For me, my first assignment to stand in front of the camera was pretty weird and scary. 

00:00:07.947 --> 00:00:12.268
 But I had to learn quickly to turn that button. 

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:17.245
 You stand in front of the camera and the feeling is good. 

00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:20.346
 I really had to learn not to be afraid of the camera. 

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:30.353
 From my first wage I booked a trip to Sri Lanka and the Maldives 

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:34.587
 I like active vacations. I used to go backpacking with friends. 

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:39.123
 I think you experience the true culture of a country in this way and you see how people really live. 

00:00:39.123 --> 00:00:42.588
 If you go back pack you are closer to the people. 

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.049
 But now that I'm a mother it's different, 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:50.594
 now it's about time with your family and that's in a rented house. 

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.985
 We as a family have chosen a vacation in Ibiza because my husband is a DJ. 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.521
 He is often there for his work. 

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.889
 In this way we see each other regularly and he often sees his child. 

00:00:59.972 --> 00:01:06.033
 Ibiza is a nice island. It is good to relax and take a good party every now and then. 

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:08.586
 I think when my son is older, 

00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:11.111
 that we are going to travel and backpack again. 

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:16.712
 Whenever I am in the Netherlands, I always go back to Friesland. 

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:21.444
 It is a very beautiful and peaceful environment where I come from. 

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:28.326
 My best friends are from Friesland, I have known them since I was 10/12 years old. 

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:31.872
 They know where I am from, they know my origin. They understand me. 

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:37.808
 When I was younger, I didn't want to become a fireman or model. 

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:44.511
 I wanted to be a happy woman, living on a hill in the great outdoors. 

00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:47.804
 I always had that image in my head that I wanted to be like that. 

00:01:47.804 --> 00:01:51.124
 I never expected that I would become a model. 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.774
 I did high school because I wanted that piece of paper 

00:01:59.774 --> 00:02:01.293
 and because I wanted to prove myself. 

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:06.535
 But after that I wanted to try different things, different schools. 

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:08.416
 I was thinking of becoming a teacher. 

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.457
 Because I really enjoy working with children. 

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:14.856
 But then I started modeling. 

00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:19.280
 So the choice was actually made for me then and I am very happy with the result. 

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:24.246
 My first time working for Victoria's Secret was at the Hamptons. 

00:02:24.246 --> 00:02:25.802
 I then worked with model Alessandra. 

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:31.754
 Alessandra had been working for Victoria's Secret for eight years. 

00:02:31.754 --> 00:02:34.398
 She really knew what to do. 

00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:39.555
 She moved and posed, and I stood looking at her with my mouth open. 

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:43.897
 Then I came, and I was quite nervous. 

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.308
 You stand there in lingerie with ten other beautiful women, 

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:49.119
 who have not had a child. 

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:57.477
 I then turned on the music and turned the button here. And this worked. 

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:02.096
 I started at Repeat as a model where I worked on a campaign from them. 

00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:05.099
 And now I am involved in their design process. 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.353
 It is a new step. 

00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.310
 It goes beyond wearing their clothes and standing in front of the camera. 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.182
 It is very nice to be able to give my opinion about what I like ... 

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:16.627
 and what I find comfortable to wear. 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.882
 Because I was one of the faces of L'Oréal, it was great to go to Cannes. 

00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:27.842
 Suddenly I was in the line of Eva Longoria and Beyoncé. 

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.729
 That was a great honor. 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.434
 "This route goes straight through the ice" 

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:38.880
 I think it's special that I can play in a movie. 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.934
 Nova Zembla is a film about Gerrit de Veer. 

00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:45.024
 He is a writer who goes on a ship. 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:49.741
 With his journey he wants to prove his love to his muse and beloved Catherine. 

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.479
 I play the role of Catherine. 

00:03:51.748 --> 00:03:53.910
 The purpose in my life has changed. 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.661
 On the one hand, there is nothing more important than your child. 

00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:03.257
 And on the other hand, your child has become the reason you work. 

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:07.143
 It has become your responsibility. 

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:17.291
 When we had it in our hands, we decided it was a Phyllon. 

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:19.473
 He is a Phyllon. 

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:21.864
 My husband came up with the name. 

00:04:21.864 --> 00:04:25.865
 We googled it and I think it means "leaf" in Greek. 

00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:29.774
 Our quality time is meant for the three of us. 

00:04:29.874 --> 00:04:34.706
 Just relax at home or the three of us go to the park. 

00:04:34.706 --> 00:04:37.300
 We just do very relaxed things. 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.529
 This is also good for me and my husband, because we both live a hectic life. 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.405
 He brings peace to our family. 

00:04:45.512 --> 00:04:47.616
 I don't know yet where our son grows up. 

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:50.878
 It is another point that my husband and I are discussing. 

00:04:50.878 --> 00:04:52.788
 We often talk about it, 

00:04:52.788 --> 00:04:57.282
 will it be the Netherlands, New York, Los Angeles or anywhere ... 

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:03.722
 We will spend the coming months in New York. 

00:05:04.276 --> 00:05:08.798
 And if we don't like it, we'll come back to the Netherlands.
