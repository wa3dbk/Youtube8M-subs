00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
this is our new flow meter so the single

essentially<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.589> input<00:01:03.979> your<00:01:04.009> weight<00:01:04.360> and

it<00:01:15.380> will<00:01:15.530> calculate<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:16.750> personal<00:01:17.750> hydration

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
it will calculate a personal hydration

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.210 
during activity against that goal so
that<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.819> can<00:01:38.000> monitor<00:01:38.450> your<00:01:38.750> hydration<00:01:39.220> and

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
that you can monitor your hydration and

that you can monitor your hydration and
see<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.700> you're<00:01:40.850> hydrating<00:01:41.840> optimally<00:01:42.440> to
