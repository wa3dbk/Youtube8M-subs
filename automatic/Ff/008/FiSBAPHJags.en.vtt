00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
happens to be a three-track figuration

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.240 
happens to be a three-track figuration
usually<00:00:23.900> like<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> front<00:00:25.800> has

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
usually like you see on the front has

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.160 
usually like you see on the front has
been<00:00:26.580> two<00:00:26.880> tracks<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.510> then<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.840> back<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
been two tracks and then on the back you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.779 
been two tracks and then on the back you
only<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> four<00:00:29.760> track

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
only see one here with the four track

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.860 
only see one here with the four track
obviously<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.830> back<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> will<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.870> two

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
obviously the back of it will have two

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.470 
obviously the back of it will have two
tracks<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> back<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.550> show<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> little

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
tracks on the back now to show a little

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.540 
tracks on the back now to show a little
bit<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> tracks<00:00:37.200> there's<00:00:37.860> three<00:00:38.190> tracks

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
bit of the tracks there's three tracks

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.020 
motor for the tracks in the front there
is<00:00:43.649> an<00:00:43.770> idler<00:00:45.200> over<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:47.489> cylinder

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
is an idler over here is your cylinder

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.810 
is an idler over here is your cylinder
to<00:00:48.239> adjust<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> height<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> tracks

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
to adjust the height of the tracks

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
to adjust the height of the tracks
that's<00:00:50.820> great<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.300> you're<00:00:51.449> working<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.280> uneven

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that's great if you're working in uneven

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.250 
that's great if you're working in uneven
terrain<00:00:53.730> which<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.390> rarely<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
terrain which we rarely see on the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.430 
terrain which we rarely see on the
street<00:00:56.059> but<00:00:57.059> anyway<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.780> red<00:00:58.020> piece<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.410> see

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
street but anyway this red piece you see

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.080 
street but anyway this red piece you see
right<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> safety<00:00:59.489> basically<00:00:59.940> what

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
right here is a safety basically what

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.520 
right here is a safety basically what
you<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.960> end<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you do is you take that end and you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.470 
you do is you take that end and you
throw<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> down<00:01:02.039> right<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.180> I'll<00:01:03.329> hold

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
throw it down right there and I'll hold

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.740 
throw it down right there and I'll hold
it<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.840> position<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:05.420> conveyor<00:01:06.420> over

the<00:01:18.360> big<00:01:18.540> long<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> see<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.259> here<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the big long one you see right here the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
the big long one you see right here the
two<00:01:21.479> cylinders<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.070> on

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
two cylinders up there you see one on

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530 
two cylinders up there you see one on
this<00:01:23.310> side<00:01:23.520> there's<00:01:23.790> also<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.450> other

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
this side there's also one on the other

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.260 
this side there's also one on the other
side<00:01:24.659> will<00:01:25.470> swing<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.159> conveyor<00:01:26.729> left<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
side will swing the conveyor left to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.289 
side will swing the conveyor left to
right<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:28.259> there<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:29.000> cylinder<00:01:30.000> up

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
right and then there is a cylinder up

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.380 
right and then there is a cylinder up
there<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.369> bring<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.430> conveyor<00:01:33.150> up

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
there which will bring the conveyor up

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
there which will bring the conveyor up
and<00:01:33.600> down

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and down

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
and down
the<00:01:35.790> biggest<00:01:36.090> problem<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.600> machines

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the biggest problem with these machines

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
the biggest problem with these machines
are<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.280> conveyor<00:01:38.610> makes<00:01:38.940> it<00:01:39.060> very

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
are is the conveyor makes it very

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.780 
are is the conveyor makes it very
top-heavy<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:40.050> there<00:01:40.290> they<00:01:41.220> will<00:01:41.400> tip<00:01:41.610> very

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
top-heavy in there they will tip very

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550 
top-heavy in there they will tip very
easily<00:01:42.120> and<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> matter<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.900> fact<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
easily and as a matter of fact one of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800 
easily and as a matter of fact one of
them<00:01:43.800> has<00:01:44.100> tipped<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:45.300> owned<00:01:45.480> by<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
them has tipped not owned by this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
them has tipped not owned by this
company<00:01:46.230> but<00:01:46.440> another<00:01:46.860> company<00:01:47.130> over<00:01:47.550> here<00:01:47.760> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
company but another company over here it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.790 
company but another company over here it
was<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.020> down<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> slope<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
was going down the slope and it

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.370 
was going down the slope and it
basically<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.540> leaned<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.870> way<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.290> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
basically just leaned one way and it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.420 
basically just leaned one way and it

basically just rip up your road you'll
always<00:02:43.860> see<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.310> down<00:02:44.520> because<00:02:44.820> if<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.300> do

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
always see it down because if you do

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.490 
always see it down because if you do
bring<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.720> up<00:02:45.840> while<00:02:46.020> you're<00:02:46.140> milling

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
bring it up while you're milling

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.720 
bring it up while you're milling
everything<00:02:46.920> will<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.160> get<00:02:47.370> shot<00:02:47.700> out

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
everything will just get shot out

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.449 
everything will just get shot out
everywhere

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.449 

and<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:52.200> look<00:02:52.379> there<00:02:52.650> compared<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.280> rest

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
and you look there compared to the rest

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.800 
and you look there compared to the rest
of<00:02:53.519> machine<00:02:53.969> it<00:02:54.150> looks<00:02:54.329> like<00:02:54.480> it's<00:02:54.659> been

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
