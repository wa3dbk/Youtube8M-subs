00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.410 

thicker<00:03:36.020> than<00:03:36.290> some<00:03:36.980> these<00:03:37.610> books<00:03:37.910> I've<00:03:38.150> seen

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
thicker than some these books I've seen

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:58.160 
thicker than some these books I've seen
you<00:03:38.600> in<00:03:38.750> terms<00:03:39.020> of<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.320> paper

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:06.440 

so<00:03:59.490> these<00:04:00.490> are<00:04:00.550> Christ<00:04:01.380> into<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.470> song<00:04:04.290> and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:18.330 
so these are Christ into the song and
one<00:04:07.450> file<00:04:12.030> um<00:04:13.030> yeah<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:14.110> that's<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.940> I<00:04:17.340> guess

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
one file um yeah so that's it I guess
