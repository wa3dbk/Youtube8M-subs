00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
time I don't do it every time you know

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.570 
time I don't do it every time you know
there's<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.869> lot<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.080> times<00:00:19.439> where<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
there's a lot of times where I I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.220 
there's a lot of times where I I
struggle<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.420> weird<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:21.840> it'll<00:00:22.020> come

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
struggle and it's weird how it'll come

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.679 
struggle and it's weird how it'll come
and<00:00:22.380> go<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.500> streaks<00:00:23.269> but<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.330> guess<00:00:24.510> I'll<00:00:24.660> just

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and go in streaks but I guess I'll just
