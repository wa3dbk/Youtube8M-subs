hi everyone we're working on a 2006
Nissan<00:00:04.950> Altima<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:06.020> we're<00:00:07.020> working<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:07.350> the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
Nissan Altima and we're working on the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.720 
Nissan Altima and we're working on the
crankshaft<00:00:07.890> position<00:00:08.280> sensor<00:00:10.250> we<00:00:11.250> had<00:00:11.429> two

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
crankshaft position sensor we had two

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.919 
crankshaft position sensor we had two
codes<00:00:12.380> we<00:00:13.380> had<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> Pio<00:00:14.089> 335<00:00:15.089> which<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.839> the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
codes we had a Pio 335 which is the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.160 
codes we had a Pio 335 which is the
crankshaft<00:00:16.470> position<00:00:16.619> sensor<00:00:17.480> signal<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
crankshaft position sensor signal and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.140 
crankshaft position sensor signal and
then<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.350> had<00:00:19.439> Pio<00:00:19.710> 725<00:00:20.640> engine<00:00:21.210> speed<00:00:21.510> signal

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
then we had Pio 725 engine speed signal

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
then we had Pio 725 engine speed signal
the<00:00:24.150> crankshaft<00:00:24.630> position<00:00:24.689> sensor<00:00:25.400> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the crankshaft position sensor is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.659 
the crankshaft position sensor is
located<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> rear<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.380> engine<00:00:29.510> and<00:00:31.669> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
located in the rear of the engine and is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.530 
located in the rear of the engine and is
back<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> back<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> cylinder<00:00:34.050> block

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
back in the back of the cylinder block

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.700 
back in the back of the cylinder block
up<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.200> area<00:00:38.090> now<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.530> looked<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
up here in this area now I looked at the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.090 
up here in this area now I looked at the
connector<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:44.610> connector<00:00:45.710> has<00:00:46.710> quite<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
connector and the connector has quite a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.450 
connector and the connector has quite a
bit<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> damage<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.500 

if<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.580> look<00:00:55.700> at<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.880> connector<00:00:56.240> there<00:00:56.420> you

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
if you look at the connector there you

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.570 
if you look at the connector there you
can<00:00:56.630> see<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.050> screwdriver<00:00:57.590> scratch<00:00:58.010> marks<00:00:58.430> on

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
can see the screwdriver scratch marks on

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.570 
can see the screwdriver scratch marks on
it<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:59.960> can<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:02.890> here<00:01:03.890> where<00:01:04.190> it's<00:01:04.400> been

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
it you can see here where it's been

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.330 
it you can see here where it's been
pushed<00:01:04.880> in<00:01:05.500> overextended<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:07.130> all

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
pushed in overextended it's all

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.940 
pushed in overextended it's all
scratched<00:01:07.700> up<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.150> here<00:01:08.450> it's<00:01:09.170> very<00:01:09.470> difficult

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
scratched up in here it's very difficult

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.910 
scratched up in here it's very difficult
to<00:01:10.130> slide<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:11.780> was<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.320> position

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
to slide it was in that position

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
to slide it was in that position
that's<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.030> unlock<00:01:14.510> position<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.980> so<00:01:16.760> it's

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
that's the unlock position and so it's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.750 
that's the unlock position and so it's
not<00:01:17.060> connected<00:01:17.570> properly<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:19.310> then<00:01:19.580> when<00:01:19.700> I

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
not connected properly so then when I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.290 
not connected properly so then when I
took<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:20.060> off<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.180> sensor<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.850> sensor<00:01:22.880> has

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
took it off the sensor the sensor has

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.170 
took it off the sensor the sensor has
got<00:01:23.420> all<00:01:23.570> kinds<00:01:23.930> of<00:01:24.020> dirt<00:01:24.610> along<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.940> side

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
got all kinds of dirt along the side

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.910 
got all kinds of dirt along the side
here<00:01:27.010> there<00:01:28.010> is<00:01:28.100> an<00:01:28.220> o-ring<00:01:28.400> right<00:01:28.880> here<00:01:29.920> where

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
here there is an o-ring right here where

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.450 
here there is an o-ring right here where
it's<00:01:31.070> broken<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.610> o-ring<00:01:32.229> if<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.130> flip<00:01:34.340> it

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
it's broken the o-ring if you flip it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.810 
it's broken the o-ring if you flip it
around<00:01:34.550> to<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:34.880> other<00:01:34.970> side

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
around to the other side

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.500 
around to the other side
the<00:01:37.360> o-rings<00:01:37.720> deformed<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.910> center<00:01:40.240> wasn't

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
the o-rings deformed the center wasn't

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.440 
the o-rings deformed the center wasn't
able<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.750> slide<00:01:41.170> all<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.500> way<00:01:41.620> in<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.270> what

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
able to slide all the way in so what

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.360 
able to slide all the way in so what
someone<00:01:43.780> kept<00:01:43.990> doing<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.920> they<00:01:45.100> kept

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
someone kept doing is they kept

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.030 
someone kept doing is they kept
tightening<00:01:45.910> it<00:01:46.030> down<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.770> don't<00:01:47.830> know<00:01:47.980> if

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
tightening it down and I don't know if

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.240 
tightening it down and I don't know if
we<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.280> see<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.520> on<00:01:48.700> this<00:01:48.820> side<00:01:49.060> or<00:01:49.210> not

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
we can see it on this side or not

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.000 
we can see it on this side or not
but<00:01:51.790> they<00:01:51.910> actually<00:01:52.180> cracked<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:53.620> back<00:01:53.800> of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
but they actually cracked the back of

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.250 
but they actually cracked the back of
the<00:01:54.070> housing<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.790> think<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.840> can<00:01:55.990> see<00:01:56.110> the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
the housing I think you can see the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.770 
the housing I think you can see the
crack<00:01:56.530> there<00:01:56.560> where<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:56.980> bolt<00:01:57.190> goes<00:01:57.400> in<00:01:57.780> let

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
crack there where the bolt goes in let

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.819 
crack there where the bolt goes in let
me<00:01:58.870> set<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.290> here

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.270 

there's<00:02:03.400> a<00:02:03.460> crack<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:05.350> alongside<00:02:05.710> here

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
there's a crack right alongside here

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.710 
there's a crack right alongside here
because<00:02:06.579> it<00:02:06.700> wasn't<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.390> they<00:02:07.479> kept

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
because it wasn't in and they kept

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.300 
because it wasn't in and they kept
tightening<00:02:08.170> her<00:02:08.259> down

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
tightening her down

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.900 
tightening her down
so<00:02:11.920> there's<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.010> lot<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.220> technical<00:02:13.459> service

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
so there's a lot of technical service

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.910 
so there's a lot of technical service
things<00:02:14.540> about<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.990> it<00:02:15.140> doesn't<00:02:15.410> apply<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.680> this

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
things about it it doesn't apply to this

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.400 
things about it it doesn't apply to this
particular<00:02:16.250> vehicle<00:02:16.750> they<00:02:17.750> talk<00:02:17.930> about<00:02:18.080> oil

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
particular vehicle they talk about oil

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.260 
particular vehicle they talk about oil
being<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.860> connector<00:02:19.280> there's<00:02:20.060> no<00:02:20.240> oil

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
being the connector there's no oil

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.040 
being the connector there's no oil
inside<00:02:20.959> this<00:02:21.140> connector

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
inside this connector

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.290 
inside this connector
but<00:02:23.560> someone<00:02:23.890> has<00:02:24.070> obviously<00:02:24.120> changed<00:02:25.120> this

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
but someone has obviously changed this

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.370 
but someone has obviously changed this
and<00:02:25.600> what<00:02:26.590> happened<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.070> all<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.430> dirt<00:02:28.380> on

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
and what happened with all this dirt on

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.440 
and what happened with all this dirt on
the<00:02:29.590> outside<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.460> connector<00:02:30.880> cannot<00:02:31.180> plug

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the outside the connector cannot plug

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.860 
the outside the connector cannot plug
all<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> way<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:34.030> once<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.360> plug<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.750> on

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
all the way in then once you plug it on

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.380 
all the way in then once you plug it on
to<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.200> new<00:02:35.350> sensor<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:37.360> green<00:02:37.980> tab<00:02:39.270> when<00:02:40.270> it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.350 
to the new sensor that green tab when it
plugs<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.960> sensor<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:42.580> green<00:02:42.880> lock<00:02:43.120> will

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
plugs on the sensor that green lock will

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.810 
plugs on the sensor that green lock will
snap<00:02:43.690> back<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.650> higher<00:02:44.950> area<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:45.700> it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
snap back to this higher area here it

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.790 
snap back to this higher area here it
will<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:46.030> flush<00:02:46.390> with<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.230> end<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.530> black

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
will be flush with the end of this black

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.730 
will be flush with the end of this black
plastic<00:02:48.010> housing<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.350> was<00:02:50.500> never

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
plastic housing so it was never

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.920 
plastic housing so it was never
connected<00:02:51.250> properly<00:02:51.970> because<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.540> all<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
connected properly because of all the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.710 
connected properly because of all the
dirt<00:02:53.310> inside<00:02:54.310> there<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.210> couldn't<00:02:55.450> connect

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
dirt inside there so it couldn't connect

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.380 
dirt inside there so it couldn't connect
properly<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:57.250> sensor<00:02:57.610> was<00:02:57.760> not<00:02:57.940> installed

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
properly the sensor was not installed

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.290 
properly the sensor was not installed
properly<00:02:59.190> as<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.550> see<00:03:00.700> all<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.940> damage

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
properly as you can see all the damage

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.810 
properly as you can see all the damage
to<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.630> o-ring<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.350> how<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.130> wasn't<00:03:03.310> seated

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
to the o-ring and how it wasn't seated

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.270 
to the o-ring and how it wasn't seated
and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.600> they<00:03:04.750> actually<00:03:05.010> bent<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.250> a

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and then they actually bent this a

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.760 
and then they actually bent this a
little<00:03:06.520> bit<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.000> they<00:03:07.210> cracked<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.870> bolt

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
little bit and they cracked the bolt

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.100 
little bit and they cracked the bolt
that<00:03:08.890> holds<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.660> I've<00:03:10.750> got<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> new

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
that holds it in so I've got a new

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.230 
that holds it in so I've got a new
sensor<00:03:11.470> coming<00:03:11.740> over<00:03:11.920> from<00:03:12.100> Nissan<00:03:12.460> we're

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
sensor coming over from Nissan we're

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.030 
sensor coming over from Nissan we're
going<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.450> put<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.600> new<00:03:13.750> sensor<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.380> clear

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
going to put a new sensor in it clear

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800 
going to put a new sensor in it clear
the<00:03:15.160> code<00:03:15.400> properly<00:03:16.000> install<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.540> connector

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810

the code properly install the connector
clean<00:03:17.620> everything<00:03:18.040> up<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:19.090> should<00:03:19.270> take

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
clean everything up and that should take

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.150 
clean everything up and that should take
care<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.660> this<00:03:19.780> consumers<00:03:20.230> problem<00:03:20.650> but

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
care of this consumers problem but

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.860 
care of this consumers problem but
someone's<00:03:21.460> got<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.760> their<00:03:21.910> work<00:03:22.120> before<00:03:22.300> and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
the work they did before when you look

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.720 
the work they did before when you look
at<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:26.650> connector<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.130> can<00:03:27.280> see<00:03:27.430> it's<00:03:27.550> very

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
at that connector you can see it's very

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.260 
at that connector you can see it's very
substandard<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:30.340> not<00:03:30.580> anything<00:03:30.850> like<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
substandard it's not anything like the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.750 
substandard it's not anything like the
vehicle<00:03:31.750> came<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.160> want<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.430> restore

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
things to the most optimal condition

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
back to a factory standard that's

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.230 
back to a factory standard that's
nowhere<00:03:38.110> close<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:39.340> thank<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.640> very<00:03:39.670> much<00:03:40.030> and
