00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
think they're all pretty much the same

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
think they're all pretty much the same
let's<00:01:15.509> take<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> look<00:01:17.390> ya<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.049> most

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
let's take a look ya think so most

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
let's take a look ya think so most
positions<00:01:20.580> secured<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.210> 13<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.140> game<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
positions secured I got 13 in one game I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.960 
positions secured I got 13 in one game I
think<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.860> was<00:01:23.070> actually<00:01:23.310> my<00:01:23.549> last<00:01:23.580> video

think that was actually my last video
too<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:25.020> that's<00:01:25.259> still<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> same<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> the
