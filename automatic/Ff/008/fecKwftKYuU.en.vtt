00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.490
 cool 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.200
 do it yourself from three turns of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.120
 starbucks 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.830
 The truth is that it is a recipe 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.500
 easy to do and that is fine for 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.970
 the summer since it 's pretty cool 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.189
 it is not found anywhere and it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.630
 resembles quite the loss of English 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.340
 target so if you like the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.990
 cappuccinos with cold drinks 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.990
 stay to watch the video 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.640
 and vanilla ice cream milk and cream 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.700
 to decorate 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.070
 the blender blender and a glass of 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.170
 starbucks that the measures will depend 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.739
 the size of this glass in my case is the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.739
 smaller 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.430
 jam can be strawberry but it is 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.470
 preferable that it be raspberry we throw 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.130
 four tablespoons ice ice cream 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.700
 vanilla and milk and so many spoonfuls 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.680
 how we want jam we beat it now 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.020
 we put it in the glass and to decorate 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.179
 we throw the cream 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.179
 and it really was delicious 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.720
 Instant out serving for milk 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.640
 cold now to the ingredients 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.740
 main we add both with lacquer 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.230
 As I wanted, I added 4 tablespoons 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.230
 we beat it and it's ready to serve 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.450
 we decorate with cream 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.450
 and enjoy 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.690
 Nutella or any other cream 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.820
 hazelnuts and chocolate to the ingredients 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.740
 main we add nutella advised 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.080
 that is not too much because it really fills 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 too much and I have to beat it super 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.150
 super good so there are no stumbling 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.150
 from nutella 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.950
 we throw it in the glass we throw the cream 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.659
 I've seen that it gets better 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.840

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.090
