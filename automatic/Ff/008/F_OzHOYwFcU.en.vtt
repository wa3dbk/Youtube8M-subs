00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.640 
really trying to cut down on what's
going<00:01:15.240> into<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> landfills<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.200> stuff<00:01:16.439> and

going into the landfills and stuff and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.780 
going into the landfills and stuff and
really<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:17.100> trying<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> make<00:01:17.549> something

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
really just trying to make something

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
really just trying to make something
that's<00:01:18.060> good<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> environment<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:19.500> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that's good for the environment which I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.340 
that's good for the environment which I
really<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:21.990> kind<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
really like so we have this kind of

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
really like so we have this kind of
strange<00:01:22.590> contraption<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.250> slides<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
strange contraption that slides out of

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
strange contraption that slides out of
it<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.920> has<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> have

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it and that's because it has to have

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.789 
it and that's because it has to have
both<00:01:26.670> sides<00:01:26.970> open<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.200> window<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> can

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
both sides open so on the window you can

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
both sides open so on the window you can
actually<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.400> headphones<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.659> let<00:01:31.110> me

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
actually see the headphones so let me

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
actually see the headphones so let me
just<00:01:31.320> try<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.950> open<00:01:32.340> I'm<00:01:32.600> not<00:01:33.600> sure

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780

how<00:01:33.900> that's<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> go<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:36.229> just<00:01:37.229> lies<00:01:37.650> up

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
how that's going to go and just lies up

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.370 
how that's going to go and just lies up
like<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> okay<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> headphones

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
like that okay so we have the headphones

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.539 
like that okay so we have the headphones
released<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.390> um<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> inside<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.520> have

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
released and um so on the inside we have

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.660 
released and um so on the inside we have
our<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.619> carrying<00:01:46.619> case<00:01:46.680> along<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.369> our

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
our little carrying case along with our

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.920 
our little carrying case along with our
cable<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.060> cable<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.479> supposed<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
cable and so the cable is supposed to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.999 
cable and so the cable is supposed to
reduce<00:01:52.079> friction<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.820> supposed<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
reduce friction and it's supposed to

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.340 
reduce friction and it's supposed to
also<00:01:56.009> reduce<00:01:56.340> tangling<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.780> we'll<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.320> how

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
also reduce tangling so we'll see how

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.899 
also reduce tangling so we'll see how
that<00:01:58.469> goes<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.310> far<00:01:59.490> I've<00:01:59.610> been<00:01:59.640> pretty
