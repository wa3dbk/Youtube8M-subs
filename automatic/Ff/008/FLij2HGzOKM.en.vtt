take one of these statuses and you will
move<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.190> one<00:03:15.790> space<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.390> any<00:03:16.510> direction<00:03:16.750> if

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
move it one space in any direction if

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.400 
move it one space in any direction if
you<00:03:18.310> move<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.910> balanced

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
you move it to balanced

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.750 
you move it to balanced
you<00:03:21.410> then<00:03:21.650> get<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.070> draw<00:03:22.310> one<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.640> these

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
you then get to draw one of these

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.210 
you then get to draw one of these
quackery<00:03:23.240> cards<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.900> future<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:25.040> are

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
quackery cards in the future you are

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.550 
quackery cards in the future you are
able<00:03:25.460> to<00:03:25.850> play<00:03:26.240> these<00:03:26.480> cards<00:03:26.960> sometimes<00:03:27.350> in

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
able to play these cards sometimes in

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.230 
able to play these cards sometimes in
place<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:27.890> doing<00:03:28.310> an<00:03:28.400> action<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:30.380> example

place of doing an action for example

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.300 
place of doing an action for example
this<00:03:32.240> card<00:03:32.570> here<00:03:32.690> says<00:03:32.990> play<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:33.830> card<00:03:34.130> as

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
this card here says play this card as

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.190 
this card here says play this card as
your<00:03:34.460> treatment<00:03:34.850> action<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.720> black<00:03:35.960> bile

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
your treatment action the black bile

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.020 
your treatment action the black bile
humor<00:03:36.650> becomes<00:03:37.070> balance<00:03:37.490> for<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:37.790> patient

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
humor becomes balance for this patient

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.430 
humor becomes balance for this patient
and<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.420> can<00:03:38.510> no<00:03:38.600> longer<00:03:38.810> become<00:03:39.110> imbalanced

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
and it can no longer become imbalanced

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.890 
and it can no longer become imbalanced
so<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.430> play<00:03:40.610> that<00:03:40.820> car<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.270> just<00:03:41.450> go

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
so you can play that car to just go

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.720 
so you can play that car to just go
ahead<00:03:41.990> and<00:03:42.140> do<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.800> so<00:03:42.920> these<00:03:43.040> cars<00:03:43.310> useful

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
ahead and do it so these cars useful

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.750 
ahead and do it so these cars useful
there's<00:03:44.210> also<00:03:44.420> cards<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.930> say<00:03:44.960> play<00:03:45.380> anytime

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
there's also cards that say play anytime

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.490 
there's also cards that say play anytime
the<00:03:46.760> status<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.690> black<00:03:47.900> bile<00:03:48.110> humor

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
the status of the black bile humor

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.350 
the status of the black bile humor
changes<00:03:48.920> move<00:03:49.130> their<00:03:49.340> black<00:03:49.580> bile<00:03:49.820> humor<00:03:50.150> one

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
changes move their black bile humor one

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.900 
changes move their black bile humor one
more<00:03:50.600> step<00:03:50.870> in<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.140> same<00:03:51.350> direction<00:03:51.580> so<00:03:52.580> those

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
more step in the same direction so those

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.360 
more step in the same direction so those
cards<00:03:53.210> would<00:03:53.270> be<00:03:53.330> played<00:03:53.600> any<00:03:53.840> time<00:03:54.250> but<00:03:55.250> you
