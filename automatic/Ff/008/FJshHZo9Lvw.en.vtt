00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
going to do a video hopefully showing

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.810 
going to do a video hopefully showing
you<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.529> way<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> best<00:00:20.580> way<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you the way I do it and the best way of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.060 
you the way I do it and the best way of
doing<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.240> now<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.350> two<00:00:22.529> or<00:00:22.619> three<00:00:22.859> reasons

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
doing it now it's two or three reasons

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.140 
doing it now it's two or three reasons
why<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.789> cut<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.180> birds<00:00:24.420> nails<00:00:25.760> Warner<00:00:26.760> is

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
why we cut the birds nails Warner is

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.650 
why we cut the birds nails Warner is
that<00:00:27.769> if<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.949> bit<00:00:29.099> nails<00:00:29.369> are<00:00:29.550> too<00:00:29.699> long<00:00:29.730> getting

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
that if a bit nails are too long getting

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
that if a bit nails are too long getting
in<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> nests<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:32.009> pull<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
in and out the nests can pull all the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
in and out the nests can pull all the
nest<00:00:33.120> material<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.829> also<00:00:34.980> when

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
nest material out they can also when

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
nest material out they can also when
you've<00:00:35.820> got<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.390> nest<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.260> hook

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you've got you in the nest it can hook

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.130 
you've got you in the nest it can hook
the<00:00:38.280> birds<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.820> young<00:00:39.180> birds<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.840> hooked

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the birds the young birds can get hooked

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.959 
the birds the young birds can get hooked
at<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.350> nest<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> one<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> main

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
at the nest but the one of the main

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.330 
at the nest but the one of the main
reason<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.750> these<00:00:43.440> nails<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.950> really

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
reason is because these nails get really

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.670 
reason is because these nails get really
sharp<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> end<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.410> actually

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
sharp at the end and they can actually

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610 
sharp at the end and they can actually
pump<00:00:47.010> puncture<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.120> shell<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> egg<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
pump puncture the shell of the egg and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.560 
pump puncture the shell of the egg and
of<00:00:49.680> course<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> egg<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.570> rendered

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of course the egg is then rendered

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.080 
of course the egg is then rendered
useless<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.829> infertile<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.850> won't

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
useless and will be infertile it won't

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.170 
useless and will be infertile it won't
hatch<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.820> before

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
hatch out so this is a time just before

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
hatch out so this is a time just before
we<00:00:57.360> start<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.780> pair<00:00:58.020> our<00:00:58.050> birds<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.579> should

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
we start to pair our birds up we should

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.029 
we start to pair our birds up we should
be<00:00:59.969> start<00:01:00.270> looking<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.170> maintenance<00:01:01.530> not

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
be start looking to do maintenance not

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.700 
be start looking to do maintenance not
only<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> cages<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.470> birds

only on the cages but also on the birds
feet<00:01:05.240> right<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.590> kit<00:01:07.830> required<00:01:08.450> various

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
feet right so the kit required various

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.039 
feet right so the kit required various
cutters<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.710> nail<00:01:10.979> cutters

cutters here you can use nail cutters
and<00:01:13.189> now<00:01:14.189> snips<00:01:15.380> right<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.400> ones<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and now snips right these are the ones I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
and now snips right these are the ones I
like<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> use<00:01:18.210> these<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:18.990> actual<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.680> cutting

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
like to use these are actual for cutting

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.010 
like to use these are actual for cutting
cable<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.299> these<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.960> are

is a bright light.i I can use a torch to
switch<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> torch<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.189> use<00:01:59.520> this

but I don't think you be able to see

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
but I don't think you be able to see
this<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.469> actually<00:02:05.219> when<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.610> hold<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.090> up

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
this but actually when you hold this up

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.059 
this but actually when you hold this up
to<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.930> light<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.829> see

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
to the light you can actually see

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.460 
to the light you can actually see
through<00:02:08.450> through<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.509> actual<00:02:09.750> claw<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.379> you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
through through the actual claw and you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.559 
through through the actual claw and you
can<00:02:10.619> see<00:02:10.950> where<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> vein

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
can see where the vein

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.160 
can see where the vein
the<00:02:12.629> veins<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.609> need<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.939> cut<00:02:15.239> just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
the veins are so you need to cut just

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.270 
the veins are so you need to cut just
before<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.700> vein<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.930> veins<00:02:19.230> they're<00:02:19.620> unique

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
before the vein the veins they're unique

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.970 
before the vein the veins they're unique
you<00:02:20.549> don't<00:02:20.579> put<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.209> right<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.840> vein<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.319> bit

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
you don't put it right to the vein a bit

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.379 
you don't put it right to the vein a bit
before<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.639> then<00:02:23.849> you'll<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.150> no<00:02:24.359> problem

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
before and then you'll have no problem

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.770 
before and then you'll have no problem
so<00:02:25.349> get<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.159> bird<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.579> nice<00:02:26.760> firm<00:02:27.120> grip<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
so get the bird a nice firm grip and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.330 
so get the bird a nice firm grip and
then<00:02:28.469> just<00:02:29.459> take<00:02:30.359> your<00:02:30.629> cutters<00:02:31.049> just<00:02:32.010> before

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
then just take your cutters just before

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.809 
then just take your cutters just before
the<00:02:32.489> end<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.060> cut<00:02:34.049> now<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.069> only<00:02:35.430> really<00:02:35.670> need

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
the end and cut now you only really need
