00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
but let's go to the main concept of this

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.609 
but let's go to the main concept of this
program<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.750> if<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.869> want<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> transfer<00:02:10.319> you

so<00:03:50.430> let<00:03:50.549> me<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:50.730> wait<00:03:50.880> for<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.090> backing<00:03:51.420> up

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
so let me just wait for this backing up

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.309 
so let me just wait for this backing up
all<00:03:54.519> right<00:03:54.909> after<00:03:55.269> it's<00:03:55.629> almost<00:03:56.019> done

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
all right after it's almost done

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.770 
all right after it's almost done
validating<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.069> backup<00:03:57.430> file<00:03:57.700> here<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.659> is

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
validating the backup file here it is

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.220 
validating the backup file here it is
and<00:03:59.049> one<00:03:59.590> point<00:03:59.830> 59<00:04:00.340> gigabytes<00:04:01.000> now<00:04:01.870> it's<00:04:02.049> done

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
and one point 59 gigabytes now it's done

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.080 
and one point 59 gigabytes now it's done
thus<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.890> said<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.220> backup<00:04:03.549> complete<00:04:03.879> click

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
thus it said the backup complete click

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:12.119 
thus it said the backup complete click
on<00:04:04.180> OK<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.769> then<00:04:10.110> after<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.980> can<00:04:12.069> go

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
on OK and then after that you can go

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.880 
on OK and then after that you can go
ahead<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.430> close<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.959> let's<00:04:14.500> go<00:04:14.680> check

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
ahead and close it but let's go check

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.390 
ahead and close it but let's go check
