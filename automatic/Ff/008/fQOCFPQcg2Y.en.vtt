00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.039
 now I want to be right 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.670

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.230
 I stuck my old today 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.390
 honed with rising 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.180
 that makes you really crazy fun 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.370
 to grind the author's stones as he did 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.120
 not only this but with a knife 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.239
 generally without quasi these grinds 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.430

 but I want the right skill 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.370
 Now, let's see it on the rocks 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.399

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.820

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.500
 long talk short sense I have the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.920
 weakest, I could think 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.479
 another challenge and the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.619

 Safe kitchen knives will always be like that 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:29.759
 kitchen crepe between the fingers 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:35.590
 held and disconnected with the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.920

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.390
 a great partner and the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.470
 Kitchen knives always go through the little ones 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.039

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.250
 something announcement so had inter 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:54.759
 we think today we do the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.420
 challenge and connect this challenge 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.720
 with a small profit 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.239
 should be called I want from you puskás 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.929

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:13.510

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.080
 toilet paper I lay that her two 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.090
 I 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.570
 and dan sharp pocket knife for 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.250
 challenge to apologize 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:32.390
 challenge makes me a clean one 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.240
 Cut through in loo paper paper shows 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.080
 The loo paper disappear between 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.070
 forefinger and middle finger and here 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.820
 between thumb and ring finger 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:53.120
 the little finger stays outside 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:57.410
 because of the knife thereby the gap 90 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.020
 degrees angle and pull the same 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:10.070
 the weight of the knife work 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:11.709
 let and how and show it that way 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.180
 passes 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.790
 I have a little hard on now 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.410
 the new idea of ​​the referee 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.750
 will not give a referee 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.989
 I think it's always a bit like that 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.900
 a point of honor that you push this 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.269
 shown because your bags razor sharp 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.840
 I could not control it 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.640
 how normal is the paper with 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.040
 Normally it raises that a bit like that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.920
 Lightweight and leaves the knife to work 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.570
 I do control twenties 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.870
 Could this be a clean one ? 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.100
 cut would be and not frayed or 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.350
