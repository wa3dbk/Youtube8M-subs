forth across the document to read each

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.640 
forth across the document to read each
line<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.500> text<00:01:10.090> this<00:01:11.090> gets<00:01:11.420> tiring<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.440> the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
line of text this gets tiring on the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.969 
line of text this gets tiring on the
eyes<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.820> can<00:01:14.440> difficult<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.680> keep<00:01:15.920> your

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
eyes and can difficult to keep your

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.970 
eyes and can difficult to keep your
place<00:01:16.430> in<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.820> document

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.260 

to<00:01:22.550> address<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.980> a<00:01:24.980> W<00:01:25.520> reader<00:01:25.700> we<00:01:26.000> can

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
to address this in a W reader we can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.620 
to address this in a W reader we can
have<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.050> document<00:01:27.680> reflow<00:01:31.240> which<00:01:32.240> just

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
have the document reflow which just

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.430 
have the document reflow which just
means<00:01:32.870> that<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.230> puts<00:01:33.470> all<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.920> content<00:01:34.490> on

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
means that it puts all the content on

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.730 
means that it puts all the content on
one<00:01:36.440> screen<00:01:36.830> with<00:01:37.130> no<00:01:37.430> horizontal<00:01:38.030> scrollbar

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
one screen with no horizontal scrollbar

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.620 
one screen with no horizontal scrollbar
so<00:01:39.740> in<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:40.070> case<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.850> text<00:01:41.210> is<00:01:41.330> wrapped

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
so in this case the text is wrapped

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.670 
so in this case the text is wrapped
around<00:01:41.870> from<00:01:42.500> line<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.010> line<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.030> that<00:01:44.060> you<00:01:44.330> can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
around from line to line so that you can

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.600 
around from line to line so that you can
vertically<00:01:45.680> scroll<00:01:46.100> through<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.460> document

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
vertically scroll through the document

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.060 
vertically scroll through the document
but<00:01:47.150> you<00:01:47.270> don't<00:01:47.480> have<00:01:47.750> to<00:01:48.080> horizontally

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
but you don't have to horizontally

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.030 
but you don't have to horizontally
scroll<00:01:49.400> this<00:01:50.150> makes<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.600> easier<00:01:50.990> for<00:01:51.350> many

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
scroll this makes it easier for many

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.570 
scroll this makes it easier for many
users<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.730> read<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.120> document

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580
