nutritional profile of a free-range egg
over<00:02:05.090> battery<00:02:05.510> hen<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.870> very<00:02:06.170> very<00:02:06.440> different

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
over battery hen is very very different

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.219 
over battery hen is very very different
the<00:02:07.550> battery<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:08.119> as<00:02:08.330> much<00:02:08.570> higher<00:02:08.840> levels<00:02:09.170> of

saturated fats and things like that so

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.770

about<00:02:37.820> how<00:02:38.000> quickly<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:38.600> get<00:02:38.870> those<00:02:39.020> animals

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440

with<00:02:49.040> grass<00:02:49.280> fed<00:02:49.580> beef<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.690> get<00:02:50.810> all<00:02:50.990> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
with grass fed beef and you get all the

done the age or something on to next if
you<00:03:14.030> grab<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.360> fork<00:03:14.780> right<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.380> just<00:03:15.560> be<00:03:15.770> those

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
you grab a fork right and just be those

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.729 
you grab a fork right and just be those
up<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.459> then<00:03:16.880> we'll<00:03:17.420> panel<00:03:18.200> with<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.440> little

I'm to shop the green cycle that what's

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.110 
I'm to shop the green cycle that what's
the<00:03:38.600> benefits<00:03:38.959> there<00:03:39.170> well<00:03:39.920> coconut<00:03:40.400> oil<00:03:40.610> has

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the benefits there well coconut oil has

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.680 
the benefits there well coconut oil has
got<00:03:41.450> walks<00:03:41.690> with<00:03:42.020> a<00:03:42.050> high<00:03:42.350> burn<00:03:42.620> point<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.000> it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
got walks with a high burn point so it

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.050 
got walks with a high burn point so it
doesn't<00:03:45.080> if<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.890> meet<00:03:46.160> olive<00:03:46.520> oil<00:03:46.730> up<00:03:46.910> to

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
go olive oil but we're going to get too

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.879 
go olive oil but we're going to get too
hot<00:04:30.000> otherwise<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:31.050> said<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:31.320> behaved<00:04:31.560> by<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
hot otherwise you said it behaved by the

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.800 
hot otherwise you said it behaved by the
tram<00:04:32.130> times<00:04:32.430> we<00:04:32.639> don't<00:04:32.849> want<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.150> exactly

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
tram times we don't want that exactly

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.409 
tram times we don't want that exactly
said<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.259> key<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:34.650> not<00:04:34.919> ever<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.580> eat<00:04:36.060> so

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
said the key is not ever and I eat so

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.950 
said the key is not ever and I eat so
I'll<00:04:36.630> go<00:04:36.810> drop<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.139> and<00:04:37.440> peas<00:04:37.650> yeah<00:04:38.960> Happy's

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
I'll go drop this and peas yeah Happy's

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.350 
I'll go drop this and peas yeah Happy's
their<00:04:40.949> legs<00:04:41.190> so<00:04:41.970> they<00:04:42.090> are<00:04:42.270> key<00:04:42.889> 44<00:04:43.889> PP<00:04:44.460> well

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
their legs so they are key 44 PP well

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.610 
their legs so they are key 44 PP well
all<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.320> goons<00:04:46.560> are<00:04:46.979> very<00:04:47.220> high<00:04:47.490> in<00:04:47.520> fiber<00:04:48.210> and

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
all the goons are very high in fiber and

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.830 
all the goons are very high in fiber and
protein<00:04:49.620> so<00:04:50.340> normally<00:04:50.699> have<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:51.180> third

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
protein so normally have a third

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.330 
protein so normally have a third
proteins<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.919> sugars<00:04:53.150> carbohydrate<00:04:54.150> that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
proteins and sugars carbohydrate that

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.070 
proteins and sugars carbohydrate that
the<00:04:56.340> fiber<00:04:56.580> content<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.150> very<00:04:57.389> slowly<00:04:57.780> so

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
the fiber content is very slowly so

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.379 
the fiber content is very slowly so
you're<00:04:58.530> gross<00:04:58.740> nobody's<00:04:59.220> energy<00:04:59.639> and<00:04:59.909> there

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
you're gross nobody's energy and there

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.870 
you're gross nobody's energy and there
anything<00:05:00.870> that's<00:05:01.139> green<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:02.159> has<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.340> benefit

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
anything that's green it has a benefit

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.850 
anything that's green it has a benefit
because<00:05:02.909> it's<00:05:03.419> high<00:05:03.659> in<00:05:03.690> chlorophyll<00:05:04.409> and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
because it's high in chlorophyll and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.290 
because it's high in chlorophyll and
we'll<00:05:05.070> have<00:05:05.190> a<00:05:05.220> slight<00:05:05.550> alkalizing<00:05:06.120> effect

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
we'll have a slight alkalizing effect

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.420 
we'll have a slight alkalizing effect
and<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:06.750> judge<00:05:06.930> people<00:05:07.139> some<00:05:07.500> other<00:05:07.680> pigs<00:05:08.039> let

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
and I judge people some other pigs let

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.210 
and I judge people some other pigs let
you<00:05:08.490> know<00:05:08.610> like<00:05:09.030> when<00:05:09.180> people<00:05:09.419> say<00:05:09.599> you<00:05:10.500> don't

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
think you just cook them for two or

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.190 
think you just cook them for two or
three<00:06:29.910> minutes<00:06:30.300> right<00:06:30.510> at<00:06:30.720> the<00:06:30.810> end<00:06:30.960> of<00:06:31.080> the

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
three minutes right at the end of the

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.470 
three minutes right at the end of the
dish<00:06:31.380> like<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:31.770> is<00:06:31.890> a<00:06:31.919> tie<00:06:32.190> code<00:06:32.490> so<00:06:33.150> they<00:06:33.180> don't

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
dish like it is a tie code so they don't

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.750 
dish like it is a tie code so they don't
screw<00:06:33.780> up<00:06:33.810> too<00:06:34.230> much<00:06:34.410> but<00:06:35.220> for<00:06:35.370> something<00:06:35.640> like

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
screw up too much but for something like

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.920 
screw up too much but for something like
this<00:06:35.820> then<00:06:36.890> it<00:06:37.890> takes<00:06:38.790> less<00:06:39.120> less<00:06:39.480> time<00:06:39.780> to

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
this then it takes less less time to

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.540 
this then it takes less less time to
cook<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.320> if<00:06:40.440> they're<00:06:40.650> if<00:06:40.919> they're<00:06:41.100> precooked
