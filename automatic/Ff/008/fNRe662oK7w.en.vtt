single<00:00:57.070> room<00:00:57.250> mode<00:00:57.460> right<00:00:57.699> yeah<00:00:58.030> okay<00:00:58.809> very

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
single room mode right yeah okay very

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:09.720 
single room mode right yeah okay very
good<00:00:59.109> I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:02.109> it's<00:01:02.199> good

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:28.770

essentially done on purpose to lie to my
watch<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.080> it's<00:01:33.200> actually<00:01:33.320> using<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.890> wall<00:01:34.190> to

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
watch so it's actually using the wall to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.020 
watch so it's actually using the wall to
straighten<00:01:35.600> up<00:01:35.750> I<00:01:35.930> on<00:01:36.170> such<00:01:36.440> as<00:01:36.620> keep<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.100> up

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.610 

because<00:01:41.030> exact<00:01:41.570> same<00:01:41.750> thing<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.140> love<00:01:42.380> was<00:01:42.590> a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
because exact same thing I love was a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:55.780 
because exact same thing I love was a
bit<00:01:42.860> flash<00:01:43.160> but<00:01:43.550> i<00:01:43.850> probably<00:01:44.540> have<00:01:54.490> 10<00:01:55.490> was

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
bit flash but i probably have 10 was

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.600 
bit flash but i probably have 10 was
real<00:01:59.590> all<00:02:00.590> right<00:02:00.800> we'll<00:02:01.160> see<00:02:01.340> what<00:02:01.460> happens

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
real all right we'll see what happens

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:14.809 
real all right we'll see what happens
yeah

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:23.860

they're<00:03:00.750> coming<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.200> those

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.270 

Oh

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.730 

one<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:15.970> witnessed<00:03:16.450> up<00:03:16.630> this<00:03:16.810> microprocessor

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.160 

fifth<00:03:20.740> is<00:03:20.890> also<00:03:21.160> another<00:03:21.280> pic<00:03:21.990> think<00:03:22.990> is<00:03:23.140> a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
fifth is also another pic think is a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.590 
fifth is also another pic think is a

general class of microprocessors they're

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.630 
general class of microprocessors they're
very<00:03:25.900> expensive<00:03:26.230> very<00:03:26.560> powerful<00:03:27.190> using<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.490> lot

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
very expensive very powerful using a lot

for<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:35.700> you're<00:03:36.700> doing<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.030> for<00:03:37.060> remote<00:03:37.690> with

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
for this you're doing it for remote with

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.309 
for this you're doing it for remote with
furniture

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.250 

for<00:03:42.890> three<00:03:43.129> years<00:03:43.159> to<00:03:43.459> say<00:03:43.730> about<00:03:44.269> just<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.870> very

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
for three years to say about just a very

00:03:45.260 --> 00:04:06.729 
for three years to say about just a very
short<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:05.599> this<00:04:05.750> new<00:04:05.930> piece<00:04:06.139> is<00:04:06.319> not<00:04:06.530> being

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
short so this new piece is not being

00:04:06.739 --> 00:05:15.420 
short so this new piece is not being
properly<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.579> power<00:04:07.969> yeah

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.360 

Laura<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.749> between<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.439> Arbat<00:05:18.949> because

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
Laura this is between the Arbat because

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.790 
Laura this is between the Arbat because
I<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.840> walking<00:05:20.840> robot<00:05:21.199> I<00:05:21.759> ever<00:05:22.759> say<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.800> anyway

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
I the walking robot I ever say it anyway

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.080 
I the walking robot I ever say it anyway
so<00:05:24.830> we<00:05:26.379> we<00:05:27.379> put<00:05:27.680> all<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.069> parts<00:05:28.400> at<00:05:28.610> home<00:05:28.789> it's

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
so we we put all the parts at home it's

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.219 
so we we put all the parts at home it's
made<00:05:29.419> mostly<00:05:29.839> on<00:05:29.960> balloon<00:05:30.289> put<00:05:30.919> it<00:05:31.009> all<00:05:31.159> out<00:05:31.189> on

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
made mostly on balloon put it all out on

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.739 
made mostly on balloon put it all out on
water<00:05:33.229> jet<00:05:33.469> so<00:05:33.800> we<00:05:33.919> prep<00:05:34.189> oh<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.849> you<00:05:35.210> didn't

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:35.749 
water jet so we prep oh and you didn't

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:40.809 
water jet so we prep oh and you didn't
add<00:05:36.009> solvers<00:05:37.009> and<00:05:37.789> we<00:05:37.909> converted<00:05:38.120> it<00:05:39.550> is<00:05:40.550> heavy

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
add solvers and we converted it is heavy

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.279 
add solvers and we converted it is heavy
so<00:05:41.499> we<00:05:42.499> cut<00:05:42.860> out<00:05:43.039> a<00:05:43.249> line<00:05:43.550> in<00:05:43.699> SolidWorks

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
so we cut out a line in SolidWorks

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.999 
so we cut out a line in SolidWorks
converted<00:05:45.289> it<00:05:45.379> cut<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:45.740> out<00:05:45.860> a<00:05:46.699> water<00:05:47.419> jet<00:05:48.009> put

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
converted it cut it out a water jet put

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.429 
converted it cut it out a water jet put
together<00:05:49.339> using<00:05:49.729> a<00:05:50.029> color<00:05:50.539> trip<00:05:50.900> it's<00:05:51.199> an

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 
together using a color trip it's an

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.999 
together using a color trip it's an
eight-core<00:05:52.389> microprocessor<00:05:53.389> which<00:05:53.749> had<00:05:54.680> some

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
eight-core microprocessor which had some

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.270 
eight-core microprocessor which had some
serious<00:05:55.490> pluses<00:05:56.389> and<00:05:56.419> minuses

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
serious pluses and minuses

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.610 
serious pluses and minuses
Thanks<00:05:58.240> being<00:05:58.450> rather<00:05:58.780> did<00:05:59.050> with<00:05:59.260> the<00:05:59.350> program

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
Thanks being rather did with the program
