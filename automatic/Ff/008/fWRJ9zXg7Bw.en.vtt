they're going to take the web next week
I<00:01:44.520> expect<00:01:44.819> to<00:01:44.850> see<00:01:44.999> some<00:01:45.029> teams<00:01:45.359> starting<00:01:45.659> to

some clear frontrunners of whom

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.599 
some clear frontrunners of whom
hopefully<00:01:49.709> we'll<00:01:49.829> start<00:01:50.069> seeing<00:01:50.219> some<00:01:50.459> shot

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609
