announcing price drop I think the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
announcing price drop I think the
pricing<00:00:53.129> conversations<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.390> at

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the other end of the spectrum not at our

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.670 
the other end of the spectrum not at our
end<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> spectrum<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.899> from<00:00:58.230> our<00:00:58.320> point<00:00:58.559> of

thats it for that closed room and figure
out<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.310> possibilities<00:01:53.850> were<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.600> how<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
out what possibilities were and how it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120 
out what possibilities were and how it
could<00:01:54.990> work<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.440> we<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.649> obviously<00:01:55.770> working

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
could work and we are obviously working

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.790 
could work and we are obviously working
on<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:56.910> probably<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.110> shouldn't

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.499 
on that now but probably not I shouldn't
probably<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.280> talking<00:01:59.490> exactly<00:01:59.759> about<00:02:00.060> how<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
probably be talking exactly about how it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.320 
probably be talking exactly about how it
will<00:02:00.690> work<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.410> we're<00:02:01.649> we're<00:02:02.100> ready<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.050 
will work and so we're we're ready to to
reveal<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.910> great

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

question<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> fair<00:02:07.050> question<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:08.340> think<00:02:09.149> it

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
question it's a fair question I think it

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.360 
question it's a fair question I think it
really<00:02:09.270> speaks<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.020> opportunity<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.280> we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
really speaks to the opportunity that we

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.440 
really speaks to the opportunity that we
have<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.670> front<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.970> us<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.270> why<00:02:12.390> this

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
partnership is so important and why it's

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.979 
partnership is so important and why it's
very<00:02:14.489> different<00:02:14.820> than<00:02:15.090> anything<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.930> we've

this platform and technology exists that

could deliver a story in a different
kind<00:03:52.519> of<00:03:52.610> way<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.820> mean<00:03:53.060> in<00:03:53.150> there<00:03:53.269> since<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
kind of way I mean in there since the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.789 
kind of way I mean in there since the
lord<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.900> rings<00:03:54.110> with<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.350> little<00:03:54.500> bit<00:03:54.650> like

lord of the rings with a little bit like

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.590 
lord of the rings with a little bit like
that<00:03:54.980> because<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.489> know<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:55.910> usually<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.450> was

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
that because you know and usually it was

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.020 
that because you know and usually it was
three<00:03:56.900> films<00:03:57.410> there<00:03:57.709> was<00:03:57.860> no<00:03:58.070> one<00:03:58.670> two<00:03:58.880> and

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
three films there was no one two and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.690 
three films there was no one two and
three<00:03:59.380> combined<00:04:00.380> one<00:04:00.769> year<00:04:00.980> apart<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.459> tell<00:04:01.670> a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
three combined one year apart to tell a

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.300 
three combined one year apart to tell a
story<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:02.840> needed<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.410> be<00:04:03.560> three<00:04:03.829> films<00:04:04.160> you

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
story I needed to be three films you

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.289 
story I needed to be three films you
couldn't<00:04:04.579> have<00:04:04.670> done<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.850> as<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.030> traditional

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
couldn't have done it as a traditional

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.530 
couldn't have done it as a traditional
film<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.200> so<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.400> know<00:04:07.430> we've<00:04:07.820> got<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.450> many

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
film and so you know we've got so many

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.750 
film and so you know we've got so many
ideas<00:04:08.660> for<00:04:09.140> stories<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.739> some<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.610> ideas

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
ideas for stories and some of the ideas

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.860 
ideas for stories and some of the ideas
are<00:04:11.239> going<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.480> be

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
are going to be

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.809 
are going to be
absolutely<00:04:12.830> become<00:04:13.129> films<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.730> will

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
absolutely become films and will

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.309 
absolutely become films and will
continue<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.180> make<00:04:14.330> films<00:04:14.690> but<00:04:14.870> there<00:04:15.110> are

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
continue to make films but there are

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.080 
continue to make films but there are
other<00:04:15.650> ideas<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.280> we<00:04:16.400> have<00:04:16.579> four<00:04:16.790> stories

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
other ideas that we have four stories

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.219 
other ideas that we have four stories
which<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:18.680> particular<00:04:19.639> medium<00:04:20.449> is<00:04:20.600> possibly

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
which this particular medium is possibly

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.590 
which this particular medium is possibly
a<00:04:21.320> much<00:04:21.500> more<00:04:21.650> interesting<00:04:21.949> way<00:04:22.370> of

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
a much more interesting way of

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.360 
a much more interesting way of
delivering<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.900> story<00:04:24.199> so<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.590> don't<00:04:24.860> imagine

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
delivering that story so I don't imagine

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.030 
delivering that story so I don't imagine
beat<00:04:25.669> these<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.240> not<00:04:26.780> you<00:04:26.990> know<00:04:27.020> based<00:04:27.770> on

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
beat these and not you know based on

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.100 
beat these and not you know based on
their<00:04:28.729> not<00:04:28.820> interactive<00:04:29.419> experiences<00:04:29.930> based

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
their not interactive experiences based

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.170 
their not interactive experiences based
on<00:04:30.380> films<00:04:30.830> we're<00:04:31.580> going<00:04:31.729> to<00:04:31.790> make<00:04:31.910> either<00:04:32.090> a

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
on films we're going to make either a

on films we're going to make either a
film<00:04:32.570> or<00:04:33.340> one<00:04:34.340> of<00:04:34.370> these<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.790> know<00:04:34.880> what<00:04:35.000> I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
film or one of these you know what I

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.430 
film or one of these you know what I
mean<00:04:35.090> that's<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.540> that's<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.960> two<00:04:36.169> different

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
mean that's it that's the two different

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.530 
mean that's it that's the two different
things
