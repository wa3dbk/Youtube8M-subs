the corners and everything that roll bar

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.430 
the corners and everything that roll bar
was<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.360> tucked<00:00:39.600> up<00:00:39.840> right<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.260> in

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
was going to be tucked up right up in

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.650 
was going to be tucked up right up in
there<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.790> either<00:00:41.910> gonna<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> cut

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
there so I was either gonna have to cut

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.279 
there so I was either gonna have to cut
it<00:00:42.809> off<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:44.180> make<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.329> look<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.930> or

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it off and make it look like or

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.819 
it off and make it look like or
figure<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.829> something<00:00:47.340> else<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.820> did

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
figure out something else so what I did

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.040 
figure out something else so what I did
since<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> dash<00:00:50.309> pad<00:00:50.700> itself<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.600> actually

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
since the dash pad itself is actually

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.090 
since the dash pad itself is actually
made<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.469> fiberglass<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:54.500> then<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.980> know

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
made out of fiberglass and then you know

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.689 
made out of fiberglass and then you know
coated<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.670> foam<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> vinyl<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.550> flipped<00:00:59.550> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
coated in foam and vinyl I flipped it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.830 
coated in foam and vinyl I flipped it
over<00:00:59.850> when<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> took<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:02.809> cut<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
over when I took it out and cut the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.649 
over when I took it out and cut the
patterns<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> inside<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.939> cut<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
patterns in it from the inside and cut a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.200 
patterns in it from the inside and cut a
bunch<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:09.530> fiberglass<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:11.210> following

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
bunch of the fiberglass out following

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.510 
bunch of the fiberglass out following
the<00:01:12.270> same<00:01:12.540> pattern<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.229> along<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> same<00:01:14.280> route

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the same pattern or along the same route

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.560 
the same pattern or along the same route
of<00:01:14.700> where<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.320> door<00:01:16.320> bars<00:01:16.590> were<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> be

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
of where the door bars were going to be

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.100 
of where the door bars were going to be
and<00:01:18.680> wound<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.770> pulling<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.369> foam<00:01:20.610> out

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
and wound up pulling a lot of foam out

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.170 
and wound up pulling a lot of foam out
so<00:01:22.110> cars<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.159> clean<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.430> looking<00:01:23.759> pretty<00:01:23.970> now

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
so cars all clean and looking pretty now

disguise because now I can actually put

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
disguise because now I can actually put
it<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> take<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:51.920> amazingly<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:54.079> dash

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
it in and take it out amazingly the dash

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.859 
it in and take it out amazingly the dash
pad<00:01:55.439> itself<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.100> actually<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.850> old<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> car

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
pad itself is actually as old as the car

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.420 
pad itself is actually as old as the car
stop<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> original<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> came<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
stop the original but it came out of

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.590 
stop the original but it came out of
another<00:01:59.700> 70<00:02:00.270> Chevelle<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:03.090> vinyls<00:02:03.450> like

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
another 70 Chevelle and the vinyls like

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.929 
another 70 Chevelle and the vinyls like
new<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.290> didn't<00:02:04.590> split<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.880> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
new so it didn't split it and it this is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.360 
new so it didn't split it and it this is
what<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.270> looks<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:11.129> know<00:02:11.160> obviously

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
what it looks like so you know obviously

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.610 
what it looks like so you know obviously
I'll<00:02:11.910> touch<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.390> later<00:02:12.720> oh<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
I'll touch that up later oh I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.530 
I'll touch that up later oh I
I know<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.099> kind<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.400> weld<00:02:14.640> plastic<00:02:15.299> in<00:02:15.480> a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
I know you can kind of weld plastic in a

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.050 
I know you can kind of weld plastic in a
way<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.780> I'll<00:02:16.680> probably<00:02:17.000> figure<00:02:18.000> out

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
way so I'll probably figure out

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.119 
way so I'll probably figure out
something<00:02:18.390> put<00:02:18.569> right<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.930> there<00:02:21.890> either<00:02:22.890> when

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
something put right in there either when

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.009 
something put right in there either when
I<00:02:23.159> get<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.549> resources<00:02:24.269> or<00:02:24.420> find<00:02:24.659> somebody

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
I get the resources or find somebody

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.920 
I get the resources or find somebody
who's<00:02:25.349> willing<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:26.180> do<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.390> which<00:02:27.599> I'm<00:02:27.750> hoping

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
who's willing to do it which I'm hoping

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.710 
who's willing to do it which I'm hoping
I'll<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.319> find<00:02:28.530> somebody<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.700> got<00:02:30.599> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
I'll just find somebody because I got to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.119 
I'll just find somebody because I got to
get<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.959> done<00:02:31.230> before<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> car

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
get this done before I get the car

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.580 
get this done before I get the car
painted<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:32.640> I'm<00:02:32.819> going<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.030> put<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:34.409> gussets

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
painted but I'm going to put the gussets

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.470 
painted but I'm going to put the gussets
here<00:02:34.980> with<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.250> speed<00:02:35.489> holes<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.940> both<00:02:35.970> sides

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
here with the speed holes on both sides

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.420 
here with the speed holes on both sides
so<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.870> kind<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.140> boxes<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.739> sanitizes<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
so it kind of boxes and sanitizes it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.300 
so it kind of boxes and sanitizes it
into<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> actual<00:02:39.060> body<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.750> car<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:41.099> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
into the actual body of the car and I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.670 
into the actual body of the car and I
decided<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.030> I'll<00:02:42.840> actually<00:02:42.989> make<00:02:43.319> a<00:02:43.379> piece

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
decided that I'll actually make a piece

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.150 
decided that I'll actually make a piece
that<00:02:43.709> goes<00:02:43.950> for<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.489> bar<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:46.500> area<00:02:46.799> here

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
that goes for the bar to this area here

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
that goes for the bar to this area here
along<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> door<00:02:47.760> jamb<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.420> comes<00:02:48.840> down<00:02:48.959> to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
along the door jamb and comes down to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.910 
along the door jamb and comes down to
here<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.510> I'll<00:02:51.599> just<00:02:51.660> completely<00:02:52.170> box<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.739> in

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
here so I'll just completely box that in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.470 
here so I'll just completely box that in
as<00:02:53.040> well<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.370> do<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> opposite<00:02:54.269> side

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
as well and do it on the opposite side

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:03.470 
as well and do it on the opposite side
as<00:02:54.750> well<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:59.569> yeah<00:03:00.569> it's<00:03:00.780> how<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.799> fits<00:03:02.480> I'll

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
as well so yeah it's how it fits I'll

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.110 
as well so yeah it's how it fits I'll
probably<00:03:04.310> put<00:03:05.310> something<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.730> there<00:03:05.879> too<00:03:05.970> will

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
probably put something in there too will

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.550 
probably put something in there too will
do<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.420> as<00:03:06.569> well

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.740 

when<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.890> gussets<00:03:11.340> it'll<00:03:11.609> it'll<00:03:12.450> cover

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
when I get the gussets it'll it'll cover

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.569 
when I get the gussets it'll it'll cover
most<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.109> this<00:03:13.230> area<00:03:13.470> I'll<00:03:13.650> have<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.950> where<00:03:14.489> it

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
most of this area I'll have it where it

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.130 
most of this area I'll have it where it
branches<00:03:14.909> off<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.329> comes<00:03:15.690> into<00:03:15.870> there<00:03:16.049> and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
branches off and comes into there and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.250 
branches off and comes into there and
completely<00:03:16.530> covers<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:20.630> got<00:03:21.630> my<00:03:21.780> floor<00:03:22.019> pans

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
completely covers that got my floor pans

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.259 
completely covers that got my floor pans
back<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.709> or<00:03:22.889> my<00:03:22.980> floor<00:03:23.220> mats<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.000> buddy<00:03:24.209> of

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
mine made for me so this here's the

mine made for me so this here's the
other<00:03:31.260> side<00:03:34.910> again<00:03:35.910> same<00:03:36.269> thing<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.690> got<00:03:36.810> that

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
other side again same thing I got that

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.589 
other side again same thing I got that
cut<00:03:37.319> just<00:03:37.590> right<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.150> said<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.450> same

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
cut just right like I said the same

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.210 
cut just right like I said the same
thing<00:03:39.660> I'll<00:03:40.079> make<00:03:40.230> another<00:03:40.470> panel<00:03:40.859> here<00:03:41.040> cut

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
thing I'll make another panel here cut

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.949 
thing I'll make another panel here cut
that<00:03:41.400> out<00:03:41.459> so<00:03:41.970> if<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.150> ever<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.510> take<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
that out so if I ever have to take the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.289 
that out so if I ever have to take the
dash<00:03:43.199> out<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:44.400> drop<00:03:44.609> one<00:03:44.639> in<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.180> actually

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
dash out I can drop one in and actually

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.689 
dash out I can drop one in and actually
pull<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.780> out<00:03:48.169> yeah<00:03:49.169> I'll<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.349> box<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.519> in

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
pull it out yeah I'll just box that in

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:57.170 
pull it out yeah I'll just box that in
here<00:03:51.000> here<00:03:55.099> yeah<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.400> think<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.819> fits<00:03:57.000> pretty

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
here here yeah I think it fits pretty

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.830 
here here yeah I think it fits pretty
good<00:03:57.299> oh<00:03:57.750> yeah<00:03:59.090> you<00:04:00.090> can<00:04:00.239> kind<00:04:00.419> of<00:04:00.540> see<00:04:00.720> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
good oh yeah you can kind of see the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.270 
good oh yeah you can kind of see the
wrinkle<00:04:01.199> right<00:04:01.379> there<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.949> think<00:04:02.010> it's

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
wrinkle right there it's I think it's

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.159 
wrinkle right there it's I think it's
split<00:04:02.639> on<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.030> inside<00:04:03.389> of<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:06.169> fiberglass

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
split on the inside of the fiberglass

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.770 
split on the inside of the fiberglass
how<00:04:08.069> about<00:04:08.579> this<00:04:08.760> area<00:04:09.120> right<00:04:09.329> here<00:04:09.389> but<00:04:09.720> it

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
how about this area right here but it

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.990 
how about this area right here but it
didn't<00:04:09.989> go<00:04:10.139> all<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.379> way<00:04:10.560> across

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
didn't go all the way across

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.280 
didn't go all the way across
we<00:04:12.000> just<00:04:12.239> fine<00:04:12.449> though<00:04:12.660> but<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.870> allowed<00:04:13.109> this

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
we just fine though but it allowed this

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.210 
we just fine though but it allowed this
tube<00:04:13.470> in<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.680> right<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.400> fit<00:04:14.609> in<00:04:14.760> there<00:04:15.169> so

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
tube in just right and fit in there so

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.550 
tube in just right and fit in there so
anyway<00:04:17.539> that's<00:04:18.539> what<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.989> car<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.199> looking

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
anyway that's what the car is looking

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.900 
anyway that's what the car is looking
like<00:04:19.709> right<00:04:19.949> now<00:04:20.099> I<00:04:20.130> got<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.519> as<00:04:20.639> clean<00:04:20.880> as

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
like right now I got it as clean as

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.270 
like right now I got it as clean as
possible<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.900> looks<00:04:22.109> pretty<00:04:22.320> good

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.110 

I<00:04:25.480> think<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.570> plan<00:04:26.810> is<00:04:27.670> when<00:04:28.670> I<00:04:28.700> meet<00:04:28.850> up<00:04:29.000> with

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
I think the plan is when I meet up with

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.210 
I think the plan is when I meet up with
the<00:04:29.210> old<00:04:29.360> man<00:04:29.570> he<00:04:30.170> comes<00:04:30.410> back<00:04:30.620> for<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.920> week<00:04:31.040> or

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
the old man he comes back for a week or
