the corner and then maybe put your
printer<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.880> closet<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.689> around<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> corner

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
printer in a closet or around the corner

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590 
printer in a closet or around the corner
in<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.159> different<00:01:32.610> room<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.509> can

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
in a different room and then you can

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.090 
in a different room and then you can
hook<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> scanner<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> everything<00:01:34.770> else<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
hook up a scanner and everything else to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
hook up a scanner and everything else to
it<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.340> speed<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.290> spot-on

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
it now the speed with this is spot-on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.450 
it now the speed with this is spot-on
that's<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.189> getting<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> little

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that's right I'm getting a little

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
that's right I'm getting a little
British<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.030> spot<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.439> thing

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
British here it's spot on the one thing

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.370 
British here it's spot on the one thing
you'll<00:01:40.770> notice<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.159> wired<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.380> don't

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you'll notice is that wired I don't

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.179 
you'll notice is that wired I don't
thing<00:01:43.500> you're<00:01:43.619> going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> notice<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
thing you're going to notice it is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.770 
thing you're going to notice it is
faster<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.610> when<00:01:44.729> you're<00:01:44.850> using<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.270> hard<00:01:45.570> drive

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
faster is when you're using a hard drive

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
faster is when you're using a hard drive
it<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.350> faster<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:46.799> wired<00:01:47.220> so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
it is a little faster to use wired so

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.639 
it is a little faster to use wired so
having<00:01:48.659> said<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.930> everything<00:01:49.439> else<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
having said that everything else is

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
having said that everything else is
going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> seem<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> exact<00:01:51.119> same<00:01:51.299> speed

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
going to seem like the exact same speed

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.539 
going to seem like the exact same speed
the<00:01:52.049> speed<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.500> printer<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.159> speed<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the speed of a printer the speed of a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.060 
the speed of a printer the speed of a
scanner<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.840> speed<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.290> game<00:01:55.649> controller

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
scanner the speed of a game controller

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.800 
scanner the speed of a game controller
there's<00:01:56.520> another<00:01:56.820> idea<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.240> you're<00:01:57.600> someone
