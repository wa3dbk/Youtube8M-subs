00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 in Ukraine for products of sanitary ware 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.390
 the fact that Ukrainian goods until recently 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 of time were cheaper than Russian celebrate 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.889
 both Russians and Ukrainians are frequent guests 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.780
 northern neighbor but now swim in 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.030
 Kharkov already has no meaning after 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.230
 the collapse of the ruble and the devaluation of the hryvnia price 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.140
 almost equal 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.000
 before the start of all these events I was watching 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.710
 which is one and a half times cheaper in 1 and 3 in 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.380
 one and a half times cheaper than any kind 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.880
 tools I went to buy them compared 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.689
 prices and now it is Kharkov in one and a half 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.669
 times more expensive 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.320
 hryvnia-ruble devaluation race 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.510
 some sort of really equated 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.820
 situation and wait for major changes in 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.320
 exports should not be considered economists but 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.900
 here rejoice in economic problems 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.339
 neighbor especially Kharkovites not worth it 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.350
 the first capital is quite a lot 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.390
 enterprises with Russian capital and 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.879
 if we consider that the current fall of the ruble 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.620
 only the beginning of the crisis is worth thinking about 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.089
 business reorientation is needed 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.729
 diversify if we talk about 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.489
 enterprises their markets because 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.790
 Today we understand that the Russian market 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.519
 he is his alternet and need alternative 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.549
 sources because we see and devaluation 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.130
 and political risks so i'm for 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.240
 so that u say so even more 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.729
 integrate into the world economic 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.720
 space but if you consider that this 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.100
 the process is long and requires 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.930
 significant resources 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.060
 foreign investment to forget about 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.040
 Russian partners are also not worth it 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.050
 this marks bering Russians capital 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.390
 which is in particular in Kharkov 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.520
 seeing European perspectives will support 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.530
 this opportunity to significantly lose weight 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.900
 maybe about the pocket of those who rush on 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.180
 Russian territory for a while while their 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.860
 the flow is not excised but with the crisis the situation 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.220
 unlikely to remain unchanged 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.480
 male population of Ukraine 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.900
 Many men go to Russia and I know that 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.500
 my husband was approached he works in 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.230
 trade asked some work 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.260
 Earnings here is a question this is big 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.540
 I think the question will still hold those 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.540
 who work still hold out 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.500
 I think the market will be very limited 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.729
 labor 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.470
 unavailable Russian labor market for 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.120
 many Ukrainians will be and thanks 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.650
 patent that recently 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.390
 Dmitry announced his article 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.080
 Medvedev want to lead for labor 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.019
 migrants 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.459
 true this measure is a double-edged sword 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.410
 of course there will be more jobs for 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.810
 Russians who may period of crisis 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.760
 replace the Ukrainian workers but 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.950
 Ukrainians are reoriented and not only 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.260
 because of patents there will be no economic 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.989
 our benefits will also be with 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.319
 find employment in a place I think 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.880
 on the contrary, Russia will lose on this because 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.769
 which is one of the cheapest 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.410
 workers are our specialists 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.650
 because of the difference that existed in 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.349
 payment there is a little higher and here a little 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.200
 there the north paid well and here 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.880
 Of course, less people earned here 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.680
 while can strike thoroughly 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.989
 Russian crisis is so small 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.239
 smugglers excise banks 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.890
 canned goods or cigarettes for the price go 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.200
 flush or even exceed 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.459
 Ukrainian analogs of the Aksa now order 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.959
