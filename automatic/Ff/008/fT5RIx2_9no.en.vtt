00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
so here's everything right here this is

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.860 
so here's everything right here this is
the<00:00:47.559> wind<00:00:47.770> chest<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:49.420> all<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.660> holes

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
the wind chest there's all the holes

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.200 
the wind chest there's all the holes
pipes<00:00:50.650> sit<00:00:51.010> on<00:00:51.100> here<00:00:51.400> and<00:00:51.489> there's<00:00:51.640> a<00:00:51.790> valves

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
pipes sit on here and there's a valves

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.710 
pipes sit on here and there's a valves
in<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:52.960> electric<00:00:53.379> action<00:00:53.739> inside<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:55.270> uses

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
in the electric action inside it uses

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.150 
in the electric action inside it uses
Reisner<00:00:56.579> 90<00:00:57.579> ohm<00:00:58.080> magnets<00:00:59.080> and<00:00:59.830> you<00:00:59.890> send<00:01:00.100> a

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
Reisner 90 ohm magnets and you send a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.070 
Reisner 90 ohm magnets and you send a
current<00:01:00.370> through<00:01:00.580> it<00:01:00.699> magnet<00:01:01.449> closes<00:01:01.900> and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
current through it magnet closes and

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.730 
current through it magnet closes and
lets<00:01:02.830> air<00:01:03.129> out<00:01:03.309> through<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.610> hole<00:01:04.530> huge<00:01:05.530> the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
lets air out through the hole huge the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.790 
lets air out through the hole huge the
keyboard<00:01:06.160> I<00:01:06.220> made<00:01:06.430> it's<00:01:07.060> not<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.830> good<00:01:10.800> makes

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
keyboard I made it's not that good makes

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.999 
keyboard I made it's not that good makes
a<00:01:11.979> lot<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.190> noise<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:13.450> mean<00:01:14.380> I<00:01:14.470> built<00:01:14.710> this

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
a lot of noise I mean I built this

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.639 
a lot of noise I mean I built this
little<00:01:15.250> action<00:01:15.850> here<00:01:16.090> with<00:01:16.539> the<00:01:16.690> key<00:01:17.110> contacts

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
little action here with the key contacts

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.980 
little action here with the key contacts
were<00:01:18.430> made<00:01:18.550> pretty<00:01:19.030> quickly<00:01:19.240> yesterday<00:01:19.539> just

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
were made pretty quickly yesterday just

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.690 
were made pretty quickly yesterday just
because<00:01:20.259> I<00:01:20.350> wanted<00:01:20.560> to<00:01:20.619> get<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.830> finished<00:01:21.009> I'm

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
because I wanted to get it finished I'm

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.270 
because I wanted to get it finished I'm
gonna<00:01:21.940> work<00:01:22.509> on<00:01:22.690> that<00:01:22.720> and<00:01:23.050> get<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:24.130> it's

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
gonna work on that and get it so it's

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.810 
gonna work on that and get it so it's
not<00:01:24.399> so<00:01:24.670> noisy<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.800> pipes<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:30.280> are<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
not so noisy here the pipes they are the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.520 
not so noisy here the pipes they are the
dimensions<00:01:31.390> are<00:01:31.570> roughly<00:01:31.810> based<00:01:31.930> on<00:01:32.289> those

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
dimensions are roughly based on those

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.790 
dimensions are roughly based on those
made<00:01:33.160> by<00:01:33.190> refugee<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:34.030> Giulio<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.770> I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
made by refugee and Giulio and then I

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.630 
made by refugee and Giulio and then I
just<00:01:36.070> voice<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:37.060> mouth<00:01:37.210> height<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
just voice to the the mouth height to

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
just voice to the the mouth height to
ear<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.530> little<00:01:41.800> tuning<00:01:42.190> tuning<00:01:43.179> shade

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
ear this is a little tuning tuning shade

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.330 
ear this is a little tuning tuning shade
changes<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.890> pitch<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:46.119> get<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.299> all<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.540> tune

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
changes the pitch to get it all in tune

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.990 
changes the pitch to get it all in tune
use<00:01:48.340> some<00:01:49.119> layering<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:51.130> connects<00:01:51.700> all<00:01:51.820> the

use some layering that connects all the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.649 
use some layering that connects all the
magnets<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.140> keyboard<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:55.240> gonna<00:01:55.390> clean

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
magnets to the keyboard I'm gonna clean

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.859 
magnets to the keyboard I'm gonna clean
that<00:01:55.689> up<00:01:55.840> if<00:01:56.049> I<00:01:56.140> can<00:01:56.380> soon<00:01:57.390> here's<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.570> blower

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
that up if I can soon here's the blower

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.370 
that up if I can soon here's the blower
box<00:01:59.229> inside<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.549> small<00:02:00.790> electric<00:02:01.299> blower<00:02:01.540> it

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
box inside is a small electric blower it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.710 
box inside is a small electric blower it
was<00:02:02.909> pretty<00:02:03.909> much<00:02:04.000> just<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.270> cheapest<00:02:04.600> thing

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
was pretty much just the cheapest thing

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.780 
was pretty much just the cheapest thing
I<00:02:04.780> could<00:02:04.930> find<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.680> it's<00:02:06.070> reasonably<00:02:06.490> quiet

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
I could find and it's reasonably quiet

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.150 
I could find and it's reasonably quiet
I'm<00:02:07.720> gonna<00:02:07.900> make<00:02:08.079> the<00:02:08.229> Box<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.860> little<00:02:08.890> bit

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
I'm gonna make the Box a little bit

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.340 
I'm gonna make the Box a little bit
better<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.579> can<00:02:10.239> kind<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.540> see<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.810> there<00:02:10.959> I'm

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
better you can kind of see in there I'm

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.470 
better you can kind of see in there I'm
gonna<00:02:11.410> make<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.709> box<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.310> dozen<00:02:12.970> thicker<00:02:13.209> wood

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
gonna make this box a dozen thicker wood

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.940 
gonna make this box a dozen thicker wood
so<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.750> can't<00:02:13.989> hear<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:16.380> that's<00:02:17.380> pretty<00:02:17.829> much

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so you can't hear it that's pretty much

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.020 
so you can't hear it that's pretty much
everything<00:02:18.100> right<00:02:18.459> here<00:02:18.640> I've<00:02:18.820> got<00:02:21.030> about

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
everything right here I've got about

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.319 
everything right here I've got about
nine<00:02:22.450> pipes<00:02:22.750> down<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.950> I've<00:02:24.070> got<00:02:24.250> see<00:02:25.030> up

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
nine pipes down so I've got see up

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.000 
nine pipes down so I've got see up
through<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.019> only<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.320> have<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.650> make<00:02:26.769> another

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
through it I only I have to make another

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.190 
through it I only I have to make another
see<00:02:27.430> for<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.700> keyboard<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.600> I've<00:02:28.690> got<00:02:28.870> C

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
see for the keyboard so I've got C

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.580 
see for the keyboard so I've got C
through<00:02:29.470> C<00:02:29.910> plus<00:02:30.910> B<00:02:30.940> flat<00:02:31.299> pen<00:02:31.540> look<00:02:32.079> out<00:02:32.260> for

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
through C plus B flat pen look out for

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.460 
through C plus B flat pen look out for
more<00:02:32.739> pipes<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.190> make<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> I'm<00:02:34.870> probably<00:02:35.260> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
more pipes to make so I'm probably the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.740 
more pipes to make so I'm probably the
only<00:02:35.650> key<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:35.950> sounds<00:02:36.370> good<00:02:36.489> right<00:02:36.670> now<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.540> D

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
only key that sounds good right now is D

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.220 
only key that sounds good right now is D
minor<00:02:37.989> so<00:02:38.410> that's<00:02:38.560> why<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.709> was<00:02:38.799> playing<00:02:40.049> but<00:02:41.049> ya

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
minor so that's why I was playing but ya

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.280 
minor so that's why I was playing but ya
lose<00:02:42.010> everything
