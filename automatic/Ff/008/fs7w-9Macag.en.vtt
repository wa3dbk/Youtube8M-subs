00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.520 
or III watch and that the case of the
watch<00:02:18.739> was<00:02:18.950> also<00:02:19.280> higher<00:02:20.180> re<00:02:20.690> something<00:02:21.350> that

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
watch was also higher re something that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.590 
watch was also higher re something that
is<00:02:21.800> also<00:02:22.160> important<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.700> understand<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.239> by

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
is also important I understand that by

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.380 
is also important I understand that by
making<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.050> watch<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.650> little<00:02:24.680> bit<00:02:25.010> like

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
making a watch it's a little bit like

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.080 
making a watch it's a little bit like
putting<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.870> little<00:02:27.470> bit<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.800> order<00:02:28.310> into

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
putting a little bit of order into

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.470 
putting a little bit of order into
something<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.750> is<00:02:29.959> very<00:02:30.739> complicated<00:02:31.730> and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
something that is very complicated and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.600 
something that is very complicated and
not<00:02:32.900> really<00:02:33.320> well<00:02:33.500> organized<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.190> we

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
not really well organized so we

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.449 
not really well organized so we
absolutely<00:02:34.790> need<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:36.110> make<00:02:36.320> every<00:02:37.130> component

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
absolutely need to make every component

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.010 
absolutely need to make every component
as<00:02:37.700> beautiful<00:02:38.360> as<00:02:38.450> possible

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
as beautiful as possible

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.410 
as beautiful as possible
because<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.220> sacred<00:02:41.120> mission

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
because it is it is a sacred mission

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.720 
because it is it is a sacred mission
will<00:02:41.660> be<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> little<00:02:42.020> bit<00:02:42.110> exaggerated<00:02:42.739> but<00:02:42.920> we

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
will be a little bit exaggerated but we

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.670 
will be a little bit exaggerated but we
are<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:44.030> are<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.390> are<00:02:44.420> dealing<00:02:44.720> with<00:02:44.900> time<00:02:45.440> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
are we are we are dealing with time and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.810 
are we are we are dealing with time and
tell<00:02:45.860> me<00:02:45.950> something<00:02:46.250> important<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:46.760> you

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
tell me something important and you

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.900 
tell me something important and you
cannot<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.600> cannot<00:02:47.959> say<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.100> as<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.820> be

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
cannot you cannot say it's as just to be

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.759 
cannot you cannot say it's as just to be
functional<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.510> has<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.810> be<00:02:50.930> functional<00:02:51.440> but

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
functional it has to be functional but

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.690 
functional it has to be functional but
also<00:02:52.690> beautiful
