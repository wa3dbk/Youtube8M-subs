 frameworks are among many things 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.989
 benefits that they have is that we are going to 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.480
 to be able to cook without fats without fats 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.010

 it's okay 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.140
 that is the super conducting layer 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.659
