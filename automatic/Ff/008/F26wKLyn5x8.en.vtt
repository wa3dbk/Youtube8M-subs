on Cara JAMA I'm not sure what the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.209 
on Cara JAMA I'm not sure what the
correct<00:00:09.990> way<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.260> pronounce<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.160> just

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
correct way to pronounce it is I just

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.509 
correct way to pronounce it is I just
call<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.780> well<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.740> probably<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
call it that well this is probably the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.630 
call it that well this is probably the
easiest<00:00:15.470> way<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> kill<00:00:16.830> book<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
easiest way to kill book this is the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.810 
easiest way to kill book this is the
easiest<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> fastest<00:00:18.900> bot<00:00:19.170> kill<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:20.279> gets

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
easiest and fastest bot kill that gets

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.750 
easiest and fastest bot kill that gets
the<00:00:21.000> most<00:00:21.210> cash<00:00:21.740> because<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.010> pretty<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the most cash because it's pretty much a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.450 
the most cash because it's pretty much a
guaranteed<00:00:24.710> num<00:00:25.970> kill<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
guaranteed num kill so what you do is

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.479 
guaranteed num kill so what you do is
you<00:00:29.730> learn<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> scorpion<00:00:30.720> into<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.710> area<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
have to do is click on the right side of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.790 
have to do is click on the right side of
this<00:00:58.829> tree<00:00:59.280> over<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.260> big<00:01:01.559> tree

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this tree over here of the big tree

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.009 
this tree over here of the big tree
right<00:01:01.829> next<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.460> styles<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.359> whatever<00:01:03.870> his

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
right next to styles or whatever his

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
right next to styles or whatever his
name<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.650> exchanges<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.339> fish<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
name is that exchanges your fish and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.020 
name is that exchanges your fish and
this<00:01:06.600> guy<00:01:06.840> wearing<00:01:07.110> no<00:01:07.439> armor<00:01:07.740> runs<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.220> or

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this guy wearing no armor runs up or

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.289 
this guy wearing no armor runs up or
armor<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.140> doesn't<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.650> work<00:01:10.860> runs<00:01:11.100> up

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
armor that doesn't really work runs up

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.240 
armor that doesn't really work runs up
so<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.600> Scorpion<00:01:12.900> starts<00:01:13.409> attacking<00:01:13.650> him<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so the Scorpion starts attacking him and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.859 
so the Scorpion starts attacking him and
I<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.400> know<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.790> he<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:15.090> stuck<00:01:15.570> or

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I don't know if he got stuck or

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.219 
I don't know if he got stuck or
something<00:01:16.939> it's<00:01:17.939> part<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> his<00:01:18.540> bot<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.020> stop

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
something it's part of his bot to stop

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.800 
something it's part of his bot to stop
there<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.670> stopped<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.360> long<00:01:21.630> enough

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
there but it stopped there long enough

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.920 
there but it stopped there long enough
to<00:01:22.430> let<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> scorpion<00:01:24.150> kill<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to let the scorpion kill it and it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
to let the scorpion kill it and it
didn't<00:01:25.290> move<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:26.130> anything<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> its<00:01:27.000> range

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
didn't move or anything out of its range

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.780 
didn't move or anything out of its range
so<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:29.159> dies<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.619> it's<00:01:31.619> gravestone<00:01:32.189> Falls<00:01:32.460> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so it dies and it's gravestone Falls and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.999 
so it dies and it's gravestone Falls and
it<00:01:32.880> keeps<00:01:33.119> three<00:01:33.810> fish<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.350> three<00:01:34.590> pieces<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
it keeps three fish or three pieces of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.910 
it keeps three fish or three pieces of
armor<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:35.880> wearing<00:01:36.740> anything<00:01:37.740> like

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
armor that it was wearing anything like

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.300

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
that
and<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> rest<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> right<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.390> the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.380 
there's this level 12 I think hanging
around<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.760> gravestone<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:10.790> I<00:02:11.030> thought<00:02:11.210> that

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
around the gravestone and I thought that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.000 
around the gravestone and I thought that
he<00:02:11.450> was<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.600> looter<00:02:12.020> so<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.320> did<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.800> try<00:02:12.980> and

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
he was a looter so I did that to try and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.370 
he was a looter so I did that to try and
get<00:02:13.190> him<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.400> go<00:02:13.550> away<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.810> turns<00:02:15.050> out<00:02:15.200> he

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
get him to go away and it turns out he

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.620 
get him to go away and it turns out he
was<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:15.530> another<00:02:15.830> bot<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.760> got<00:02:16.940> thrown<00:02:17.450> off

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
was just another bot that got thrown off

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.080 
was just another bot that got thrown off
by<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.080> gravestone<00:02:18.560> I<00:02:19.070> think<00:02:19.340> I'm<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:19.850> sure

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
by the gravestone I think I'm not sure

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.050 
by the gravestone I think I'm not sure
what<00:02:20.330> he<00:02:20.390> got<00:02:20.540> thrown<00:02:20.750> off<00:02:20.810> by<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.790> he<00:02:22.790> stood

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
what he got thrown off by but he stood

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.950 
what he got thrown off by but he stood
there<00:02:23.270> for<00:02:23.330> awhile<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:25.180> waiting<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.480> seemed

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
there for awhile just waiting it seemed

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.750 
there for awhile just waiting it seemed
good<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.710> thought<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.130> he<00:02:28.250> was<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> looter

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
good it I thought that he was a looter

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.310 
good it I thought that he was a looter
but<00:02:29.060> actually<00:02:29.600> there<00:02:29.750> was<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> different

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
but actually there was a different

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.040 
but actually there was a different
leader<00:02:30.470> here<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:32.060> think<00:02:32.570> you'll<00:02:32.750> see<00:02:33.020> him

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
leader here and I think you'll see him

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.070 
leader here and I think you'll see him
come<00:02:33.440> by<00:02:33.650> with<00:02:33.950> them<00:02:34.190> he's<00:02:34.700> got<00:02:34.880> full<00:02:35.450> rune<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
come by with them he's got full rune and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.570 
come by with them he's got full rune and
some<00:02:37.150> room<00:02:38.150> beserker<00:02:38.810> shield<00:02:39.110> thing<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:40.460> a

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
some room beserker shield thing and a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.750 
some room beserker shield thing and a
claim<00:02:40.880> damn<00:02:41.660> vaccine<00:02:42.020> Vicks<00:02:42.710> psyllium<00:02:43.340> thing

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
claim damn vaccine Vicks psyllium thing

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.650 
claim damn vaccine Vicks psyllium thing
and<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.150> cape<00:02:46.300> well<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:48.730> out<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.790> all<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.330> kills

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
and a cape well so out of all the kills

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.870 
and a cape well so out of all the kills
that<00:02:50.900> I've<00:02:51.020> gotten<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.650> think<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:52.310> these<00:02:52.520> two

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
that I've gotten I think that these two

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.480 
that I've gotten I think that these two
together<00:02:53.330> were<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.930> most<00:02:54.440> were<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.310> most

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
together were the most were the most

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.890 
together were the most were the most
valuable<00:02:55.910> out<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.210> them<00:02:56.800> but<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:58.660> don't<00:02:59.660> know

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
valuable out of them but I don't know

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.250 
valuable out of them but I don't know
the<00:03:00.110> average<00:03:00.350> amount<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.040> fish<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.630> bought

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
the average amount of fish that a bought

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.590 
the average amount of fish that a bought
carries<00:03:03.739> around<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:04.100> them<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.580> all<00:03:05.480> the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
carries around with them and all the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.180 
carries around with them and all the
other<00:03:05.630> kills<00:03:06.050> that<00:03:06.200> I've<00:03:06.320> gotten<00:03:06.770> get<00:03:07.010> with

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
other kills that I've gotten get with

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.350 
other kills that I've gotten get with
lobster<00:03:07.820> box<00:03:09.220> instead<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.280> them<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:10.820> response

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
lobster box instead of them so response

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.770 
lobster box instead of them so response
so<00:03:12.430> thousand<00:03:13.430> mobsters<00:03:13.910> who<00:03:14.300> were<00:03:14.480> is

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
so thousand mobsters who were is

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.570 
so thousand mobsters who were is
worthwhile<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.620> lot<00:03:15.890> less<00:03:16.070> than<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.400> does

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
worthwhile a lot less than it does

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.430 
worthwhile a lot less than it does
absorb<00:03:16.760> fish

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.790 

well<00:03:20.280> from<00:03:21.150> what<00:03:21.810> I've<00:03:22.070> done<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.370> far<00:03:23.400> about<00:03:24.800> 10

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
well from what I've done so far about 10

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.650 
well from what I've done so far about 10
kills<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.770> 2<00:03:28.770> mil<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.540> little<00:03:30.540> bit

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
kills can get you 2 mil a little bit

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.220 
kills can get you 2 mil a little bit
more

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
more

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.190 
more
it<00:03:31.640> varies<00:03:32.640> because<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:33.360> all<00:03:33.510> box<00:03:33.750> carry<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
it varies because not all box carry the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.740 
it varies because not all box carry the
same<00:03:34.410> amount<00:03:34.470> Autobot<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.560> work<00:03:37.700> them<00:03:38.750> fish

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
same amount Autobot so work them fish

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.600 
same amount Autobot so work them fish
the<00:03:39.990> exact<00:03:40.500> same<00:03:40.710> timing<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.920> it<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.520> varies

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
the exact same timing so it just varies

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.300 
the exact same timing so it just varies
a<00:03:45.510> lot

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.020 

hmm<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:51.300> right<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.770> just<00:03:53.430> wait<00:03:53.730> for

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
hmm so right now if you just wait for

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.990 
hmm so right now if you just wait for
the<00:03:54.210> Scorpion<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.990> kill<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> buy<00:03:56.000> sometimes

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
the Scorpion to kill the buy sometimes

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.540 
the Scorpion to kill the buy sometimes
the<00:03:57.330> bot<00:03:57.720> will<00:03:58.050> run<00:03:58.290> away<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.740> last<00:03:58.980> second

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
the bot will run away at the last second

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.550 
the bot will run away at the last second
I<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.820> don't<00:04:00.450> know<00:04:00.570> if<00:04:00.720> it's<00:04:00.840> programmed<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.440> do

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
I I don't know if it's programmed to do

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.350 
I I don't know if it's programmed to do
that<00:04:01.590> or<00:04:01.890> it's<00:04:02.100> just<00:04:02.220> coincidence<00:04:04.640> but<00:04:05.640> if

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
that or it's just coincidence but if

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.230 
that or it's just coincidence but if
you're<00:04:06.570> lucky<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.410> level<00:04:07.740> 3<00:04:08.280> bot<00:04:08.760> shows

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
you're lucky and the level 3 bot shows

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.330 
you're lucky and the level 3 bot shows
up<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.750> starts<00:04:11.000> hovering<00:04:12.000> around<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.510> area

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
up and starts hovering around the area

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.910 
up and starts hovering around the area
you'll<00:04:14.340> get<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.850> kill<00:04:15.620> there's<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.680> way<00:04:16.890> to

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
you'll get the kill there's a way to

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.580 
you'll get the kill there's a way to
work<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.940> tort<00:04:18.269> there's<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.200> way<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.350> work

work this to tort there's a way to work

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.440 
work this to tort there's a way to work
this<00:04:19.769> bot<00:04:20.370> kill<00:04:20.640> with<00:04:20.820> two<00:04:21.000> different<00:04:21.150> people

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
this bot kill with two different people

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.220 
this bot kill with two different people
and<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.800> might<00:04:23.160> put<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> tutorial<00:04:23.880> out<00:04:24.570> for<00:04:25.050> it

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
and I might put a tutorial out for it

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.930 
and I might put a tutorial out for it
it's<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:27.120> works<00:04:27.390> better<00:04:27.750> but<00:04:28.700> sometimes<00:04:29.700> it

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
it's it works better but sometimes it

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.370 
it's it works better but sometimes it
can<00:04:30.150> cause<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.930> bot<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.320> get<00:04:31.470> away<00:04:31.560> faster<00:04:33.380> no

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
can cause the bot to get away faster no

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.370 
can cause the bot to get away faster no
I<00:04:34.800> have<00:04:35.550> no<00:04:35.790> idea<00:04:36.060> how<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.210> explain<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.720> after

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
I have no idea how to explain that after

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.850 
I have no idea how to explain that after
I<00:04:37.410> set<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:39.600> I'm<00:04:39.780> not<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.260> don't<00:04:40.530> feel<00:04:40.710> like

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
I set it and I'm not I don't feel like

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.820 
I set it and I'm not I don't feel like
editing<00:04:41.310> anyway<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:41.790> out<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:42.840> if<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.680> look

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
editing anyway this out so if you look

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.240 
editing anyway this out so if you look
at<00:04:43.919> my<00:04:44.070> inventory<00:04:44.610> right<00:04:44.790> here<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.060> just<00:04:45.360> got

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
at my inventory right here I just got

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.310 
at my inventory right here I just got
twelve<00:04:47.250> twelve<00:04:48.000> hundred<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.480> swordfish

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
twelve twelve hundred and swordfish

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.159 
twelve twelve hundred and swordfish
twelve<00:04:49.919> hundred<00:04:50.100> tuna<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:50.850> don't<00:04:51.810> know<00:04:51.930> if<00:04:52.050> it

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
twelve hundred tuna I don't know if it

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.810 
twelve hundred tuna I don't know if it
was<00:04:52.320> just<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.620> coincidence<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.310> those<00:04:53.580> were

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
was just a coincidence that those were

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.460 
was just a coincidence that those were
about<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.300> same<00:04:54.480> amount

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
about the same amount

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.760 
about the same amount
so<00:04:57.280> when<00:04:57.550> one<00:04:57.760> kill<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.240> got<00:05:00.210> 350,000<00:05:01.210> coins<00:05:01.810> and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
so when one kill I got 350,000 coins and

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.950 
so when one kill I got 350,000 coins and
worth<00:05:03.070> from<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.940> this<00:05:04.240> little<00:05:04.300> right<00:05:04.810> here

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
worth from it and this little right here

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.810 
worth from it and this little right here
is<00:05:05.110> calling<00:05:05.440> me<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.590> new<00:05:05.920> even<00:05:06.700> though<00:05:06.730> he<00:05:08.820> is

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
is calling me a new even though he is

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.380 
is calling me a new even though he is
being<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.270> hypocrite<00:05:10.480> so

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.900 

what<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.020> normally<00:05:16.200> do<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:17.100> to<00:05:17.280> get<00:05:17.580> a<00:05:17.610> little
