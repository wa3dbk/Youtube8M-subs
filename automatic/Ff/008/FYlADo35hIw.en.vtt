 different owners has been from a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.719
 trapiche up to a cattle ranch of 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 At present we have 10 years that the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.280
 remodeled we restore it we treat 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.920
 to keep it very authentic with furniture 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.760
 with paintings and try to have it as 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.590
 before 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.070
 imagine those times and good about 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.640
 everything also had to be in some things 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.710
 for the Cristeros where they stayed 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.840
 truly imagine that good father 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
 much more before and also what 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.409
 I was seriously I swear that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 come this way to have more into the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.159
 I found it amazing dinner but that is the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 rooms to which this hacienda belonged 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.229
 he was an exile who came from obviously 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.290
 from germany and this and he built this 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.540
 scene later, notice that he is very curious 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.490
 they acquired it some people called 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 rafael gonzÃ¡lez that makes her 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
 cattle ranching of all of fight 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.430
 where the bullfighter Manuel Capetillo he 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.710
 taught to bring whoever parks lived 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.450
 even here then good they give you a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.590
 careful I do not imagine and how many 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.390
 rooms are the sunstroke we see 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.789
 currently with nine quarters we start 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.700
 to the plan we initially had only 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.070
 four but according as we have gone 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.929
 growing we have enabled until now 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.750
 we have nine good the structure is the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.369
 it does not change anything at all 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.110
 nothing else with the passage of time I do not 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.300
 you just said if the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.940
 structure remains intact as is 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.520
