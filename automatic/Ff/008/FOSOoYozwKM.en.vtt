on<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.189> some<00:00:20.369> friends<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.449> ended<00:00:21.750> up

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
on with some friends but it ended up

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.450 
on with some friends but it ended up
with<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.289> me<00:00:22.439> doing<00:00:22.650> post-production<00:00:23.340> work

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460

and<00:00:23.699> whatnot<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.240> figured<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.840> don't<00:00:25.320> want<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
them think that were actually a company

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.390 
them think that were actually a company

basically<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.460> cut<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
basically all you have to do is cut the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.930 
basically all you have to do is cut the
arms<00:00:54.420> off<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.350> neck<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
arms off and the neck and you have the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.990 
arms off and the neck and you have the
proper<00:00:57.510> spandex<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> let's<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.640> rid<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.850> that

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.200 
proper spandex so let's get rid of that
for<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:01.100> think<00:01:02.100> it'd<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.309> easier<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.059> go

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
for now I think it'd be easier as I go

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.549 
for now I think it'd be easier as I go
through<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.510> costume<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.170> take<00:01:04.320> bits

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
through this costume to just take bits

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.380 
through this costume to just take bits
away<00:01:06.470> so<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.830> problem<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.030> even

even know what to say so in order to fix
this<00:01:37.380> problem<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.799> decided<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.400> some

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
this problem we decided to get some

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.270 
this problem we decided to get some
these<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.390> thermal<00:01:39.810> pants<00:01:40.049> from<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:41.040> ski

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
these are some thermal pants from my ski

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.910 
these are some thermal pants from my ski
gear<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.110> just<00:01:43.110> threw<00:01:43.290> those<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.500> underneath

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
gear and just threw those in underneath

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.380 
gear and just threw those in underneath
to<00:01:44.189> give<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:44.579> much-needed<00:01:44.759> thickness

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to give it some much-needed thickness

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
to give it some much-needed thickness
and<00:01:45.860> well<00:01:46.860> needed<00:01:47.369> concealment<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.799> of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and well needed concealment and of

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.380 
and well needed concealment and of
course<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> match<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
course you got to match that with the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
course you got to match that with the
other<00:01:51.570> side<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.200> took<00:01:52.290> one<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> my<00:01:52.680> gym

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
other side I just took one of my gym

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.800 
other side I just took one of my gym
singlets<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:54.439> cut<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> down<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> size

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.179 

so<00:01:59.810> that's<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.500> can<00:02:00.619> use<00:02:00.740> anything<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.100> want

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
so that's you can use anything you want

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.529 
so that's you can use anything you want
for<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.549> body<00:02:01.640> underneath<00:02:02.090> but<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.299> think

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
for the body underneath but I think

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.209 
for the body underneath but I think
black<00:02:02.750> works<00:02:03.079> best<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.590> terms<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.130> know

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
black works best in terms of you know

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.899 
black works best in terms of you know
color<00:02:04.789> coordination<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.539> kind<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.780> thing

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
color coordination that kind of thing

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.540 
color coordination that kind of thing

that i sewed onto the end of it to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.699 
that i sewed onto the end of it to
extend<00:02:17.750> its<00:02:17.959> length<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:18.290> I'm<00:02:18.349> pretty<00:02:18.500> sure

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
extend its length but I'm pretty sure

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.920 
extend its length but I'm pretty sure
you'd<00:02:18.890> be<00:02:18.920> able<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.280> find<00:02:19.519> gloves<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.480> the

you'd be able to find gloves of the
appropriate<00:02:21.349> length<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.800> really<00:02:21.980> went

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
appropriate length if you really went

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.770
