00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.980
 I sleep girl who came to fill a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.000
 lack that had for young people 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.240
 wanted to do something outside 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.920
 from school to have fun or develop 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 an artistic or sporting talent 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 we were going to have something 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 very academic with them it was a club 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.260
 sportsman for the music club with a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.669
 adult professor selling time who 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.669
 teaches you to marc how it works 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.820
 which is also one of things that 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.039
 for parents are rewarding too 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.140
 keep my son there in a team of 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.000
 hockey he made his team win 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.370
 while drawing is in the head 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.329
 of adults goes drawing everyone 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.809
 decides in any case all the young 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.769
 decide its share the importance still 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.000
 taken is like normal and little more 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.100
 seriously when he makes drawings 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.929
 only finally when you come to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.539
 the university that studied at the fine arts 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:08.350
 where does that necessarily mean you already have 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.539
 17 years old 18 years and older but before 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.909
 get there you're not taken seriously 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:17.289
 you're not considering and graffiti is 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.360
 the only thing that has allowed people 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.450
 of 15 years to do something that 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.340
 was disproportionate who was very tall who 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.440
 took a picture and this very big has it 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.850
 impressed impressed buddies 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.259

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.000
 liked by friends how did you do it 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.220
 what are you riding on what is that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.470
 of the little descendant on your exit in 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.229
 his school notebook nature and with the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.229
 graffiti this young will become someone 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.509
 but before I did not have graffiti ben 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.280
 it was not that it was not taken at 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.990
 serious but nothing concrete for us 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.460
 decide on roses and a few 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.420
 leaves are braid to our parents on 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.340
 Paris before it's fine 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.170
 discontinue and then return to shape as 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.570
 it was a bit like today 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.659

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.830

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.110
 also invest money in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.950
 for these events it's something 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.470
