00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.529 

we<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.640> want<00:00:20.849> to<00:00:20.910> make<00:00:20.970> sure<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.359> there's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
we really want to make sure that there's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.570 
we really want to make sure that there's
that<00:00:21.689> contrast<00:00:22.230> between<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.949> negative<00:00:23.430> space

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
that contrast between the negative space

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.560 
that contrast between the negative space
and<00:00:24.560> then<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.800> high-tension<00:00:26.310> Speights<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and then the high-tension Speights you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.510 
and then the high-tension Speights you
need<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> exploration<00:00:28.829> you<00:00:29.099> need<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
need the exploration you need the

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.210 
need the exploration you need the
scavenging<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.300> need<00:00:30.539> something<00:00:31.079> to<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:32.009> say

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
scavenging you need something to to say

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.700 
scavenging you need something to to say
like<00:00:32.400> okay<00:00:32.699> I'm<00:00:33.239> setting<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> certain<00:00:34.019> tone<00:00:34.199> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.160 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and
a<00:00:35.100> patina<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.140> can

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
a patina here so that then we can

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
a patina here so that then we can
contrast<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.370> stark<00:00:38.699> like

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
contrast that with some stark like

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.689 
contrast that with some stark like
changes<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:40.230> need<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> intensity<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.339> strike

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
changes we need the intensity to strike

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.509 
changes we need the intensity to strike
a<00:00:41.940> different<00:00:42.690> chord<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.470> that<00:00:43.650> only<00:00:43.829> works<00:00:44.190> if

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
a different chord it that only works if

since resources are limited you still

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.540 
since resources are limited you still

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
environment for you to scavenge so it's

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.540 
environment for you to scavenge so it's
a<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:11.410> have<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.680> balance<00:03:11.830> at<00:03:12.069> risk<00:03:12.250> versus

a you have to balance at risk versus

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.759 
a you have to balance at risk versus
reward<00:03:12.640> but<00:03:12.970> it's<00:03:13.090> definitely<00:03:13.300> all<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.319> part<00:03:14.709> of

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
reward but it's definitely all a part of

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.380 
reward but it's definitely all a part of
the<00:03:14.860> choice<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.400> sometimes<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.180> world

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
the choice and sometimes the world

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.210 
the choice and sometimes the world
doesn't<00:03:16.629> give<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.049> choice<00:03:17.290> sometimes<00:03:17.950> all

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
doesn't give you a choice sometimes all

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.710

the<00:03:18.340> battle<00:03:18.910> breaks<00:03:19.120> out<00:03:19.360> in<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.540> way<00:03:19.660> you

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the battle breaks out in the way you

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.869 
the battle breaks out in the way you
didn't<00:03:20.140> expect<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.760> make

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
didn't expect and you have to make

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.360 
didn't expect and you have to make
decisions<00:03:22.000> like<00:03:22.599> in<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.170> moment<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.010> that's

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
decisions like in the moment so that's

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.800 
decisions like in the moment so that's
another<00:03:24.610> reason<00:03:24.879> why<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.450> did<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> whole

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
another reason why we did the whole
