the<00:01:32.799> white<00:01:32.979> straw<00:01:33.340> here<00:01:33.609> I'm<00:01:33.700> going<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.880> fold

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
the white straw here I'm going to fold

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.830 
the white straw here I'm going to fold
it<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.270> half

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.180 

and<00:01:43.840> then<00:01:43.930> just<00:01:44.140> crease<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.560> down<00:01:44.590> make<00:01:45.040> sure

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
and then just crease it down make sure

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.550 
and then just crease it down make sure
it's<00:01:45.340> nice<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.700> flat<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.110> like<00:01:47.200> folding

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
it's nice and flat kind of like folding

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.550 
it's nice and flat kind of like folding
paper<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.880> there<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.240> now<00:01:49.390> in<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.630> half<00:01:49.840> or

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
paper so there it's now in the half or

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.410 
paper so there it's now in the half or
in<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.770> middle<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.190> in<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.060> middle<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.360> this

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
in the middle and in the middle of this

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.550 
in the middle and in the middle of this
white<00:01:52.659> one<00:01:52.810> I'm<00:01:52.900> going<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.080> place<00:01:53.229> the<00:01:53.380> green

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
white one I'm going to place the green

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.969 
white one I'm going to place the green
one

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
one

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.770 
one
so<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.340> usually<00:01:54.520> place<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.150> in<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.270> center<00:01:55.630> and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
so I usually place it in the center and

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.690 
so I usually place it in the center and
then<00:01:56.200> pull<00:01:56.409> a<00:01:56.440> little<00:01:56.680> bit<00:01:56.799> to<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.040> right<00:01:57.280> so

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
then pull a little bit to the right so

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.640 
then pull a little bit to the right so
it's<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.850> little<00:01:58.060> off-center<00:01:58.259> with<00:01:59.259> this<00:01:59.440> piece

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
it's a little off-center with this piece

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.920 
it's a little off-center with this piece
being<00:01:59.860> slightly<00:02:00.220> longer<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.909> then<00:02:01.509> this<00:02:01.630> part

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
being slightly longer and then this part

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.540 
being slightly longer and then this part
this<00:02:02.170> one<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.619> two<00:02:02.770> here<00:02:03.009> that's<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.369> the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
this one and two here that's on the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.310 
this one and two here that's on the
white<00:02:03.880> straw<00:02:04.240> I'm<00:02:04.720> going<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.899> move<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.110> white

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
white straw I'm going to move the white

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.950 
white straw I'm going to move the white
are<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.860> number<00:02:06.220> one<00:02:06.430> over<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> left<00:02:07.210> then

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
are the number one over to the left then

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.870 
are the number one over to the left then
the<00:02:07.990> next<00:02:08.380> step<00:02:08.590> here<00:02:08.890> you're<00:02:09.459> going<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.729> be

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
the next step here you're going to be

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.240 
the next step here you're going to be
taking<00:02:10.239> number<00:02:10.450> four<00:02:10.750> here<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.290> you'll<00:02:12.130> be

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
taking number four here and you'll be

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.120 
taking number four here and you'll be
bending<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.269> over<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.380> center<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:17.070> try<00:02:18.070> to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
bending it over to the center and try to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.210 
bending it over to the center and try to
make<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.519> even<00:02:18.790> with<00:02:19.060> number<00:02:19.330> one<00:02:19.860> okay<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.040> now

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
make it even with number one okay so now

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.290 
make it even with number one okay so now
the<00:02:21.280> next<00:02:21.459> step<00:02:21.610> you're<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.060> taking

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
the next step you're going to be taking

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.979 
the next step you're going to be taking
number<00:02:22.510> two<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:23.530> folding<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> back<00:02:24.040> around

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
number two be folding it back around

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.509 
number two be folding it back around
everything<00:02:25.989> you're<00:02:26.680> going<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.860> be<00:02:26.920> forming<00:02:27.310> a

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
everything you're going to be forming a

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.110 
everything you're going to be forming a
V<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.269> what<00:02:28.870> we're<00:02:28.989> doing<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.410> number<00:02:29.680> two

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
V and what we're doing with number two

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.009 
V and what we're doing with number two
we're<00:02:31.120> going<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.300> be<00:02:31.360> locking<00:02:31.720> up<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.870> high

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
we're going to be locking up the high

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.290 
we're going to be locking up the high
number<00:02:32.380> one<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.220> do<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.519> by<00:02:33.730> simply

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
number one and we do that by simply

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.900 
number one and we do that by simply
pushing<00:02:35.050> number<00:02:35.470> one<00:02:35.620> behind<00:02:36.040> number<00:02:36.370> two<00:02:36.610> and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
pushing number one behind number two and

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.390 
pushing number one behind number two and
now<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:37.870> locked<00:02:38.080> into<00:02:38.320> place<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:39.190> still

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
now it's locked into place you still

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.250 
now it's locked into place you still
have<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.550> hold<00:02:39.700> onto<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.180> bottom<00:02:40.600> it's<00:02:41.140> not

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
have to hold onto the bottom it's not

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.390 
have to hold onto the bottom it's not
completely<00:02:41.590> locked<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.040> you'll<00:02:42.160> feel<00:02:42.370> that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
completely locked but you'll feel that

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.000 
completely locked but you'll feel that
it's<00:02:42.670> sting's<00:02:43.150> it'll<00:02:43.540> stay<00:02:43.780> still<00:02:44.140> let<00:02:44.890> me

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
it's sting's it'll stay still let me

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.280 
it's sting's it'll stay still let me
show<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.430> again<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.600> here<00:02:46.810> we<00:02:46.930> started

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
show you that again so here we started

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.830 
show you that again so here we started
from<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.980> second<00:02:48.340> step<00:02:48.579> take<00:02:49.570> number<00:02:49.810> two

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
from the second step take number two

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.780 
from the second step take number two
fold<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.560> around<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.250> back<00:02:52.290> making<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.470> V<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
fold it around the back making a V and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.770 
fold it around the back making a V and
then<00:02:54.910> you're<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> be<00:02:55.239> taking<00:02:55.570> number

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
then you're going to be taking number

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.789 
then you're going to be taking number
two<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.320> placing<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:56.890> front<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.250> number<00:02:57.519> one

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
two and placing in front of number one

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.509 
two and placing in front of number one
so<00:02:59.799> it's<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.100> easy

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
so it's that easy

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.580 
so it's that easy
then<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.540> next<00:03:01.750> step<00:03:01.989> you're<00:03:02.200> going<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.470> be

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
then the next step you're going to be

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.460 
then the next step you're going to be
taking<00:03:02.980> number<00:03:03.280> four<00:03:03.730> here<00:03:04.440> you'll<00:03:05.440> be

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
taking number four here you'll be

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.280 
taking number four here you'll be
bending<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.100> behind<00:03:06.760> again<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.630> you're

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
bending that behind again and you're

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.960 
bending that behind again and you're
gonna<00:03:08.380> be<00:03:08.470> placing<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:08.980> underneath<00:03:09.400> or<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:09.850> top

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
gonna be placing it underneath or on top

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.900 
gonna be placing it underneath or on top
of<00:03:10.239> number<00:03:10.690> three<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:12.250> we're<00:03:12.400> taking<00:03:12.519> number

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
of number three so we're taking number

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.729 
of number three so we're taking number
four

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
four

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.080 
four
placing<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.829> folding<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.430> back<00:03:15.459> behind

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
placing it folding it back behind

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.970 
placing it folding it back behind
everything<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.780> we're<00:03:17.530> going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.709> be<00:03:17.799> placing

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
everything and we're going to be placing

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.229 
everything and we're going to be placing
it<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.340> front<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.640> number<00:03:18.850> three<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.670> so

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
it in front of number three like so so

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.270 
it in front of number three like so so
again<00:03:22.329> we<00:03:22.570> form<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.049> similar<00:03:23.440> configuration

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
again we form that similar configuration

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.620 
again we form that similar configuration
we<00:03:24.400> had<00:03:24.579> in<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.760> beginning<00:03:24.850> with<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.329> two<00:03:25.510> in

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
we had in the beginning with the two in

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.930 
we had in the beginning with the two in
the<00:03:25.720> middle<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.989> one<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:26.769> each<00:03:26.799> side<00:03:26.950> for<00:03:27.850> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
the middle and one on each side for the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.670 
the middle and one on each side for the
next<00:03:28.269> step<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.690> will<00:03:28.810> be<00:03:28.870> taking<00:03:29.170> number<00:03:29.410> one

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
next step you will be taking number one

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.710 
next step you will be taking number one
you'll<00:03:30.310> be<00:03:30.370> folding<00:03:30.790> in<00:03:30.880> front<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.269> everybody

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
you'll be folding in front of everybody

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.270 
you'll be folding in front of everybody
else<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.230> now<00:03:32.350> we're<00:03:32.500> doing<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.070> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
else so now we're doing the it's the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.530 
else so now we're doing the it's the
same<00:03:33.489> thing<00:03:33.760> that<00:03:33.850> it's<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.090> opposite

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
same thing that it's the opposite

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.060 
same thing that it's the opposite
instead<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.900> bending<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.170> behind<00:03:35.590> we're<00:03:35.950> going

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
instead of bending it behind we're going

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.370 
instead of bending it behind we're going
to<00:03:36.130> be<00:03:36.190> going<00:03:36.280> up<00:03:36.519> front<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.810> number<00:03:37.989> one<00:03:38.170> goes

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
to be going up front so number one goes

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.099 
to be going up front so number one goes
in<00:03:38.560> front<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.540> here<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:40.630> have<00:03:40.780> our<00:03:40.930> V

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
in front and here we have our V

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.810 
in front and here we have our V
configuration<00:03:41.920> again<00:03:42.040> like<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.459> had<00:03:42.609> before

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
configuration again like we had before

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.349 
configuration again like we had before
so<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.510> see<00:03:43.690> these<00:03:43.810> steps<00:03:44.109> repeat<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.239> have

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
so you see these steps repeat so we have

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.910 
so you see these steps repeat so we have
our<00:03:46.510> V<00:03:46.660> configuration<00:03:47.440> we're<00:03:47.680> going<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:47.859> be

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
our V configuration we're going to be

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.099 
our V configuration we're going to be
taking<00:03:48.220> number<00:03:48.489> one<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.180> folding<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:49.959> or

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
taking number one and folding it or

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.629 
taking number one and folding it or
putting<00:03:50.380> it<00:03:50.530> behind<00:03:50.650> number<00:03:50.980> three<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.459> lock

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
putting it behind number three to lock

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.830 
putting it behind number three to lock
it<00:03:51.820> in

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
it in

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.500 
it in
like<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:56.640> you're<00:03:56.760> almost<00:03:56.910> done

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
like so so you're almost done

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.530 
like so so you're almost done
the<00:03:58.380> next<00:03:58.709> step<00:03:58.950> you're<00:03:59.580> going<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.060> be<00:04:00.150> taking

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the next step you're going to be taking

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.900 
the next step you're going to be taking
number<00:04:00.780> two<00:04:01.100> be<00:04:02.100> folding<00:04:02.490> in<00:04:02.580> front<00:04:02.850> of

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
number two be folding in front of

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.300 
number two be folding in front of
everybody<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.560> you'll<00:04:04.560> be<00:04:04.709> placing<00:04:04.920> number

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
everybody and you'll be placing number

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.480 
everybody and you'll be placing number
two<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:05.850> front<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.720> behind<00:04:07.080> number<00:04:07.680> four<00:04:08.040> so

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
two in front and behind number four so

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.620 
two in front and behind number four so
now<00:04:08.610> number<00:04:08.910> four<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.209> going<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.420> come<00:04:09.540> up

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
now number four is going to come up

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.370 
now number four is going to come up
front<00:04:11.360> we<00:04:12.360> have<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.630> configuration<00:04:13.290> again

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
front we have that configuration again

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.870 
front we have that configuration again
with<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.740> two<00:04:13.890> in<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.100> middle<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.580> one<00:04:14.790> on

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
with the two in the middle and one on

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.210 
with the two in the middle and one on
each<00:04:14.910> side<00:04:15.290> so<00:04:16.290> our<00:04:16.410> next<00:04:16.620> step<00:04:16.890> here<00:04:17.070> will<00:04:17.190> be

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
each side so our next step here will be

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.789 
each side so our next step here will be
to<00:04:17.310> take<00:04:17.579> number<00:04:17.760> three<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:19.500> bend<00:04:19.680> it

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
to take number three and to bend it

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.180 
to take number three and to bend it
behind<00:04:20.190> number<00:04:20.730> one<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:22.440> have<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.680> V

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
behind number one we have the V

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.370 
behind number one we have the V
configuration<00:04:24.030> again<00:04:24.150> you're<00:04:24.990> going<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.260> be

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
configuration again you're going to be

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.980 
configuration again you're going to be
locking<00:04:25.620> number<00:04:25.950> three<00:04:26.630> placing<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:27.780> front

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
locking number three placing it in front

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.970 
locking number three placing it in front
of<00:04:28.110> number<00:04:28.230> four<00:04:28.620> here<00:04:29.690> like<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.350> that's

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
of number four here like so and that's

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.790 
of number four here like so and that's
locked<00:04:32.250> into<00:04:32.430> place<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:34.290> next<00:04:34.500> step<00:04:34.710> you're

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
locked into place the next step you're

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.890 
locked into place the next step you're
gonna<00:04:34.919> be<00:04:35.010> taking<00:04:35.340> number<00:04:35.550> one<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:36.690> can<00:04:36.810> be

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
gonna be taking number one you can be

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.290 
gonna be taking number one you can be
folding<00:04:37.230> it<00:04:37.290> behind<00:04:37.560> everybody<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.300> you're

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
folding it behind everybody and you're

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.550 
folding it behind everybody and you're
going<00:04:39.480> to<00:04:39.540> be<00:04:39.630> placing<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.050> in<00:04:40.200> front<00:04:40.500> of

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
going to be placing that in front of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.820 
going to be placing that in front of
number<00:04:40.770> two<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.160> lock<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.490> into<00:04:41.610> place<00:04:42.830> so

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
number two to lock it into place so

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.280 
number two to lock it into place so
we're<00:04:44.010> almost<00:04:44.220> done<00:04:44.490> here<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:45.720> next<00:04:45.900> step<00:04:46.020> is

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
we're almost done here the next step is

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.990 
we're almost done here the next step is
pretty<00:04:46.440> much<00:04:46.500> just<00:04:46.680> folding<00:04:47.130> this<00:04:47.730> side

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
pretty much just folding this side

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.930 
pretty much just folding this side
number<00:04:48.210> three<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.660> four<00:04:48.930> down<00:04:49.760> making<00:04:50.760> a

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
number three and four down making a

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.970 
number three and four down making a
crease<00:04:54.110> then<00:04:55.110> you're<00:04:55.230> also<00:04:55.410> going<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.740> take

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
crease then you're also going to take

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.159 
crease then you're also going to take
number<00:04:56.130> one<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.580> two<00:04:56.760> fold<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.690> down<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.080> make

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
number one and two fold it down and make

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.770 
number one and two fold it down and make
a<00:04:58.200> crease<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.860> now<00:04:59.850> we're<00:05:00.000> going<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.150> flip<00:05:00.450> the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
a crease and now we're going to flip the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
a crease and now we're going to flip the
heart<00:05:01.080> over<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:03.260> usually<00:05:04.260> what<00:05:04.350> I<00:05:04.380> do<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:04.590> I

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
heart over and usually what I do is I

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.950 
heart over and usually what I do is I
look<00:05:04.979> for<00:05:05.040> places<00:05:05.910> that<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.120> can<00:05:06.210> tuck<00:05:06.690> these

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
look for places that I can tuck these

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.830 
look for places that I can tuck these
two<00:05:07.410> here<00:05:07.740> on<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.860> outside<00:05:08.370> into<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:09.570> heart

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
two here on the outside into the heart

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.050 
two here on the outside into the heart
and<00:05:10.050> then<00:05:10.590> usually<00:05:10.979> I<00:05:11.010> just<00:05:11.100> keep<00:05:11.460> one<00:05:11.729> and<00:05:11.850> two

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
and then usually I just keep one and two
