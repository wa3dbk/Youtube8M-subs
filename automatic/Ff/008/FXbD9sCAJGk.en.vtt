00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
to go to fat it's going to start burning

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.440 
to go to fat it's going to start burning
fat<00:02:00.250> well<00:02:00.610> you've<00:02:00.729> got<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.000> make<00:02:01.090> sure<00:02:01.299> that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
fat well you've got to make sure that

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.120 
fat well you've got to make sure that
you<00:02:01.539> have<00:02:01.689> enough<00:02:01.720> fat<00:02:02.110> burn<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.009> you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
you have enough fat burn and then you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.199 
you have enough fat burn and then you
also<00:02:03.280> want<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.610> make<00:02:03.700> sure<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:03.939> you're

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209

getting<00:02:04.330> enough<00:02:04.539> protein<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:05.140> recovery<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
getting enough protein for recovery and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.639 
getting enough protein for recovery and
so<00:02:07.270> typically<00:02:07.750> if<00:02:07.929> somebody<00:02:08.229> comes<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.560> me

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
after about two and a half point success
