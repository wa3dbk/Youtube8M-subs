it's<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.340> pretty<00:02:31.049> pretty<00:02:32.049> cool<00:02:32.260> design<00:02:32.579> the

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
it's a pretty pretty cool design the

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.610 
it's a pretty pretty cool design the
actual<00:02:34.359> ship<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:34.870> don't<00:02:35.079> really<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.439> the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
actual ship I don't really like the

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.569 
actual ship I don't really like the
design<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:37.079> its<00:02:38.079> it's<00:02:38.560> kind<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:38.799> square<00:02:39.219> as<00:02:39.400> you

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
design of its it's kind of square as you

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.199 
design of its it's kind of square as you
can<00:02:39.730> see<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:42.280> kind<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.549> see<00:02:42.760> it's<00:02:42.909> a<00:02:43.030> really

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
can see you kind of see it's a really

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.349 
can see you kind of see it's a really
weird<00:02:43.540> shape<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:44.489> I'm<00:02:45.489> not<00:02:45.639> too<00:02:45.819> hot<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
weird shape and I'm not too hot on the

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.140 
weird shape and I'm not too hot on the
on<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.859> also<00:02:48.189> the<00:02:48.310> back<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.790> me<00:02:48.909> looks

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
on that and also the back to me looks

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.000 
on that and also the back to me looks
kind<00:02:49.359> of<00:02:49.389> unfinished<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:50.349> get<00:02:50.500> these<00:02:50.620> tiny

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
kind of unfinished you get these tiny

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.819 
kind of unfinished you get these tiny
little<00:02:51.099> outputs<00:02:51.909> on<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.150> engines<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:53.560> it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
little outputs on the engines and it

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.330 
little outputs on the engines and it
just<00:02:54.299> kind<00:02:55.299> of<00:02:55.359> comes<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.780> funky<00:02:56.169> angle<00:02:56.500> if

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
just kind of comes to a funky angle if

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.890 
just kind of comes to a funky angle if
you<00:02:57.459> ask<00:02:57.639> me<00:02:57.879> so<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.239> don't<00:02:58.450> really<00:02:58.540> like<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
you ask me so I don't really like the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.409 
you ask me so I don't really like the
design<00:02:59.250> as<00:03:00.250> far<00:03:00.459> as<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.700> shape<00:03:00.909> but<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.269> don't

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
design as far as the shape but I don't

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.030 
design as far as the shape but I don't
think<00:03:01.540> that's<00:03:01.750> Legos<00:03:02.200> fault<00:03:02.469> I<00:03:02.650> just<00:03:02.859> think

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
think that's Legos fault I just think

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.729 
think that's Legos fault I just think
it's<00:03:03.159> kind<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.459> leadership<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:05.230> Lucas<00:03:05.560> art

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
it's kind of a leadership that Lucas art

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.039 
it's kind of a leadership that Lucas art
designs<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:06.459> it's<00:03:07.359> pretty<00:03:07.450> cool<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:07.689> do<00:03:07.840> like

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
designs so it's pretty cool I do like

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.949 
designs so it's pretty cool I do like
these<00:03:08.200> big<00:03:08.409> Pistons<00:03:08.889> that<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.159> get<00:03:09.340> here<00:03:09.959> or

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
these big Pistons that you get here or

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.530 
these big Pistons that you get here or
shocks<00:03:11.319> or<00:03:11.650> whatever<00:03:11.859> you<00:03:11.919> want<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.069> call<00:03:12.540> but

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
shocks or whatever you want to call but

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.089 
shocks or whatever you want to call but
the<00:03:13.629> main<00:03:13.780> focus<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.319> this<00:03:14.730> ship<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:17.099> wing

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
the main focus of this ship is the wing

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.170 
the main focus of this ship is the wing
function<00:03:19.139> so<00:03:20.139> I'll<00:03:20.229> show<00:03:20.409> you<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:21.519> have

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
function so I'll show you that you have

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.869 
function so I'll show you that you have
the<00:03:22.269> soul<00:03:22.479> release<00:03:22.840> tab<00:03:23.109> here<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.879> flips

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
the soul release tab here that flips

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.210 
the soul release tab here that flips
over<00:03:25.060> eyes<00:03:25.269> kind<00:03:25.449> of<00:03:25.510> like<00:03:25.629> a<00:03:25.690> safety<00:03:26.079> lock<00:03:26.229> if

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
over eyes kind of like a safety lock if

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.399 
over eyes kind of like a safety lock if
you<00:03:27.340> can<00:03:27.459> see<00:03:27.669> and<00:03:28.659> once<00:03:28.840> that's<00:03:29.049> out<00:03:29.199> of<00:03:29.290> the

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
you can see and once that's out of the

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.719 
you can see and once that's out of the
way<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:31.859> know<00:03:32.859> that's<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.370> other<00:03:33.400> thing<00:03:33.639> I'm

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:33.729 
way you know that's the other thing I'm

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.280 
way you know that's the other thing I'm
going<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:33.909> show<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.060> there's<00:03:34.629> landing<00:03:35.139> gear

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
going to show you there's landing gear

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.789 
going to show you there's landing gear
on<00:03:35.409> this<00:03:35.560> ship<00:03:36.400> as<00:03:36.579> you<00:03:36.639> can<00:03:36.849> see<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.799> the

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
on this ship as you can see and the

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.619 
on this ship as you can see and the
landing<00:03:39.040> gear<00:03:39.099> will<00:03:39.370> move<00:03:39.579> with<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.120> wings<00:03:40.329> so

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
landing gear will move with the wings so

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.490 
landing gear will move with the wings so
I'm<00:03:40.689> going<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.870> show<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.019> this<00:03:41.109> multiple

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
I'm going to show you this multiple

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.439 
I'm going to show you this multiple
times<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:41.889> you<00:03:41.979> can<00:03:42.099> see<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> but<00:03:43.000> kind<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.359> the

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
times so you can see it but kind of the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.330 
times so you can see it but kind of the
overall<00:03:44.669> action<00:03:45.669> is<00:03:45.790> when<00:03:45.970> you<00:03:46.060> pick<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.299> up

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
overall action is when you pick it up

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.960 
overall action is when you pick it up
there<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.430> goes<00:03:49.049> come<00:03:50.049> on<00:03:50.579> that's<00:03:51.579> kind<00:03:51.849> of

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
there it goes come on that's kind of

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.229 
there it goes come on that's kind of
doing<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.329> yeah<00:03:52.629> there<00:03:52.989> we<00:03:53.079> go

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
doing it yeah there we go

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.949 
doing it yeah there we go
yeah<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:56.290> what<00:03:56.530> happens<00:03:57.780> trying<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.840> do<00:03:58.900> this

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
yeah so what happens trying to do this

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.559 
yeah so what happens trying to do this
with<00:03:59.109> one<00:03:59.139> hand<00:03:59.290> without<00:03:59.560> dropping<00:04:00.069> in<00:04:00.220> it

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
with one hand without dropping in it

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.949 
with one hand without dropping in it
there<00:04:01.569> we<00:04:01.659> go

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
there we go

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.319 
there we go
so<00:04:02.259> what<00:04:02.409> happens<00:04:02.769> basically<00:04:02.949> when<00:04:03.879> you<00:04:04.030> flip

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
so what happens basically when you flip

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.530 
so what happens basically when you flip
the<00:04:04.900> wing<00:04:05.709> down<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:06.129> center<00:04:06.370> wing<00:04:06.519> it<00:04:08.280> moves

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
the wing down the center wing it moves

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.699 
the wing down the center wing it moves
as<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.659> can<00:04:10.810> see<00:04:11.019> there's<00:04:11.169> that<00:04:11.290> blue<00:04:11.530> piece

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
as you can see there's that blue piece

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.020 
as you can see there's that blue piece
right<00:04:11.949> so<00:04:12.159> that's<00:04:12.310> what<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.519> center<00:04:12.759> wing<00:04:12.909> is

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
right so that's what the center wing is

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.879 
right so that's what the center wing is
connected<00:04:13.479> to<00:04:13.509> him<00:04:13.720> then<00:04:14.379> I<00:04:14.500> hit<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.769> these

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
connected to him then I hit to these

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.509 
connected to him then I hit to these
gears<00:04:15.189> which<00:04:16.120> fold<00:04:16.479> up<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.289> landing<00:04:17.650> gear<00:04:17.889> as

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
gears which fold up the landing gear as

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.870 
gears which fold up the landing gear as
you<00:04:18.909> can<00:04:19.209> see<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.859> landing<00:04:21.099> gears<00:04:21.310> now<00:04:21.579> hidden

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
you can see the landing gears now hidden

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.120 
you can see the landing gears now hidden
away<00:04:22.060> for<00:04:23.279> smaller<00:04:24.279> and

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
away for smaller and

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.250 
away for smaller and
then<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:25.460> folds<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.150> wings<00:04:26.330> down<00:04:26.570> via<00:04:26.960> these

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
then it folds the wings down via these

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.500 
then it folds the wings down via these
little<00:04:28.000> connectors<00:04:29.000> these<00:04:29.150> little<00:04:29.360> black

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
little connectors these little black

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.010 
little connectors these little black
connectors<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.130> Pistons<00:04:31.840> slow<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.990> down

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
connectors and the Pistons slow it down

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.600 
connectors and the Pistons slow it down
because<00:04:33.350> there's<00:04:33.590> rubber<00:04:33.860> in<00:04:34.040> there<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.520> it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
because there's rubber in there so it

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.030 
because there's rubber in there so it
doesn't<00:04:34.760> just<00:04:35.180> flip<00:04:35.630> out<00:04:35.750> like<00:04:35.990> crazy<00:04:36.200> I'll

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
doesn't just flip out like crazy I'll

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.180 
doesn't just flip out like crazy I'll
show<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.400> if<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.670> push<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.060> wing<00:04:38.270> back<00:04:38.480> up

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
show you if you push the wing back up

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.400 
show you if you push the wing back up
these<00:04:40.190> will<00:04:40.400> start<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.730> rise<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.990> can<00:04:42.050> see

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
these will start to rise you can see

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.700 
these will start to rise you can see
underneath<00:04:45.280> if<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.400> do<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.730> away<00:04:47.710> again

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
underneath if you do that away again

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.760 
underneath if you do that away again
this<00:04:48.860> is<00:04:49.010> hard<00:04:49.190> with<00:04:49.310> one<00:04:49.460> hand<00:04:50.170> yeah<00:04:51.170> there<00:04:51.710> we

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
this is hard with one hand yeah there we

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.470 
this is hard with one hand yeah there we
go<00:04:52.870> so<00:04:53.950> that's<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.100> basic<00:04:55.460> idea<00:04:55.580> I'll<00:04:56.000> see<00:04:56.390> if

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
go so that's the basic idea I'll see if

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.030 
go so that's the basic idea I'll see if
I<00:04:56.540> can<00:04:56.690> do<00:04:56.840> this<00:04:56.930> so<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.350> can<00:04:57.470> see<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.710> landing

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
I can do this so you can see the landing

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.620 
I can do this so you can see the landing
gear<00:04:58.810> see<00:04:59.810> it<00:05:00.290> hinges<00:05:00.770> down<00:05:01.420> and<00:05:02.420> then<00:05:02.510> when

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
gear see it hinges down and then when

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.280 
gear see it hinges down and then when
you<00:05:02.720> push<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.070> forward<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.370> goes<00:05:04.520> back<00:05:04.700> up<00:05:05.290> so

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
you push it forward it goes back up so

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.230 
you push it forward it goes back up so
again<00:05:07.040> doing<00:05:07.370> this<00:05:07.490> with<00:05:07.670> one<00:05:07.730> hand<00:05:07.850> it's<00:05:08.180> a

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
again doing this with one hand it's a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.230 
again doing this with one hand it's a
little<00:05:08.480> tricky<00:05:09.490> but<00:05:10.490> on<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.700> wings<00:05:10.850> you<00:05:11.090> get

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
little tricky but on the wings you get

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.850 
little tricky but on the wings you get
there<00:05:11.420> the<00:05:11.540> wings<00:05:11.690> are<00:05:11.810> pretty<00:05:11.870> cool<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:12.800> get

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
there the wings are pretty cool you get

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.430 
there the wings are pretty cool you get
these<00:05:13.010> long<00:05:13.820> cannons<00:05:14.330> which<00:05:14.990> are<00:05:15.110> really<00:05:15.230> nice

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
these long cannons which are really nice

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.330 
these long cannons which are really nice
and<00:05:17.140> on<00:05:18.140> the<00:05:18.230> inside<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.770> get<00:05:18.860> these<00:05:19.010> flick

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
and on the inside you get these flick

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.390 
and on the inside you get these flick
fire<00:05:19.520> missiles<00:05:20.200> all<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.410> have<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.650> do<00:05:21.770> is<00:05:22.100> push

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
fire missiles all you have to do is push

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.640 
fire missiles all you have to do is push
on<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.730> plunger<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.080> pushes<00:05:24.410> it<00:05:24.530> out

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
on the plunger and it pushes it out

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.780 
on the plunger and it pushes it out
there<00:05:24.800> for<00:05:25.780> like<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:26.990> so<00:05:27.920> I'm<00:05:28.460> not<00:05:28.580> going<00:05:28.700> to

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
there for like that so I'm not going to

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.860 
there for like that so I'm not going to
shoot<00:05:28.910> them<00:05:29.120> because<00:05:29.270> I<00:05:29.360> lose<00:05:29.570> them<00:05:29.690> really

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
shoot them because I lose them really

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.220 
shoot them because I lose them really
easily<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:31.460> center<00:05:31.730> wing<00:05:31.910> has<00:05:32.780> a<00:05:32.810> little

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
easily the center wing has a little

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.760 
easily the center wing has a little
engine<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.970> another<00:05:35.170> version<00:05:36.170> there's<00:05:36.620> the

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
engine on it another version there's the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.810 
engine on it another version there's the
intake<00:05:37.670> and<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.870> output<00:05:39.230> right<00:05:39.350> there<00:05:39.590> so<00:05:40.520> I

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
intake and the output right there so I

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.970 
intake and the output right there so I
do<00:05:41.660> kind<00:05:41.900> of<00:05:41.930> like<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.110> flip-flop<00:05:42.620> design

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
do kind of like the flip-flop design

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.810 
do kind of like the flip-flop design
with<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.060> weird<00:05:44.240> wings<00:05:44.480> and<00:05:45.550> there's<00:05:46.550> pretty

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
with the weird wings and there's pretty

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.490 
with the weird wings and there's pretty
cool<00:05:47.030> little<00:05:47.330> inputs<00:05:47.810> right<00:05:47.960> here<00:05:48.260> on<00:05:48.410> the

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
cool little inputs right here on the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.580 
cool little inputs right here on the
engines<00:05:48.800> or<00:05:48.920> intakes<00:05:49.420> so<00:05:50.420> it's<00:05:51.230> pretty<00:05:51.350> cool

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
engines or intakes so it's pretty cool

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.070 
engines or intakes so it's pretty cool
set<00:05:51.800> overall<00:05:55.390> that's<00:05:56.390> what<00:05:56.600> if<00:05:56.810> I<00:05:56.900> should

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
set overall that's what if I should

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.670 
set overall that's what if I should
recommend<00:05:57.350> this<00:05:57.530> or<00:05:57.680> not<00:05:57.770> it's<00:05:59.380> it's<00:06:00.380> a<00:06:00.470> cool

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
recommend this or not it's it's a cool

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.230 
recommend this or not it's it's a cool
set<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:00.980> have<00:06:01.160> but<00:06:01.490> I<00:06:01.520> would<00:06:01.730> wait<00:06:01.970> a<00:06:02.000> little
