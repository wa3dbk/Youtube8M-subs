millimeter crochet hook and I've already

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.400 
millimeter crochet hook and I've already
started<00:00:22.920> by<00:00:23.189> chaining<00:00:23.550> 5<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.630> my<00:00:24.779> foundation

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
started by chaining 5 for my foundation

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.650 
started by chaining 5 for my foundation
chain<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.490> number<00:00:26.789> will<00:00:26.939> depend<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.480> what

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
chain and the number will depend on what

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720 
chain and the number will depend on what
your<00:00:27.810> pattern<00:00:28.230> says<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> first<00:00:29.550> thing

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
your pattern says so the first thing

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
your pattern says so the first thing
that<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> want<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.439> make<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> single

that I want to do is to make a single
crochet<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> second<00:00:33.180> chain<00:00:33.210> from<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:33.750> hook

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
crochet in the second chain from my hook

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.549 
crochet in the second chain from my hook
so<00:00:34.559> just<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.610> normally<00:00:35.670> would<00:00:36.530> when<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so just like I normally would when I

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.200 
so just like I normally would when I
work<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.980> single<00:00:38.190> crochet<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
work a single crochet into the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.670 
work a single crochet into the
foundation<00:00:39.719> chain<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.170> gonna<00:00:40.320> work<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
foundation chain I'm gonna work at the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.670 
foundation chain I'm gonna work at the
same<00:00:40.980> way<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.660> working<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.410> one

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
same way so I'm working into that one

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
same way so I'm working into that one
loop<00:00:43.950> at<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.160> top<00:00:44.280> there<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.719> gonna

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
loop at the top there and I'm just gonna

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.779 
loop at the top there and I'm just gonna
kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.469> along<00:00:46.620> until<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> end

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
kind of go along until I get to the end

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.389 
kind of go along until I get to the end
of<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.360> row<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.460> my<00:00:50.670> foundation<00:00:51.360> chain<00:00:52.399> so

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
of my row and if my foundation chain so

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.130 
of my row and if my foundation chain so
now<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.180> last<00:00:55.170> chain<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.280> my

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
now here is my last chain of my

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.349 
now here is my last chain of my
foundation<00:00:58.140> chain<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> want<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> do

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
foundation chain and what I want to do

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.930 
foundation chain and what I want to do
is<00:01:00.660> imagine<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.800> my<00:01:01.890> patterns<00:01:02.280> has<00:01:02.520> three

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
is imagine that my patterns has three

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.500 
is imagine that my patterns has three
single<00:01:03.420> crochets<00:01:03.930> into<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.619> last<00:01:05.309> chain<00:01:05.700> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
single crochets into that last chain so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
single crochets into that last chain so
I'm<00:01:06.570> gonna<00:01:06.689> work<00:01:07.670> one<00:01:11.900> two<00:01:13.220> into<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> same

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
I'm gonna work one two into the same

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.179 
I'm gonna work one two into the same
spot<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.930> two<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.560> same<00:01:19.799> spot

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
spot so I have two into that same spot

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.679 
spot so I have two into that same spot
now<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> work<00:01:20.939> my<00:01:21.150> third<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.770 

so<00:01:26.320> there<00:01:26.560> we<00:01:26.799> have<00:01:27.070> three<00:01:27.909> single<00:01:28.390> crochets

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
so there we have three single crochets

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.709 
so there we have three single crochets
into<00:01:29.079> that<00:01:29.259> last<00:01:29.649> chain<00:01:30.039> now<00:01:31.030> that<00:01:31.210> next<00:01:31.600> thing

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
into that last chain now that next thing

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.169 
into that last chain now that next thing
your<00:01:31.869> pattern<00:01:32.259> will<00:01:32.439> say<00:01:32.710> is<00:01:32.979> work<00:01:33.670> into<00:01:34.060> the

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
your pattern will say is work into the

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.569 
your pattern will say is work into the
remaining<00:01:34.569> loops<00:01:35.469> of<00:01:35.679> your<00:01:35.799> foundation<00:01:36.340> chain

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
remaining loops of your foundation chain

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.609 
remaining loops of your foundation chain
so<00:01:36.789> what<00:01:36.939> I<00:01:36.969> want<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.390> do<00:01:37.569> is<00:01:37.750> turn<00:01:38.049> my<00:01:38.109> work

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
so what I want to do is turn my work

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.380 
so what I want to do is turn my work
around<00:01:39.869> instead<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:42.119> normally<00:01:43.119> what<00:01:43.299> I<00:01:43.329> would

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
around instead of normally what I would

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.149 
around instead of normally what I would
do<00:01:43.719> is<00:01:43.899> I<00:01:43.929> would<00:01:44.079> turn<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.439> like<00:01:44.709> this<00:01:44.920> and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
do is I would turn it like this and

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.010 
do is I would turn it like this and
start<00:01:45.369> working<00:01:45.579> across<00:01:45.939> but<00:01:46.329> because<00:01:46.689> we<00:01:46.840> want

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
start working across but because we want

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.349 
start working across but because we want
to<00:01:47.109> be<00:01:47.200> working<00:01:47.459> turning<00:01:48.459> this<00:01:48.549> into<00:01:48.849> a<00:01:49.000> round

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
to be working turning this into a round

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.630 
to be working turning this into a round
I<00:01:49.719> wanted<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.229> actually<00:01:50.380> turn<00:01:50.709> my<00:01:50.950> work<00:01:51.130> upside

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
I wanted to actually turn my work upside

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.719 
I wanted to actually turn my work upside
down<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.590> we've<00:01:53.590> already<00:01:53.890> worked<00:01:54.159> into<00:01:54.549> this

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
down and we've already worked into this

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.819 
down and we've already worked into this
stitch<00:01:55.149> here<00:01:55.179> and<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.689> was<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.109> three<00:01:56.530> that

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
stitch here and that was the three that

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.619 
stitch here and that was the three that
we<00:01:56.979> did<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.579> those<00:01:57.969> are<00:01:58.149> going<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.329> kind<00:01:58.539> of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:58.629 
we did and those are going to kind of

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.410 
we did and those are going to kind of
come<00:01:58.810> around<00:01:59.079> as<00:01:59.319> I<00:01:59.469> work<00:01:59.739> and<00:02:00.009> to<00:02:00.879> form<00:02:01.209> this

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
come around as I work and to form this

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.179 
come around as I work and to form this
sort<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.689> oval<00:02:02.110> shape<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:02.679> I'm<00:02:02.770> gonna<00:02:02.920> work

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
sort of oval shape and I'm gonna work

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.569 
sort of oval shape and I'm gonna work
into<00:02:03.549> my<00:02:03.700> next<00:02:04.770> chain<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.069> that's<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
into my next chain and that's the

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.319 
into my next chain and that's the
remaining<00:02:07.239> loop<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.369> laughs<00:02:09.700> from<00:02:10.179> when

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
remaining loop that is laughs from when

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.900 
remaining loop that is laughs from when
I<00:02:10.360> worked<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:11.079> side<00:02:11.349> of<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:11.950> I'm<00:02:12.640> going<00:02:12.819> to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
I worked this side of it so I'm going to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.289 
I worked this side of it so I'm going to
insert<00:02:13.329> my<00:02:13.390> hook<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:14.549> I'm<00:02:15.549> just<00:02:15.730> gonna<00:02:15.849> work<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
insert my hook and I'm just gonna work a

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.119 
insert my hook and I'm just gonna work a
single<00:02:16.510> crochet<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:17.319> like<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.650> would

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
single crochet just like I would

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.030 
single crochet just like I would
normally<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:22.290> I'm<00:02:23.290> going<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.470> come<00:02:23.709> into<00:02:23.859> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
normally and I'm going to come into the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.949 
normally and I'm going to come into the
next<00:02:24.370> one<00:02:24.579> and<00:02:24.819> work<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.540> single<00:02:25.720> crochet<00:02:30.959> and

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
next one and work a single crochet and

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.580 
next one and work a single crochet and
into<00:02:32.590> my<00:02:32.739> third<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.280> here

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.760 

and<00:02:37.130> that's<00:02:37.610> my<00:02:37.880> last<00:02:38.180> one<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.989> more<00:02:39.590> than

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
and that's my last one and more than

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.650 
and that's my last one and more than
likely<00:02:39.800> my<00:02:40.220> pattern<00:02:40.610> tells<00:02:40.849> me<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.180> work<00:02:41.330> too

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
likely my pattern tells me to work too

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.160 
likely my pattern tells me to work too
into<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.560> last<00:02:43.010> one<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:43.340> I'm<00:02:43.400> going<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.550> work

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
into that last one so I'm going to work

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.770 
into that last one so I'm going to work
too<00:02:45.170> into<00:02:45.650> there<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.910> that's<00:02:47.090> my<00:02:47.270> second<00:02:47.660> one

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
too into there so that's my second one

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.660 
too into there so that's my second one
into<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.140> same<00:02:48.349> space<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.920> then<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.489> would

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
into the same space and then I would

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.640 
into the same space and then I would
join<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.300> with<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.540> slip<00:02:50.900> stitch<00:02:51.050> into<00:02:51.470> that

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
join it with a slip stitch into that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.910 
join it with a slip stitch into that
first<00:02:52.160> single<00:02:53.000> crochet<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.720> that's<00:02:54.590> all

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
first single crochet and that's all

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.270 
first single crochet and that's all
there<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:57.080> working<00:02:57.440> both<00:02:57.650> sides<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:58.160> your

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
there is to working both sides of your

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.059 
there is to working both sides of your
foundation<00:02:59.000> chain<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.630> you<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.410> see<00:03:00.680> that

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
foundation chain and you can see that

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.240 
foundation chain and you can see that
now<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> have<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:02.209> going<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:02.780> an<00:03:02.900> oval<00:03:03.410> around
