00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 we see the pizza 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.300
 an express advice 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 I put it in milk to the matambre 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329
 dedicate actually I do not leave it in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 milk but if you cooked it in milk or 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.510
 that milk is present but in the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.510
 cooking and not so much 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.440
 the mother 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:10.350
 good, what I'm doing is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.360
 taking a little bit the fat is not 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.190
 like when you do rollup that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 you have that I did not like it, of course you have 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.299
 to tighten it in this case in this case 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.030
 we're going to leave it with a little fat and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 the key fat I put it down below what 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.170
 you say and this guy was wrong my grace 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 for the plate that I hold that is minimal 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.259
 it's not like that because this is going to shrink in 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.750
 the oven 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.369
 then I put salt I put pepper 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.090

 in 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.950
 very crazy but you know that if you change it 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.950
 much the boy flavor when this is in 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.020
 the oven do not forget that the cheese is 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.900
