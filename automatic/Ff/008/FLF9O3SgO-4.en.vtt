Dodge flatbed and haul our eschewed was

Dodge flatbed and haul our eschewed was
sometimes<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.570> crashes<00:03:30.050> your<00:03:30.200> game<00:03:30.440> when

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
sometimes it crashes your game when

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.550 
sometimes it crashes your game when
you're<00:03:31.040> tabbing<00:03:31.790> through<00:03:31.820> vehicles<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.690> don't

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
you're tabbing through vehicles I don't

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.350 
you're tabbing through vehicles I don't
know<00:03:33.620> why<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:33.860> does<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.100> but<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.760> guess<00:03:35.180> it's

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
know why it does that but I guess it's

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.320 
know why it does that but I guess it's
it's<00:03:35.570> a<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:36.320> flatbed<00:03:37.070> hauler<00:03:37.460> Dodge<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.300> a

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
it's a that flatbed hauler Dodge is a

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.550 
it's a that flatbed hauler Dodge is a

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
converted mod from 2011 so that might

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.040 
converted mod from 2011 so that might
have<00:03:42.770> something<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.730> attribute<00:03:44.240> towards<00:03:44.900> it

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
have something to attribute towards it

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.320
