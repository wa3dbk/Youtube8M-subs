00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.529 
bushes around and I wanted to show you
about<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.070> seed<00:00:26.279> saving<00:00:26.670> for<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:26.939> clematis

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
about the seed saving for this clematis

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.849

because<00:00:28.970> it<00:00:30.109> recedes<00:00:31.109> itself<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.740> you're

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
because it recedes itself so you're

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.680 
because it recedes itself so you're
constantly<00:00:32.040> getting<00:00:32.430> new<00:00:32.579> vines<00:00:32.880> every<00:00:33.300> year

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
constantly getting new vines every year

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
vines in here so this will need to be

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.880 
vines in here so this will need to be
cleaned<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.760> bit<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.329> cut<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> dead<00:00:40.040> out<00:00:41.870> the
