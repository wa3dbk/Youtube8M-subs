you want to go ahead and turn it off for

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.410 
you want to go ahead and turn it off for
now<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.930> once<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.369> ready<00:01:59.880> go

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
now so once you have all the ready go

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.889 
now so once you have all the ready go
ahead<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.960> hit<00:02:01.320> jailbreak<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.479> pretty<00:02:03.810> much

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
ahead and hit jailbreak so pretty much

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
ahead and hit jailbreak so pretty much
once<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.469> all<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> do<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
once you do that all you have to do is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.719 
once you do that all you have to do is
wait<00:02:06.270> until<00:02:06.350> evasion<00:02:07.350> tells<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.520> next

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
wait until evasion tells you the next

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:21.170 
wait until evasion tells you the next
step

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.149 

so<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.109> injecting<00:02:22.829> the<00:02:23.280> first<00:02:24.030> stage<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:28.349> it

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
so it's injecting the first stage and it

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.500 
so it's injecting the first stage and it
should<00:02:29.489> boot<00:02:29.819> off<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.359> there<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:32.510> once

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
should boot off and there we go and once

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.369 
should boot off and there we go and once
it<00:02:33.750> boots<00:02:33.959> back<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.370> don't<00:02:35.370> touch<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.939> or<00:02:36.599> do

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
it boots back on don't touch it or do

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.920 
it boots back on don't touch it or do
anything<00:02:37.620> until<00:02:38.099> you<00:02:38.639> get<00:02:38.849> instructions<00:02:40.730> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
anything until you get instructions and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.720 
anything until you get instructions and
