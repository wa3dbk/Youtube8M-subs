00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.710
 the Catholic advanced the cup final 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.270
 Chile after eliminating copper after 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.830
 duel captain cristian álvarez 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.810
 commented on the fight he had with the 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.700
 pigeon figueroa and remarked that no 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.230
 he will let no one come to insult him 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.230
 to the shirt that defends 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.090
 he ran away because of that fixed I tell you that a 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.579
 team as it was that so many people 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.590
 say that all the tranquility that the 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.269
 draw 1 to 1 we did not deserve because 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.970
 we had arrived because they 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.559
 they came to the arch maybe we were not very 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.629
 deep but yes keeping the ball 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.970
 keeping the gold and they do not 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.660
 they came out a penalty that I do not know if 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.820
 it was or it was not but 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.079
 but not after that we did not fall 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.960
 reader that we did not fall into despair 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.890
 and I really liked the game of this 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.750
 reading but look when they insult 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.100
 to the shirt when they insult me 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.320
 that I'm the team captain, this is what 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.670
 I will understand and no no I could not stand 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.979
 in the street to tell me that and less what 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.460
 I'm going to tell you here in San Carlos 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.460
 so 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.510
 not the same thing that happens but it is not and 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.550
 It is no longer I that I will defend 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.840
 always on the side of the copper to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.840
 ghost figueroa turned on the fan 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.240
 and criticized the determination of the lfp in 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.520
 when his punishment also commented the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.120
 mourning that eliminated affective 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.290
 because he scored goals is a team that 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.990
 half of court up has very 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.240
 good players and we came to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.280
 complicate it just in the part of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.080
 weak forms that in the defensive part 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 that's where I think that until the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.580
 minute 30 time version we had it 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.070
 totally controlled garcía yo yo creo 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.630
 that was a good match I do not the little 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.690
 people who came to the stadium that left 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.530
 happy for part because the picture 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.500
 local no but 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.010
 copper is not a match worthy of a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.210
 semifinal with the little with the little 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.340
 rest that we had that you know 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.020
 that the Catholic versed in those moments 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.959
 we have to go antofagasta return to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.640
 calama all badly organized in as much 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.650
 leandro gracián explained that the duel was 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.750
 pretty even but they failed in the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.670
 position of the ball and the team was left 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.100
 very beaten after saying goodbye to the cup 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.850
 chile is from a return match of 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.319
 equal to equal 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.390
 this time he won in cattolica the other great 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.069
 love 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.650
 and we won in the tournament we 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.470
 we draw 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.100
 we are then I think you have to have 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.060
 a little bit more phase 9 extra 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.000
 to cause to play having the ball 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.250
 and good nothing more than nothing we did not miss 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.040
 that 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.040
 it was definitely an even match and 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.319
 that of losing a lot of anger was lost 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.319
 I was very hurt
