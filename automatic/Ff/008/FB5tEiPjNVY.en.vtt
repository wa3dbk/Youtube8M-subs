00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.740 
the subs matter what even though they
are<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:09.810> Sonic<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.470> 100%<00:03:11.209> 100%<00:03:12.209> trust

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
are from Sonic and I 100% 100% trust

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.509 
are from Sonic and I 100% 100% trust
Sonic<00:03:13.109> but<00:03:13.530> it's<00:03:13.799> like<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.310> could<00:03:14.459> be

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
Sonic but it's like it could be

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.370 
Sonic but it's like it could be
something<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.819> of<00:03:14.880> their<00:03:15.060> control<00:03:15.359> like<00:03:16.230> say

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
something out of their control like say

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.750 
something out of their control like say
if<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.560> came<00:03:16.709> from<00:03:16.859> British<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.370> bad<00:03:17.519> or

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
if it came from British and bad or

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.330 
if it came from British and bad or
something<00:03:18.139> but<00:03:20.989> now<00:03:21.989> let's<00:03:22.230> turn<00:03:22.590> around<00:03:22.709> my

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
something but now let's turn around my

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.370 
something but now let's turn around my
multimeters<00:03:24.120> point<00:03:24.389> two<00:03:24.540> off<00:03:24.690> right<00:03:24.989> now<00:03:25.139> but

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
multimeters point two off right now but

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.539 
multimeters point two off right now but
it's<00:03:25.650> reading<00:03:25.890> at<00:03:25.980> 4<00:03:26.220> ohms<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:28.549> already

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
it's reading at 4 ohms so I already

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.920 
it's reading at 4 ohms so I already
multimeter<00:03:30.030> all<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> other<00:03:30.390> coils<00:03:30.720> are<00:03:30.840> all

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
multimeter all the other coils are all

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:31.670 
multimeter all the other coils are all
good<00:03:31.170> but

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
good but

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.320 
good but
always<00:03:32.040> check<00:03:32.310> everything<00:03:32.760> before<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.150> wire

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
always check everything before you wire

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.430 
always check everything before you wire
them<00:03:33.510> up<00:03:33.599> because<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.900> might<00:03:34.049> have<00:03:34.140> ordered

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
them up because you might have ordered

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.320 
them up because you might have ordered
like<00:03:34.650> dual<00:03:34.890> force<00:03:35.250> per<00:03:35.519> se<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.909> then<00:03:36.090> I've

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
like dual force per se and then I've

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.580 
like dual force per se and then I've
never<00:03:36.480> had<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:36.780> problem<00:03:36.989> before<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> have

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
never had this problem before but I have

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.690 
never had this problem before but I have
heard<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.830> people<00:03:37.890> having<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.340> problem<00:03:38.610> they

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
heard of people having the problem they

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.949 
heard of people having the problem they
ordered<00:03:38.940> Yule<00:03:39.060> fours<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.569> they<00:03:39.629> get<00:03:39.780> dual

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
ordered Yule fours and they get dual

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.300 
ordered Yule fours and they get dual
twos<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:40.560> assume<00:03:40.860> everything<00:03:41.250> is

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
twos and they assume everything is

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.280 
twos and they assume everything is
correct<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.760> they<00:03:41.849> wire<00:03:42.000> them<00:03:42.180> up<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.599> then

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
correct and they wire them up and then

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.009 
correct and they wire them up and then
you<00:03:43.409> blow<00:03:44.040> an<00:03:44.190> amp<00:03:44.370> or<00:03:44.700> blow<00:03:45.209> sub<00:03:45.569> or<00:03:45.750> something

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
you blow an amp or blow sub or something

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.270 
you blow an amp or blow sub or something
because<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.560> don't<00:03:46.709> have<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:46.950> wired<00:03:47.099> to<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
because you don't have it wired to the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.410 
because you don't have it wired to the
right<00:03:47.400> cord<00:03:47.580> figurations<00:03:48.150> you're<00:03:48.299> not

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
right cord figurations you're not

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.360 
right cord figurations you're not
getting<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.690> proper<00:03:48.900> power<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.250> always

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
getting the proper power so just always

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.890 
getting the proper power so just always
check<00:03:50.670> everything<00:03:51.090> before<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.510> install<00:03:51.780> I

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
check everything before you install I

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.289 
check everything before you install I
know<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.260> looks<00:03:52.379> all<00:03:52.530> sexy<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.069> stuff<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.579> got
