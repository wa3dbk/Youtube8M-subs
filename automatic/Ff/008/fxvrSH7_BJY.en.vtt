00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.219
 the ingredients are 4 eggs a yogurt 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.139
 of pineapple let's see this recipe very 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.359
 simple because all the measurements go in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 reference to yogurt so then 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.060
 taking as an example we yogurt 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.760
 to pour half a yogurt of olive oil 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.550
 two flour yogurts two yogurts from 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.500
 white sugar and a teaspoon of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.690
 yeast of course also 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 we need the natural pineapple if you do not have 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.710
 the natural pineapple as we are 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.510
 teaching here you can use it in 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.210
 syrup or fresh that sell it in cans 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.370
 we have started beating the eggs and 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.980
 now let's throw out the yogurt since 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.739
 we're going to need the yogurt for the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.300
 measure of the rest of the ingredients I 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.879
 I'm using pineapple is the most 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.780
 recommended but if not also what 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.399
 you can use strawberry or natural vale 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 because it is now such an intense flavor 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.500
 so that you notice a lot 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.450
 well we add the yogurt and we continue 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.180
 beating so that everything is integrated 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.250
 added the sugar now let's add 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.930
 the first measure of flour that had already 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.600
 added I already showed us how I'm going to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 take the second one as you always see as 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.200
 reference yogurt 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.970
 and we will continue to beat until it 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.710
 integrate very well very well very well all 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.690
 the ingredients 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.210
 we have already mixed all the ingredients 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.940
 So we've taken half yogurt 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.330
 oil and mix again while 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.000
 It is very important to warm up the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.659
 oven above and below to 190 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.550
 degrees is worth so good the mass of what 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.920
 that would be our cake would already be 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.780
 list now let's prepare the pineapple 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.280
 as I told you the mass of the fossil already 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.960
 is made so let's prepare the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.710
 mold we have put the mold where we are going 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.299
 to make the cake 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.100
 and then join with a little bit of 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.659
 butter you can spread it with a 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.150
 little butter with a little 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.240
 oil is worth what you want once 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.210
 we already have it well smeared 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.179
 both the base and the edges is 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.520
 very important that it does not stick so 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.720
 let's put it together 10 remove the 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.210
 butter that our left over 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.210
 and we are going to add a little bit of sugar 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.550
 with this we are going to get the 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.080
 first base of the cake because 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.140
 really what is below I think that 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.050
 then logically it will be up 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.070
 this adding 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.920
 the sugar here I see that there is a small 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.840
 little house and I'm putting all the sugar 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.850
 once I have the sugar and I just 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.410
 it is to put the pineapple 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.490
 so I'm going to put it like this 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:56.100
 It's worth all over the surface as you see 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.100
 super simple to do very fast 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.650
 and although I have given you these 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.629
 indications you can use canned pineapple 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.330
 you can use another yogurt 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.380
 once we have the whole mold 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.300
 covered with pineapple 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.300
 add the cake dough 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.370
 and you are ready to put in the oven you 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.120
 I remember about 30 35 minutes at 190 degrees 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.120
 above and below 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.150
 after 40 minutes in the oven already 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.519
 we have our pineapple cake ready 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.400
