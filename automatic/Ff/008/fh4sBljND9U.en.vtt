as<00:00:02.220> we've<00:00:02.490> posted<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.000> previous<00:00:03.389> logs<00:00:03.629> we're

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
as we've posted in previous logs we're

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.829 
as we've posted in previous logs we're
very<00:00:04.500> mindful<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.759> dynamics<00:00:06.720> and

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
very mindful of the dynamics and

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.930 
very mindful of the dynamics and
interactions<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:07.529> go<00:00:07.710> on<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.099> shadow<00:00:08.370> ages

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
interactions that go on and shadow ages

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.790 
interactions that go on and shadow ages
one<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.809> things<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.349> do<00:00:10.530> notice

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
one of the things that we do notice

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.160 
one of the things that we do notice
about<00:00:11.160> aging<00:00:11.519> animals<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.300> when<00:00:13.049> they

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
about aging animals is that when they

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.690 
about aging animals is that when they
are<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> little<00:00:13.469> bit<00:00:13.679> more<00:00:13.860> stiff<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> little

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
are a little bit more stiff for a little

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.740 
are a little bit more stiff for a little
bit<00:00:14.880> more<00:00:16.160> pain<00:00:17.240> from<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:18.480> kind<00:00:18.630> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
bit more pain from some kind of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.779 
bit more pain from some kind of
arthritic<00:00:19.109> condition<00:00:19.650> they<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> tendency

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
arthritic condition they have a tendency

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.509 
arthritic condition they have a tendency
to<00:00:20.820> over<00:00:21.090> compensate<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.109> weakness<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
to over compensate for that weakness and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
to over compensate for that weakness and
be<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> little<00:00:24.090> bit<00:00:24.269> more<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> tasks<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.439> their

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
be a little bit more and tasks in their

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
be a little bit more and tasks in their
dominance<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.279> we've<00:00:26.939> certainly<00:00:27.119> been

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
dominance and we've certainly been

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.870 
dominance and we've certainly been
seeing<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.050> shadow<00:00:28.320> lately<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.429> what

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
seeing that in shadow lately and what

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.590 
seeing that in shadow lately and what
you're<00:00:30.000> looking<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.189> clip<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.600> just

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you're looking at here is a clip of just

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.160 
you're looking at here is a clip of just
a<00:00:33.690> morning<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> wolf<00:00:34.290> care<00:00:34.559> again<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.280> shadow

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
a morning of wolf care again on shadow

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.600 
a morning of wolf care again on shadow
really<00:00:37.170> seems<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.739> having<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.489> bit

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
really seems to be having a little bit

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.830 
really seems to be having a little bit
more<00:00:38.730> difficult<00:00:38.910> time<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> high

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
more difficult time with the high

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
more difficult time with the high
humidity<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:41.070> we've<00:00:41.309> had<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> lot<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.700> those

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
humidity and we've had a lot of those

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
humidity and we've had a lot of those
high<00:00:42.030> humidity<00:00:42.329> days<00:00:43.129> certainly<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.280> may<00:00:44.489> be

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
high humidity days certainly that may be

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.600 
high humidity days certainly that may be
contributed<00:00:45.870> by<00:00:46.020> joint<00:00:46.260> swelling<00:00:46.410> etc<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
contributed by joint swelling etc and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.930 
contributed by joint swelling etc and
basically<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.239> you're<00:00:48.420> seeing<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.940> shadow

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
basically what you're seeing is a shadow

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
basically what you're seeing is a shadow
asserting<00:00:51.719> dominance<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:52.350> Denali<00:00:52.649> because

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
asserting dominance over Denali because

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
asserting dominance over Denali because
to<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.219> he's<00:00:53.399> doing<00:00:53.699> some<00:00:53.940> testing<00:00:54.329> behavior

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
to now he's doing some testing behavior

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.439 
to now he's doing some testing behavior
up<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.890> shadows<00:00:56.280> face<00:00:56.489> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.090> pushing<00:00:57.360> them

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
up on shadows face kind of pushing them

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.430 
up on shadows face kind of pushing them
around<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.920> thing<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> note<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> when

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
around and one thing to note is when

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
around and one thing to note is when
Gregor<00:01:01.440> comes<00:01:01.770> over<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.489> takes<00:01:02.670> over

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
Gregor comes over and kind of takes over

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.859 
Gregor comes over and kind of takes over
from<00:01:03.090> Denali<00:01:03.449> shadow<00:01:03.960> tends<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.860> leave<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
from Denali shadow tends to leave and

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.700 
from Denali shadow tends to leave and
again<00:01:06.869> those<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.110> things<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.500> we're

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
again those are things that we're

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.230 
again those are things that we're
watching<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.250> watching<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.700> shows<00:01:08.909> your

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
watching we're watching it shows your

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
watching we're watching it shows your
posture<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.900> you're<00:01:10.650> obviously<00:01:10.740> seeing

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
posture and you're obviously seeing

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
posture and you're obviously seeing
Denali<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.880> Aaden<00:01:12.180> run<00:01:12.210> up<00:01:12.360> sorry<00:01:12.990> Janelle

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
Denali and Aaden run up sorry Janelle

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.230 
Denali and Aaden run up sorry Janelle
Ian<00:01:13.500> grizzly<00:01:14.250> run<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> hill<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
Ian grizzly run up the hill and kind of

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.539 
Ian grizzly run up the hill and kind of
do<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> wrestling<00:01:15.869> match<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.340> really<00:01:17.340> not

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
do a wrestling match and really not

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
do a wrestling match and really not
shadows<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.659> able<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> keep<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
shadows not able to keep up with that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.399 
shadows not able to keep up with that
and<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.250> we're<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.670> real<00:01:21.479> life<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> we're

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and so we're a real life all that we're

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
and so we're a real life all that we're
really<00:01:22.590> watching<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.189> behavior<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
really watching that behavior and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.719 
really watching that behavior and
interpreting<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.189> shadows<00:01:26.189> doing<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.460> chin

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
interpreting it shadows doing a chin

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.060 
interpreting it shadows doing a chin
rest<00:01:26.939> over<00:01:27.420> Denali<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
rest over Denali and that is a way to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.730 
rest over Denali and that is a way to
try<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.509> force<00:01:30.509> metal<00:01:30.840> onto<00:01:30.990> submission<00:01:31.590> in

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
try to force metal onto submission in

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.120 
try to force metal onto submission in
your<00:01:31.890> aura<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.880> Denali<00:01:33.270> does<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.860> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
your aura and Denali does do that but it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
your aura and Denali does do that but it
comes<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.579> back<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.240> again<00:01:36.390> it's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
comes right back up and again it's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.200 
comes right back up and again it's
getting<00:01:36.810> much<00:01:37.350> harder<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> shadow<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.400> keep

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
getting much harder for a shadow to keep

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.580 
getting much harder for a shadow to keep
control<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> pack<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.350> why<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
control of the pack which is why you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.300 
control of the pack which is why you
probably<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:42.380> overreaction<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.710> much

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
probably see a overreaction or a much

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
probably see a overreaction or a much
more<00:01:44.520> intensified<00:01:45.060> balance<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.170> be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
more intensified balance that would be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.289 
more intensified balance that would be
necessary<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> other<00:01:47.610> thing<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.000> lot<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
necessary the other thing is a lot of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
necessary the other thing is a lot of
vocalization<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:49.979> when<00:01:50.159> an<00:01:50.250> animal

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
vocalization you know when an animal

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.350 
and as I say Denali this is all just
social<00:05:13.380> dynamics<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:14.340> is<00:05:14.550> social

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
social dynamics and this is social

social dynamics and this is social
interaction<00:05:15.900> this<00:05:16.080> is<00:05:16.230> not<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.410> negative

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
interaction this is not a negative

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.120 
interaction this is not a negative
situation<00:05:17.550> for<00:05:18.210> him<00:05:18.350> but<00:05:19.350> like<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.590> say<00:05:19.830> we<00:05:20.010> do
