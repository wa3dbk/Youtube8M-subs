00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.440
 I think a battle is approaching 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.650
 dance 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.650

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.599
 AHA 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:28.449

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.449
 let's try to be like this 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.449
 ah 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 more or less 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.809
 he did not succeed 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.930
 there are impossible things you have to accept 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.440
 as I do not know how to fly make up only in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.440
 Russian 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.870
 the Colombian that I do not understand 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.020
 whether what is helping for my 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.939
 presentation of the school but our 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.290
 working exaggerated not everyone 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.290

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.930
 I saw the ridiculous and that's it 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.810
 a diamond in the rough today 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.869

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.250
 movements 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 I believe that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.670
 the next round of dancing 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.570

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.570

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.050
 and on the other 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.590
 i 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.590
 good 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.410
 i 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.380
 Hello 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.780
 but it can not be 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.840
 it seems that he will not be able to overcome this 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.800
 but but you're doing 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.450
 the strip breathes 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.280
 I feel good and it has been a good 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.680

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.340
 I will not even half an hour 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.750
 stage and it still does not work out that you do not 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.079
 comes out because it's charity to the talent of 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.079
 lines 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.590
 on stage they stop and make a few 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.680
 steps like that and be spectacular clear 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.020
 as ridley that not only complete spelling 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.900

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.470
 exact 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.250
 i 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.250
 so is 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.450

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.640
 Yes, I think we could change a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.400
 makeup 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.209
