00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.580
 well let's see a typical incoming 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.200
 Indian cooking a cucumber the hairline 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.740
 ingredients that we go to your yogurt 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.029
 natural fresh cilantro cilantro chile 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.529
 black pepper onion ginger cumin 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.529
 ground and cilantro powder 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.039
 The first thing we have done has been to strip 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.679
 the cucumber once peeled with a 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.679
 grater and with the thickest part of 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.229
 is the finest median for that and this one 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.570
 and the thicker I come back we use this 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:53.570
 moment of the last hours and where the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.600
 cucumber put in pierce so we go 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.760
 we use a finer scratch to have 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.550
 but so much water does not expel everything and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.150
 will be quite famous because we do 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.150
 transverse shape we call scratching 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.690
 it's not that we have scratched the cucumber we are going to 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.340
 bring a little onion but a little 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.000
 the original recipe for this does not lead 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.400
 onion 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.070
 the cucumber hairline and the hairline 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.470
 onion if there was a mixture and makes a 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.790
 cucumber and onion very little just for 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.500
 that for something desired but without reaching 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.810
 to kill him 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.840
 we found a little 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.960
 what much said and even with what has 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.930
 released is worth us once we have 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.030
 grated the cucumber onion we have already 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.350
 chopped I'm also in fresh and the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.220
 Chile 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 at the time of incorporating 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.970
 the cucumber 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.570
 also incorporates chili and cilantro 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.590
 you can also use a variety that 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 comment 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.140
 me in this case in fact downtown 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.590
 On the other hand we have done a little bit of 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.590
 Pepper 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.149
 cumin 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.510
 in this dish it is characterized because 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.760
 has enough cum if there are if they have 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.160
 recipe recipes forgiveness say seeds 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.330
 of cumin what is yours is that you use the 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.220
 tortilla road seed a 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.540
 little before incorporating it into the plate 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.540
 a little bit of ginger 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.730
 and a lot 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.730
 and a little ground coriander powder 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.770
 also incorporates a little salt 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.700
 and we move everything quite 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.349
 we are all rectifying do some 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.989
 like a little more cumin a 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.740
 little more than being a little more 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.440
 cucumber 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.740
 the moment we would have our king is 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.740

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.569
 after having presented the king are you 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.220

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.629
 crunchy and with a species that is very 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.629
