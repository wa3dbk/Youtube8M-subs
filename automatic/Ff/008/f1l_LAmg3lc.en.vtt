00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.750
 facade 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.460

 sewn csp outside that is what we are 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.910
 see that protection is protection central and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.660
 two intermediate ones are not sewn i.e. 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.769
 can be cut and it will be one-piece windows 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.630

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.040
 game meter-wide daughter there you can 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.250
 make shelves for storage 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.560
 always missing in the house further we 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.600
 go hallways hallways width but 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.869
 approximate by top meter and a half 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:25.800
 70 meters possibly opposite the main 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.159
 entrance immediately will be the entrance to the kitchen left here 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.880

 the kitchen it will stand itself large 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:05.340
 Right angle that is estimated to 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.990
 hence why did we make the kitchen next to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.720
