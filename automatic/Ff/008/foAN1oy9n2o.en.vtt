00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.620
 time after nothing 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.620
 with me 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.160
 Horse 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 I lack 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.149
 yes 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.630
 and very good two kids that I have 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.490
 you are welcome to a video plus the 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.400
 last of the core of the nuclear pipe to 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:57.720
 23 is called slums when the group 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:59.890
 so then playing a group that does not 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.870
 one more game as I said the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.449
 last nuclear nuclear until 45 files are 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.490
 they see excursions the first of all was 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.460
 la de la five looks on the square map 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.920
 the second one, if I'm not mistaken, was the cac 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.210
 40 in raid after left the secum has 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.970
 on the map of mehldau I think that the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.979
 best of all with silver difference 45 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.710
 in root and good and finally it is 23 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.240
 hostages those who tried to get me out 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.190
 extreme a few times but national 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 has been in basic before commenting a 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.520
 little the characteristics of the weapon and 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.680
 tell you what I think compared to 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.910
 the rest tell you that obviously there was 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.229
 to put some music at the beginning 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.300
 because the 8 with all the nuclear a 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.030
 pippa tell you that as the series is 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.350
 finished then his life will remain in the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.520
 channel you already know that you have a few 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.189
 series 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.990
 how to improve in the call of duty also 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.530
 you have the doubts with all the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.090
 pistols the nuclear is subscriber the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.219
 I do not look for pla league so I say it for 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.420
 What do you say if you ask me? 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.860
 is at nuclear because maybe it was 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.159
 Nuclear subscribers the channel series 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.569
 it is there you do not know it does not also want 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.009
 a little talk about the hacker issue 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.420
 of the last apple that we have free 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.009
 we have the subject of which is the subject of 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.740
 the 23rd was good let's move on to the topic 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.939
 of the 23 will be the 23 you are then so 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.069
 general with fast charger and 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.929
 silencer goes very well but the truth 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.610
 that I go safer always with the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.459
 arms with enlarged because by being 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.530
 public without having to be six 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.290
 players those enemies because it's always 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.819
 needed more bullets than more quickly I 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.840
 that's why I like more enlarged corpses 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.549
 so I've loaded fast 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.319
 depending on what weapon for everything 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.600
 that of 23 because the long cannon and when 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.160
 You are extended for me 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.170
 indispensable as you always know 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.940
 that I only have four years ago with 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.200
 secondary because I do not like it much 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.030
 bring c4 anyway things 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.420
 secondary and I started four some 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.650
 crockery for more nothing more than anything else 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.900
 five or six casualties in the misunderstanding 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.890
 It's even that I think I get 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.620
 and then obviously nuclear what good 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.680
 that you see on a pretty good map 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.720
 the interest you are a gun that goes very 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.579
 well at close range it's great about 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.709
 everything for fashion league to make the video 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.879
 so league goes luxury but what good 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.470
 let's say we get the most 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.140
 full we would say that the gun more 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.800
 complete in cadence damage 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.390
 and reaches and of the you are 45 but difficult 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.880
 to use then well we would say that the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.850
 second gun I would usually say 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.730
 that the best in league is the cab 40 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.100
 obviously because you know or it seems like a 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.959
 scorpion but in pistolita and for 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.450
 publish even if I surprised what I wanted 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.709
 say then the five seven because the afa and 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.910
 they look because the truth that they have 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.090
 many bullets 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.840
 does not kill four bullets 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.730
 five bullets many times he kills 3 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.989
 also the cadence is pretty good 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.970
 even though it's a gun 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.440
 semiautomatic and I really like the 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.540
 true that I thought I was going to 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.129
 cost when I stayed nuclear with faith 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.550
 you see in the plaza map I thought that I 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.110
 it was going to cost a lot more and really 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.420
 since then I kept playing with that gun 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.099
 and it came out in pretty high gusts and I 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.480
 I recommend and try to take it in league 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.890
 also just in case although good that 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.269
 that I'll keep fewer bullets 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.390
 call the sun and such that the cac 40 with 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.100
 cans 45 is a handicap but try it 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.600
 also tell you about everything about the 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.480
 good hacker theme 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.430
 since I 've been these days without internet 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.010
 let's say fast to upload the videos and 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.810
 took 6 10 hours and I had to 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.250
 be in a place that is not my house here 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.380
 where I'm planning then I could not 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.419
 doing it could not raise them that's what 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.220
 it's basically happened then that I've 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.690
 done since I've been five days for everything 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.010
 the people looking for connection looking 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.210
 looking in the end to find a 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.830
 site with a good connection has 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.840
 cost a lot and I thought I was going to 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.100
 can upload videos less badly than I've 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.780
 could then he gave me all the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.460
 comments from hackers and all because 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.200
 I remember that I read all the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.580
 comments that the thing that I 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.919
 I answered comments have good things 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.660
 and bad things that if you insult or if 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.160
 disrespectful I read the comment and you 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.570
 I win the account because it is necessary to be 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.310
 respectful in the channel and we have all 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.390
 to collaborate not only with me but with 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.400
 the rest of the subscribers 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.590
 you should not be disrespectful and what 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.970
 second is that to read all the 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.340
 comments so I can take into account 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.930
 what you told me is true that the 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.610
 hacker's departure I did not upload all the 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.290
 necessary evidence to prove it to 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.900
 one hundred percent for sure I just 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.000
 I get it 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.130
 but that they already know how I am not 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.949
 One thing goes up because yes to do it 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.810
 spam or to gain visitors or whatever 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.090
 because that's not my style and if there were 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.580
 it's because I'm really sure of the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.530
 one hundred percent sure that's how it is 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.120
 I have a hundred thousand casualties in league I know what 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.310
 a person can do or can not do 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.479
 some comments telling me then if 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.449
 you have sunk an iron you hold on 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.800
 good as iron a silver I've already 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.150
 said that there are many players that 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.229
 they play competitive they are great 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.750
 that are coming because here the 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.370
 divisions give exactly the same only 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.720
 I say that normally a teacher usually 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.130
 be a little better than iron because 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.930
 The general thing is that it's normal but 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.699
 nothing else I do not say that the iron ones are 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.620
 banks there will be some that are terrific 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.910
 but it's about this guy because I do not 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.199
 it seemed normal I said I have 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.470
 here a thousand casualties he says I know what I do not 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.820
 I can do and that I intuit because of some 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.039
 way or another just when you are born from 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.570
 Respawn the positions where you're going 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.710
 it is strange to you maybe 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.780
 it seems strange to us because I 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.150
 league game seems strange to me then it's 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.620
 the typical kid who says what is he 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.400
 a fool and maybe they have seen me 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.870
 for the wow 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.310
 well boy well if you have not seen that 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.330
 we are in league and he says no thanks 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.340
 Help is because maybe you have 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.900
 a problem first we will have to see if see 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.620
 which is league mode not 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.020
 so 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.669
 then all of 100 thousand lows that 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.560
 I carry this to my past twice 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.300
 The video was deleted for the first time 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.760
 I was not erased I could not record it was a 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.440
 pure incredible and that look super clear 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.060
 in 10 minutes with the m8 the day doing 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.949
 spray before I always see myself in all 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.870
 the casualties here does not look so clear but 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.790
 pay attention to me that I'm sure obviously 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.650
 you can have the benefit of the doubt 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.120
 of some comment and read in plan then 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.889
 look, you have not shown him how he has to 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.330
 be I do not believe it at all I think 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.080
 perfect or it seems perfect because 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.520
 you are partly right then we are going to 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.470
 give more topics of more turns to the topic 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.389
 simply what I will do will be to be 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.150
 Attentive if it happens again that is weird 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:49.190
 then I will record it we will comment it and what 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.720
 you will see so you can see what knowledge 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.699
 the things that are so if it happens to me 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560
 then the alive ones to warn them for 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.330
 let us know and so you know that there 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.889
 people that does not mean that everything 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.229
 the world takes it that there are people who are 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.880
 that I 've seen in videos that are 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.560
 uploads of hackers and such people that 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.880
 it just has a kind of menu it 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.470
 activates the option to see the 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.940
 enemies with a kind of uber sat and 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.590
 you when you play against them you do not see them 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.570
 because they are not jumping on the map or 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.760
 they will not have infinite ammo no
