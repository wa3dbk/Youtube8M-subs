00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
way to figure it out and beat him

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.660 
way to figure it out and beat him
because<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.259> cuz<00:01:19.619> he's<00:01:19.770> Batman<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
I don't understand that because then

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
I don't understand that because then
you're<00:01:22.979> saying<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.659> Batman<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.689> overpowered

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
you're saying that Batman is overpowered

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
you're saying that Batman is overpowered
and<00:01:25.710> Batman<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.299> should<00:01:27.540> be

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and Batman is the one that should be

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.080 
and Batman is the one that should be
potentially<00:01:28.560> boring<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.400> honestly<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
