00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
given how positive first-half

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.640 
given how positive first-half
performance<00:00:10.559> was<00:00:11.120> yeah<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.150> mean<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.440> play

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
performance was yeah I mean we we play

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.829 
performance was yeah I mean we we play
welfare<00:00:14.160> stuff<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.480> know<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.719> only

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
welfare stuff and you know the only

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.599 
welfare stuff and you know the only
thing<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.440> didn't<00:00:16.650> do<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.039> stick<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> ball<00:00:17.460> in

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
thing we didn't do is stick the ball in

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.750 
thing we didn't do is stick the ball in
the<00:00:17.699> back<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.000> net<00:00:18.830> obviously<00:00:19.830> up<00:00:19.980> on

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
the back of the net obviously up on

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.040 
the back of the net obviously up on
myself<00:00:20.939> responsible<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.720> because<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
myself responsible for that because I

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.359 
myself responsible for that because I
had<00:00:22.170> probably<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> best<00:00:22.769> chance<00:00:23.160> for<00:00:23.840> us<00:00:24.840> but

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
had probably the best chance for us but

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.439 
had probably the best chance for us but
obviously<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.609> weren't<00:00:26.730> able<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> score<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
obviously we weren't able to score and I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.200 
obviously we weren't able to score and I
think<00:00:28.189> we<00:00:29.189> sort<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> work<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> way<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> way

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
think we sort of work the way the way

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.400 
think we sort of work the way the way
things<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.539> been<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.660> at<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> moment<00:00:30.990> I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
things have been going at the moment I

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.229 
things have been going at the moment I
think<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:32.009> know<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.309> need<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.910> scoring

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
think you know we need to be scoring

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.049 
think you know we need to be scoring

a<00:00:36.420> platform<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> build<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.710> obviously<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.129> did

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
a platform to build on obviously we did

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.000 
a platform to build on obviously we did
have<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> platform<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.090> terms<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.510> nil<00:00:39.690> nil

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
have a platform in terms of a nil nil

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.470 
have a platform in terms of a nil nil
and<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.160> were<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> half<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:41.850> saying<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and we were in a half time saying that

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
and we were in a half time saying that
you<00:00:43.260> know<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.559> need<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> produce<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you know we just need to produce the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.389 
you know we just need to produce the
same<00:00:44.309> performance<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.890> whatever<00:00:46.890> reason<00:00:47.280> we

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
same performance and whatever reason we

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.850 
same performance and whatever reason we
were<00:00:47.550> were<00:00:47.910> unable<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.860> that's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
were were unable to and that's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.200 
were were unable to and that's
ultimately<00:00:49.980> why<00:00:50.430> we've<00:00:50.670> why<00:00:50.969> we've<00:00:51.180> got

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
ultimately why we've why we've got

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
ultimately why we've why we've got
forget<00:00:51.570> she<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> factor<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.829> may<00:00:53.010> be

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
forget she was a factor that may be

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560 
forget she was a factor that may be
going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> second<00:00:53.760> half<00:00:53.879> still<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to second half still not have you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.670 
going to second half still not have you
made<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.870> breakthrough<00:00:55.140> maybe<00:00:55.469> nerve

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
made that breakthrough maybe nerve

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.599 
made that breakthrough maybe nerve
started<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> say<00:00:56.449> um<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:59.160> hard<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> say

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
started to say um it's hard to say

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
started to say um it's hard to say
really<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.969> mean<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
really I mean we we all in the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470 
really I mean we we all in the
changement<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.309> believe<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:03.359> we

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
changement we all believe that that we

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.939 
changement we all believe that that we
were<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.960> able<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.350> produce

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
were going to be able to just produce

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820 
were going to be able to just produce
the<00:01:05.220> same<00:01:05.369> again<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.560> win<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the same again and and going and win the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.530 
the same again and and going and win the
game<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> my

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
game you know just take one of my

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.649 
game you know just take one of my
chances<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> yeah<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.270> hard<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> say

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
chances but so yeah it's hard to say

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.320 
chances but so yeah it's hard to say
exactly<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> was<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.970> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

leaves no margin for four on tuesday
night<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.090> pick<00:01:18.780> ourselves

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
night we just have to pick ourselves

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
night we just have to pick ourselves
back<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.770> positive<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.119> know

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
back up be positive and you know

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
back up be positive and you know
believing<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.860> need<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
believing in you know we we just need to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.940 
believing in you know we we just need to
start<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.909> game<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> front<00:01:24.450> foot<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
start a game on the front foot and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
start a game on the front foot and
produce<00:01:25.950> two<00:01:26.520> good<00:01:26.729> halves<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> football<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
produce two good halves of football and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.850 
produce two good halves of football and
that<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.229> enough<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.470> win<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> game<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that will be enough to win the game and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
that will be enough to win the game and
and<00:01:29.250> we<00:01:29.729> believed<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.090> were<00:01:30.210> absolutely<00:01:30.689> touch

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and we believed we were absolutely touch

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.050 
and we believed we were absolutely touch
you<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:31.650> he<00:01:31.829> probably<00:01:31.979> turns<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.670> an

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you now because he probably turns to an

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.819 
you now because he probably turns to an
emphasize<00:01:33.540> important<00:01:34.140> usually<00:01:34.409> fact<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
emphasize important usually fact that a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
emphasize important usually fact that a
chance<00:01:35.070> doing<00:01:35.280> such<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> horrible<00:01:36.570> home<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
chance doing such a horrible home on a

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.520 
chance doing such a horrible home on a
high<00:01:37.640> yeah<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.970> don't<00:01:39.509> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:40.290> into

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
high yeah we don't want to be going into

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
high yeah we don't want to be going into
next<00:01:40.710> season<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.600> our<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:42.869> in
