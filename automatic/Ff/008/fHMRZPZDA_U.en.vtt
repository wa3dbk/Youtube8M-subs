going really really well the only thing
about<00:00:25.150> this<00:00:25.420> tank<00:00:25.750> is<00:00:25.990> that<00:00:26.290> it's<00:00:27.280> quite<00:00:27.700> bare

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
about this tank is that it's quite bare

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.300 
about this tank is that it's quite bare
there<00:00:28.450> isn't<00:00:28.720> anything<00:00:28.990> going<00:00:29.470> on<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.160> what

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
there isn't anything going on and what

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.489 
there isn't anything going on and what
happened<00:00:30.700> was<00:00:30.940> with<00:00:31.240> me<00:00:31.360> let's<00:00:31.990> see<00:00:32.169> and<00:00:32.469> a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:32.499 
happened was with me let's see and a

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.009 
happened was with me let's see and a
couple<00:00:32.679> months<00:00:32.859> ago<00:00:33.179> I<00:00:34.179> was<00:00:34.480> having<00:00:34.690> an<00:00:34.870> issue

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
couple months ago I was having an issue

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.340 
couple months ago I was having an issue
with<00:00:35.230> a<00:00:35.410> high<00:00:35.710> pH<00:00:36.010> my<00:00:36.489> pH<00:00:36.519> was<00:00:37.350> somewhere

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
with a high pH my pH was somewhere

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.270 
with a high pH my pH was somewhere
around<00:00:39.120> 6<00:00:40.120> or<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:40.960> well<00:00:41.620> being<00:00:41.949> me<00:00:42.159> of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
around 6 or so and well being me of

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.180 
around 6 or so and well being me of
course<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.640> freaked<00:00:42.879> out<00:00:43.030> so<00:00:43.589> it's<00:00:44.589> that<00:00:45.069> would

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
course I freaked out so it's that would

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.029 
course I freaked out so it's that would
be<00:00:45.280> okay<00:00:45.670> except<00:00:45.969> for<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.179> fact<00:00:46.420> that<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
be okay except for the fact that the

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.340 
be okay except for the fact that the
target<00:00:48.519> range<00:00:48.819> should<00:00:49.089> be<00:00:49.300> around<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:50.339> 7<00:00:51.339> to<00:00:51.429> 7.5

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
target range should be around a 7 to 7.5

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.619 
target range should be around a 7 to 7.5
the<00:00:53.350> more<00:00:53.559> consistent<00:00:53.859> of<00:00:54.159> pH<00:00:54.489> that's<00:00:54.940> totally

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
the more consistent of pH that's totally

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.169 
the more consistent of pH that's totally
fine<00:00:55.870> but<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.440> was<00:00:57.309> freaking<00:00:57.729> out<00:00:57.789> so<00:00:57.999> what<00:00:58.120> I

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
fine but I was freaking out so what I

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.069 
fine but I was freaking out so what I
did<00:00:58.389> is<00:00:58.889> in<00:00:59.889> my<00:01:00.010> previous<00:01:00.280> video<00:01:00.609> I've<00:01:00.819> had

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
did is in my previous video I've had

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
did is in my previous video I've had
terracotta<00:01:02.079> pots<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.739> I<00:01:02.800> had<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:02.979> bunch<00:01:03.159> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
terracotta pots and I had a bunch of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.600 
terracotta pots and I had a bunch of
rocks<00:01:05.110> in<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.439> tank<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.009> I<00:01:06.070> was<00:01:06.250> wondering<00:01:06.520> if

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
rocks in the tank and I was wondering if

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.859 
rocks in the tank and I was wondering if
maybe<00:01:06.729> that<00:01:06.909> was<00:01:07.090> causing<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.540> high<00:01:07.659> pH

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
maybe that was causing the high pH

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.870 
maybe that was causing the high pH
because<00:01:08.259> I<00:01:08.380> had<00:01:08.469> been<00:01:09.040> reading<00:01:09.399> about<00:01:09.460> that

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
because I had been reading about that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.999 
because I had been reading about that
could<00:01:10.570> be<00:01:10.719> a<00:01:10.960> possible<00:01:11.590> cause<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.950> took

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
could be a possible cause I took

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.999 
could be a possible cause I took
everything<00:01:12.520> out<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:12.969> about<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.770> couple<00:01:14.770> weeks

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
everything out and about a couple weeks

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.130 
everything out and about a couple weeks
to<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.310> month<00:01:15.369> later<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:15.939> realized<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.810> pH

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
to a month later I realized that the pH

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.740 
to a month later I realized that the pH
was<00:01:17.770> getting<00:01:18.369> back<00:01:18.520> in<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.729> normal<00:01:18.880> range<00:01:19.149> at

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
was getting back in the normal range at

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.590 
was getting back in the normal range at
about<00:01:20.140> seven<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.590> seven<00:01:20.829> point<00:01:21.070> five<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:22.210> that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
about seven to seven point five so that

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.270 
about seven to seven point five so that
was<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.930> couple<00:01:23.020> months<00:01:23.170> ago<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.799> I<00:01:23.950> really

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
was a couple months ago and I really

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.709 
was a couple months ago and I really
just<00:01:24.310> honestly<00:01:24.939> haven't<00:01:25.180> gotten<00:01:25.329> around<00:01:25.479> to

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
just honestly haven't gotten around to

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.370 
just honestly haven't gotten around to
putting<00:01:26.170> stuff<00:01:26.469> back<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:28.090> looking<00:01:28.990> into

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
putting stuff back in I'm looking into

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.510 
putting stuff back in I'm looking into
getting<00:01:29.530> some<00:01:29.920> new<00:01:30.390> decor<00:01:31.390> for<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.750> tank

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
getting some new decor for the tank

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.469 
getting some new decor for the tank
trying<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.640> find<00:01:33.820> something<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.270> maybe

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
trying to find something that maybe

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.740 
trying to find something that maybe
wouldn't<00:01:34.810> be<00:01:35.079> causing<00:01:35.469> a<00:01:35.530> high<00:01:35.649> pH<00:01:35.859> again<00:01:36.750> so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
wouldn't be causing a high pH again so

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.490 
wouldn't be causing a high pH again so
yeah<00:01:39.240> possibly<00:01:40.240> looking<00:01:40.689> into<00:01:40.930> getting<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.289> ton

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
yeah possibly looking into getting a ton

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.590 
yeah possibly looking into getting a ton
of<00:01:41.530> more<00:01:41.680> plants<00:01:42.130> but<00:01:42.430> I<00:01:42.640> was<00:01:43.000> also<00:01:43.240> having<00:01:43.390> an

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
of more plants but I was also having an

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.899 
of more plants but I was also having an
issue<00:01:43.689> with<00:01:43.899> my<00:01:44.350> Oscar<00:01:44.799> ripping<00:01:45.280> up<00:01:45.399> plants

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
issue with my Oscar ripping up plants

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.819 
issue with my Oscar ripping up plants
rearranging<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.899> tank<00:01:47.079> it's<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:47.350> funny<00:01:47.590> I

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
rearranging the tank it's so funny I

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.669 
rearranging the tank it's so funny I
would<00:01:48.579> do<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:48.789> water<00:01:49.030> change<00:01:49.469> taking<00:01:50.469> all<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
would do a water change taking all the

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:51.630 
would do a water change taking all the
plants<00:01:51.009> so<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.100> could<00:01:51.250> get<00:01:51.310> underneath

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
plants so I could get underneath

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.969 
plants so I could get underneath
everything<00:01:52.000> coming<00:01:52.899> back<00:01:53.109> and<00:01:53.380> he<00:01:53.590> would<00:01:53.829> be

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
everything coming back and he would be

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.139 
everything coming back and he would be
dragging<00:01:54.310> them<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.429> the<00:01:54.549> other<00:01:54.759> side<00:01:54.820> of<00:01:55.090> the

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
dragging them to the other side of the

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.910

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
move it and put him over here so we

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.920 
move it and put him over here so we
ended<00:02:13.599> up<00:02:13.690> with

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
ended up with

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.369 
with green water
what<00:02:53.829> started<00:02:54.129> was<00:02:54.340> an<00:02:54.430> algae<00:02:54.730> bloom

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
what started was an algae bloom

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.659 
what started was an algae bloom
well<00:02:56.379> bacteria<00:02:56.799> will<00:02:56.919> turn<00:02:57.159> into<00:02:57.340> an<00:02:57.430> algae

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:57.669 
well bacteria will turn into an algae

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.390 
well bacteria will turn into an algae
bloom<00:02:57.700> turn<00:02:58.030> into<00:02:59.010> phenology<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.219> that<00:03:00.310> was

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
bloom turn into phenology and that was

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.119 
bloom turn into phenology and that was
really<00:03:00.519> nasty<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.349> what<00:03:02.349> I<00:03:02.379> tried<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.919> is<00:03:03.040> I

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
really nasty so what I tried to do is I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
did not want to do any chemicals because

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.250 
did not want to do any chemicals because
I<00:03:06.549> just<00:03:06.849> hate<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.150> idea<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.450> putting<00:03:07.780> stuff<00:03:08.079> in

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
I just hate the idea of putting stuff in

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.929 
I just hate the idea of putting stuff in
the<00:03:08.319> tank<00:03:08.560> where<00:03:08.829> these<00:03:09.430> fish<00:03:09.579> are<00:03:09.760> gonna<00:03:09.849> be

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
the tank where these fish are gonna be

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.509 
the tank where these fish are gonna be
leaving<00:03:10.169> living<00:03:11.169> and<00:03:11.379> have<00:03:11.530> something<00:03:11.769> react

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
leaving living and have something react

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.039 
leaving living and have something react
with<00:03:12.669> them<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.269> know<00:03:13.389> it<00:03:13.599> would<00:03:13.719> be<00:03:13.840> fine

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
with them and I know it would be fine

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.050 
with them and I know it would be fine
but<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.349> still<00:03:14.590> creeps<00:03:14.769> me<00:03:14.919> out<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.099> I<00:03:15.609> was

but it still creeps me out so I was
looking<00:03:16.120> into<00:03:16.389> doing<00:03:16.810> diatom<00:03:17.319> filters<00:03:17.709> and

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
looking into doing diatom filters and

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.469 
looking into doing diatom filters and
even<00:03:18.159> looking<00:03:18.370> at<00:03:18.459> water<00:03:18.639> polishing<00:03:19.090> systems

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:19.479 
even looking at water polishing systems

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.020 
even looking at water polishing systems
