of beat up when I got it but it was

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.390 
of beat up when I got it but it was
relatively<00:00:15.900> inexpensive<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.740> was<00:00:16.859> almost<00:00:17.039> new

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
relatively inexpensive it was almost new

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.130 
relatively inexpensive it was almost new
but<00:00:17.730> they'd<00:00:17.910> used<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.480> about<00:00:18.570> two<00:00:18.840> years

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
but they'd used it for about two years

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.700 
but they'd used it for about two years
out<00:00:19.350> there<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.970> BLM<00:00:20.970> contract<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:22.500> got<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
little chain thing on one end and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.169

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.609 
another chain thing on the other end and
then<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.660> friend<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.080> mine<00:00:31.230> had<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
skid-steer plate and he made me a deal

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.540 
skid-steer plate and he made me a deal
on<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.680> don't<00:00:34.800> remember<00:00:34.920> exactly<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
on it I don't remember exactly what the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.100 
on it I don't remember exactly what the
deal<00:00:35.700> was<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.030> think<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.329> gave<00:00:36.510> 100<00:00:36.840> bucks<00:00:37.020> for

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
deal was I think I gave 100 bucks for

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.799 
deal was I think I gave 100 bucks for
the<00:00:37.350> something<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:38.010> remember<00:00:38.809> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
the something but I don't remember and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
the something but I don't remember and
then<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.260> welded<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> right<00:00:41.610> straight<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
then I just welded it right straight to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.440 
then I just welded it right straight to
the<00:00:42.390> three-point<00:00:42.899> hitch<00:00:43.050> Douma<00:00:43.620> Hickey<00:00:44.450> you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the three-point hitch Douma Hickey you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440 
the three-point hitch Douma Hickey you
can<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:47.000> little<00:00:48.000> hole<00:00:48.149> there

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
can kind of see the little hole there

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
can kind of see the little hole there
where<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> pin<00:00:49.050> used<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.730> hole<00:00:50.879> up

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
where the pin used to be and the hole up

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.529 
where the pin used to be and the hole up
at<00:00:51.239> top<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.730> did<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.000> simple<00:00:54.360> actually

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
at top and I just did it simple actually

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.779 
at top and I just did it simple actually
and<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> weird<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.460> seems<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and it's kind of weird and it seems to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.540 
and it's kind of weird and it seems to
work<00:00:56.820> pretty<00:00:56.940> good<00:00:57.300> actually<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.520> can

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
work pretty good actually and you can

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.049 
work pretty good actually and you can
kind<00:00:59.820> of<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> chain<00:01:01.440> gags<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.980> need<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> get

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
kind of see the chain gags I need to get

pressure<00:01:37.229> checking<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.390> found<00:01:39.659> that

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
pressure checking and I found that

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.789 
pressure checking and I found that
hydraulic<00:01:41.009> motor<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.079> local

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
hydraulic motor it was at the local

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.780 
hydraulic motor it was at the local
junkyard<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:45.619> somebody<00:01:46.619> had<00:01:47.040> brought<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
junkyard that somebody had brought in a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.819 
junkyard that somebody had brought in a
diaphragm<00:01:48.390> pump<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.049> actually<00:01:49.470> had<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
diaphragm pump that actually had that

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.539 
diaphragm pump that actually had that
motor<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
motor on it

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.209 
motor on it
and<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:52.740> took<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.640> pump<00:01:54.630> off<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.200> sold<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
and I took the pump off and sold the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.149 
and I took the pump off and sold the
diaphragm<00:01:56.729> pump<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.500> kept<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.649> hydraulic

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
diaphragm pump and kept the hydraulic

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.010 
diaphragm pump and kept the hydraulic
motor<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> look<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.810> actually

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
motor and if you look in there actually

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.130 
motor and if you look in there actually
I<00:02:01.229> maybe<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.280> loose<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.610> think

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
I maybe I can this is just loose I think

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.089 
I maybe I can this is just loose I think
you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> chain<00:02:07.099> lovejoy

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
you can see it's got a chain lovejoy

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.609 
you can see it's got a chain lovejoy
type<00:02:08.640> trip<00:02:09.090> thing<00:02:09.479> there<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:10.200> know<00:02:10.289> exactly

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
type trip thing there don't know exactly

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
type trip thing there don't know exactly
what<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.009> call<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.310> thing<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.510> there

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
what you call that thing but it's there

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.430 
what you call that thing but it's there
and<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.930> just<00:02:12.959> mounted

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and it just mounted

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.030 
and it just mounted
right<00:02:13.530> up<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.780> works<00:02:15.780> good<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.240> then<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.890> can

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
right up and works good and then you can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610 
right up and works good and then you can
see<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.310> hydraulics<00:02:20.910> they're<00:02:21.810> not<00:02:21.990> as<00:02:22.200> neat<00:02:22.470> as

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
see my hydraulics they're not as neat as

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
see my hydraulics they're not as neat as
they<00:02:22.740> could<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.670> stuff<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.060> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
they could be but it's just stuff that I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.540 
they could be but it's just stuff that I
found<00:02:24.510> laying<00:02:24.870> around<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.220> only<00:02:26.370> thing<00:02:26.460> I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
found laying around and the only thing I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.100 
found laying around and the only thing I
had<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:26.940> buy<00:02:27.210> on<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.570> thing<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:27.930> that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
had to really buy on this thing was that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.260 
had to really buy on this thing was that
skid<00:02:28.380> plate<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.440> this

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
skid plate and that you can see this

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.310 
skid plate and that you can see this
bypass<00:02:33.270> here<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:34.530> got<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.770> have<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.300> bypass

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
bypass here you got to have a bypass

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.720 
bypass here you got to have a bypass
it's<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.410> little<00:02:37.620> free<00:02:37.830> will<00:02:38.070> when<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.400> shut<00:02:38.610> it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it's a little free will when you shut it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.090 
it's a little free will when you shut it
off<00:02:38.850> otherwise<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:39.650> grinds<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> halt

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
off otherwise it just grinds to a halt

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.190 
off otherwise it just grinds to a halt
all<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.270> is<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> circuit<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.930> goes<00:02:43.080> from

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
all that is is a circuit that goes from

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.590 
all that is is a circuit that goes from
one<00:02:43.290> host<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.830> other<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:45.240> when<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:45.450> under

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
one host to the other so when it's under

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.970 
one host to the other so when it's under
pressure<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.050> goes<00:02:46.200> around<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.680> when<00:02:46.860> it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
pressure it goes around but when it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.280 
pressure it goes around but when it
stops<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.520> goes<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.330> goes<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.200> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
stops it goes it goes back to the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.640 
stops it goes it goes back to the
pressure<00:02:49.920> circuit<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.490> just<00:02:50.730> three<00:02:51.060> wheels

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
pressure circuit in just three wheels

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.120 
pressure circuit in just three wheels
and<00:02:54.020> yeah<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.170> works<00:02:55.320> pretty<00:02:55.530> good<00:02:55.650> pretty

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
and yeah that works pretty good pretty

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.970 
and yeah that works pretty good pretty
impressed<00:02:56.960> especially<00:02:57.960> since<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.740> don't<00:02:58.830> have

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
impressed especially since I don't have

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.350 
impressed especially since I don't have
much<00:02:59.130> money<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.490> it<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.820> thing<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.150> real

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
much money in it and this thing is real

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.160 
much money in it and this thing is real
fast<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.700> lot<00:03:02.700> easier<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.270> use<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> skid

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
fast it's a lot easier to use on a skid

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.550 
fast it's a lot easier to use on a skid
steer<00:03:04.200> than<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:06.240> use<00:03:06.510> when<00:03:06.960> you're

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
steer than it is to use when you're

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.100 
steer than it is to use when you're
sitting<00:03:08.310> there<00:03:08.340> when<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.090> get<00:03:09.270> my<00:03:09.600> age<00:03:09.630> it's

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
sitting there when you get my age it's

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.820 
sitting there when you get my age it's
kind<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.380> tough<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.940> turn<00:03:11.940> around<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.540> and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
kind of tough to turn around and and

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.350 
kind of tough to turn around and and
watch<00:03:13.830> where<00:03:14.070> you're<00:03:14.220> mowing<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.790> then<00:03:14.940> my<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
watch where you're mowing and then my I

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.900 
watch where you're mowing and then my I
have<00:03:15.870> an<00:03:15.990> old<00:03:16.140> 70<00:03:16.860> horsepower<00:03:17.100> tractor<00:03:17.760> but

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
have an old 70 horsepower tractor but

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.430 
have an old 70 horsepower tractor but
it's<00:03:18.030> got<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> clutch<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.720> five-speed<00:03:19.230> or

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
it's got a clutch and a five-speed or

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.740 
it's got a clutch and a five-speed or
six-speed<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:21.030> got<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.270> clutch<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.630> all

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
six-speed and you got to clutch it all

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.360 
six-speed and you got to clutch it all
the<00:03:21.840> time<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.290> go<00:03:22.380> into<00:03:22.590> reverse<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.280> was

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the time and go into reverse and it was

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.240 
the time and go into reverse and it was
so<00:03:23.640> much<00:03:23.790> work<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.270> was<00:03:24.360> hard<00:03:24.920> she<00:03:25.920> put<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.160> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
so much work and was hard she put on the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.400 
so much work and was hard she put on the
skid<00:03:26.459> steer<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.850> then<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.270> smells<00:03:28.170> real

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
skid steer and then it just smells real

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.090 
skid steer and then it just smells real
quick<00:03:28.970> yeah<00:03:29.970> last<00:03:30.360> year<00:03:30.570> when<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.530> first<00:03:31.620> built

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
quick yeah last year when I first built

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.220 
quick yeah last year when I first built
that<00:03:32.310> skids<00:03:32.820> here<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.150> had<00:03:33.300> this<00:03:33.420> little<00:03:33.600> it's

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that skids here we had this little it's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.920 
that skids here we had this little it's
just<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.440> little<00:03:34.560> field<00:03:34.860> but<00:03:35.630> it's<00:03:36.630> where<00:03:36.840> we

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
just a little field but it's where we

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.479 
just a little field but it's where we
keep<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.110> chickens<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.980> ducks<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
keep the chickens and ducks and

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.229 
keep the chickens and ducks and
what-have-you<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:40.350> weeds<00:03:40.950> were<00:03:41.239> six

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
what-have-you and the weeds were six

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.780 
what-have-you and the weeds were six
feet<00:03:42.480> tall<00:03:42.690> in<00:03:42.989> here<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:44.340> looked<00:03:44.519> kind<00:03:44.580> of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
feet tall in here and it looked kind of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.190 
feet tall in here and it looked kind of
unsightly<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.630> put<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.660> mower

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
unsightly and so I put that mower

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.080 
unsightly and so I put that mower
together<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.709> could<00:03:49.800> mow<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.489> couple

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
together so I could mow this a couple

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.330 
together so I could mow this a couple
times<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.390> year<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:52.769> see<00:03:52.950> over<00:03:53.160> there<00:03:53.310> I
