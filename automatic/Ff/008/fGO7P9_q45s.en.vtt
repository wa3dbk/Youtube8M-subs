but<00:00:50.909> we're<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.179> use<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.719> total<00:00:52.499> knob

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
but we're going to use this total knob

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.299 
but we're going to use this total knob
version<00:00:53.280> B<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> latest<00:00:54.359> one<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
version B which is the latest one and

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.709 
version B which is the latest one and
the<00:00:56.309> first<00:00:56.519> time<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.699> did<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.909> was<00:00:57.059> manually<00:00:57.569> but

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the first time I did it was manually but

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.540 
the first time I did it was manually but
someone<00:00:58.319> who<00:00:58.379> actually<00:00:58.530> made<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.890> installer

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
someone who actually made the installer

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.290 
someone who actually made the installer
for<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> you're<00:01:02.039> gonna<00:01:02.159> need<00:01:02.280> wine<00:01:02.640> okay

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
for this so you're gonna need wine okay

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.910 
for this so you're gonna need wine okay
so<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.600> you're<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.809> Mac<00:01:04.050> or<00:01:04.290> something<00:01:04.680> just

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
so if you're on Mac or something just

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.700 
so if you're on Mac or something just
get<00:01:05.220> wine<00:01:05.520> and<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.060> should<00:01:06.210> work<00:01:06.710> but

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
get wine and this should work but

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.290 
get wine and this should work but
basically<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> program<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.060> going<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
basically this program is just going to

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.230 
basically this program is just going to
put<00:01:09.480> in<00:01:09.890> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> right<00:01:11.220> files<00:01:11.550> into

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
put in you know the right files into

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.110 
put in you know the right files into
your<00:01:12.630> memory<00:01:12.930> stick<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:14.040> said<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
your memory stick and I said so like I

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.300 
your memory stick and I said so like I
said<00:01:15.240> before<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.320> 6<00:01:16.620> 20<00:01:17.160> if

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
said before make sure you have 6 20 if

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
said before make sure you have 6 20 if
you<00:01:17.370> have<00:01:17.460> anything<00:01:17.670> else<00:01:17.880> don't<00:01:18.660> be<00:01:18.750> an<00:01:18.900> idiot

so I'll go next and agree next now click
on<00:01:25.430> change<00:01:25.790> here<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:27.500> don't<00:01:27.650> try<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.800> find<00:01:28.070> you

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
on change here you don't try to find you

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.730 
on change here you don't try to find you
where<00:01:28.520> your<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.930> know<00:01:30.050> your<00:01:30.080> your<00:01:30.290> memory

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
where your you know your your memory

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.580 
where your you know your your memory
circuit<00:01:31.070> card<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.790> that<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.110> in<00:01:33.260> your<00:01:33.380> root

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
circuit card is that so is in your root

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.660 
circuit card is that so is in your root
folder<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.190> it's<00:01:34.460> in<00:01:34.610> our<00:01:34.820> media<00:01:35.210> folder

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
folder and it's in our media folder

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.280 
folder and it's in our media folder
expand<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.880> should<00:01:38.120> be<00:01:38.150> called<00:01:38.450> dis<00:01:38.840> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
expand that I should be called dis and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.160 
expand that I should be called dis and
that's<00:01:40.160> it<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.460> hit<00:01:40.580> ok<00:01:40.970> now<00:01:41.840> it's<00:01:41.990> going<00:01:42.080> to

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
that's it you hit ok now it's going to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.080 
that's it you hit ok now it's going to
change<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.650> like<00:01:42.860> drive<00:01:43.220> em<00:01:43.520> or<00:01:43.790> whatever

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
change it to like drive em or whatever

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.460 
change it to like drive em or whatever
the<00:01:44.210> hell<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.420> this<00:01:44.600> it's<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.290> try<00:01:45.410> to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the hell is this it's going to try to

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.860 
the hell is this it's going to try to
emulate<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.010> windows<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.690> click

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
emulate the windows and you click

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.600 
emulate the windows and you click
next<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.350> that's<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.710> you're<00:01:48.830> done<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.520> will

it so hopefully you not to do that with
the<00:02:26.650> patapon<00:02:27.159> demo<00:02:28.150> hack<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:29.470> I'm<00:02:29.650> not<00:02:29.829> going

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
the patapon demo hack but I'm not going

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.429 
the patapon demo hack but I'm not going
to<00:02:29.980> talk<00:02:30.430> about<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.939> I'm<00:02:31.689> assuming<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.319> know

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
how to do that already anyways it has

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.550 
how to do that already anyways it has
everything<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:36.159> it<00:02:36.459> doesn't<00:02:36.700> have<00:02:36.849> a<00:02:37.560> iso

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
everything but it doesn't have a iso

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.349 
everything but it doesn't have a iso

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
like other games like Mortal Kombat it

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.300 
like other games like Mortal Kombat it
didn't<00:03:35.169> really<00:03:35.290> run<00:03:35.470> well<00:03:35.739> or<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> street

fighter<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:37.060> was<00:03:37.209> kind<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.419> laggy<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.049> not<00:03:38.709> all

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
fighter it was kind of laggy so not all

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.789 
fighter it was kind of laggy so not all
games<00:03:39.159> are<00:03:39.400> really<00:03:39.879> great<00:03:40.590> with<00:03:41.590> this

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
games are really great with this

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.130 
games are really great with this
emulator<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.690> get<00:03:43.870> what<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.019> get

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
emulator so you get what you get

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.740 
emulator so you get what you get
but<00:03:46.069> basically<00:03:46.310> what<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:47.030> really<00:03:47.210> want<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.540> do

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
but basically what you really want to do

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.860 
but basically what you really want to do
is<00:03:47.930> play<00:03:48.140> games<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.160> know<00:03:49.400> with<00:03:49.580> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
is play games you know with the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.510
