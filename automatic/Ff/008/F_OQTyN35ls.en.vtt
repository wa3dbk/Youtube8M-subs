00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.580
 let's see how we build the 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.010
 paired comparison matrices and 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 we calculate the eigenvectors of the 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.790
 players with respect to the variables and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.890
 let's see the two cases when we 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.180
 we find in the quantitative case and 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.310
 when we are in the case 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.099
 qualitative 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.380
 and this would be a classic structure of 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.710
 valuation of a player in which 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.480
 we intend to value the player at x 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.160
 having these comparable and having 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.129
 this structure of characteristics 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.839
 personal sports with these 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.080
 secondary variables well first thing 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:44.110
 what we have to do as we already know and 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.780
 if it has been seen in other videos is 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.890
 calculate the weight of all the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.800
 variables 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 This can be done through the 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.690
 paired comparison matrices 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.850
 we calculate the first matrix of 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.399
 primary varieties and the two matrices 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.930
 of the secondary variables and the 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.660
 product of both will give us the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.850
 final weighting of the variables 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.640
 secondary that are with respect to the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.830
 which are we going to compare the players 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.420
 this would be the structure already with the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.050
 condemnations of the variables that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.470
 we have which is 66 with 41% 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.170
 the games played 110 and 61 the data 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.950
 599 etcetera and now the next step 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.930
 is to compare the players with respect to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.369
 each of the variables but if 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.679
 we observe the variables we will see that there 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.300
 quantitative and variable variables 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.190
 qualitative variable with negative are 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.259
 the goals the games played the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.240
 assists the age 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.270
 those are variables that we can find 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.920
 information about them in publications in 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.630
 newspapers and magazines on the internet 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.190
 etcetera we can know the goals that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.110
 each of these players has marked 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.909
 but if these variables with directives 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.320
 of his treatment to obtain the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.500
 own vector is simply 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.990
 look for the goals in this case of each 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.080
 player and normalize by the sum for 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.970
 add all the goals and divide each the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.380
 goals for each player for the sum or what 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.720
 same the games played are the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.080
 assists and so on so I'm 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.630
 here is sum one would be the own vector 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.550
 of the players with respect to the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.470
 variable goals and this is the diameter 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.270
 own of the players with respect to 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.190
 matches 4 or when they are 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.410
 quantitative vector variables 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.840
 own are obtained by normalizing by the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.420
 add the quantitative data of that 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.890
 variable but when the variable is 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.930
 qualitative as is the case of the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.459
 leadership and relevance the vector 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.260
 own is obtained through the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.110
 surveys and matrices of 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.170
 paired comparison and we make from 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.700
 of those surveys so that 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.470
 using experts or personally 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.310
 each of these matrices is made 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.290
 laterality and relevance is verified that 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.570
 is consistent and that would be the vector 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.239
 own so that at the end of both 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.130
 processes what we have is on the one hand 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.080
 the weighting of the variables that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.920
 we have obtained at the beginning and on the other 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.500
 side 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.510
 one of the players with respect to each 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.250
 one of the variables the variables 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.380
 quantitative here and in the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.930
 qualitative variables here at the end 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.240
 the product of both we will see more 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.520
 forward that gives us the result of the 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.170
 weighting of players with 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.790
 with respect to all the variables that is what 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.620
 that we are looking to get your 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.790
 value well with this we have seen how 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.560
 build the comparison matrices 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.570
 paired of the players with respect to 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.940
 the variables and calculate your vector 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.100
 own both in cases where the 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.570
 variable is quantitative as when the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.570
 variable is qualitative
