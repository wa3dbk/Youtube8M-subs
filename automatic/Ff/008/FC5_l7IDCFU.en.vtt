I want it was four or five well I didn't

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.229 
I want it was four or five well I didn't
go<00:00:32.619> against<00:00:32.860> it's<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.129> whole<00:00:33.250> time<00:00:33.430> but<00:00:34.150> you

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
go against it's the whole time but you
