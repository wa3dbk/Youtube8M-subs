00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
 Before we start right away 

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.660
 I forgot to add this to this episode. 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.040
 This is Dan Jones. 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.720
 He is a guest artist this week. 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.280
 He is very cool 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.180
 Ok, let's get started. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.120
 If you watch this album often 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.840
 You probably know that we believe in free game mode. 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.720
 We think he has potential 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.560
 Become a good thing in the video game industry 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 Allow consumers to spend the money they think the game is worth 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.760
 And simultaneously 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.540
 Let game developers not miss it 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.300
 Consumers who cannot pay the full retail price 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.120
 Or those who are willing to go far beyond the basic retail price to extend the experience. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700
 Ideally 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.120
 This model is perfect 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.700
 Closer to home, I am fed up. 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.380
 Recent free game mode 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.320
 Already destroyed 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.440
 Trapped in moral error 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.240
 James has consulted many free games. 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.660
 And they all rushed to the cliff 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 You can find today's free games 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.700
 Ninety percent or more profit 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.800
 Earn less than 10% of players 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 They depend on what they call 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.620
 blue whale 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.160
 The kind of person who will spend thousands of dollars on the game 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.880
 And this psychology destroys this model for consumers. 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.860
 This makes the industry unprofitable 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.800
 Kill each other 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.580
 In short, morally disgusting 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.460
 This is really something we should be ashamed of. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.960
 So let us explain why this is a bad business model. 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.120
 At the same time, I believe this will resonate with some of these game developers. 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.520
 So the problem is here 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.160
 You fell into the free game arm competition 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.940
 There are a limited number of blue whales here 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.160
 And everyone needs them to maintain this game. 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.340
 Means that everyone wants to kill each other for these blue whales. 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.460
 I hate this title. 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.340
 This has led to a skyrocketing budget for freemium games. 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.320
 Especially mobile devices and social networks 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 User recruitment cost 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.700
 One year higher than one year 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.220
 At the same time, rewards and advertising space are getting more expensive. 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.360
 And more and more useless 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 This arm race turned into let us 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.040
 Create a game that caters to the blue whale 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.760
 Many free games in the game have been 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.120
 Farther and farther away from those who are willing to pay $5 to $10 to enjoy a satisfying gaming experience 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.620
 Instead, focus on creating the experience 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.220
 For those who are willing to throw hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month. 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.260
 Lost those 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.700
 All those who are unwilling or unable to pile up a lot of money 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 Cause non-blue whale players to leave this game 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.940
 This not only makes the game lose profits from others 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.880
 Also let the game lose these players as blue whale game content. 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 This is very basic 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.820
 Because most blue whales want to get from their huge expenses. 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.800
 Is a sense of satisfaction or help other players 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.240
 The collective travel of such low-cost players and free players 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.120
 Lack of ability to gain satisfaction 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.920
 After a while 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.640
 Players who cause higher expenses also quit 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.600
 But because these players are very basic 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.620
 To create the experience that blue whales pursue 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.020
 Indispensable for game makers 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.200
 Go to get new players 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.960
 As fast as old players 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.420
 This leads to high advertising costs 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.100
 Also further increase the cost of recruiting new players in the future 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.300
 Because the player takes turns 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.920
 And the company needs to work harder 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.800
 Go find the game content that the player becomes a blue whale 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.380
 This core cannot be sustained 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.660
 If the free game market continues from this road 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.360
 Will self-destruct 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.800
 If the free game industry wants to survive 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.740
 We need to turn our attention to the average player. 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.720
 As a designer 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.880
 I didn’t shout in the air. 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.380
 Say we should turn these experiences completely free 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.520
 But even as a consumer, I don’t think these experiences should be free. 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.060
 I accept spending $5-10 on the game. 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.540
 I mean I have spent $60 to buy games. 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.300
 And for this good game, I am happy to spend this money. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.760
 But this should be an investment 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.580
 We want to pursue from consumers 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.860
 Not for the $5 million bill 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.280
 Listen, I can be the first to say 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.040
 I think those who decrypt free games are actually not free people. 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.420
 Those lamenting and cursing free game makers 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.300
 Do not directly send them to spend tens of millions of products to do the performance of super disdain 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.300
 I even admit 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.220
 This is a barrier we have to overcome 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.500
 This title becomes an evolutionary online culture 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.520
 But at the same time I will be the first person 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.340
 Go to resist those who say they are not finished free games 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 Because they can’t actually pay for it to play it 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.980
 In the current market and now the standard business model 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.120
 They are correct 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.320
 I don't have actual data but 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.280
 But I am willing to make a big bet. 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.140
 The storm comes from more than 10% of the revenue of Hearthstone 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.500
 From those who spend less than $50 on the game in a month 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.880
 In fact, I dare to bet that he is far more than this ratio. 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.480
 Why do they have a satisfying experience because they only have two dollars? 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.300
 And they don’t miss those blue whales. 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.800
 They don't rule out those who want to set up the best deck right away. 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.020
 And people who are willing to spend thousands of pieces to complete it. 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.860
 But they also do not become slaves of such people. 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.280
 That's the future profitable and sustainable free game. 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.760
 I know that I sound very angry. 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.200
 Actually there is a little 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.500
 Even surpassing the problem of stable operation 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.980
 I also argue that the current free game has surpassed the moral bottom line. 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.680
 We have free games accused 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.240
 Try to lie to kids to spend money on their parents 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.960
 And make people bankrupt 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.280
 Listen, I don’t envy someone who spends a lot of money to buy happiness. 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.760
 Enjoy the sense of escape 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.200
 I will be a hypocrite if I say this 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.460
 But if you are playing games 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.800
 And you are not talking about happiness or fun or participation in the office. 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.720
 Instead, start talking about how 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.220
 Get thousands of dollars from people's hands 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.100
 Just for some is just a moment 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.700
 Some are not permanent things in your game. 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.520
 You are on the wrong path 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.320
 There are many ways to play games on human psychology. 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.640
 Feeling uneasy about the money on hand 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.460
 This is not the purpose of the game. 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.480
 And remember what I said. 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.920
 If you are about to let a person lose 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.660
 Ten thousand pieces are like 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.200
 Bragging ability or virtual friend 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.940
 You can't be unintentional 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.140
 To manipulate humanity and abuse the ugliest side of humanity 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.200
 You know and you keep doing 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.480
 You add these things to your design 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.120
 Is this the purpose of our decision to play the game? 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.580
 Listen to many of us 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.540
 In this industry 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.040
 Get a good life without crossing that line 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.920
 A new way of making money does not mean we need to compromise 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.620
 We have said many, many times 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.620
 This model has unlimited potential 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.600
 Many studios are proving this 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.420
 Storm RIOT VALVE WARGAMING Sony SPRYFOX GRINDINGGEARGAME 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.820
 This model can reach friendly consumers 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.780
 And surprisingly successful without resorting to predatory skills 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.140
 Just for your good 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.940
 Throw it away
