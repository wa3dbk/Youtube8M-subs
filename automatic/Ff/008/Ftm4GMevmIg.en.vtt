00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
finishes that you can get in a woodgrain

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160 
finishes that you can get in a woodgrain
different<00:01:51.149> types<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.420> wood<00:01:51.540> grain<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
different types of wood grain and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.929 
different types of wood grain and
they've<00:01:52.439> also<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.710> two<00:01:52.979> premium<00:01:53.460> finishes

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
definitely the speaker system they're

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.560 
definitely the speaker system they're
showing<00:02:05.670> off<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.030> boot<00:02:06.180> they<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.360> have

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
showing off at the boot they do have

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.020 
showing off at the boot they do have
some<00:02:06.750> others<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.340> complete<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
some others but it's a complete as I

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360 
some others but it's a complete as I
said<00:02:09.239> systems<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.840> got<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.039> six

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
said systems you got the one to the six

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.240 
said systems you got the one to the six
the<00:02:11.550> eight<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> ten

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
the eight and a ten

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.270 
the eight and a ten
and<00:02:13.110> over<00:02:14.110> here<00:02:14.290> you've<00:02:14.440> got<00:02:14.620> these<00:02:14.770> effect

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and over here you've got these effect

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.860 
and over here you've got these effect
speakers<00:02:15.700> these<00:02:15.850> are<00:02:15.970> bipolar<00:02:16.330> dipole

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
speakers these are bipolar dipole

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.570 
speakers these are bipolar dipole
speakers<00:02:17.410> are<00:02:17.560> switchable<00:02:18.100> so<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.490> have

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
speakers are switchable so you can have

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.170 
speakers are switchable so you can have
them<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.760> either<00:02:18.910> way

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
them go either way

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.670 
them go either way
obviously<00:02:19.720> dipole<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.320> gonna<00:02:20.470> give<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.650> a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
obviously dipole is gonna give you a

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.380 
obviously dipole is gonna give you a
more<00:02:20.800> diffused<00:02:21.220> sound<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:22.150> can<00:02:22.270> point

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
more diffused sound if you can point

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.430 
more diffused sound if you can point
them<00:02:22.570> at<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.720> null<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.140> listening

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
them at the null of the listening

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.740 
them at the null of the listening
position<00:02:23.830> by<00:02:24.820> pole<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.180> gonna<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.450> good<00:02:25.630> if

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
position by pole it's gonna be good if

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.510 
position by pole it's gonna be good if
you<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.020> have<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.350> ability<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:27.280> one<00:02:27.490> a

you just have the ability to to one a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.560 
you just have the ability to to one a
little<00:02:27.670> more<00:02:27.850> if<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.120> sound<00:02:28.360> maybe<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
little more if you sound maybe you

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.940 
little more if you sound maybe you

that<00:02:40.090> goes<00:02:40.240> in<00:02:40.450> well<00:02:40.690> with<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.900> series<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
that goes in well with the series and it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.280
