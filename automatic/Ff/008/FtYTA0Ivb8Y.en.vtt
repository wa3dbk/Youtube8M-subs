00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
people if you were extremely lucky I

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.439 
people if you were extremely lucky I
just<00:04:54.250> think<00:04:54.400> it's<00:04:54.550> awesome<00:04:54.849> in<00:04:54.970> general<00:04:55.330> which

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
just think it's awesome in general which

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.480 
just think it's awesome in general which
is<00:04:55.599> why<00:04:55.750> I'm<00:04:55.960> showing<00:04:56.139> it<00:04:56.440> basically<00:04:57.129> you<00:04:57.310> line

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
is why I'm showing it basically you line

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.010 
is why I'm showing it basically you line
up<00:04:57.699> in<00:04:57.819> the<00:04:57.909> clouds<00:04:58.150> and<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.509> hits<00:04:58.659> the<00:04:58.810> car

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
up in the clouds and it hits the car

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.600 
up in the clouds and it hits the car
next<00:04:59.259> to<00:04:59.379> the<00:04:59.530> bomb<00:04:59.710> and<00:04:59.889> bounces<00:05:00.250> up<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.520> the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
next to the bomb and bounces up in the

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.300 
next to the bomb and bounces up in the
air<00:05:00.759> and<00:05:00.940> over<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.240> fence<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.860> quite<00:05:03.099> hard

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
air and over the fence it's quite hard

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.860 
air and over the fence it's quite hard
to<00:05:03.370> me<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.699> show<00:05:03.909> how<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.360> exactly<00:05:04.629> works

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
to me to show how it exactly works

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.290 
to me to show how it exactly works
because<00:05:05.530> I'm<00:05:06.159> always<00:05:06.370> looking<00:05:06.699> in<00:05:06.789> the<00:05:06.909> air<00:05:07.060> so

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
because I'm always looking in the air so

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:17.910 
because I'm always looking in the air so
I'll<00:05:07.389> try<00:05:07.629> and<00:05:07.810> show<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:08.080> in<00:05:08.169> third<00:05:08.349> person

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.990 

apart<00:05:18.920> from<00:05:19.040> that<00:05:19.250> on<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.430> attack<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:19.760> really

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
apart from that on the attack I really

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.070 
apart from that on the attack I really
don't<00:05:20.180> know<00:05:20.300> what<00:05:20.450> else<00:05:20.600> you<00:05:20.750> could<00:05:20.870> line<00:05:21.050> up

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
don't know what else you could line up

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.750 
don't know what else you could line up
to<00:05:21.380> Nate<00:05:21.560> does<00:05:21.860> anything<00:05:22.070> else<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.580> could

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
to Nate does anything else you could

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.890 
to Nate does anything else you could
just<00:05:22.790> generally<00:05:23.390> throw<00:05:23.600> it<00:05:23.720> in<00:05:23.810> that

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
just generally throw it in that

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.020 
just generally throw it in that
direction<00:05:24.140> right<00:05:25.040> where<00:05:25.220> people<00:05:25.580> sit

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
direction right where people sit

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.550 
direction right where people sit
I<00:05:26.060> mean<00:05:26.600> if<00:05:26.750> he'll<00:05:26.840> always<00:05:26.960> sit<00:05:27.230> at<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.380> red

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
I mean if he'll always sit at the red

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.990 
I mean if he'll always sit at the red
car<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.800> top<00:05:28.130> of<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.310> street<00:05:28.520> so<00:05:28.730> you<00:05:28.760> just

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
car the top of the street so you just

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.510 
car the top of the street so you just
gotta<00:05:29.180> throw<00:05:29.390> a<00:05:29.450> nade<00:05:29.660> over<00:05:29.870> there<00:05:33.340> sit<00:05:34.340> for

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
gotta throw a nade over there sit for

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.860 
gotta throw a nade over there sit for
needs<00:05:34.730> I<00:05:34.910> don't<00:05:35.090> really<00:05:35.270> have<00:05:35.450> much<00:05:35.630> else

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
needs I don't really have much else

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.780 
needs I don't really have much else
because<00:05:36.050> I've<00:05:36.260> always<00:05:36.410> been<00:05:36.500> an<00:05:36.740> SMG<00:05:37.070> on<00:05:37.490> city

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
because I've always been an SMG on city

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.250 
because I've always been an SMG on city
streets<00:05:37.880> so<00:05:38.270> I<00:05:38.330> never<00:05:38.420> knew<00:05:38.720> living<00:05:39.080> tank

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
streets so I never knew living tank

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.110 
streets so I never knew living tank
mates<00:05:39.470> because<00:05:40.040> I<00:05:40.280> basically<00:05:40.670> just<00:05:40.790> rush

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
mates because I basically just rush

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.680 
mates because I basically just rush
everywhere

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
everywhere

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.660 
everywhere
I'll<00:05:42.140> quickly<00:05:42.350> go<00:05:42.530> over<00:05:42.650> some<00:05:42.860> ball<00:05:43.160> bangs<00:05:43.400> but

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
I'll quickly go over some ball bangs but

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.980 
I'll quickly go over some ball bangs but
I<00:05:43.700> don't<00:05:43.910> think<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:44.330> map<00:05:44.540> really<00:05:44.690> has<00:05:44.870> that

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
I don't think this map really has that

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.360 
I don't think this map really has that
many<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.320> them<00:05:45.470> either<00:05:45.590> because<00:05:45.890> all<00:05:46.280> the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
many of them either because all the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.750 
many of them either because all the
buildings<00:05:46.700> are<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.000> huge<00:05:48.370> firstly<00:05:49.370> this<00:05:49.520> one

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
buildings are so huge firstly this one

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.790 
buildings are so huge firstly this one
is<00:05:49.910> always<00:05:50.300> always<00:05:50.600> even<00:05:51.260> it<00:05:51.350> is<00:05:51.440> probably<00:05:51.680> the

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
is always always even it is probably the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.920 
is always always even it is probably the
most<00:05:51.950> important<00:05:52.520> is<00:05:52.940> primarily<00:05:53.390> done<00:05:53.720> with

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
most important is primarily done with

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.600 
most important is primarily done with
the<00:05:54.050> scope<00:05:54.290> I<00:05:54.470> have<00:05:54.680> died<00:05:54.890> if<00:05:55.100> it<00:05:55.190> was<00:05:55.400> spraying

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
the scope I have died if it was spraying

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.100 
the scope I have died if it was spraying
at<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:55.820> baked<00:05:55.970> air<00:05:56.180> as<00:05:56.300> well<00:05:56.420> it<00:05:56.960> basically

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
at the baked air as well it basically

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.960 
at the baked air as well it basically
starts<00:05:57.680> people<00:05:57.980> rushing<00:05:58.340> middle<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.820> also

starts people rushing middle can also

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.670 
starts people rushing middle can also
kill<00:05:59.270> the<00:05:59.300> scope<00:05:59.660> who's<00:05:59.930> trying<00:06:00.200> to<00:06:00.350> spam<00:06:00.530> in
