00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.690 

so<00:00:07.200> here's<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.500> scraper<00:00:07.710> mixer<00:00:07.799> pro<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
so here's the scraper mixer pro the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.370 
so here's the scraper mixer pro the
first<00:00:08.730> thing<00:00:09.150> you<00:00:09.269> notice<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.080> inclusion

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
first thing you notice is the inclusion

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.060 
first thing you notice is the inclusion
of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.830> scraper<00:00:11.099> beta<00:00:12.410> so<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.559> scraper<00:00:13.799> beta

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
of the scraper beta so the scraper beta

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.470 
of the scraper beta so the scraper beta
is<00:00:14.190> essentially<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.759> leaf<00:00:14.940> beetle<00:00:15.269> we'd

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
is essentially the leaf beetle we'd

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.480 
is essentially the leaf beetle we'd
normally<00:00:15.630> get<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.170> all<00:00:16.289> mixers<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.310> it's

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
normally get with all mixers but it's

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.130 
normally get with all mixers but it's
with<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.090> addition<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.630> windscreen

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
with the addition of this windscreen

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.200 
with the addition of this windscreen
wiper<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:20.039> fairly<00:00:20.250> obvious<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.029> it's

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
wiper it's fairly obvious but what it's

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
wiper it's fairly obvious but what it's
doing<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.900> scraping<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.500> bowl<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.890> every

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
doing is scraping the bowl with every

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.550 
doing is scraping the bowl with every
turn<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.240> does<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.960> combines<00:00:25.350> your

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
turn and what that does it combines your

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.710 
turn and what that does it combines your
butter<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> sugar<00:00:26.609> into<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.240> light<00:00:27.449> fluffy

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
butter and sugar into a light fluffy

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
butter and sugar into a light fluffy
texture<00:00:28.230> quicker<00:00:28.650> keeping<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> air<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
texture quicker keeping the air in the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.640 
texture quicker keeping the air in the
mix<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.750> results<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.410> lighter

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
mix and that results in a lighter

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.130 
mix and that results in a lighter
fluffier<00:00:32.219> cake<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.780> show<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.960> how<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
fluffier cake so just show you how it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.860 
fluffier cake so just show you how it
works<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:38.149> we<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.300> some<00:00:39.510> cubed

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
works so we have some cubed

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
works so we have some cubed
room-temperature<00:00:40.620> butter<00:00:41.809> we<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
room-temperature butter we have the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.860 
room-temperature butter we have the
equivalent<00:00:45.440> amount<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.620> sugar<00:00:50.690> just<00:00:51.690> lock

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
equivalent amount of sugar just lock

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.290 
equivalent amount of sugar just lock
that<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.550> you'll<00:00:53.550> also<00:00:53.699> see<00:00:54.000> there's<00:00:54.210> no

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that in you'll also see there's no

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
that in you'll also see there's no
numbers<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.870> speeds<00:00:55.199> recipes<00:00:56.010> don't

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
numbers for your speeds recipes don't

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.680 
numbers for your speeds recipes don't
call<00:00:56.460> phone<00:00:56.610> numbers<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:56.940> call<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.300> tasks

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
call phone numbers they call for tasks

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
call phone numbers they call for tasks
so<00:00:57.840> we've<00:00:58.050> opted<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> most<00:00:59.280> common

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
so we've opted for for the most common

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.670 
so we've opted for for the most common
baking<00:01:00.000> tasks<00:01:00.449> I'll<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.109> dial<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
baking tasks I'll just dial it up to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:16.410 
baking tasks I'll just dial it up to
creaming

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.359 

I'll<00:01:17.420> just<00:01:17.659> stop<00:01:17.899> that<00:01:18.079> halfway<00:01:18.289> through<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
I'll just stop that halfway through the

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.399 
I'll just stop that halfway through the
scrape<00:01:19.670> Abita<00:01:20.030> avoids<00:01:20.479> me<00:01:20.719> having<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.110> get<00:01:21.259> my

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
scrape Abita avoids me having to get my

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.190 
scrape Abita avoids me having to get my
spatula<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.700> continually<00:01:23.210> lift<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.509> lid<00:01:23.719> to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
spatula to continually lift the lid to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.510 
spatula to continually lift the lid to
scrape<00:01:24.470> down<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.680> sides<00:01:25.039> because<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
scrape down the sides because the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.130 
scrape down the sides because the
scraper<00:01:25.789> beta<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:26.390> scraping<00:01:26.750> down<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.020> sides

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
scraper beta is scraping down the sides

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:46.840 
scraper beta is scraping down the sides
itself<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.890> every<00:01:28.039> turn

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.940 

so<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.060> couple<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.390> minutes

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
so in a couple of minutes

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
so in a couple of minutes
perfectly<00:01:49.950> cream<00:01:50.340> butter<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.870> because<00:01:51.870> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
perfectly cream butter and because it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.420 
perfectly cream butter and because it
was<00:01:52.050> done<00:01:52.230> quickly<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.860> scrape<00:01:53.100> Abita

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
was done quickly with the scrape Abita

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.800 
was done quickly with the scrape Abita
its<00:01:53.610> retain<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.120> air<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
its retain the air which is going to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.450 
its retain the air which is going to
give<00:01:54.960> us<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.140> light<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.620> fluffy<00:01:55.830> cake<00:01:56.010> once

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
give us a light and fluffy cake once

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.790 
give us a light and fluffy cake once
baked<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.170> only<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.500> you've<00:01:58.590> got<00:01:58.710> the
