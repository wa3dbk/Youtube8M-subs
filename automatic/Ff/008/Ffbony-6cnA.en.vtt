aren't really any huge differences the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
aren't really any huge differences the
interface<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.010> largely<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.820> same<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.450> can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
interface is largely the same you can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.040 
interface is largely the same you can
see<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.469> new<00:00:43.739> live<00:00:43.980> wallpaper

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
see that we have this new live wallpaper

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.900 
see that we have this new live wallpaper
but<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> sunbeam<00:00:47.250> live<00:00:47.520> wallpaper

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
but for the sunbeam live wallpaper

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.500 
but for the sunbeam live wallpaper
there's<00:00:48.180> nothing<00:00:48.570> major<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> biggest

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
there's nothing major and the biggest

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
there's nothing major and the biggest
change<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.739> camera<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.730> into

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
change is in the camera if you go into

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
change is in the camera if you go into
the<00:00:54.030> camera<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> new<00:00:54.870> camera<00:00:55.289> menu

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the camera you see the new camera menu

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.229 
the camera you see the new camera menu
here<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:57.329> used<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> circular<00:00:59.239> menu

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
here you used to have a circular menu

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
here you used to have a circular menu
with<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> options<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:02.280> now

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
with all the options right here now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
with all the options right here now
that's<00:01:02.850> changed<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.989> actually<00:01:04.320> find<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> more

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that's changed we actually find it more

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.429 
that's changed we actually find it more
convenient<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.670> new<00:01:05.939> way<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
convenient this new way and all the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
convenient this new way and all the
options<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.159> accessible<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.150> press<00:01:09.479> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
button or button on the bottom and you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.300 
the camera and that's how they look like
you<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.299> select<00:01:21.659> HDR<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.920> shoot<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you have we can select HDR to shoot in a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.480 
you have we can select HDR to shoot in a
jar<00:01:23.549> modern<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.990> exposure<00:01:25.650> have

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
jar modern not have the exposure have

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.999 
jar modern not have the exposure have
some<00:01:26.700> basic<00:01:27.150> settings<00:01:27.390> here<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.740> timer

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
some basic settings here like the timer

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.670 
some basic settings here like the timer
and<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.119> select<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.680> whether

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and so on you can also select to whether

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
and so on you can also select to whether
you<00:01:31.920> you'd<00:01:32.220> use<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.670> won't<00:01:32.880> use<00:01:33.119> flash<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you you'd use or won't use flash and you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.899 
you you'd use or won't use flash and you
also<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.290> switch<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.070> front-facing

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
also can switch to the front-facing

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420 
also can switch to the front-facing
camera<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.799> back<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> main

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
camera you just go back to the main

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.390 
camera you just go back to the main
camera<00:01:38.700> right<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:40.770> probably<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
camera right now so that's probably the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
camera right now so that's probably the
biggest<00:01:41.670> change<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.240> Google<00:01:43.049> has<00:01:43.200> made<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
biggest change that Google has made to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.399 
biggest change that Google has made to
Android<00:01:43.829> 4.3<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.750> terms<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> other

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
Android 4.3 and in terms of other

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
Android 4.3 and in terms of other
changes<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.430> why<00:01:48.290> does<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.320> even<00:01:49.770> exist<00:01:50.280> so

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
changes and why does it even exist so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.389 
changes and why does it even exist so
the<00:01:51.210> reason<00:01:51.600> most<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> reasons<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.920> under

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the reason most of the reasons are under

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.600 
the reason most of the reasons are under
the<00:01:53.610> hood<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.840> will<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.350> quickly<00:01:55.500> run<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the hood so we will just quickly run and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
the hood so we will just quickly run and
to<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.210> actually<00:01:57.360> we<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> score<00:01:58.350> here

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to to actually we have the score here

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.539 
to to actually we have the score here
and<00:01:59.329> really<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.810> ran<00:02:01.110> our<00:02:01.290> tests<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and really when we ran our tests on the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.590 
and really when we ran our tests on the
4.2<00:02:03.420> based<00:02:04.700> Samsung<00:02:05.700> Galaxy<00:02:05.969> s4<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.390> got

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
4.2 based Samsung Galaxy s4 we got

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.680 
4.2 based Samsung Galaxy s4 we got
around<00:02:07.310> 24,000<00:02:08.509> 25,000<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:10.500> m2<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.220> here

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
around 24,000 25,000 on m2 to here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.770 
around 24,000 25,000 on m2 to here
score<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:12.080> slightly<00:02:12.530> higher<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.910> we<00:02:14.600> can't

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
score is slightly higher and we can't

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.960 
score is slightly higher and we can't
really<00:02:14.900> say<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.530> because<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> model<00:02:16.610> or
