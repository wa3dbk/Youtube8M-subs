00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
this was a very good use of flash the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.710 
this was a very good use of flash the
reason<00:01:53.490> why<00:01:53.580> i<00:01:53.610> flashed<00:01:53.970> there<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.390> because<00:01:54.570> i

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
reason why i flashed there was because i

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
reason why i flashed there was because i
got<00:01:54.930> stunned<00:01:55.290> by<00:01:55.470> vein<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.790> order<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.180> get

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
got stunned by vein and in order to get

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.140 
got stunned by vein and in order to get
out<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> her<00:01:58.230> targeting<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> stay<00:01:59.550> alive<00:01:59.850> i

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
out of her targeting and stay alive i

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.270 
out of her targeting and stay alive i
had<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.690> flash<00:02:00.990> away<00:02:01.260> from<00:02:01.440> her<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.800> she<00:02:01.830> would

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
had to flash away from her so she would

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.640 
had to flash away from her so she would
inadvertently<00:02:02.910> click<00:02:03.630> where<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.290> standing

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
inadvertently click where I was standing

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.250 
inadvertently click where I was standing
before<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.850> she<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.120> move<00:02:06.240> forward<00:02:06.630> waste<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
before so she would move forward waste a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.570 
before so she would move forward waste a
split<00:02:07.500> second<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.100> bought<00:02:08.310> me<00:02:08.399> enough

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
split second and that bought me enough

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.280 
split second and that bought me enough
time<00:02:08.760> to<00:02:08.790> kill<00:02:09.060> her<00:02:09.149> apparently<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.960> moment<00:02:10.229> I
