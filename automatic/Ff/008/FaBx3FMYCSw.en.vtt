00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.870 
I have take it off us you'll see a
little<00:01:13.200> modification<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.760> did<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.700> if<00:01:17.700> we

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
little modification I did to this if we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.820 
little modification I did to this if we
turn<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> round<00:01:19.790> hold<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> camera

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
turn it round hold it up to the camera

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.020

might<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:23.070> able<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:26.030> made

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
might be able to see that I have made

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.480 
might be able to see that I have made
the<00:01:27.210> whole<00:01:27.540> much<00:01:28.500> bigger<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.250> only

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the whole much bigger because they only

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
the whole much bigger because they only
had<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.939> tiny<00:01:30.479> hole<00:01:30.930> which<00:01:31.170> sound<00:01:31.530> went

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
had a little tiny hole which sound went

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.219 
had a little tiny hole which sound went
through<00:01:32.040> which<00:01:32.250> gave<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> very<00:01:33.780> tinny

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
through which gave this a very tinny

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.580 
through which gave this a very tinny
sound<00:01:34.350> indeed<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> widen<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> hole<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.170> also

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
sound indeed so widen the hole and also

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.210 
sound indeed so widen the hole and also
taking<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> back<00:01:38.790> off<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.270> that's

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
taking the back off because that's

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.620 
taking the back off because that's
improved<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.400> sound<00:01:41.670> quality<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.270> it's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
improved the sound quality but it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.010 
improved the sound quality but it's
still<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.320> very<00:01:43.380> good<00:01:44.270> because<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:45.600> i<00:01:45.630> plug

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
still not very good because when i plug

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.380

quality<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.800> um<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.819> microphone<00:02:39.390> on

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
quality of this um the microphone on

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.839 
quality of this um the microphone on
this<00:02:39.750> headset<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.890> very<00:02:41.099> buzzy<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:41.760> it

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
this headset it's very buzzy and it

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.850 
this headset it's very buzzy and it
picks<00:02:42.090> up<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.390> high<00:02:42.569> frequencies<00:02:43.290> too<00:02:43.590> much

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
picks up the high frequencies too much

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.550 
picks up the high frequencies too much
so<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> over<00:02:44.730> drives<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.330> sounds<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.349> s

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
so it over drives on sounds like the s

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.920 
so it over drives on sounds like the s
and<00:02:46.920> things<00:02:47.519> like<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.790> well<00:02:48.510> i'm<00:02:48.569> going<00:02:48.840> to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and things like that well i'm going to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.479 
and things like that well i'm going to
show<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.200> i'm<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:49.860> compare<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.250> with

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
show you i'm going to compare that with

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.580 
show you i'm going to compare that with
the<00:02:50.819> sound<00:02:51.180> quality<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.810> microphone<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.530> I

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the sound quality of a microphone that I

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.280 
the sound quality of a microphone that I
made<00:02:53.010> what<00:02:53.879> we<00:02:54.030> have<00:02:54.239> here<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.780> microphone

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
made what we have here is the microphone

made what we have here is the microphone
that<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.500> made<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.370> connected<00:02:56.670> up<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.330> my

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that I made and it is connected up to my

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.140 
that I made and it is connected up to my
tape<00:02:57.750> recorder<00:02:57.900> by<00:02:58.440> this<00:03:00.500> by<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.530> rather

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
messy looking circuit here but it does

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.460 
messy looking circuit here but it does
work<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.549> was<00:03:05.730> also<00:03:05.910> using<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.810> connect<00:03:07.290> up

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470

there is no buzzing and no over driving

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.100 
there is no buzzing and no over driving
on<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.060> high<00:03:30.209> frequencies<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:33.480> microphone

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
on the high frequencies this microphone

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.259 
on the high frequencies this microphone
sounds<00:03:34.650> exactly<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.190> way<00:03:35.489> our<00:03:35.670> microphones

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
sounds exactly the way our microphones

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.199 
sounds exactly the way our microphones
should<00:03:36.690> sound<00:03:37.430> now<00:03:38.430> we're<00:03:38.639> going<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.940> take<00:03:39.150> a

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
should sound now we're going to take a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.180 
should sound now we're going to take a
look<00:03:39.480> inside<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.019> headset<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.620> see<00:03:40.859> exactly

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
look inside the headset to see exactly

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.500 
look inside the headset to see exactly
why<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.389> sounds<00:03:43.230> as<00:03:43.380> bad<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.100> does<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.579> we're

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
why it sounds as bad as it does so we're

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.930 
why it sounds as bad as it does so we're
going<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.750> start<00:03:46.049> by<00:03:46.200> opening<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.160> inline

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
going to start by opening up the inline

00:03:47.940 --> 00:04:07.540 
going to start by opening up the inline
volume<00:03:48.239> control

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.740 

so<00:04:08.150> now<00:04:08.330> we<00:04:08.390> can<00:04:08.690> have<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> look<00:04:09.170> inside<00:04:13.750> let's

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
so now we can have a look inside let's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.220 
so now we can have a look inside let's
just<00:04:14.990> turn<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.440> spit<00:04:15.740> around<00:04:19.900> okay<00:04:20.900> I've<00:04:21.049> got

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
just turn the spit around okay I've got

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.050 
just turn the spit around okay I've got
the<00:04:21.320> camera<00:04:21.769> as<00:04:21.830> close<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.400> it<00:04:22.430> as<00:04:22.610> i<00:04:22.670> can<00:04:23.060> now

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
the camera as close to it as i can now

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.140 
the camera as close to it as i can now
and<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.210> may<00:04:26.240> be<00:04:26.480> able<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.960> see<00:04:27.880> this<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
and you may be able to see this is the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.230 
and you may be able to see this is the
microphone<00:04:29.570> cable<00:04:29.960> right<00:04:30.170> here<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:32.000> may<00:04:32.030> be

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
microphone cable right here you may be

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.090 
microphone cable right here you may be
able<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.630> see<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:33.020> there<00:04:33.200> is<00:04:33.230> absolutely<00:04:33.800> no

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
able to see that there is absolutely no

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.940 
able to see that there is absolutely no
screening<00:04:34.580> on<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:35.090> wire<00:04:35.360> tool<00:04:35.920> they've<00:04:36.920> just

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
screening on that wire tool they've just

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.970 
screening on that wire tool they've just
use<00:04:37.280> ordinary<00:04:37.580> headphone<00:04:38.480> wire<00:04:38.770> does<00:04:39.770> not

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
use ordinary headphone wire does not

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.850 
use ordinary headphone wire does not
have<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.400> screening<00:04:40.880> on<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:42.440> that's<00:04:42.620> why

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
have the screening on it and that's why

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.100 
have the screening on it and that's why
it<00:04:42.920> sounds<00:04:43.370> so<00:04:43.610> bad<00:04:43.850> that's<00:04:44.150> why<00:04:44.390> there<00:04:44.600> is<00:04:44.690> so

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
it sounds so bad that's why there is so

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.830 
it sounds so bad that's why there is so
much<00:04:45.320> hum<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:46.010> that<00:04:46.190> sound<00:04:46.550> now<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.360> would

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
much hum in that sound now I would

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.380 
much hum in that sound now I would
replace<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:48.410> cable<00:04:48.650> but<00:04:49.220> unfortunately<00:04:50.180> my

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
replace the cable but unfortunately my

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.830 
replace the cable but unfortunately my

this is the element that i took out of
it<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.690> if<00:05:05.810> you<00:05:05.960> want<00:05:06.140> to<00:05:06.260> know<00:05:06.410> what's<00:05:06.650> inside

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
it so if you want to know what's inside

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.900 
it so if you want to know what's inside
a<00:05:07.130> soldering<00:05:07.700> iron<00:05:07.880> well<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:10.730> what

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
a soldering iron well this is what

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.390 
a soldering iron well this is what
you'll<00:05:11.090> find<00:05:11.530> I'm<00:05:12.530> testing<00:05:13.010> it<00:05:13.100> with<00:05:13.160> the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
you'll find I'm testing it with the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.500 
you'll find I'm testing it with the
meter<00:05:13.610> here<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:16.400> see<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:16.880> this<00:05:17.030> wire<00:05:17.480> here

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
meter here and see that this wire here

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.790 
meter here and see that this wire here
is<00:05:18.110> good<00:05:19.300> as<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.480> see<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.810> whiskey<00:05:21.290> as<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:21.680> can

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
is good as I see the whiskey as you can

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.430 
is good as I see the whiskey as you can
see<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.190> resistance<00:05:22.720> goes<00:05:23.720> up<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:24.169> further

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
see the resistance goes up the further

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.340 
see the resistance goes up the further
along<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:25.010> elements<00:05:25.430> I<00:05:25.550> move<00:05:26.200> which<00:05:27.200> is

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
along the elements I move which is

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.580 
along the elements I move which is
simply<00:05:27.560> made<00:05:27.860> out<00:05:28.010> of<00:05:28.190> resistance<00:05:28.669> wire<00:05:32.590> with

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
simply made out of resistance wire with

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:43.770 
simply made out of resistance wire with
the<00:05:33.620> other<00:05:34.070> wire

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.080 

there's<00:05:44.780> no<00:05:45.139> connection<00:05:45.590> at<00:05:46.009> all<00:05:46.099> sir

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
there's no connection at all sir

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.679 
there's no connection at all sir
somewhere<00:05:51.849> there's<00:05:52.849> not<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.180> meter<00:05:53.389> that's

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
somewhere there's not the meter that's

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.010 
somewhere there's not the meter that's
going<00:05:53.900> on<00:05:54.020> more<00:05:54.379> the<00:05:54.560> wire<00:05:54.740> because<00:05:55.159> that<00:05:55.370> is

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
going on more the wire because that is

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.570 
going on more the wire because that is
conducting<00:05:57.020> as<00:05:57.169> you<00:05:57.289> can<00:05:57.439> see<00:05:57.680> but<00:05:57.889> somewhere

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
conducting as you can see but somewhere

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.360 
conducting as you can see but somewhere
inside<00:05:59.409> this<00:06:00.409> there<00:06:02.379> let's<00:06:03.379> go<00:06:03.590> on<00:06:03.650> open<00:06:04.069> and

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
inside this there let's go on open and

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.860 
inside this there let's go on open and
it's<00:06:04.580> just<00:06:05.259> not<00:06:06.259> possible<00:06:06.500> to<00:06:06.800> fix<00:06:07.659> next<00:06:08.659> time

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
it's just not possible to fix next time

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.570 
it's just not possible to fix next time

it's it oxidized like mad my other

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.360 
it's it oxidized like mad my other
soldering<00:06:23.569> irons<00:06:23.870> 10<00:06:24.110> done<00:06:24.319> did<00:06:24.620> not<00:06:24.860> do<00:06:25.129> this

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
soldering irons 10 done did not do this

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.170 
soldering irons 10 done did not do this
now<00:06:28.150> why<00:06:29.150> that<00:06:29.360> has<00:06:29.539> them<00:06:30.580> gone<00:06:31.580> as<00:06:31.729> bad<00:06:31.969> as<00:06:32.150> a

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
now why that has them gone as bad as a

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.469 
now why that has them gone as bad as a
house<00:06:32.509> but<00:06:32.750> anyway<00:06:33.969> that's<00:06:34.969> just<00:06:35.060> about<00:06:35.419> the

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
house but anyway that's just about the

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.849 
house but anyway that's just about the
end<00:06:35.719> now<00:06:35.900> so<00:06:36.229> until<00:06:36.620> next<00:06:36.650> time<00:06:37.039> goodbye
