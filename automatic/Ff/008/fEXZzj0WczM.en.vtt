alright guys and here's our finished

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.810 
alright guys and here's our finished
plastic<00:00:31.910> screen<00:00:32.620> it's<00:00:33.620> made<00:00:33.890> out<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.160> three

the edge pieces which you saw me put

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.610 
the edge pieces which you saw me put
together<00:00:42.519> the<00:00:43.519> second<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:43.940> which<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.449> the<00:00:45.379> mesh

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
together the second of which is the mesh

just you know your bag a zip ties so

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.219 
just you know your bag a zip ties so
with<00:01:31.429> that<00:01:31.580> let's<00:01:32.000> take<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.270> look<00:01:32.569> at<00:01:32.810> this

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
with that let's take a look at this

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.460 
with that let's take a look at this

tube here coming from the pump is going

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.309 
tube here coming from the pump is going
to<00:02:00.500> be<00:02:00.619> positioned<00:02:01.429> on<00:02:01.610> top<00:02:01.640> of<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:03.140> that

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
to be positioned on top of this so that

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.290 
to be positioned on top of this so that
all<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.679> water<00:02:03.950> kind<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.399> goes<00:02:04.640> through<00:02:05.119> this

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
all the water kind of goes through this

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.650 
all the water kind of goes through this
chamber<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.140> our<00:02:07.099> screen<00:02:07.729> here<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.390> acting

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
chamber and our screen here is acting

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.619 
chamber and our screen here is acting
kind<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.349> as<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> divider<00:02:10.180> what<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.270> going<00:02:11.510> to

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
kind of as a divider what I'm going to

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.600 
kind of as a divider what I'm going to
do<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.930> pack<00:02:12.230> all<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.680> my<00:02:12.770> filter<00:02:13.160> media<00:02:13.430> on

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
do is pack all of my filter media on

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.699 
do is pack all of my filter media on
this<00:02:13.760> side<00:02:14.030> get<00:02:14.270> my<00:02:14.450> water<00:02:14.720> flowing<00:02:15.319> on<00:02:15.500> this

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
this side get my water flowing on this

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.369 
this side get my water flowing on this
side<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.160> then<00:02:16.700> what<00:02:17.000> has<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.450> happen<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
side and then what has to happen is the

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.860 
side and then what has to happen is the
water<00:02:18.590> has<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.890> travel<00:02:19.340> down<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.690> can

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
water has to travel down and then it can

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.740 
water has to travel down and then it can
travel<00:02:21.080> through<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> screen<00:02:22.040> into<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.120> open

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
travel through the screen into this open

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.790 
travel through the screen into this open
section<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:25.280> then<00:02:25.550> up

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
section and then up

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.360 
section and then up
then<00:02:26.890> overflow<00:02:27.900> into<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.380> turtle<00:02:29.710> tank<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
then overflow into the turtle tank and

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.730 
then overflow into the turtle tank and
the<00:02:31.360> reason<00:02:31.720> why<00:02:31.840> that's<00:02:32.050> important<00:02:32.650> is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
the reason why that's important is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.520 
the reason why that's important is
because<00:02:33.130> we<00:02:33.280> don't<00:02:33.400> want<00:02:33.610> any<00:02:33.790> bio<00:02:34.000> media<00:02:34.530> to

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
because we don't want any bio media to

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.820 
because we don't want any bio media to
get<00:02:35.650> clogged<00:02:36.100> up<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:37.090> -<00:02:37.810> otherwise<00:02:38.500> we're

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
get clogged up in this - otherwise we're

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.500 
get clogged up in this - otherwise we're
gonna<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:39.010> 300<00:02:39.520> gallons<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.910> water<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
gonna have 300 gallons of water on the

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.140 
gonna have 300 gallons of water on the
floor<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:41.950> screen<00:02:42.340> acts<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.880> nice

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
floor so this screen acts as a nice

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.650 
floor so this screen acts as a nice
little<00:02:43.390> divider<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:45.400> fit<00:02:45.910> inside<00:02:46.210> this

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
little divider to fit inside this

little divider to fit inside this
55-gallon<00:02:48.180> drum<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.480> you'll<00:02:50.080> notice<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.650> cut

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
55-gallon drum and you'll notice I cut

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.380 
55-gallon drum and you'll notice I cut
it<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:52.150> size<00:02:52.480> here<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.980> hits<00:02:54.550> both<00:02:54.910> edges

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
it to size here so it hits both edges

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.350 
it to size here so it hits both edges
here<00:02:55.980> goes<00:02:56.980> all<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.250> way<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.940> then<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.240> goes

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
here goes all the way and then it goes

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.480 
here goes all the way and then it goes
all<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.600> way<00:02:58.690> from<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.020> top<00:02:59.290> all<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.220> way

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
all the way from the top all the way

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.850 
all the way from the top all the way
down<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.000> bottom<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.630> there's<00:03:02.530> actually

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
down to the bottom and there's actually

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.640 
down to the bottom and there's actually
a<00:03:02.890> little<00:03:03.220> difficult<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.820> get<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.560> but<00:03:05.560> that's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
a little difficult to get in but that's

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.320 
a little difficult to get in but that's
a<00:03:05.830> good<00:03:06.070> thing<00:03:06.280> because<00:03:06.490> it<00:03:06.820> means<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.240> will

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
a good thing because it means it will

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.230 
a good thing because it means it will
stay<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:08.020> place<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.250> anyways<00:03:09.550> guys<00:03:09.580> if<00:03:10.120> you

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
stay in place so anyways guys if you

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.660 
stay in place so anyways guys if you
need<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:11.140> use<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.320> screen<00:03:11.830> in<00:03:12.220> one<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.580> your

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
need to use a screen in one of your

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.630 
need to use a screen in one of your
filters<00:03:13.180> one<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:13.990> your<00:03:14.110> stumps<00:03:14.640> consider

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
filters one of your stumps consider

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.190 
filters one of your stumps consider
using<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.360> plastic<00:03:16.840> lattice<00:03:17.230> as<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.980> frame<00:03:18.400> and

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
using the plastic lattice as a frame and

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.460 
using the plastic lattice as a frame and
then<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.860> hardware<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> mesh<00:03:21.550> as<00:03:22.300> as<00:03:22.840> your<00:03:23.260> mesh

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
then the hardware a mesh as as your mesh

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.370 
then the hardware a mesh as as your mesh
itself<00:03:24.120> anyways<00:03:25.120> hope<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.510> enjoyed<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.260> I'll
