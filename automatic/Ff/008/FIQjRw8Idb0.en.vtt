them floating how you don't I'll slowly
see<00:01:29.060> how<00:01:29.270> that's<00:01:29.960> gonna<00:01:30.080> work<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.650> their

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
see how that's gonna work in their

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.679 
see how that's gonna work in their
zombie<00:01:31.460> how<00:01:31.700> they're<00:01:31.880> running<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:32.540> at<00:01:32.630> the

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
zombie how they're running and at the

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.359 
zombie how they're running and at the
design<00:01:33.049> be<00:01:33.260> just<00:01:33.530> floating<00:01:33.890> around<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.189> face

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
design be just floating around your face

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.010 
design be just floating around your face
and<00:01:34.670> then<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:35.180> gun<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.450> think<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:35.869> the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
and then this gun I think this is the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.109 
and then this gun I think this is the
wave<00:01:36.260> gun<00:01:36.500> combine<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.340> know<00:01:37.490> with<00:01:37.670> both<00:01:38.090> of

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
wave gun combine you know with both of

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.789 
wave gun combine you know with both of
them<00:01:38.390> stuck<00:01:38.780> together<00:01:38.960> basically<00:01:39.350> that's<00:01:39.710> why

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
them stuck together basically that's why

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.219 
them stuck together basically that's why
it<00:01:39.890> looks<00:01:40.040> different<00:01:40.510> but<00:01:41.510> yeah<00:01:41.720> basically<00:01:41.930> I

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
it looks different but yeah basically I

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.570 
it looks different but yeah basically I
just<00:01:42.530> kept<00:01:42.740> everything<00:01:42.920> else<00:01:43.159> went<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
just kept everything else went to the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.010 
just kept everything else went to the
moon<00:01:43.759> stuff<00:01:44.030> that's<00:01:44.360> why<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.509> made<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:44.810> little

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
moon stuff that's why I made this little

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.660 
moon stuff that's why I made this little
