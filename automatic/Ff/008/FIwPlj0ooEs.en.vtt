00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
so I got this countertop clamp base here

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.010 
so I got this countertop clamp base here
and<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:33.340> can<00:00:33.460> see<00:00:33.670> that<00:00:33.790> countertop<00:00:34.180> comes<00:00:34.870> in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020

here<00:00:35.199> like<00:00:35.350> that<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:35.829> then<00:00:36.250> you<00:00:36.399> adjust<00:00:36.520> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
here like that and then you adjust the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.759

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
little pegs are here with the the

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.319 
little pegs are here with the the
turning<00:00:41.769> screw<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.730> make<00:00:42.879> it<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.059> little<00:00:43.180> bit

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
turning screw to make it a little bit

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.000 
turning screw to make it a little bit
tighter<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.930> secure<00:00:44.290> up<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.739> pepper

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
tighter and to secure up to the pepper

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.130 
tighter and to secure up to the pepper
to<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.309> countertop

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
but you can see that the grain mill just

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.440 
but you can see that the grain mill just
kind<00:00:49.450> of<00:00:49.480> slides<00:00:49.780> nicely<00:00:50.050> over<00:00:50.649> these<00:00:51.450> are

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
kind of slides nicely over these are

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
you can tighten up so I'm going to do

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.500 
you can tighten up so I'm going to do
this<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.440> each<00:01:08.590> one

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.249

so with this secured on here in place

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.749 
so with this secured on here in place
the<00:01:16.750> next<00:01:17.049> step<00:01:17.229> is<00:01:17.469> to<00:01:17.740> actually<00:01:18.189> mount<00:01:18.490> the

the next step is to actually mount the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.039 
the next step is to actually mount the
wheel<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:21.009> we<00:01:21.130> go<00:01:21.250> um<00:01:22.119> put<00:01:22.659> this<00:01:22.780> big

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
wheel there we go um put this big

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.380 
wheel there we go um put this big
cast-iron<00:01:23.590> crank<00:01:24.130> weõll<00:01:24.460> on<00:01:24.640> here<00:01:24.909> this<00:01:25.329> is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
cast-iron crank weõll on here this is

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.240 
cast-iron crank weõll on here this is
where<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.020> action<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.439> going<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.619> happen<00:01:27.009> with

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
where the action is going to happen with

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.850 
where the action is going to happen with
the<00:01:27.610> grinding<00:01:28.060> um<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:29.079> this<00:01:29.259> guy<00:01:29.469> is<00:01:29.530> made<00:01:29.740> out

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.609 
the grinding um and this guy is made out
of<00:01:29.979> cast<00:01:30.130> iron<00:01:30.310> like<00:01:30.579> I<00:01:30.670> said<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:32.200> comes<00:01:32.380> with<00:01:32.560> a

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
turn the actual the bearings to grind

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.490 
turn the actual the bearings to grind
the<00:01:48.459> grain<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.539> do<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:49.959> to<00:01:50.080> have<00:01:50.110> this

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
the grain so you do have to have this

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.440 
the grain so you do have to have this
little<00:01:50.799> guy<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.039> here<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:52.149> I'll<00:01:52.240> show<00:01:52.270> you

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
little guy in here and I'll show you

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.719 
little guy in here and I'll show you
what<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:52.659> looks<00:01:52.959> like<00:01:56.280> okay<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.429> now<00:01:57.670> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
what that looks like okay so now the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.580 
what that looks like okay so now the
little<00:01:58.060> square<00:01:58.299> guys<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:58.720> so<00:01:59.140> now<00:01:59.289> when<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.500> turn

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
little square guys in so now when I turn

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.589 
little square guys in so now when I turn
the<00:01:59.829> wheel<00:01:59.860> see<00:02:00.700> how<00:02:00.819> the<00:02:00.880> bearing<00:02:01.239> actually

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:01.599 
the wheel see how the bearing actually

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:04.649 
the wheel see how the bearing actually
moves<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:03.250> that's<00:02:03.700> how<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.000> grunt<00:02:04.420> that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
moves that's that's how the grunt that

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.169 
moves that's that's how the grunt that
grain<00:02:04.929> gets<00:02:05.079> grinded<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:06.789> you<00:02:06.880> got<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.090> have

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
grain gets grinded so you got to have

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.520 
grain gets grinded so you got to have
that<00:02:07.270> little<00:02:07.329> guy<00:02:07.599> in<00:02:07.720> there<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.110> then

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
that little guy in there and then

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.009 
that little guy in there and then
depending<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.610> your<00:02:09.700> setup<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.239> opted<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.810> go

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
depending on your setup I opted to go

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.180 
depending on your setup I opted to go
with<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.079> higher<00:02:14.260> leverage<00:02:14.709> handle

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
with the like the higher leverage handle

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.430 
with the like the higher leverage handle
this<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.880> small<00:02:16.510> upgrade<00:02:16.989> actually

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
this is this is a small upgrade actually

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.710 
this is this is a small upgrade actually
if<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.160> don't<00:02:18.370> have<00:02:18.549> this<00:02:18.730> though<00:02:19.000> you'll

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
if you don't have this though you'll

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.240 
if you don't have this though you'll
just<00:02:20.019> have<00:02:20.139> this<00:02:20.290> handle<00:02:20.620> assembly<00:02:20.829> and<00:02:21.220> you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
just have this handle assembly and you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.340 
just have this handle assembly and you
can<00:02:21.819> secure<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.329> this<00:02:22.480> hole<00:02:22.690> right<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:22.930> so

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
can secure it to this hole right here so

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.640 
can secure it to this hole right here so
once<00:02:24.069> again<00:02:24.190> another<00:02:24.549> washer<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.560> a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
once again another washer in just a

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.879 
once again another washer in just a
small<00:02:26.799> bolt<00:02:27.220> right<00:02:27.400> here<00:02:28.290> okay<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.769> can

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
small bolt right here okay and you can

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.770 
small bolt right here okay and you can
kind<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.069> see<00:02:30.250> how<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.459> snugs<00:02:31.359> up<00:02:31.569> there

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
kind of see how that snugs up there

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.949 
kind of see how that snugs up there
against<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.700> cast<00:02:33.700> iron<00:02:33.910> flywheel<00:02:34.359> for<00:02:34.630> added

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
against the cast iron flywheel for added

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.979 
against the cast iron flywheel for added
leverage<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.190> now<00:02:36.430> really<00:02:36.670> guys<00:02:36.970> with<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.840> in

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
down here and then just start grinding

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.809 
down here and then just start grinding
turning<00:02:58.560> away

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.390 

alright<00:03:05.689> guys<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.500> ground<00:03:06.829> for<00:03:07.010> about<00:03:07.159> two

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
alright guys so I ground for about two

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.490 
alright guys so I ground for about two
minutes<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.969> I<00:03:08.030> got<00:03:08.180> about<00:03:08.269> that<00:03:08.659> much<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:09.469> a

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
minutes and I got about that much not a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.479 
minutes and I got about that much not a
ton<00:03:09.909> not<00:03:10.909> a<00:03:10.939> ton<00:03:11.650> definitely<00:03:12.650> take<00:03:12.829> some<00:03:12.859> work

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
ton not a ton definitely take some work

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.360 
ton not a ton definitely take some work
to<00:03:13.640> hand<00:03:14.030> grind<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.510> which<00:03:15.500> kind<00:03:15.709> of<00:03:15.829> is<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.099> good

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
to hand grind it which kind of is a good

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.550 
to hand grind it which kind of is a good
time<00:03:16.579> for<00:03:16.849> me<00:03:16.909> to<00:03:17.000> probably<00:03:17.180> talk<00:03:17.450> about<00:03:17.530> why<00:03:18.530> I

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
time for me to probably talk about why I

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.979 
time for me to probably talk about why I
have<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.890> hand<00:03:19.219> grinder<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:20.480> fact<00:03:20.719> that<00:03:20.900> this

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
have a hand grinder the fact that this

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.640 
have a hand grinder the fact that this
guy<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.470> be<00:03:22.569> used<00:03:23.569> without<00:03:23.750> electricity<00:03:24.290> in

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
guy can be used without electricity in

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.610 
guy can be used without electricity in
my<00:03:24.680> opinion<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.370> awesome<00:03:25.879> I<00:03:26.030> love<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:27.049> I<00:03:27.260> want

my opinion is awesome I love that I want
something<00:03:27.890> that<00:03:28.450> doesn't<00:03:29.450> have<00:03:29.689> to<00:03:29.900> be

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
something that doesn't have to be

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.839 
something that doesn't have to be
totally<00:03:30.739> dependent<00:03:31.310> upon<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.609> grid

configured<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.859> come<00:03:45.859> around<00:03:46.269> like<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.510> then

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
configured to come around like and then

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.619 
configured to come around like and then
over<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> motor<00:03:49.189> so<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.909> works<00:03:50.120> like<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.359> in<00:03:50.569> a

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
over to a motor so it works like a in a

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.879 
over to a motor so it works like a in a
pulley<00:03:50.870> system<00:03:50.959> where<00:03:51.409> you<00:03:51.470> have<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> motor

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
pulley system where you have a motor

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.729 
pulley system where you have a motor
powers<00:03:52.879> the<00:03:53.090> belt<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.510> actually<00:03:54.230> turns<00:03:54.530> the

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
powers the belt and actually turns the

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.069 
powers the belt and actually turns the
wheel<00:03:54.889> for<00:03:55.159> you<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:55.669> it<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.510> nice<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.019> other

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
wheel for you so it is nice the other

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.050 
wheel for you so it is nice the other
capability<00:03:57.769> but<00:03:58.069> as<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.340> mentioned<00:03:58.579> you're<00:03:58.909> not

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
capability but as I mentioned you're not

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.059 
capability but as I mentioned you're not
tied<00:03:59.329> to<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.629> you<00:03:59.900> can<00:04:00.200> do<00:04:00.349> it<00:04:00.379> by<00:04:00.530> hand<00:04:00.709> if<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
tied to it you can do it by hand if you

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.200 
tied to it you can do it by hand if you
need<00:04:01.189> to<00:04:01.400> if<00:04:02.269> you<00:04:02.389> need<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.569> punch<00:04:02.810> your<00:04:02.989> kids

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.650 

this<00:04:09.210> is<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> good<00:04:09.540> way

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
this is a good way

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.330 
this is a good way
the<00:04:12.470> other<00:04:12.590> thing<00:04:12.740> that's<00:04:12.830> really<00:04:12.950> cool<00:04:13.130> that

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
the other thing that's really cool that

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.590 
the other thing that's really cool that
probably<00:04:13.760> some<00:04:13.880> of<00:04:13.970> you<00:04:14.000> guys<00:04:14.120> have<00:04:14.240> seen<00:04:14.390> is

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
probably some of you guys have seen is

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.970 
probably some of you guys have seen is
they<00:04:14.750> actually<00:04:15.080> use<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.260> same<00:04:15.650> polling

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
they actually use that same polling

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.600 
they actually use that same polling
system<00:04:16.130> with<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.580> belt<00:04:17.050> to<00:04:18.050> hook<00:04:18.590> up<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.770> extra

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
system with the belt to hook up to extra

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.940 
system with the belt to hook up to extra
cycles<00:04:19.970> as<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.420> pedal<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.200> watch<00:04:21.380> TV<00:04:21.620> or

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
cycles as you pedal and you watch TV or

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.530 
cycles as you pedal and you watch TV or
you<00:04:22.070> read<00:04:22.250> your<00:04:22.370> book<00:04:22.550> or<00:04:22.760> whatever<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.330> do

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
you read your book or whatever you do

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.810 
you read your book or whatever you do
while<00:04:23.750> you<00:04:23.900> exercise<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:25.370> actually<00:04:25.520> be

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
while you exercise you can actually be

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.090 
while you exercise you can actually be
grinding<00:04:26.240> grain

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.340 

let's<00:04:29.310> take<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.490> look<00:04:29.700> now<00:04:29.730> at<00:04:30.180> what<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.930> do<00:04:31.080> if

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
let's take a look now at what to do if

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.170 
let's take a look now at what to do if
you<00:04:31.560> do<00:04:31.740> want<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:31.980> go<00:04:32.100> ahead<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.490> switch<00:04:32.760> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
you do want to go ahead and switch the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.720 
you do want to go ahead and switch the
setting<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.590> have<00:04:34.800> my<00:04:34.890> flywheel<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.430> this

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
setting so I have my flywheel on this

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.790 
setting so I have my flywheel on this
side<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.900> guys<00:04:37.020> that's<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.470> side<00:04:37.650> that's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
side you guys that's the side that's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.410 
side you guys that's the side that's
been<00:04:37.890> facing<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.400> camera<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.940> then<00:04:39.120> if<00:04:39.300> we

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
been facing the camera and then if we

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.730 
been facing the camera and then if we
flip<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.690> around<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.080> can<00:04:40.230> see<00:04:40.410> that<00:04:40.440> on<00:04:40.620> the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
flip it around you can see that on the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.580 
flip it around you can see that on the
back<00:04:40.920> here<00:04:41.340> we<00:04:41.520> have<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.390> little<00:04:42.960> knob<00:04:43.230> on

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
back here we have this little knob on

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.680 
back here we have this little knob on
this<00:04:44.100> side<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.340> says<00:04:44.520> fine<00:04:44.880> with<00:04:45.360> an<00:04:45.510> arrow

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
this side it says fine with an arrow

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.780 
this side it says fine with an arrow
going<00:04:45.780> down<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.400> side<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.670> says

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
going down and on this side it says

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.420 
going down and on this side it says
coarse<00:04:48.240> going<00:04:48.720> this<00:04:48.900> way<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.290> I<00:04:50.010> want<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.310> go

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
coarse going this way so I want to go

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.860 
coarse going this way so I want to go
ahead<00:04:50.550> now<00:04:50.700> I've<00:04:51.000> got<00:04:51.180> some<00:04:51.360> pretty<00:04:51.540> fine

coarser<00:05:23.540> looks<00:05:24.540> like<00:05:24.720> you<00:05:24.810> could<00:05:24.960> use<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.320> for

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
coarser looks like you could use it for

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.590 
coarser looks like you could use it for
hot<00:05:25.800> cereal<00:05:26.190> or<00:05:26.280> something<00:05:26.610> as<00:05:26.760> compared<00:05:27.510> to

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
hot cereal or something as compared to

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.050 
hot cereal or something as compared to
this<00:05:27.720> guy<00:05:27.810> flour

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.270

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
there's two there's two bearings in the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.700 
there's two there's two bearings in the
country<00:05:34.580> living<00:05:34.730> grain<00:05:34.940> mill<00:05:35.120> one<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.560> is

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
country living grain mill one that is

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.000 
country living grain mill one that is
about<00:05:37.510> one<00:05:38.510> it's<00:05:38.660> about<00:05:38.750> there<00:05:39.170> and<00:05:39.440> another

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
about one it's about there and another

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.680 
about one it's about there and another
one<00:05:40.190> over<00:05:40.280> here<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:40.790> both<00:05:41.000> those<00:05:41.240> bearings

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
one over here so both those bearings

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.370 
one over here so both those bearings
work<00:05:42.290> in<00:05:42.470> concert<00:05:42.920> to<00:05:43.520> turn<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:44.930> grinding

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
work in concert to turn the grinding

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.800 
work in concert to turn the grinding
mechanism<00:05:45.800> as<00:05:45.980> you<00:05:46.160> crank<00:05:46.430> this<00:05:46.610> wheel<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.660> the

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
mechanism as you crank this wheel so the

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.450 
mechanism as you crank this wheel so the
importance<00:05:48.170> of<00:05:48.290> that<00:05:48.410> guys<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.890> that<00:05:49.160> when<00:05:49.340> you

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
importance of that guys is that when you

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.040 
importance of that guys is that when you
crank<00:05:49.850> this<00:05:50.030> guy<00:05:50.240> you're<00:05:50.810> going<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:50.990> be

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
crank this guy you're going to be

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.560 
crank this guy you're going to be
putting<00:05:51.260> a<00:05:51.320> lot<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.680> force<00:05:52.010> on<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:53.090> mechanism

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
putting a lot of force on the mechanism

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.810 
putting a lot of force on the mechanism
in<00:05:53.720> here<00:05:54.050> there's<00:05:54.860> wheat<00:05:55.160> sitting<00:05:55.490> on<00:05:55.580> top<00:05:55.760> of

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
in here there's wheat sitting on top of

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.360 
in here there's wheat sitting on top of
it<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.300> if<00:05:57.200> you<00:05:57.320> don't<00:05:57.500> have<00:05:57.680> super<00:05:58.100> super

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
it and if you don't have super super

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.580 
it and if you don't have super super
strong<00:05:58.640> parts<00:05:59.060> then<00:05:59.840> it's<00:06:00.020> very<00:06:00.230> easy<00:06:00.470> for

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
strong parts then it's very easy for

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.060 
strong parts then it's very easy for
this<00:06:01.010> to<00:06:01.220> give<00:06:01.480> and<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:03.620> know<00:06:03.740> your<00:06:03.890> grain

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
this to give and you know your grain

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.770 
this to give and you know your grain
mill<00:06:04.280> is<00:06:04.370> essentially<00:06:04.760> out<00:06:04.880> with<00:06:05.510> a<00:06:05.540> country

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
mill is essentially out with a country

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.990 
mill is essentially out with a country
living<00:06:06.080> grain<00:06:06.350> mill<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:07.160> have<00:06:07.280> two<00:06:07.640> bearings

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
living grain mill you have two bearings

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.240 
living grain mill you have two bearings
instead<00:06:08.330> of<00:06:08.420> one<00:06:08.630> a<00:06:08.810> lot<00:06:09.290> a<00:06:09.320> lot<00:06:09.560> of<00:06:09.620> systems

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
instead of one a lot a lot of systems

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.860 
instead of one a lot a lot of systems
only<00:06:10.460> have<00:06:10.640> one<00:06:10.910> so<00:06:11.120> you're<00:06:11.240> getting<00:06:11.420> two<00:06:11.630> here

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
only have one so you're getting two here

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.810 
only have one so you're getting two here
and<00:06:12.080> instead<00:06:12.830> of<00:06:12.920> like<00:06:13.070> a<00:06:13.100> brass<00:06:13.430> bushing

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
and instead of like a brass bushing

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.250 
and instead of like a brass bushing
which<00:06:14.330> you'll<00:06:14.450> find<00:06:14.480> in<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.810> lot<00:06:14.900> of<00:06:14.930> systems

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
which you'll find in a lot of systems

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.090 
which you'll find in a lot of systems
these<00:06:15.500> are<00:06:15.560> both<00:06:16.520> stainless<00:06:17.330> steel<00:06:18.100> super

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
these are both stainless steel super

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.030 
these are both stainless steel super
hardcore<00:06:19.400> industrial<00:06:20.360> grade<00:06:20.600> bearings<00:06:21.320> so

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
hardcore industrial grade bearings so

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.110 
hardcore industrial grade bearings so
they're<00:06:22.190> not<00:06:22.340> going<00:06:22.520> to<00:06:22.580> go<00:06:22.730> out<00:06:22.760> on<00:06:22.970> you

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
they're not going to go out on you

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.210 
they're not going to go out on you
everything<00:06:24.080> is<00:06:24.230> warranteed<00:06:24.650> in<00:06:24.830> case<00:06:24.980> you<00:06:25.100> do

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
everything is warranteed in case you do

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.679 
everything is warranteed in case you do
need<00:06:25.400> it<00:06:25.550> but<00:06:25.700> you<00:06:26.150> want

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.509 

way<00:06:29.749> back<00:06:29.899> to<00:06:30.019> like<00:06:30.139> the<00:06:30.259> caveman<00:06:30.649> days<00:06:30.889> there

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:31.519 
way back to like the caveman days there

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:34.600 
way back to like the caveman days there
was<00:06:31.729> stone<00:06:32.419> grinders<00:06:32.839> and<00:06:33.469> the<00:06:34.219> people<00:06:34.489> that

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
was stone grinders and the people that

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.449 
was stone grinders and the people that
ground<00:06:34.879> their<00:06:35.149> grain<00:06:35.449> with<00:06:35.689> those<00:06:35.899> things

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:36.459 
ground their grain with those things

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.559 
ground their grain with those things
ended<00:06:37.459> up<00:06:37.580> like<00:06:37.759> losing<00:06:38.119> all<00:06:38.209> their<00:06:38.299> teeth

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
ended up like losing all their teeth

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:39.999 
ended up like losing all their teeth
because<00:06:38.929> they're<00:06:39.139> grinding<00:06:39.409> little<00:06:39.829> pieces

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
because they're grinding little pieces

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.209 
because they're grinding little pieces
of<00:06:40.249> grit<00:06:40.519> stone<00:06:40.819> grit<00:06:41.299> up<00:06:41.539> in<00:06:41.719> the<00:06:41.959> flour<00:06:42.219> that

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
of grit stone grit up in the flour that

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:46.029 
of grit stone grit up in the flour that
they<00:06:43.369> were<00:06:43.429> making<00:06:43.639> so<00:06:44.559> fast-forward<00:06:45.559> to

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 
they were making so fast-forward to

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.489 
they were making so fast-forward to
modern<00:06:46.699> day<00:06:46.849> grinders<00:06:47.299> and<00:06:47.569> there<00:06:47.989> there<00:06:48.379> were

00:06:48.489 --> 00:06:48.499 
modern day grinders and there there were

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:50.829 
modern day grinders and there there were
still<00:06:48.769> worse<00:06:48.949> stones<00:06:49.279> used<00:06:49.610> but<00:06:50.389> they<00:06:50.779> were

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:50.839 
still worse stones used but they were

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:53.259 
still worse stones used but they were
more<00:06:51.169> of<00:06:51.259> like<00:06:51.379> an<00:06:51.499> aluminum<00:06:51.769> coated<00:06:52.610> thing

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:53.269 
more of like an aluminum coated thing

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:55.809 
more of like an aluminum coated thing
which<00:06:53.449> is<00:06:53.569> equally<00:06:54.349> terrible<00:06:54.679> for<00:06:54.979> you<00:06:55.069> so<00:06:55.279> the

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:55.819 
which is equally terrible for you so the

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.579 
which is equally terrible for you so the
cool<00:06:56.059> thing<00:06:56.209> about<00:06:56.239> Country<00:06:56.689> Living<00:06:56.869> is<00:06:57.259> it's

00:06:57.579 --> 00:06:57.589 
cool thing about Country Living is it's

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:01.209 
cool thing about Country Living is it's
made<00:06:58.309> with<00:06:58.639> with<00:06:59.539> those<00:07:00.049> two<00:07:00.349> really<00:07:00.709> super

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:01.219 
made with with those two really super

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:03.790 
made with with those two really super
super<00:07:01.369> sturdy<00:07:01.759> industrial<00:07:02.449> grade<00:07:02.800> bearings

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
super sturdy industrial grade bearings

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.979 
super sturdy industrial grade bearings
and<00:07:04.699> then<00:07:04.849> the<00:07:04.969> grinding<00:07:05.360> mechanism<00:07:05.779> itself

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:05.989 
and then the grinding mechanism itself

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:09.809 
and then the grinding mechanism itself
is<00:07:06.169> made<00:07:06.379> out<00:07:06.409> of<00:07:06.619> a<00:07:06.709> high<00:07:07.129> carbon<00:07:07.489> steel

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:09.819 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:12.299 

got<00:07:10.240> a<00:07:10.270> little<00:07:10.419> rice<00:07:10.659> action<00:07:11.169> can<00:07:11.770> you<00:07:11.830> do<00:07:11.979> rice

in this thing sure let's do right now
make<00:07:14.830> a<00:07:14.860> little<00:07:15.069> rice<00:07:15.189> flour<00:07:16.289> and<00:07:17.289> here's<00:07:17.589> a

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710 
make a little rice flour and here's a

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.309 
make a little rice flour and here's a
little<00:07:17.949> look<00:07:18.129> at<00:07:18.339> the<00:07:18.610> rice<00:07:19.389> flour<00:07:19.689> grant<00:07:20.199> i

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 
little look at the rice flour grant i

little look at the rice flour grant i
ground<00:07:20.650> this<00:07:20.800> guy<00:07:20.979> up<00:07:21.189> super<00:07:21.819> super<00:07:22.150> fine<00:07:22.389> just

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:23.259 
ground this guy up super super fine just

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.230 
ground this guy up super super fine just
a<00:07:23.319> little<00:07:23.349> bit<00:07:23.620> of<00:07:23.710> hard<00:07:23.889> work<00:07:24.069> but<00:07:24.400> that's<00:07:25.029> how

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
a little bit of hard work but that's how

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.260 
a little bit of hard work but that's how
I<00:07:25.270> wanted<00:07:25.569> it<00:07:25.689> so<00:07:25.960> it's<00:07:26.110> like<00:07:26.199> just<00:07:27.270> powdery

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.270
