00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.580
 all of you 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.580
 we have an aquarium 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.730
 and is a gift from school 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.770
 older children they have bought a 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.590
 part and they gave us the one that had 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.590
 fell he was sung to see that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 aquarium had never seen fish so 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.900
 pretty 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.109
 how are they all called their fish because those 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.900
 12 there are little red fish and whites 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.120
 they are angels fish 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.260
 and what is the name of the long tail and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.019
 Pointy is a shark not a 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.099
 shark would not fit from aquarium as 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.099
 call this radio 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.920
 according to you know what it's called 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.440
 I'm afraid it's not everyone's name 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.470
 tomorrow I will bring a book of fish so that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.510
 we can learn their names look there's a 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.150
 small crab inside that shell 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.670
 we will also learn how to take care 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.800
 the aquarium the most important thing of all for 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.820
 course is to feed the fish 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.820
 everyday 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.120
 and we will take turns feeding them I will 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.290
 put your hand in the magic hat and 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.290
 I will take out today's name 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.730
 here and I do not 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.330
 fed fish you do not have to give them 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.610
 lots of food that will be enough to 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.950
 youtube or very careful not to throw anything 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.620
 of fish food 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.550
 I was very proud to have that task 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.000
 so important, let's see how they come 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.920
 they have to be very hungry now what 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.540
 such if we take brushes and paints and 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.610
 we make some drawings of our new 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.310
 friends the fish 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.340
 that I thought the fish were still with 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.340
 hungry maybe they needed more food 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.790
 and imagined swimming in the aquarium with 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.790
 all the fish 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.120
 backwards 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.230
 It is not like this 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.630
 now 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.310
 giving too much food 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.590
 but some fish are hungry 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.020
 all the greedy red fish 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.529
 eat and eat without paying sometimes die 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.509
 by eating too much there is not a natural 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.090
 I did not want to hurt the fish 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.189
 giving them too much food is like that 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.770
 green things are called algae 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:27.080
 Many algae are also bad for 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.080
 I 'm going to remove the fish 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.650
 the snails eat seaweed 3 of some 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.199
 from home you have snails 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.620
 berry and really like to eat this 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:44.130
 light green thing for them is so 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.160
 delicious as the chocolate you have a 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.100
 aquarium in your house if my dad and I 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.919
 we take care of him is bigger than this and 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.720
 has many more times sometime like this is 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.020
 like you're a bottom diver 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.669
 marine and that you're swimming in your aquarium 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.449
 of course many come from ssp is a queue of 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.580
 sword 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.440
 sometimes I imagine that he grabbed me from his 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.590
 tail and that I go around the whole 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.889
 aquarium I also do it like 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.250
 they call the other 16s of stripes it's called 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.380
 zebrafish the black is a tetra and the one that 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.830
 has a big suitcase up is a pen 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.040
 sailor 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.560
 and that is a hermit crab looking 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.230
 shells and they move inside them like 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.870
 move to a new house as I see that 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.730
 you know a lot of fish could you tell us 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.070
 more about them so that the drawings we 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.800
 come out better as it has a very aquarium 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.260
 very big in your house and it will bring us 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.380
 some snails so they can eat the 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:48.010
 algae oscar handles your support are pretty 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.710
 great for sharks is not not so 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.510
 I'm going to draw a picture of us 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.330
 being dragged by a colares fish 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:58.180
 for him I knew that it was not going to be 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.760
 never lived again because he was doing 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.600
 many friends and how do you say it's called 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.600
 the pd rules
