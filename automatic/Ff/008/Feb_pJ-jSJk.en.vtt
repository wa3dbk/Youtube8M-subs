00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.580
 ren hector as always you already know me the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 I asked you to upload it I have a list 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.839
 I'm following and playing on the tom 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.429
 tomorrow they play darius for his writer 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.650
 what he asked me to give me is tomorrow what will you have 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.760
 so nothing, let's comment a little bit 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.230
 what is right in the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.690
 masters and runes that I recommend 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.730
 I recommend for the rector as you already know 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.530
 you told me many of you have turned me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.970
 to repeat that there are other foxes 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.720
 masters with other characters that I've 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.750
 viewed 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.399
 these are basic masters and runes for 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.719
 Someone who does not know how this is going 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.489
 character of someone who wants to play it 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.260
 for the first time someone who is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.550
 starting in this game then see or be 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.469
 that yes that is all the matter I do not know 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.609
 how will he be rector I do not know how they are going 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.629
 the masters because I put it 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.870
 you are exactly and not here and not and not what 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.610
 I do wrong 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.079
 more or less why you may 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.489
 You take this mastery is legal these 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.170
 changes and go better just that 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.000
 just like angel serna runes are not 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.440
 the best but some ruins that go 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.480
 well with this character I do not know if I 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.219
 you understand so we're not going to do anything 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.379
 let's start today at 21 in defense and 9 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.420
 in attack ringtone has to become 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.220
 in a wall in law because it is a character 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.520
 that ends with a lot of life in a lot of damage 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.090
 so nothing we deny harm as always 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.950
 more life regeneration and we put life 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.409
 as always it is worth with this we are going to deny 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.910
 the damage done by the top enemies 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.410
 rector is going to play top by the way 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.679
 only in my jungle butt I do not like 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.240
 nothing with this we deny in the year of the top 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.160
 enemy with this new life with this 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.020
 they held more in line with this we went up 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.539
 the armor because normally then 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.130
 we will meet with tops that are 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.159
 that of therefore had armor and 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.229
 this by reset 2 magical resistance s &amp; p 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.119
 carry that has a little more damage than 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.069
 normal is the last skill that we 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.319
 hit sin and it does not kill us for that 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.780
 for this magical resistance pretty much 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.120
 to endure that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.430
 perseverance to regenerate more life already 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.260
 that we will end the solar fire with a 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.330
 a lot of things and so we will generate more 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.220
 life need to fucking mother and with 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.320
 renewed strength this regeneration of 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.780
 life is going to multiply by 10% in a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.770
 0.1 so we will generate more 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.000
 life and we will have a lot more support in 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.710
 any legendary we are going to put is already 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.910
 I know I do not like it very much, it's not very good 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.300
 expertise but I'm not just 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.330
 convince because it's worth the armor for 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.430
 5 is 15 is good armor but to me 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.070
 this to have a shield at the beginning and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.750
 have a power to attach more energy to 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.530
 enemy I like more this Monday read more 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.180
 brutal 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.400
 this is more for him and this is more for 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.490
 beats more than anything with this we can do 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.080
 you will leave me and arm the enemy in the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.150
 first moments so it's going to 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.530
 have 50 more life by we have we can 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.540
 go hit him more and the neuro to do 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.340
 less damage because we want a little escudito and 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.100
 with this in letter we throw the ink and 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.260
 by the other armor as the rector is 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.760
 very good throwing feces at the fish 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.650
 to the title that you have putting yourself in the middle 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.840
 from a lot of people and start throwing 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.510
 the ere start studying as this one 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.330
 heal at dinner and we 're not going to put 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.340
 and legendary and tenacious guard simply 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.689
 apart from that it is the last one if we lower the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.370
 alternation we put more tenacity and 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:04.780
 we go down in the duration of the controls 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.730
 in us instead looking in attack 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.400
 let's put 4 in witchcraft because who 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.110
 has a very long cds this bug 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.420
 I feel and if I had the lowest is 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.069
 it would be super broken record to go cds so 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.870
 Long is a character that is well 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.000
 but it's not broken so let's go 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.340
 let's put 5% witchcraft for 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.920
 have more damage and this is for double 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.849
 guiding edge ends up having so much life 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.799
 So much life that you do not care is 2% that 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.540
 1% additional damage received by this 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.340
 absolutely the same so sword of 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.920
 double edged for the rector of peace of whore 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.120
 mother talking about the runes we're going 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.310
 put here in the middle because there is better 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.349
 we have yellow armor for 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.079
 hold better to the top in damage marks 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.879
 of attack to do more damage blue of 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.799
 magic resistance to endure better 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.510
 to hit and when the time comes and 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.739
 fifths of attack damage because doing 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.720
 more damage are simply a ruin 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.760
 pretty standard enough for a top 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.260
 that has to endure and hurt like that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.060
 that nothing these are the masters and moons 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.110
 of ren hÃ©ctor tomorrow we will have salaries 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.490
 and nothing I hope 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.490
 liked the video and until next time
