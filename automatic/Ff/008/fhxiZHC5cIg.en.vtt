to design the farm make it look nice so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
to design the farm make it look nice so
that'll<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> separate<00:01:10.890> playlist<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.580> it'll

that'll be a separate playlist so it'll

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.510 
that'll be a separate playlist so it'll
be<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.810> would<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.140> episode<00:01:13.560> 1<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.159> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
be this would be like episode 1 and this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.749 
be this would be like episode 1 and this
would<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.990> carrots<00:01:15.990> potato<00:01:16.830> we<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.610> them

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
would be carrots potato we all of them

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
would be carrots potato we all of them
and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.270> it'll<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> current<00:01:19.020> potato<00:01:19.290> we

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and then it'll be a current potato we

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.260 
and then it'll be a current potato we
design<00:01:19.979> how<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.280> make<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:20.790> nice<00:01:20.970> that's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
design how to make it look nice that's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.550 
design how to make it look nice that's
what<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.020> they'll<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.350> 2

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
what it will be so they'll be like 2

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
what it will be so they'll be like 2
episodes<00:01:22.610> two<00:01:23.610> videos<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.390> episodes

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
episodes two videos for one episodes

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.969 
episodes two videos for one episodes
that's<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> kind<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.799> in

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that's how it's going to kind of be in

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
that's how it's going to kind of be in
two<00:01:26.100> different<00:01:26.130> playlists<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.049> no<00:01:28.049> more

design<00:03:07.060> then<00:03:07.570> you're<00:03:07.990> gonna<00:03:08.110> want<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.440> put

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
design then you're gonna want to put

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.160 
design then you're gonna want to put
your<00:03:08.770> water<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.370> now<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.000> water<00:03:10.240> is<00:03:10.510> used<00:03:10.870> to

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
your water in now the water is used to

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.880 
your water in now the water is used to
grow<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:12.190> there<00:03:12.850> well<00:03:13.360> kind<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.350> grow<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.710> it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
grow that there well kind of grow it it

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.770 
grow that there well kind of grow it it
is<00:03:15.010> basically<00:03:15.190> used<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.910> increases<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
is basically used to it increases the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.140 
is basically used to it increases the
growing<00:03:17.020> time<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.860> keeps<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.400> as<00:03:18.550> a<00:03:18.820> whole

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
growing time and it keeps it as a whole

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.990 
growing time and it keeps it as a whole
block<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.560> let<00:03:20.980> me<00:03:21.070> show<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.280> guys<00:03:21.520> how<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.760> do

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
block so let me show you guys how to do

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.160 
block so let me show you guys how to do
this<00:03:22.180> you're<00:03:22.360> going<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.540> want<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.750> put<00:03:22.960> them

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
this you're going to want to put them

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.840 
this you're going to want to put them
like<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.860> water<00:03:24.040> does<00:03:24.310> not<00:03:24.340> leak<00:03:24.670> and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
like that so the water does not leak and

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.340 
like that so the water does not leak and
affect<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.270> Redstone<00:03:25.690> then<00:03:26.110> you're<00:03:26.230> gonna

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
affect the Redstone then you're gonna

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.840 
affect the Redstone then you're gonna
want<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.620> put<00:03:26.740> one<00:03:26.950> down<00:03:27.130> there<00:03:27.400> then<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.670> put

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
want to put one down there then you put

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.460 
want to put one down there then you put
the<00:03:27.970> water<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.330> you've<00:03:28.870> got<00:03:28.990> to<00:03:29.080> be<00:03:29.140> really

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
the water in you've got to be really

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.080 
the water in you've got to be really
quick<00:03:29.650> finished<00:03:29.980> part<00:03:30.160> guys<00:03:30.310> so<00:03:30.700> that's

simple guy can do it so you go to put it
in<00:03:32.680> get<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> block<00:03:33.280> down<00:03:33.460> there<00:03:33.790> here<00:03:34.000> we<00:03:34.090> go

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
in get the block down there here we go

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.450 
in get the block down there here we go
see<00:03:34.960> how<00:03:35.020> quick<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.260> was<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.220> really

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460

see how quick that was that is really
good<00:03:36.580> so<00:03:36.730> once<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.090> water<00:03:37.240> is<00:03:37.540> in<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.110> I'll

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
good so once the water is in that I'll

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.600 
good so once the water is in that I'll
show<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.590> water<00:03:38.770> is<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.130> there<00:03:39.250> see<00:03:39.430> other

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
show you the water is in there see other

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.700 
show you the water is in there see other
sea<00:03:39.940> water<00:03:40.150> then<00:03:40.330> don't<00:03:41.140> want<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.350> I<00:03:41.500> don't

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
sea water then don't want to I don't

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.780 
sea water then don't want to I don't
want<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.890> get<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.070> to<00:03:42.160> leak<00:03:42.340> because<00:03:42.520> it<00:03:42.610> kind

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
want to get it to leak because it kind

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.340 
want to get it to leak because it kind
of<00:03:42.910> leaks<00:03:43.330> everywhere<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.990> gets<00:03:44.110> annoying

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
of leaks everywhere and gets annoying

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.380 
of leaks everywhere and gets annoying
but<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.890> water<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.250> inside<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.180> hold

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
but the water is inside that if I hold

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.570 
but the water is inside that if I hold
this<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.810> will<00:03:47.380> see<00:03:47.650> there<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.190> go<00:03:48.220> so

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
this you will see there you go so

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.860 
this you will see there you go so
remember<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:48.970> can<00:03:49.180> hold<00:03:49.390> this<00:03:49.480> at<00:03:49.630> any<00:03:49.780> time

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870

ready for this you're gonna wanna pour
one<00:04:02.410> piece<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.770> redstone<00:04:03.150> then<00:04:04.150> you<00:04:04.330> want<00:04:04.480> to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
one piece of redstone then you want to

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.180 
one piece of redstone then you want to
put<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.720> comparator<00:04:05.380> and<00:04:05.530> then<00:04:05.980> you're<00:04:06.100> going

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
put a comparator and then you're going

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.410 
put a comparator and then you're going
to<00:04:06.250> want<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.460> put<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.700> curve<00:04:06.880> imperative

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
to want to put the curve imperative

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.690 
to want to put the curve imperative
facing<00:04:08.350> towards<00:04:08.800> this<00:04:09.130> box<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.550> have<00:04:09.580> to

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
facing towards this box you have to

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.760 
facing towards this box you have to
place<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.150> balk<00:04:10.420> when<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.170> compare<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.500> make

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
place this balk when you compare to make

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.560 
place this balk when you compare to make
sure<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.040> is<00:04:12.160> facing<00:04:12.610> towards<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.209> body<00:04:13.450> but

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
sure it is facing towards this body but

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.090 
sure it is facing towards this body but
it's<00:04:13.660> not<00:04:13.720> facing<00:04:14.140> it's<00:04:14.350> not<00:04:14.709> gonna<00:04:14.860> work<00:04:15.070> so

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
it's not facing it's not gonna work so

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.120 
it's not facing it's not gonna work so
that<00:04:15.550> little<00:04:15.730> thing<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.239> then<00:04:17.130> that

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
that little thing there and then that

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.890 
that little thing there and then that
little<00:04:18.370> thing<00:04:18.520> there<00:04:18.700> you<00:04:19.030> want<00:04:19.180> to<00:04:19.239> click<00:04:19.330> LT

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
little thing there you want to click LT

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.080 
little thing there you want to click LT
on<00:04:20.020> it<00:04:20.140> the<00:04:20.320> comparator<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:21.370> will<00:04:21.520> cause<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:22.030> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
on it the comparator it will cause it to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.060 
on it the comparator it will cause it to
go<00:04:22.419> negative<00:04:22.690> mode<00:04:23.140> as<00:04:23.350> I<00:04:23.500> call<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:23.979> that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
go negative mode as I call it and that

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.640 
go negative mode as I call it and that
is<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:24.790> very<00:04:25.180> key<00:04:25.540> for<00:04:25.810> this

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
is a very key for this

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.110 
is a very key for this
notice<00:04:26.919> once<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.280> is<00:04:27.310> in<00:04:27.550> negative<00:04:27.910> mode

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
notice once it is in negative mode

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.550 
notice once it is in negative mode
you're<00:04:28.389> gonna<00:04:28.540> want<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.720> put<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.870> redstone<00:04:29.110> on

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
you're gonna want to put a redstone on

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.080 
you're gonna want to put a redstone on
top<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.979> this<00:04:30.100> block<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.790> then<00:04:30.910> do<00:04:31.060> another

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
top of this block and then do another

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.820 
top of this block and then do another
piece<00:04:31.509> of<00:04:31.630> redstone<00:04:31.780> coming<00:04:32.320> down<00:04:32.500> from<00:04:32.650> this

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
piece of redstone coming down from this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.650 
piece of redstone coming down from this
block<00:04:33.040> just<00:04:33.220> over<00:04:33.729> here<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.240> side<00:04:34.300> you

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
block just over here on this side you

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.180 
block just over here on this side you
can<00:04:34.720> see<00:04:34.810> how<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.229> curves<00:04:35.530> around<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:35.979> that

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
can see how that curves around like that

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.219 
can see how that curves around like that
and<00:04:36.400> then<00:04:36.639> make<00:04:36.789> it<00:04:36.820> connect<00:04:37.270> back<00:04:37.630> into<00:04:38.139> the

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
and then make it connect back into the

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.140 
and then make it connect back into the
comparator<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.100> reason<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.699> want<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:39.970> do

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
comparator the reason you want to do

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.870 
comparator the reason you want to do
this<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.600> because<00:04:41.020> when<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.500> click<00:04:41.800> believer<00:04:42.160> it

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
this is because when I click believer it

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.730 
this is because when I click believer it
will<00:04:43.270> cause<00:04:43.509> it<00:04:43.539> to<00:04:43.720> flicker<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.620> is

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
will cause it to flicker and that is

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.469 
will cause it to flicker and that is
what's<00:04:44.949> gonna<00:04:45.190> cause<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.669> bonemeal<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.330> grow

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
what's gonna cause the bonemeal to grow

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.810 
what's gonna cause the bonemeal to grow
and<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:47.169> is<00:04:47.289> how<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.470> works<00:04:47.650> whereas<00:04:48.220> if<00:04:48.520> you

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
and that is how it works whereas if you

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.670 
and that is how it works whereas if you
press<00:04:49.090> LT<00:04:49.479> on<00:04:49.570> that<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:49.960> will<00:04:50.110> see<00:04:50.320> how<00:04:50.530> it

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
press LT on that you will see how it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.140 
press LT on that you will see how it
does<00:04:50.860> not<00:04:51.039> flicker<00:04:51.280> so<00:04:51.699> make<00:04:51.880> sure<00:04:51.910> you

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
does not flicker so make sure you

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.999 
does not flicker so make sure you
definitely<00:04:52.630> put<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:52.900> in<00:04:53.020> negative<00:04:53.470> mode<00:04:53.680> or<00:04:53.889> it

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
definitely put it in negative mode or it

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.370 
definitely put it in negative mode or it
will<00:04:54.160> not<00:04:54.370> work<00:04:54.430> that<00:04:55.360> is<00:04:55.509> key<00:04:55.750> guys<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.110> have

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
will not work that is key guys you have

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.499 
will not work that is key guys you have
to<00:04:56.590> do<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.949> it<00:04:57.280> won't<00:04:57.610> work<00:04:57.789> so<00:04:58.090> once<00:04:58.389> you

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
to do that it won't work so once you

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.969 
to do that it won't work so once you
have<00:04:58.630> done<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:59.289> can<00:04:59.410> switch<00:04:59.620> your<00:04:59.650> lever

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
have done that you can switch your lever

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.710 
have done that you can switch your lever
off<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.490> then<00:05:00.970> you're<00:05:01.210> gonna<00:05:01.300> want<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.600> put

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
off and then you're gonna want to put

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.360 
off and then you're gonna want to put
another<00:05:02.020> block<00:05:02.169> there<00:05:02.500> this<00:05:02.770> will<00:05:02.979> not<00:05:03.220> affect

another block there this will not affect

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.830 
another block there this will not affect
the<00:05:03.669> redstone<00:05:04.030> because<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.419> is<00:05:04.510> curving

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840

to make it dark inside of that block

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.540 
to make it dark inside of that block
let's<00:05:31.270> make<00:05:31.510> it<00:05:31.539> 100%<00:05:32.349> dark<00:05:32.949> we're<00:05:33.220> still<00:05:33.430> so

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
let's make it 100% dark we're still so

you guys can see in you want to put the

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:36.810 
you guys can see in you want to put the
number<00:05:35.560> of<00:05:35.620> pieces<00:05:35.770> like<00:05:36.039> that<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.430> I<00:05:36.460> love

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
number of pieces like that and I love

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.610 
number of pieces like that and I love
that<00:05:36.849> and<00:05:37.210> there<00:05:37.510> you<00:05:37.539> go<00:05:37.810> it's<00:05:38.080> completely

that and there you go it's completely
pitch<00:05:38.830> buck<00:05:39.160> in<00:05:39.370> there<00:05:39.880> so<00:05:40.060> that<00:05:40.180> will<00:05:40.300> cause

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
pitch buck in there so that will cause

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.290 
pitch buck in there so that will cause
the<00:05:40.750> crops<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.830> automatically<00:05:42.580> harvest<00:05:43.030> if<00:05:43.240> I

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
the crops to automatically harvest if I
