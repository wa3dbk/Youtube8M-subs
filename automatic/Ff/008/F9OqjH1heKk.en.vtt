before this team so it's really created

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190 
before this team so it's really created
a<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> competition<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a lot of competition out there in the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
a lot of competition out there in the
field<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.950> defense<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:08.820> last<00:01:09.150> year

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
field the defense was so good last year

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.080 
field the defense was so good last year
this<00:01:10.049> year's<00:01:10.350> unit<00:01:10.710> possibly<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.580> better<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
this year's unit possibly be better I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
this year's unit possibly be better I
definitely<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.170> could<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.500> better<00:01:13.740> just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
definitely think we could be better just

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
definitely think we could be better just
because<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.850> lot<00:01:15.360> last<00:01:15.630> year<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.380> relied<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
because a lot last year we relied on the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.830 
because a lot last year we relied on the
dance<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.640> rush<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> quarterback<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.689> get

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
dance to rush the quarterback and get

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.530 
dance to rush the quarterback and get
sex<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.380> relied<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> DVD<00:01:20.369> cover<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.000> you

interceptions<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.330> gonna<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> lot<00:01:24.960> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
interceptions it's gonna be a lot of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
interceptions it's gonna be a lot of
versatility<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.070> year<00:01:26.340> we're<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
versatility this year we're going to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
versatility this year we're going to
have<00:01:27.140> linebackers<00:01:28.140> rushing<00:01:28.650> safety<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
have linebackers rushing safety is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.640

coming<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:29.939> blitzing<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> be

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
coming down blitzing so it's going to be

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.770 
coming down blitzing so it's going to be
a<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.040> versatility<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.540> think

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
a lot of versatility and I just think
