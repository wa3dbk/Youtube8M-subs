 and a lagoon is located in the countryside 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:39.809
 technician of the municipality of san juan 'golpe 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:41.370
 by the department of freedom according to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.550
 the national study service 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.289
 snet and the inventory of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.170
 Wetlands of the Ministry of the Environment 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.329
 environment this body of water is a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.629
 wide crater produced by a rash 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.039
 volcanic caused by groundwater 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.039
 in contact with hot lava 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.390
 however there is reference from the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.500
 1659 eruption of volcano san 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.440
 Salvador and the volcano on the beach are 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 says that the lagoon was not 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.550
 located on this site but it was 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.550
 located on the plane of the lagoon 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.840
 but I have another hypothesis that I have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.030
 told that having a waterhole the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.180
 I saw that it was small that they were coming down 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 some old people went down spent alone could 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.150
 Wash hands carefully because 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.000
 the sector was very deep to the water 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.460
 Chamico lagoon is part of the complex 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.820
 of protected natural areas of the beach 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:52.410
 with an extension of more than 1500 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:55.740
 hectares the lagoon is fragmented into 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.920
 four portions the first one is lava 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.130
 volcanic the second is a mantle of water 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.890
 bordered by vegetation and the last two 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:13.250
 they are forests located on the back of the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:18.470
 San Salvador volcano as trees

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.170

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:40.400
 true bells and this

 March 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.940
 no low hand 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.850
 in 2012 we were seeing the site of 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.700
 what is the complex the beach that does not 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.220
 I was having assistance by none 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.740
 ong and was also without assistance from 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.590
 part of the authorities in charge of 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.870
 conservation that 's what brought us 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.330
 to the lagoon added to the problem that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.020
 we found that people commented 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.120
 that the lagoon was drying up and that the 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.360
 Sulfur made it almost all 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.280
 fish this one would have died in that 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.650
 meaning we took a tour and 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.880
 we saw that there was a lot 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.060
 trash 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.670
 and other types of sediments that 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.940
 industries that were around him 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.830
 they threw in the entrances in the accesses and 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.470
 that had obstructed the passage of water 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:46.170
 rain that was the one that fed the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.300
 lagoon for the assistance foundation 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.810
 technique for community development 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.450
 Salvadoran assisted in coordination 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.820
 with the ministry of the environment have 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:19.320
 carried out different activities with the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:21.980
 In order to protect the lagoon the water itself 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.080
 it is not used for consumption 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.860
 it's just for fishing activities 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.300
 bathroom and some 5 families that still 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.220
 they come to hell 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:38.009
 clothing that hence the use generated by 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:42.539
 lagoon is more than everything for fishing 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:44.490
 craft as you can see then the 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.340
 fish classes here are with three 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.430
 we have the handsome t the tilapia and the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.460
 symbol followed them then follows the 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.000
 eel 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.220
 from 10 years until this date then 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.490
 I have stayed like you 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.580
 can you see with my two sticks or famous 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.080
 snacks that is called the water cuckoo 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.789
 as you can see it here there are 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.840
 the animalists will also live 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.729
 they are freshly caught and as you can see 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.580
 Also, they do not lack 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.580
 skewer where to put my fish to 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:51.560
 get better than what is already being 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:53.479
 ending the lagoon in its in its 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.610
 ecosystem offers alternatives 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.650
 recreational 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.500
 very few because the mirror of water that 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.050
 has around you is perhaps like 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.780
 about 5 or 6 meters where the people 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.669
 You can enjoy a bath because 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.030
 be a volcanic cone because people do not 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:14.599
 can be deepened a little bit more and 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:17.000
 generally people come to camp in 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.159
 the days of Holy Week in the 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.849
 August holidays and vacations 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:24.969
 of Christmas 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:28.449
 people come here rustically camping 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:30.599
 and there is a boat that also makes them their 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.599
 travel 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:38.559
 gianmarco in Nahuatl language means 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:40.719
 place of the dead and according to some 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:44.279
 historians this place with a 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:44.279
 cemetery in pre-Columbian times 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.590
 this type of humidity serves as 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.260
 result of water in rainy season and 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.910
 some retain carbon that contribute 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.910
 to fight global warming
