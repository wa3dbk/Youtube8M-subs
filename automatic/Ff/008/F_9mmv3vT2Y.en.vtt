00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
under just a little local so that's that

under just a little local so that's that
there<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.549> granulomatous<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
there was a little granulomatous you and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.990 
there was a little granulomatous you and
last<00:01:09.240> week<00:01:09.510> he<00:01:09.810> cauterized<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:11.000> silver

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
last week he cauterized it with silver

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.830 
last week he cauterized it with silver
nitrate<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:14.270> chemical<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> long

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
nitrate it's like a chemical on a long

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.520 
nitrate it's like a chemical on a long
stick<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.950> looks<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> long<00:01:17.520> matchstick

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
stick it looks like a long matchstick

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.530 
stick it looks like a long matchstick
and<00:01:19.530> basically<00:01:20.430> he<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.670> kind<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.180> sticks<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and basically he just kind of sticks it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.030 
and basically he just kind of sticks it
in<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.750> rubs<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> granuloma<00:01:22.740> tissue

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
in and rubs it on the granuloma tissue

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.999 
in and rubs it on the granuloma tissue
and<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:24.210> cauterized<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.470> gets<00:01:25.650> rid<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.860> it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and it cauterized it and gets rid of it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
and it cauterized it and gets rid of it
so<00:01:26.580> he<00:01:26.700> did<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> last<00:01:27.240> week<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.780> he<00:01:27.840> did<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
better there was less what he still

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.420

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
last six out this time so I can talk a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
last six out this time so I can talk a
little<00:01:41.310> better<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.180> basically<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.840> have

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930

little better but basically I just have
three<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:44.280> tiny<00:01:44.579> elastics<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.110> put<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
three little tiny elastics that I put in

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.850 
three little tiny elastics that I put in
there<00:01:46.759> just<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.970> try<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.810> bring<00:01:49.110> my<00:01:49.259> bite<00:01:49.560> back

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.180 
pretty much the whole areas touching
it's<00:02:15.240> getting<00:02:15.540> better<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.320> as<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
it's getting better you know as the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.460 
it's getting better you know as the
week's<00:02:17.400> go<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.670> known<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.080> still<00:02:19.290> pretty

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
week's go on known this is still pretty

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.710 
week's go on known this is still pretty
much<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> same<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:20.310> could<00:02:20.400> still<00:02:20.730> feel<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
much the same I could still feel you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.490 
much the same I could still feel you
know<00:02:21.810> some<00:02:22.560> pressure<00:02:22.860> areas<00:02:23.990> but<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.380> know

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
know some pressure areas but you know

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.400 
know some pressure areas but you know
the<00:02:25.650> chin<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:26.520> still<00:02:26.760> fairly<00:02:27.690> numb<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.230> think

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
the chin is still fairly numb I think

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.630 
the chin is still fairly numb I think
that's<00:02:28.560> gonna<00:02:28.680> take<00:02:28.770> months<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.370> months<00:02:29.460> to

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
that's gonna take months and months to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.960 
that's gonna take months and months to
come<00:02:30.000> back<00:02:30.450> slowly<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.580> even<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.700> someone

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
come back slowly so even if someone

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.220 
come back slowly so even if someone
comes<00:02:33.120> back<00:02:33.330> I'm<00:02:33.540> probably<00:02:33.720> not<00:02:33.900> gonna<00:02:34.050> know

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
comes back I'm probably not gonna know

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.140 
comes back I'm probably not gonna know
because<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:34.800> gradual<00:02:35.270> but<00:02:37.400> let's<00:02:38.400> see

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.190 

that's<00:02:42.150> pretty<00:02:42.270> much<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.690> got<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.050> go-ahead

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that's pretty much it I got the go-ahead

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.680 
that's pretty much it I got the go-ahead
to<00:02:43.440> do<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.550> know<00:02:44.640> continuing<00:02:45.210> orthodontic

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
to do you know continuing orthodontic

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.950 
to do you know continuing orthodontic
treatment<00:02:46.200> so<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:47.520> went<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.150> today<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
treatment so I went in today for a

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.040 
treatment so I went in today for a
broken<00:02:49.380> bracket<00:02:49.860> that's<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.750> he<00:02:51.750> took<00:02:51.900> that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
broken bracket that's it he took that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.250 
broken bracket that's it he took that
out<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> back<00:02:53.630> he's<00:02:54.630> not<00:02:54.660> gonna<00:02:54.990> put<00:02:55.200> it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
out in the back he's not gonna put it

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.420 
out in the back he's not gonna put it
back<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.590> because<00:02:55.770> that's<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.130> what<00:02:56.310> he's

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
back in because that's not what he's

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.490 
back in because that's not what he's
