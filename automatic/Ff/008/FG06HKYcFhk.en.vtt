00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
never really thought for sure that I

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.710 
never really thought for sure that I
would<00:04:49.410> be<00:04:49.560> able<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.800> break<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.160> record

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
would be able to break this record

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.210 
would be able to break this record
especially<00:04:51.720> not<00:04:51.870> with<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.320> team<00:04:52.530> like<00:04:52.560> Atlanta

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
especially not with a team like Atlanta

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.430 
especially not with a team like Atlanta
with<00:04:53.730> their<00:04:53.880> ballpark<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.630> mean<00:04:55.170> if<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.410> was

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
with their ballpark I mean if I was

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.750 
with their ballpark I mean if I was
going<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.680> break<00:04:55.920> it<00:04:56.160> would<00:04:56.340> have<00:04:56.460> been<00:04:56.520> with

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
going to break it would have been with

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.540 
going to break it would have been with
New<00:04:57.720> York<00:04:57.870> Yankees<00:04:58.350> or<00:04:58.650> with<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.130> Texas

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
New York Yankees or with the Texas

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.540 
New York Yankees or with the Texas
Rangers<00:04:59.760> because<00:05:00.390> of<00:05:00.540> their<00:05:00.660> ballpark<00:05:00.900> but

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
Rangers because of their ballpark but

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.270 
Rangers because of their ballpark but
for<00:05:02.550> whatever<00:05:02.730> reason<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.980> this<00:05:05.100> is

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
for whatever reason and and this is

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.160 
for whatever reason and and this is
typical<00:05:05.760> with<00:05:05.790> me<00:05:06.120> at<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.720> beginning<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:07.080> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
season I usually I usually have a

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.710 
season I usually I usually have a
fantastic<00:05:10.980> first<00:05:11.370> half<00:05:11.580> of<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:11.910> season<00:05:12.090> and

left maybe maybe just over a month maybe

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.220 
left maybe maybe just over a month maybe
just<00:06:58.240> around<00:06:58.540> a<00:06:58.660> month<00:06:58.810> I<00:06:58.930> can't<00:06:59.110> remember

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.860 
just around a month I can't remember
exactly<00:06:59.800> but<00:07:00.120> we'll<00:07:01.120> have<00:07:01.270> plenty<00:07:01.510> of<00:07:01.630> time<00:07:01.720> to

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
exactly but we'll have plenty of time to

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.960 
exactly but we'll have plenty of time to
hit<00:07:02.440> more<00:07:02.620> home<00:07:02.830> runs<00:07:02.860> so<00:07:03.490> that<00:07:03.700> should

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
hit more home runs so that should

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.240 
hit more home runs so that should
probably<00:07:04.420> go<00:07:04.540> up<00:07:04.570> to<00:07:04.870> around<00:07:05.080> 80<00:07:05.470> ish<00:07:05.710> maybe<00:07:06.100> a

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
probably go up to around 80 ish maybe a

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.830 
probably go up to around 80 ish maybe a

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
little bit higher so that's going to be

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.900
