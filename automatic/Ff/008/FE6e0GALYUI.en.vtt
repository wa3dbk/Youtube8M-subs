00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 How about I'm Marco Romero and I'm going to do 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.240
 a series of tutorials to make a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.269
 motion comic a comic or a movement 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.289
 with animation before before 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.660
 continue I must clarify that I am not a 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.439
 professional I do this for fun 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.230
 I am an amateur and hopefully serve them 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.199
 well in this chapter we are going to see the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.779
 tools that we need those 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.930
 programs that we need to make a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.469
 comic bag and what we are going to use 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:42.030
 they are the sketch book express the pixelmator 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.090
 the garageband the adobe after effects and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.590
 the final cut pro let's start 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.649
 saying briefly what are we going to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.940
 occupy these those programs and then in 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 the next chapters we are going to 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.010
 detail its operation and how 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 use good let's start with the let 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.460
 with the sketch book express this program 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.440
 You can download it from the app store 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.940
 form is the free version 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.660
 can use in 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.080
 on the computer with the mouse self 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:20.900
 in my case I have it installed on an ipad 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:24.560
 3 and I use a pen the bamboo 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.810
 of wacom its price is around 500 pesos 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.479
 Mexicans 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.580
 it's a pretty good pen the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.250
 I recommend a lot 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.420
 and well let's use this program 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.140
 to draw to make the drawings of 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.860
 our comic we are going to close this this 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.040
 program after what we do with the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 sketch book express we are going to touch up 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.540
 with the pixel mail this is a no version 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.530
 as expensive as photoshop is going to 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.870
 serve to take away the white background from 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.900
 our drawings because at the moment of 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.899
 give them animation we need the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.050
 transparent background the next package 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.860
 that we're going to use is garageband you'll see 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.880
 van is included with the brands of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.310
 free form is already integrated and this 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.030
 program we will occupy to record 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.510
 the voices of the characters of our 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.640
 motion comic the dialogue and so on 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.450
 and the other program that we are going to use 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.720
 it's called adobe after effects I have 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.110
 installed version cs6 and this program 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.680
 We will use it mainly for 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.950
 the effects that we are going to put 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.599
 our drawings all the animation of 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.159
 the drawings the movement we are going to 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:00.739
 perform with adobe after effects is a 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.230
 relatively simple program for what 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.060
 basic also has its degree of 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.080
 complexity for more effects 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.780
 showy we are going to close this program and 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.510
 the last program we need is going to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.209
 be the final cut pro this program is 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.810
 for video editing with this one let's 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.959
 unite all the all the parts of 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:32.739
 our project as would be the sound 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:36.519
 the music the photos the edition the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:39.280
 animation and everything we are going to unite with 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.190
 this final cut pro and with this we are going to 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.350
 export and we will generate the product 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.340
 final and from here we can export to 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.670
 youtube is an apple pay program 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.250
 and well maybe you can get over there 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.080
 but this is because of everyone in the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.049
 next chapter we're going to start 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.220
 see how to use the sketch book express 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.220
 greetings to all
