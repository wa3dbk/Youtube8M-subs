already unboxed as you can see here this

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.470 
already unboxed as you can see here this
is<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.649> charging<00:00:35.100> cable<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:36.270> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
is the charging cable because this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.119 
is the charging cable because this
device<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> actually<00:00:37.079> woods<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:37.890> means

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.229 
device is actually woods with with means
it<00:00:38.489> acts<00:00:38.730> independently<00:00:39.829> without<00:00:40.969> iPad<00:00:41.969> so

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it acts independently without iPad so

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.970 
it acts independently without iPad so
you<00:00:42.360> never<00:00:42.480> actually<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.590> ipad

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
