00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.410
 hello girls how are they good 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.720
 they will ask what I do with this towel 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.400
 in the head certain good today I'm going to 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.629
 teach how to do repolarization in 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.059
 home 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.730
 good cried with these treatments that 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.519
 I showed them in the video of the creolina 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.519
 are these three I use them together 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.730
 in the other videos that I've seen in 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.430
 youtube I notice some children 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 use these little pots and this presitas 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.270
 and they mix everything here and they throw it 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.160
 I do not do this well so I will 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.920
 I'm going to show right now I'm going to remove 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.710
 what is healing me and forgive me 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.170
 these crazy dogs that I bring but 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.570
 and so one of the showers comes out then 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.890
 I wanted to show you how I do 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.700
 I realize good 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.980
 I'm going to comb my hair, I use this penita or 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.129
 if you want to use one of the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 normal how are you but webb I go 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.680
 to comb my hair I have a little 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 tangled 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.140
 but I want you to see all the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.560
 process that I do when I do the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.560
 repolarization 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.259
 already after having had the hair 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.259
 all that legacy 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:30.439
 I come and used the creams true as 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.110
 I do the creams I made them in 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.750
 the Havana little bit and so that 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.880
 the treatment is a little more durable 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.549
 because if we are going to place 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.369
 spoonfuls in these pots are us 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.060
 they end up very fast and sometimes sometimes not 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.549
 we have money for one to buy these 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.170
 treatments that are a bit expensive 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.009
 a hole 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.340
 What I do first is throw myself in the 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:02.760
 the hand well each of the treatments 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.920
 today here I pass 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.720
 what do I do and I divide the falling 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 tensions I already have it divided and the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.470
 points in this way that is the same 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.220
 what are we going to do in the little boat in the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.750
 little pot in a little hut as they call it and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.570
 to mix it and this what we are 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.360
 by mixing we were going to make 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.950
 these forms 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.500
 the application of the treatments all 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.320
 the hair has to be on paper 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 soaked from the treatment and another thing the 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.320
 treatment, we're not going to throw it out of the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.490
 root but less to the tips and is very 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.960
 easy to throw it out because because this one when 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.020
 the hair is wet 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.480
 the treatment is better incorporated in the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.500
 hair let's do the same for this 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.500
 part for this section 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.409
 and it's very easy girls see the hair 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.500
 divine if you want to take a 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.870
 little vitamin d what you 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.159
 want for me I do it this way and 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.900
 I think these treatments are 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.090
 very good and I do not have a need 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.170
 to throw me will rule because they already 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.970
 they come with vitamin e in their in the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.970
 creams already come with vitamin e 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.670
 then he combed it 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.370
 this way now that I'm going to use 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.260
 The iron can also be used with 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.890
 thermal caps but I think with the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.989
 iron is much better for the iron 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.819
 I put aluminum foil so that 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:42.220
 not mistreat me both to hair 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:47.849
 well now what we are going to do will be 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.849
 document is to connect the iron 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.670
 connect the iron and turn it on 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.750
 and it will arrive until 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.540
 the number is up to 210 me 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.410
 It looks like it's a very good iron 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.350
 I also use the baby leaks but in 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.880
 these moments I do not have it here good 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.299
 this is treatment 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.920
 I do it to my clients because I 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.110
 work 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.540
 that 's all about hairdressing and 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.790
 let me tell you that you have not studied anything 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.400
 I'm empirical in what I do and I think 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.830
 I am a good at what I do and this is what 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.310
 I owe it to my mom who taught me 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.680
 do all this then we start from 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.720
 this way I use this iron that 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.060
 it is forgiveness of this seed that is very 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.460
 I use it so good and I spend 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.830
 iron in this way 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.830
 then I take another extension 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.340
 and it happened again 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.810
 in this way 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.810
 and stay like this 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.380
 next to 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.840
 and later 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.840
 I make 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.439
 from this side 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.930
 and it stays that way 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.180
 and so on 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.350
 same 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.600
 and we passed several times until one 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.620
 I do not want either it's going to go away 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.180
 to come one to look for the hairs not true 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.210
 good after having done this 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.870
 procedure with the iron you're going to 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.680
 wash the hair with ice water 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:48.310
 because that the ice seals 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.250
 cuticles from the tips and makes your 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:55.240
 Hair looks more movable more shiny 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.849
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.070
 my video and put in practice this 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.690
 repolarization at home that is very good 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.449
 it's like the ones they do in the salons 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.479
 but 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:10.080
 at home he practiced it to my clients 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.819
 also and also other things that more 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.689
 I will show you later that it is 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:19.439
 I owe the video of the rollito in the head 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:21.569
 so that it is the gallitos that is 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.980
 very good in the next video are the 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.620
