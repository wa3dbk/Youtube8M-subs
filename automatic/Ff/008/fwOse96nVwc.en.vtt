00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
modding on it so that would be the way

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.589 
modding on it so that would be the way
to<00:03:01.959> go<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:03.159> as<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.700> right<00:03:03.879> now<00:03:03.939> nobody<00:03:04.540> has

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
kind of cracked the ISO mind or released

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.990 
kind of cracked the ISO mind or released
any<00:03:08.230> mods<00:03:08.530> for<00:03:08.889> ISO<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:11.590> ISO<00:03:12.519> isn't

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
be modded again there are probably like

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.509 
be modded again there are probably like
10<00:04:14.109> pilots<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.680> can<00:04:15.159> be<00:04:15.400> modded<00:04:15.879> and<00:04:16.359> if

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.879 
basically the way I've been hearing
things<00:04:20.079> is<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:21.519> content<00:04:22.060> for<00:04:22.330> your<00:04:22.389> zombies

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
things is the content for your zombies

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.219 
things is the content for your zombies
in<00:04:23.979> your<00:04:24.189> multiplayer<00:04:24.939> is<00:04:25.210> not<00:04:25.900> on<00:04:26.080> the

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
in your multiplayer is not on the

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.499 
in your multiplayer is not on the
console<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.889> it's<00:04:26.979> not<00:04:27.129> in<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.370> game<00:04:27.580> save<00:04:27.879> and

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
console and it's not in a game save and

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.869 
console and it's not in a game save and
it's<00:04:29.110> not<00:04:29.349> really<00:04:29.800> on<00:04:29.949> your<00:04:30.129> profile<00:04:30.610> it's

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
it's not really on your profile it's

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.209 
it's not really on your profile it's
linked<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.330> your<00:04:31.569> profile<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.830> reason

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:33.219 
linked to your profile and the reason

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.040 
linked to your profile and the reason
why<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.370> can't<00:04:33.669> inject<00:04:34.120> anything<00:04:34.479> into<00:04:34.780> the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
why you can't inject anything into the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.610 
why you can't inject anything into the
game<00:04:35.289> while<00:04:35.590> you're<00:04:35.770> playing<00:04:36.039> is<00:04:37.050> because<00:04:38.050> the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
game while you're playing is because the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.499 
game while you're playing is because the
games<00:04:38.889> in<00:04:39.099> three<00:04:39.340> different<00:04:39.580> sectors<00:04:40.150> is<00:04:40.360> the

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
games in three different sectors is the

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.959 
games in three different sectors is the
way<00:04:40.629> I've<00:04:40.780> seen<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.169> is<00:04:41.669> because<00:04:42.669> you<00:04:42.939> have

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
way I've seen it is because you have

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:44.909 
way I've seen it is because you have
zombies<00:04:43.659> and<00:04:43.870> then<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.080> have<00:04:44.199> multiplayer

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
zombies and then you have multiplayer

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.070 
zombies and then you have multiplayer
and<00:04:45.250> campaign<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.449> way<00:04:46.599> that<00:04:46.810> they<00:04:46.930> had

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
and campaign the way that they had

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.689 
and campaign the way that they had
before<00:04:47.319> is<00:04:47.680> they<00:04:47.919> would<00:04:48.159> have<00:04:48.189> them<00:04:48.490> all

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
before is they would have them all

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.059 
before is they would have them all
connected<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:49.569> sense<00:04:49.900> but<00:04:50.620> now<00:04:50.800> they've

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
connected in a sense but now they've

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.740 
connected in a sense but now they've
kind<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.460> just<00:04:51.789> split<00:04:52.030> them<00:04:52.210> up<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.419> three

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
kind of just split them up in three

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.399 
kind of just split them up in three
sectors<00:04:53.939> if<00:04:54.939> we<00:04:55.120> go<00:04:55.270> on<00:04:55.449> this<00:04:55.780> one<00:04:56.020> says<00:04:56.259> the

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
sectors if we go on this one says the

sectors if we go on this one says the
exact<00:04:56.710> same<00:04:56.740> thing<00:04:56.979> about<00:04:57.340> how<00:04:57.520> black<00:04:57.759> ops<00:04:58.000> 2
