00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.570 
incredible today you know 3718 I've been
on<00:01:34.960> him<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.259> rebound<00:01:35.650> war<00:01:35.890> he's<00:01:36.400> been

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
on him the rebound war he's been

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.150 
on him the rebound war he's been
averaging<00:01:36.729> like<00:01:37.210> 11<00:01:37.600> 12<00:01:37.690> 13<00:01:37.840> like<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.979> could

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
averaging like 11 12 13 like you could

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.010 
averaging like 11 12 13 like you could
get<00:01:39.280> 18<00:01:39.700> 20<00:01:40.030> in<00:01:40.150> most<00:01:40.300> high<00:01:40.420> school<00:01:40.630> games<00:01:40.810> and

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
get 18 20 in most high school games and

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.230 
get 18 20 in most high school games and
I<00:01:41.440> thought<00:01:41.680> today<00:01:41.860> he<00:01:42.070> also<00:01:42.250> did<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:42.759> great

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
I thought today he also did a great

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.920 
I thought today he also did a great
defensive<00:01:43.810> job<00:01:44.080> in<00:01:44.770> 22<00:01:45.430> who<00:01:46.150> could<00:01:46.360> kill<00:01:46.660> it<00:01:46.720> at

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
defensive job in 22 who could kill it at

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.230 
defensive job in 22 who could kill it at
the<00:01:47.320> high<00:01:47.770> hair<00:01:48.070> who<00:01:48.460> could<00:01:48.640> really<00:01:48.880> shoot

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
the high hair who could really shoot

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.600 
the high hair who could really shoot
them<00:01:49.450> all<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.320> think<00:01:50.500> he<00:01:50.590> made<00:01:50.740> 13<00:01:51.190> late<00:01:51.460> to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
them all and I think he made 13 late to

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.980 
them all and I think he made 13 late to
tie<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.820> game<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:52.210> his<00:01:52.300> over<00:01:52.479> five<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> half

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
so as well I told him before the game

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.980 
so as well I told him before the game
you<00:01:56.590> can't<00:01:56.860> have<00:01:56.979> 13<00:01:57.429> him<00:01:57.580> 16<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.630> could<00:01:58.810> hold

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
you can't have 13 him 16 you could hold

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.480 
you can't have 13 him 16 you could hold
him<00:01:59.200> aight<00:01:59.440> you're<00:01:59.619> capable<00:01:59.830> of<00:02:00.100> doing<00:02:00.369> that

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
him aight you're capable of doing that

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.639 
him aight you're capable of doing that
if<00:02:00.729> you<00:02:01.210> guard<00:02:01.479> him<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:01.869> can't<00:02:02.080> lose<00:02:02.229> him<00:02:02.500> and

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
if you guard him you can't lose him and

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.630 
if you guard him you can't lose him and
now<00:02:02.710> pay<00:02:02.860> attention<00:02:02.890> then<00:02:03.310> because<00:02:03.490> he'll

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
now pay attention then because he'll

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.370 
now pay attention then because he'll
knock<00:02:03.819> down<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.000> three<00:02:04.060> ball<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.020> think<00:02:05.140> that

knock down a three ball so I think that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.200
