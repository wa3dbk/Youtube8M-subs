examples of what I showed you is that

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.310 
examples of what I showed you is that
quickscoping<00:03:51.510> regardless<00:03:52.510> whether<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.079> or

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
sucks but it's like me using an IED I

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.230 
sucks but it's like me using an IED I
guess<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.220> know<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> lot<00:04:30.790> of<00:04:30.820> people<00:04:30.940> hate

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
guess you know a lot of people hate

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.180 
guess you know a lot of people hate
those<00:04:31.390> too<00:04:31.660> hey<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.170> use<00:04:32.590> them<00:04:32.800> because<00:04:32.920> they're

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
those too hey I use them because they're

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.730 
those too hey I use them because they're
cheap<00:04:33.460> easy<00:04:33.730> kills<00:04:34.420> and<00:04:34.840> that's<00:04:35.530> what

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
cheap easy kills and that's what

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.650 
cheap easy kills and that's what
quickscoping<00:04:36.430> seems<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.970> be<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.210> me<00:04:37.360> you<00:04:37.540> know

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
quickscoping seems to be to me you know

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.260 
quickscoping seems to be to me you know
if<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.170> wanted<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.770> lay<00:04:39.220> down<00:04:39.520> prone<00:04:39.940> and

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
if you wanted the lay down prone and

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.380 
if you wanted the lay down prone and
snipe<00:04:40.780> across<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.410> map<00:04:41.620> that's<00:04:42.520> at<00:04:42.910> least<00:04:42.970> a

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
snipe across the map that's at least a

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.420 
snipe across the map that's at least a
little<00:04:43.540> more<00:04:44.050> realistic<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.740> sniping<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.310> my

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
little more realistic of sniping in my

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.840 
little more realistic of sniping in my
opinion<00:04:45.750> but<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:47.230> quick<00:04:47.710> scalpers<00:04:48.130> man<00:04:48.310> hey<00:04:48.550> I

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
opinion but a quick scalpers man hey I

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.600 
opinion but a quick scalpers man hey I
was<00:04:49.600> terrible<00:04:49.960> at<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:50.230> gosh<00:04:50.500> I'm<00:04:51.250> almost<00:04:51.460> a

look at this I didn't most of this is

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.560 
look at this I didn't most of this is
not<00:04:56.740> even<00:04:56.950> quickscoping<00:04:57.520> it's<00:04:57.790> hardscoping

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
not even quickscoping it's hardscoping

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.470 
not even quickscoping it's hardscoping
but<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.740> just<00:05:00.220> got<00:05:00.400> bored<00:05:00.820> with<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.060> man<00:05:01.330> it's

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
but I just got bored with it man it's

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.830 
but I just got bored with it man it's
like<00:05:01.660> you're<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:02.620> walking<00:05:02.890> around<00:05:03.190> with<00:05:03.640> his

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
like you're just walking around with his

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.020

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.360 
to get around the map man I just hated
it<00:05:09.340> maybe<00:05:09.670> it's<00:05:09.850> because<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.120> was<00:05:10.240> bad<00:05:10.480> at<00:05:10.510> it
