00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it looks pretty easy to get doesn't look

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.830 
it looks pretty easy to get doesn't look
like<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> build<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.660> anything

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
like you have to build it or anything

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290 
like you have to build it or anything
like<00:00:43.340> like<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.460> liquefy<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.059> kind<00:00:45.239> of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
like like this liquefy it's kind of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.639 
like like this liquefy it's kind of
similar<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.750> slick<00:00:45.960> far<00:00:46.230> i<00:00:46.260> thought<00:00:46.559> from

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
similar to the slick far i thought from

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
similar to the slick far i thought from
from<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> zombies<00:00:47.550> mode<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> kind<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.120> looks

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
from the zombies mode it kind of looks

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.720 
from the zombies mode it kind of looks
similar<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.930> maybe<00:00:49.920> shoots<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.610> bit

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
similar and maybe shoots a little bit

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.970 
similar and maybe shoots a little bit
similar<00:00:51.079> but<00:00:52.079> yet<00:00:52.230> does<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> have

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
similar but yet does not like you have

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
similar but yet does not like you have
to<00:00:53.010> build<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.579> but<00:00:53.910> i<00:00:53.969> don't<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.600> will<00:00:54.750> be

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to build it but i don't think it will be

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
to build it but i don't think it will be
as<00:00:54.960> simple<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.860> walking<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.460> room

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
as simple as just walking into a room

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.930 
as simple as just walking into a room
and<00:00:56.789> getting<00:00:57.090> i<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> maybe<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.940> do

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and getting i think you maybe have to do

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
and getting i think you maybe have to do
some<00:01:00.120> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.390> easter<00:01:00.899> egg<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.260> find<00:01:01.530> out

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
some kind of easter egg to find out

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.229 
some kind of easter egg to find out
where<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.890> room<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> unlock<00:01:03.030> this

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
where this room is or to unlock this

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
where this room is or to unlock this
room<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.629> maybe<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.229> something<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
room you maybe have to do something I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.010 
room you maybe have to do something I
don't<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.880> simple<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.750> walking

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
don't think is as simple as just walking

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
don't think is as simple as just walking
into<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> room<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> don't<00:01:08.580> think

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
into a room and get in it don't think

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.130 
into a room and get in it don't think
also<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.240> would<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.540> simple<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.960> just

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
also it would be as simple as just

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.510 
also it would be as simple as just
paying<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> door<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.010> into<00:01:11.159> room<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
paying for a door to get into room to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.710 
paying for a door to get into room to
get<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.150> seems<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.510> little

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
get it because it just seems a little

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960 
get it because it just seems a little
bit<00:01:13.080> too<00:01:13.290> easy<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.799> gun<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.250> kill<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
bit too easy for a gun that can kill the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.899 
bit too easy for a gun that can kill the
aliens<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.439> shot<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.040> whatever<00:01:17.490> round

shoot at you and you refill it by

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
shoot at you and you refill it by
collecting<00:01:27.119> these<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> egg<00:01:28.110> little

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
collecting these kind of egg little

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
collecting these kind of egg little
things<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> then<00:01:29.220> squeeze<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.909> I'm

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
things and then squeeze it in I'm

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.520 
things and then squeeze it in I'm
guessing<00:01:30.689> you're<00:01:30.780> gonna<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.320> them

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
guessing you're gonna have to get them

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.170 
guessing you're gonna have to get them
from<00:01:31.710> killing<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.310> actual<00:01:32.729> scorpions

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
from killing the actual scorpions

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
from killing the actual scorpions
themselves<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.320> yeah<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.070> ties

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
themselves so yeah that kind of all ties

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
themselves so yeah that kind of all ties
in<00:01:35.430> nicely<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.360> looks<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.720> me<00:01:36.810> like

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
in nicely and it looks to me like

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
in nicely and it looks to me like
Infinity<00:01:37.590> Ward<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> idea<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
Infinity Ward are in on the idea of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.630 
Infinity Ward are in on the idea of
having<00:01:39.509> wound<00:01:39.960> weapons<00:01:40.380> within<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
having wound weapons within the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
having wound weapons within the
extinction<00:01:42.119> mode<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:43.140> could<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.439> seeing

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
extinction mode so we could be seeing

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.929 
extinction mode so we could be seeing
many<00:01:43.829> more<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> future<00:01:44.369> looks<00:01:44.850> like

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
many more in the future looks like

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.190 
many more in the future looks like
they're<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.240> down<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> same<00:01:45.659> lines<00:01:45.869> as<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
they're going down the same lines as a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
they're going down the same lines as a
track<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> zombies<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.909> wound

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
track with the zombies and the wound

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.450 
track with the zombies and the wound
weapons<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:49.079> all<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:50.009> map<00:01:50.220> looks

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
weapons I'm all for that this map looks

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
weapons I'm all for that this map looks
a<00:01:50.579> lot<00:01:50.700> better<00:01:50.850> than<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> previous<00:01:51.360> map<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.780> did

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
a lot better than the previous map I did

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.600 
a lot better than the previous map I did
enjoy<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> previous<00:01:52.710> map<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.430> one

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
enjoy the previous map but this one

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
enjoy the previous map but this one
looks<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.909> lot<00:01:54.149> better<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.659> looks<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
looks a lot better it looks like the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.319 
looks a lot better it looks like the
previous<00:01:55.770> ones<00:01:56.040> come<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> pilot<00:01:56.880> map<00:01:57.060> like

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
previous ones come like a pilot map like

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
previous ones come like a pilot map like
seeing<00:01:57.930> whether<00:01:58.049> people<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:58.920> not

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
seeing whether people like it or not

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039 
seeing whether people like it or not
this<00:01:59.549> looks<00:01:59.820> slightly<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.360> wave<00:02:00.630> based

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
this looks slightly more wave based

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.899 
this looks slightly more wave based
rather<00:02:01.380> than<00:02:01.680> objective<00:02:01.890> based<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.700> haven't

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
rather than objective based I haven't

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
rather than objective based I haven't
seen<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.060> drill<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.689> don't<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.290> minute

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
seen a drill I don't think at the minute

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.869 
seen a drill I don't think at the minute
and<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.579> maybe<00:02:06.360> slightly<00:02:06.990> more<00:02:07.290> round<00:02:07.879> wave

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
and so maybe slightly more round wave

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.580 
and so maybe slightly more round wave
based<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.539> something<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:09.989> more<00:02:10.440> like

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
based or something like that more like

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.440 
based or something like that more like
the<00:02:10.709> zombies<00:02:11.039> mode<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.489> guess<00:02:11.940> we'll<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.270> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the zombies mode I guess we'll have to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.309 
the zombies mode I guess we'll have to
wait<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.840> but

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
wait and see but

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.830 
wait and see but
looks<00:02:13.620> like<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.310> wound<00:02:14.489> weapons<00:02:14.939> are<00:02:15.150> back<00:02:15.540> or

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
looks like the wound weapons are back or

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.539 
looks like the wound weapons are back or
for<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.260> first<00:02:16.439> time<00:02:16.650> sort<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.980> say<00:02:17.129> making<00:02:17.430> an

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.280 
for the first time sort of say making an

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290
