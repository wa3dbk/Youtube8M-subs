00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
there's that I do cherry-pick my

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.650 
there's that I do cherry-pick my
gameplays<00:00:28.010> definitely<00:00:29.150> but<00:00:30.150> I'm<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.480> much<00:00:30.630> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
gameplays definitely but I'm not much of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.450 
gameplays definitely but I'm not much of
a<00:00:30.810> sniper<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.349> don't<00:00:31.500> expect<00:00:31.619> me<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.160> do

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
a sniper so don't expect me to do

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.880 
a sniper so don't expect me to do
incredibly<00:00:33.000> well<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.660> mean<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.320> example

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
incredibly well I mean that for example

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
incredibly well I mean that for example
was<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> huge<00:00:35.940> fail<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> should<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.600> just

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
was a huge fail I should have just

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.229 
was a huge fail I should have just
waited<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.860> should<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.219> line<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.790> shots

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
waited and should just line up my shots

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.470 
waited and should just line up my shots
but<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.840> very<00:00:40.579> nervous<00:00:41.579> when<00:00:41.850> people<00:00:42.390> get

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
but I get very nervous when people get

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.209 
but I get very nervous when people get
too<00:00:42.780> close<00:00:43.079> what's<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.500> second<00:00:43.860> shot<00:00:43.890> really

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
too close what's that second shot really

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
too close what's that second shot really
a<00:00:44.309> fail<00:00:44.899> kurudi<00:00:45.899> crap

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
a fail kurudi crap

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
a fail kurudi crap
one<00:00:47.399> thing<00:00:47.610> though<00:00:47.760> I'm<00:00:47.910> playing<00:00:48.030> against

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
one thing though I'm playing against

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.819 
one thing though I'm playing against
pretty<00:00:48.539> low<00:00:48.750> level<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.379> why<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.680> decided

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
pretty low level so that's why I decided

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.069 
pretty low level so that's why I decided
to<00:00:50.160> go<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.840> what<00:00:52.340> was<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> fail<00:00:54.079> no

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to go for the what was that a fail no

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.450 
to go for the what was that a fail no
way<00:00:56.329> it<00:00:57.329> can't<00:00:57.570> proof<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.140> though<00:00:58.460> well

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
way it can't proof there though well

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.479 
way it can't proof there though well
that<00:00:59.579> thing<00:00:59.820> disappear<00:01:00.000> no<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.020> doesn't<00:01:01.440> oh<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
