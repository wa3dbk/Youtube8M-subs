this one is a 3 megapixel camera and
then<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> back<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:45.989> slide

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
then to get the back off you just slide

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.279 
then to get the back off you just slide
it<00:00:46.770> under<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> flag<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:49.020> there's<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it under the flag up and there's the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.920 
it under the flag up and there's the
book<00:00:51.410> we've<00:00:52.410> got<00:00:52.620> our<00:00:52.649> two<00:00:53.340> gigabytes<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.450 

micro<00:00:57.930> sim<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.920> pop<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.430> out

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
micro sim here so you just pop up out

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
micro sim here so you just pop up out
and<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.690> how<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> get

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and like that and that's how you get

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.349 
and like that and that's how you get
into<00:01:01.859> your<00:01:01.920> micro<00:01:02.340> sim<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.730> already<00:01:03.000> kind

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
into your micro sim but I already kind

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
into your micro sim but I already kind
of<00:01:03.420> came<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.140> open<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> box

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of came with it when we open the box

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
of came with it when we open the box
that's<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.159> came<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.869> shut

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that's what came in so you can just shut

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.120 
that's what came in so you can just shut
up<00:01:07.380> there<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> bit<00:01:07.860> fiddly<00:01:09.049> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.979> can

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
up there as a bit fiddly and then we can

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.980 
up there as a bit fiddly and then we can
just<00:01:11.159> slide<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> battery<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
just slide the battery out like that and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.499 
just slide the battery out like that and
then<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> lot<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.580> sim

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
then there's just a lot for you and sim

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.109 
then there's just a lot for you and sim
card<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.090> slide<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
card and then we can just slide that

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.310 
card and then we can just slide that
back<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.630> line<00:01:21.750> up<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:25.049> turn

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
back on line up and that's up so we turn

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.890 
back on line up and that's up so we turn
that<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> unlit<00:01:27.270> enhance<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that on this is the unlit enhance and

you've got you use a guide and then look

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
you've got you use a guide and then look
at<00:02:10.019> startup<00:02:10.530> as<00:02:10.709> our<00:02:11.009> Android<00:02:11.580> device<00:02:11.850> just

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
at startup as our Android device just

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
at startup as our Android device just
slide<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.260> across<00:02:13.800> there<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.400> a

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
slide that across there this is a

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.559 
slide that across there this is a
resistive<00:02:14.940> touchscreen<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.390> it's

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
resistive touchscreen on this so it's

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.050 
resistive touchscreen on this so it's
not<00:02:18.690> quite<00:02:18.959> as<00:02:19.130> receptive<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.430> capacitive

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
not quite as receptive in the capacitive

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.460 
not quite as receptive in the capacitive
touchscreen<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:21.660> it's<00:02:21.810> pretty<00:02:21.930> good<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.380> you

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
touchscreen but it's pretty good as you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.710 
touchscreen but it's pretty good as you
