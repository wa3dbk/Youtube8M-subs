00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
out process where we know what

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.680 
out process where we know what
particular<00:00:44.280> species<00:00:44.639> we<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.359> illustrate

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
particular species we want to illustrate

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.689 
particular species we want to illustrate
where<00:00:46.229> you<00:00:46.319> know<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> plumage<00:00:47.100> isn't<00:00:47.549> like<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
where you know the plumage isn't like a

Juvenal sub-adult
and<00:00:52.229> we<00:00:53.039> want<00:00:53.249> a<00:00:53.489> position<00:00:54.149> opposed<00:00:54.569> where<00:00:55.469> all

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and we want a position opposed where all

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.680 
and we want a position opposed where all
of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> field<00:00:56.850> marks<00:00:57.269> are<00:00:57.479> visible<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:59.629> try<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of the field marks are visible I try to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
of the field marks are visible I try to
block<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.319> some<00:01:01.679> of<00:01:01.799> the<00:01:01.859> major<00:01:02.039> colors<00:01:02.639> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
block in some of the major colors and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.960 
block in some of the major colors and
then<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.659> start<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.920> little<00:01:05.220> refinements

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
then I start to make little refinements

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
then I start to make little refinements
and<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.270> lot<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.630> them<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.140> fairly<00:01:07.830> subtle

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and a lot of them are just fairly subtle

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.650 
and a lot of them are just fairly subtle
refinements<00:01:09.150> might<00:01:10.050> be<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.230> way<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.470> feather

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
refinements might be a way of feather

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.400 
refinements might be a way of feather
lies<00:01:12.660> or<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> fluffiness<00:01:14.000> but<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> try<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> work

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
lies or a fluffiness but I try to work

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.910 
lies or a fluffiness but I try to work
on<00:01:16.680> those<00:01:17.010> small<00:01:17.460> details<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.920> develop

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
on those small details and then develop

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.890 
on those small details and then develop
the<00:01:20.070> color<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.300> that<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> gives<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the color so that it gives a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
the color so that it gives a
three-dimensional<00:01:22.770> quality<00:01:22.980> to<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> bird<00:01:23.910> in

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
three-dimensional quality to the bird in

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.050 
three-dimensional quality to the bird in
my<00:01:24.210> painting<00:01:24.690> that's<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.080> important<00:01:26.060> my

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
my painting that's really important my

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.380 
my painting that's really important my
ideal<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.500> painting<00:01:28.980> should<00:01:29.280> mimic<00:01:29.940> what

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
ideal is the painting should mimic what

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.720 
ideal is the painting should mimic what
a<00:01:30.600> birder<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.620> through<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.490> good

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
a birder would see through a really good

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.610 
a birder would see through a really good
telescope<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.660> really<00:01:33.930> great<00:01:34.200> pair<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
telescope or a really great pair of

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.640 
telescope or a really great pair of
binoculars<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.790> needs<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.120> be<00:01:36.290> crisp<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
binoculars so it needs to be crisp and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.370 
binoculars so it needs to be crisp and
clear<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.430> give<00:01:39.120> a<00:01:39.150> feeling<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.260> you're

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
clear and give a feeling of what you're

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.290 
clear and give a feeling of what you're
gonna<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.890> field<00:01:42.230> as<00:01:43.230> an<00:01:43.590> artist<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.400> as

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
gonna see in the field as an artist I as

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.870 
gonna see in the field as an artist I as
a<00:01:45.360> young<00:01:45.690> man<00:01:45.900> anyway<00:01:46.440> I<00:01:46.470> saw<00:01:46.920> myself<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.670> as

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
a young man anyway I saw myself more as

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
a young man anyway I saw myself more as
a<00:01:47.909> painter<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> modern<00:01:49.140> painter<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.070> never

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.280 
a painter a modern painter and and never
really<00:01:51.409> put<00:01:52.409> myself<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.010> context<00:01:53.700> of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
really put myself in the context of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.930 
really put myself in the context of
illustrating<00:01:55.290> birds<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.010> illustrating

illustration now I'm one of that line of
illustrators<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.320> at<00:02:07.650> something<00:02:08.519> a
