00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.312
Hi! Welcome to Archana's Rasoi.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.313
I am holding a diya in my hands, means it's the onset of Diwali

00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:10.617
And when Diwali is here, that means preparations are on in full swing

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:14.304
Which means sweets for the festival have to be made

00:00:14.518 --> 00:00:17.457
Sweets and savoury such as karanji, ladoo, shankarpara, chakli, chivada...everything

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:21.626
So now it's time to make besan ladoo

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:30.719
Let's have a look at the ingredients for besan ladoo

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:42.936
For 1 large bowl began (chickpea/gram flour), 1/4 cup ghee is required

00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:50.458
If you add little less ghee will also do, 1/2 cup bowl of powdered sugar 

00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:56.753
3-4 tbsp milk, cardamom powder according to requirement and dry fruits such as chopped almonds and pistas are also required. 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.997
You can also use dry fruits such as raisins, charoli, bedana will also do

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.379
Come so let's start making the sweet

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.694
First thing we start with is roasting the besan (chickpea/gram flour)

00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:09.017
For that we will heat ghee

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:33.656
If you have taken 1 large bowl of besan (chickpea/gram flour) or 1kg flour, then 1/4 cup ghee should be used  

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:42.590
Hence, I am heating 1/4 cup ghee as I have 
 taken 1 large bowl of besan (chickpea/gram flour)

00:01:44.047 --> 00:01:46.680
Approximately 1/4 cup ghee

00:01:50.493 --> 00:02:12.190
Once the ghee is well heated, remember, to use coarsely ground besan (chickpea or gram flour) and not fine grained flour

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:20.400
Now that the ghee is heated, add 1 large bowl of besan (chickpea/gram flour)

00:02:26.264 --> 00:02:30.020
Now ensure that you mix it and roast it well

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:37.620
We must roast the flour very well, because it is difficult to gauge how much time will be required to roast it

00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:46.180
However, once the flour turns brownish (almond coloured) till then we must continue to roast it on a slow flame.   

00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:51.590
If roasting the flour on a high flame, remember, to constantly stir it otherwise it could get stuck to the bottom of the vessel

00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:54.310
And it also tends to release a burnt smell

00:03:06.148 --> 00:03:09.430
Now that the flour has turned brown, turn off the gas

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.040
Now it's time to add 3-4 tbsp of milk

00:03:25.562 --> 00:03:29.040
So here I have added milk, but do 
 you know why I have added it?

00:03:29.277 --> 00:03:35.280
Adding milk makes the flour rise and this ensures that it gives a smooth texture to the ladoo and doesn't hurt the throat 

00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:39.130
I am also sure that many of you'll must be 
 thinking that by adding milk will the ladoo last?

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:42.420
But you'll do not have to worry because the ladoo will last for almost a month, nothing will happen to them 

00:03:42.986 --> 00:03:51.400
Now will let the flour cool down for a couple of 
 minutes and then add the rest of the ingredients

00:03:54.748 --> 00:04:00.890
Now that the flour has soaked in the milk 
 well, its also got a nice almond color

00:04:01.342 --> 00:04:08.380
Let's cool the mixture either in a bowl or a plate

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:10.230
Transfer the mixture to a bowl, which I am using here

00:04:16.902 --> 00:04:19.970
Now that the mixture has cooled, I will 
 add 1/2 cup powdered sugar  

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.200
Here, I would like to share that, when using sugar, use powdered sugar such that the grains are coarse and not fine 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.650
The same way we took coarse besan (chickpea/gram flour) 
 similarly use coarsely ground powdered sugar 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.130
So let's add powdered sugar now

00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:44.030
Add cardamom powder according to requirement 

00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:51.010
After that it's time to add dry fruits to 
 the mixture and keep some for garnish later

00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:55.460
Now mix all the ingredients well 

00:04:56.115 --> 00:05:02.940
So in this we added powdered sugar, cardamom powder, chopped almonds and pistas, we can start making the ladoos  

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.140
Now let's make the ladoos

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.870
Some like it more sweet, in that case you can 
 more sugar approximately 2-3 more spoons of sugar 

00:05:09.547 --> 00:05:27.690
Thus, to ensure the ladoo is smooth in texture, 
 use coarse grains of began (chickpea/gram flour)

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:41.220
The second thing to remember is to add milk once the flour has been roasted and turned into an almond color 

00:05:41.488 --> 00:05:50.540
And the third thing to remember is, use coarsely ground powdered sugar and now I am going to start making the ladoos

00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:57.190
Now let's see that by using 1 large bowl of 
 besan (chickpea/gram flour) how many ladoos do I get?

00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:59.590
And now I am going to start making the ladoos

00:06:00.247 --> 00:06:02.870
I am taking a plate 

00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:23.600
The ladoos are made, so how many ladoos have I 
 got by using 150g of besan (chickpea/gram flour)? 

00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:37.800
So I have got around 8 ladoos

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.870
Now we will decorate the ladoos

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:47.070
I will put the finely chopped almonds and 
 pistas on top of the ladoos 

00:06:49.824 --> 00:06:54.910
The ladoo also looks very pretty once its garnished with chopped almonds and pistas

00:06:55.653 --> 00:07:01.320
You can also use other dry fruits such as raisins, bedana, charoli 

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:03.950
So the besan ladoos are ready

00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:09.360
And now I am sure no one has doubts about how to make ladoos or how much ghee to add, I have given you all the measurements 

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:25.050
For 1kg of besan (chickpea/gram flour) use 1/4 cup ghee, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup powdered sugar and cardamom powder according to taste and requirement   

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.250
