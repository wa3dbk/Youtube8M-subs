00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
into the formulas for you guys so first

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.670 
into the formulas for you guys so first
things<00:01:11.520> first<00:01:11.580> you're<00:01:11.909> gonna<00:01:11.970> need<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.540> of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
things first you're gonna need a lot of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
things first you're gonna need a lot of
chlorophyll<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.640> seeds<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
chlorophyll so you just use seeds to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.069 
chlorophyll so you just use seeds to
create<00:01:16.079> that<00:01:16.549> now<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
create that now this is just to make a

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.800 
create that now this is just to make a
snow<00:01:19.770> pod<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.759> regular<00:01:21.060> pea<00:01:21.240> pod<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.630> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
snow pod and a regular pea pod you just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
snow pod and a regular pea pod you just
use<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.229> formulas<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
use these formulas and this is what you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.660 
use these formulas and this is what you
use<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.720> hit<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> zombies<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.920> you're

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
use to hit the zombies with and you're

purchase your seeds with your sunlight
and<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:41.940> take<00:01:42.120> a<00:01:42.270> chlorophyll<00:01:42.840> put<00:01:43.080> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and you just take a chlorophyll put a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.740 
and you just take a chlorophyll put a
chest<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> middle<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.250> you'll<00:01:44.370> get<00:01:44.520> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
from a bowl of chlorophyll you constable

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.289 
from a bowl of chlorophyll you constable
of<00:02:12.900> chlorophyll<00:02:13.530> by<00:02:13.680> using<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.730> chlorophylls

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
of chlorophyll by using for chlorophylls

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.080 
of chlorophyll by using for chlorophylls
and<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.989> regular<00:02:16.439> Bowl<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.129> middle<00:02:17.400> alright

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
could make them grow faster in each

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.710 
could make them grow faster in each
plant<00:03:16.409> to<00:03:16.590> fully<00:03:16.799> grow<00:03:17.159> would<00:03:17.939> require<00:03:18.329> about

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
plant to fully grow would require about

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.190 
plant to fully grow would require about
to<00:03:19.139> bone<00:03:19.409> meals<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:20.760> let<00:03:21.000> me<00:03:21.120> get<00:03:21.329> repeater

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
to bone meals so let me get repeater

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.830 
to bone meals so let me get repeater
seeds<00:03:22.700> let<00:03:23.700> these<00:03:23.939> real<00:03:24.150> quick<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.599> then<00:03:24.689> let

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
seeds let these real quick and then let

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.569 
seeds let these real quick and then let
me<00:03:24.930> get<00:03:25.079> my<00:03:25.200> bone<00:03:25.470> meal<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.129> I<00:03:26.189> could<00:03:26.340> show<00:03:26.519> you

me get my bone meal so I could show you

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.030 
me get my bone meal so I could show you
guys<00:03:26.849> they'll<00:03:27.659> take<00:03:27.870> about<00:03:28.019> two<00:03:28.590> each<00:03:28.799> and

its endowed grass and I'll just do this

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.809 
its endowed grass and I'll just do this
for<00:04:08.790> example<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:09.629> any<00:04:10.400> plant<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.609> have

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
so this mod adds in two different kinds

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.379 
so this mod adds in two different kinds
of<00:04:19.079> zombies<00:04:19.139> we<00:04:19.799> have<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.280> flag<00:04:20.579> zombie<00:04:21.150> and

the<00:04:21.930> more<00:04:22.139> dangerous<00:04:22.680> football's<00:04:23.220> on<00:04:23.460> me<00:04:23.610> the

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
the more dangerous football's on me the

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.060 
the more dangerous football's on me the

prevents them from taking damage in the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.510 
prevents them from taking damage in the
