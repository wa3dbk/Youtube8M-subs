to the Zoysia we have more it's it's a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.910 
to the Zoysia we have more it's it's a
lot<00:00:38.489> greener<00:00:38.670> than<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> Bermuda<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
lot greener than then the Bermuda is and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
lot greener than then the Bermuda is and
some<00:00:41.550> people<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.120> voices<00:00:42.809> are

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
some people think that voices are

don't<00:00:44.940> come<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.390> dormancy<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.899> fast<00:00:46.170> as

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
don't come out of dormancy as fast as

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.720 
don't come out of dormancy as fast as
Bermuda<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.489> would<00:00:47.579> say<00:00:48.770> sometimes<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
Bermuda and I would say sometimes it

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.200 
Bermuda and I would say sometimes it
depends<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> type<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> Zoysia<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.210> also

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
depends on the type of Zoysia and also

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090 
depends on the type of Zoysia and also
how<00:00:54.449> much<00:00:54.629> fertilizer<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.980> how

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
how much fertilizer is out there and how

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.770 
how much fertilizer is out there and how
you<00:00:56.160> guys<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.550> mowing<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.910> taking<00:00:57.329> care<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.539> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you guys are mowing it taking care of it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
you guys are mowing it taking care of it

up to the side here and we have a little

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.140 
up to the side here and we have a little
bit<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.590> barrier<00:01:10.590> between<00:01:10.770> lawns<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.640> they

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
bit of a barrier between lawns here they

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.719 
bit of a barrier between lawns here they
have<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.450> drain<00:01:12.869> put<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.549> see

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
have a little drain put in here you see

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
have a little drain put in here you see
the<00:01:14.880> French<00:01:15.570> drain<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.110> was<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.799> but

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the French drain that was put in so but

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.560 
the French drain that was put in so but
it's<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.460> great<00:01:17.670> barrier<00:01:18.090> between<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.540> two

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
it's a great barrier between the two

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.170 
it's a great barrier between the two
lawns<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.220> look<00:01:20.400> incredibly

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
lawns now they don't look incredibly

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.920 
lawns now they don't look incredibly
different<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.799> were<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.549> had<00:01:23.820> maybe<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
different so if I were if I had maybe a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
different so if I were if I had maybe a
half<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.380> lawn<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.830> shaded<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.460> half<00:01:26.670> a
