that<00:01:34.700> way<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:38.120> intercooler<00:01:38.570> doesn't

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
that way the the intercooler doesn't

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.510 
that way the the intercooler doesn't
take<00:01:39.050> on<00:01:40.360> doesn't<00:01:41.360> take<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:42.010> power<00:01:43.010> from<00:01:43.190> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
take on doesn't take the power from the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.550 
take on doesn't take the power from the
ps3<00:01:45.880> instead<00:01:46.880> of<00:01:47.270> getting<00:01:47.870> power<00:01:48.080> for<00:01:48.290> ps3

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
ps3 instead of getting power for ps3

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.360 
ps3 instead of getting power for ps3
it's<00:01:49.040> getting<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.370> proof<00:01:49.580> of<00:01:49.730> this<00:01:49.940> thing<00:01:50.210> and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
it's getting the proof of this thing and

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.020 
it's getting the proof of this thing and
we'll<00:01:52.370> speed<00:01:52.640> well<00:01:52.910> but<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:55.310> off<00:01:55.580> looks

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
we'll speed well but this off looks

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.170 
we'll speed well but this off looks
really<00:01:56.570> good<00:01:56.690> so<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:01.220> then<00:02:01.370> just<00:02:01.550> liked<00:02:01.790> it<00:02:02.030> up

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
really good so and then just liked it up

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.490 
really good so and then just liked it up
a<00:02:02.210> little<00:02:02.870> hole<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.320> if<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.560> put<00:02:03.740> on<00:02:03.890> table

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
a little hole so if you put on table

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.340 
a little hole so if you put on table
right<00:02:06.500> here<00:02:07.720> that's<00:02:08.720> just<00:02:09.020> like<00:02:10.000> right<00:02:11.000> there

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
right here that's just like right there

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.040 
right here that's just like right there
don't<00:02:12.350> hold<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.620> back<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:14.270> which<00:02:14.510> is

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
don't hold it back and this which is

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.880 
don't hold it back and this which is
useless<00:02:15.650> now<00:02:15.680> what<00:02:17.080> may<00:02:18.080> be<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.320> future<00:02:18.500> can

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890
