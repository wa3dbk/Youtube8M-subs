00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.850
 from kid I always liked inclusive 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.960
 my first team car when I had 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.120
 18 years 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.700
 so we'll come change only 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 now changed practically took us is 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.850
 Child we gave some toys. 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.920
 buggy grandparents mothers give time 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.930
 It happened and now I have this 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.710
 530 horse toy for the 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.710
 people have fun 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.700
 [Music] 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.700
 the at 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.240
 [Music] 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:58.520
 the rubbish 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:01:01.520
 [Music] 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 not 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.930
 [Music] 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 [Applause] 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:44.819
 good guys 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.799
 now I will explain the result of the 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.119
 the goal of jailson 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.439
 We do not know how a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.020
 right hand dynamometer 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.679
 I only heard money going back and forth. 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.799
 come on 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.920
 this one in question is worth the coach 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.770
 we have two power graphs on the wheel 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.899
 power in the lost power motor 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.539
 when we did the measurement he should 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.409
 power on the wheel the boot until determined 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.629
 acceleration 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.200
 wait for him to do the pen calculation then 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.640
 independent of tire wheel size 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.860
 width ratio does not matter 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.269
 that when you calibrate the car you 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.370
 will calibrate the engine 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.980
 relationship you are going to measure 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:31.319
 in this issue the issue came 530 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:39.630
 horses on the engine at 5725 rpm and five hundred 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:45.030
 and 6.07 in the wheel at 5,450 rpm torque torque 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.959
 maximum of the crankshaft here we have 58 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.530
 kilos 58 kilos of torque to 6 thousand 480 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.260
 rpm 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
 basically it was a man out there has other 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.400
 functions that we can be 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.950
 using networks 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.419
 of rotation in the gear shift and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.139
 many other things more speed 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.079
 Last 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.160
 the acceleration from 0 to 100 and so it has 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.519
 various measurements 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.750
 finishing the goal of Mr. jailso 530 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.800
 horses on the engine 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:26.970
 ok ok mon 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:29.970

 [Music] 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.680
 is 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.060
 is the following people the toy 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.579
 responsibility therein must be 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.260
 aware of what you have in hand is the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.060
 dangerous toy you can not accelerate 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.000
 anywhere has adequate space 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.690
 for this to avoid an accident on the street 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.460
 huh 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.860
 and that's what we're trying to encourage 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.900
 stop it with these street thinks 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.330
 ended up with this mess because that 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.550
 has been harming us and for this has 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.800
 using the pole has the clues there that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.130
 we had fun having fun with 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.350
 security with a great deal of responsibility 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.310
 It's and who you like, this is it, it has to be 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:54.039
 this way the street is a car 29 né madre 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.039
 her forged has 11 head had done 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.520
 in 1970 it is with this great 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.919
 the technician if the control has the co2 is that 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.340
 is a system that makes pressure 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.630
 of the turbine was faster, it is not a 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.919
 car that took a little bit to be 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.530
 voted 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.940
 So the guy is starting now and maybe 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.970
 already having a little difficulty 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.870
 still make the car develop but it is a 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.180
 good car but it's an excellent car has 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.099
 a legal power for what he has is a 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.010
 car in view that we can see that 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.200
 has a blow of equipment and has no 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.880
 a result that is the only time wanted only 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.400
 To thank you, my mechanic is that the 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.530
 tarcísio is that it has helped a lot and the 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.750
 main has been patient with me, huh? 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.000
 but he is a nice guy and I want 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.099
 thank you for turkey today by car 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.280
 is today how is it we should 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.280
 he 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:10.120
 shorts tight the boot afraid to walk 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.870
 Even the owner can not accelerate hi tv.
