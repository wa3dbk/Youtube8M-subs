00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
thousands of themes available but I

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.240 
thousands of themes available but I
always<00:00:21.960> tend<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.320> find<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.710> pick<00:00:22.890> well<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> think

always tend to find I pick well I think

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.040 
always tend to find I pick well I think
I<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.850> liked<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:25.019> I

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I really liked that one and then I

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.830 
I really liked that one and then I
realized<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.710> know<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:26.330> it<00:00:27.330> won't<00:00:27.510> let<00:00:27.689> me

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
realized you know what it won't let me

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.210 
realized you know what it won't let me
change<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> sidebar<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.859> other<00:00:28.980> side

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
change the sidebar to the other side

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
change the sidebar to the other side
it's<00:00:29.580> got<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> wrong<00:00:30.300> number<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.630> columns<00:00:31.109> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it's got the wrong number of columns but

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.950 
it's got the wrong number of columns but
it<00:00:31.439> won't<00:00:31.560> let<00:00:31.710> me<00:00:31.800> change<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.600> actually<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
it won't let me change it or actually it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.720 
it won't let me change it or actually it
won't<00:00:34.230> let<00:00:34.410> me<00:00:34.500> change<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> back<00:00:35.040> background

image and I find that very frustrating

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.410 
image and I find that very frustrating
because<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.579> things<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> bit<00:00:39.300> more

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
because I like things to be a bit more

so you go to suggest header and it will

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.059 
so you go to suggest header and it will
bring<00:03:16.630> up<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:17.019> different<00:03:17.440> header<00:03:17.680> for<00:03:17.919> you

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
bring up a different header for you

there we go so that how easy was that

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.089 
there we go so that how easy was that
BAM<00:03:21.430> new<00:03:21.730> header<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:23.049> can<00:03:23.410> suggest<00:03:23.859> a

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
BAM new header you can suggest a

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.530 
BAM new header you can suggest a

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
get the columns and say for example you

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.110 
get the columns and say for example you
wanted<00:04:31.130> you're<00:04:31.400> looking<00:04:31.700> at<00:04:31.790> this<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.060> know

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
wanted you're looking at this you know

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.670 
wanted you're looking at this you know
what<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.330> know<00:04:32.450> what<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.840> don't<00:04:33.169> want<00:04:33.320> that<00:04:33.440> bit

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
what you know what I don't want that bit

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.190 
what you know what I don't want that bit
that's<00:04:34.280> all<00:04:34.370> right<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:35.000> click<00:04:35.270> delete<00:04:35.690> block

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
that's all right you click delete block

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.930 
that's all right you click delete block
and<00:04:36.500> it's<00:04:37.490> gone

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
and it's gone

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.810 
and it's gone
so<00:04:38.600> as<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.900> can<00:04:39.080> see<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:39.710> quite<00:04:39.919> easy<00:04:40.340> to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
so as you can see it's quite easy to

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.230 
so as you can see it's quite easy to
change<00:04:41.210> all<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.780> different<00:04:42.080> aspects<00:04:42.560> of<00:04:43.240> your

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
change all the different aspects of your

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.930 
change all the different aspects of your
site<00:04:44.570> which<00:04:44.750> you're<00:04:44.900> designing<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:46.610> one<00:04:46.729> I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
site which you're designing the one I

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.490 
site which you're designing the one I
quite<00:04:47.240> like<00:04:47.419> which<00:04:47.960> I'm<00:04:48.080> not<00:04:48.169> going<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.350> show

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
quite like which I'm not going to show

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.170 
quite like which I'm not going to show
because<00:04:48.590> probit<00:04:49.010> let<00:04:49.220> big<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.760> bit<00:04:49.910> slow

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
because probit let big and bit slow

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.760 
because probit let big and bit slow
while<00:04:50.419> and<00:04:50.600> Vidia<00:04:50.900> where<00:04:51.139> I'm<00:04:51.260> recording<00:04:51.680> this

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
while and Vidia where I'm recording this

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.440 
while and Vidia where I'm recording this
video<00:04:51.950> but<00:04:52.850> I've<00:04:53.600> been<00:04:54.910> inserting<00:04:55.910> an<00:04:56.060> image

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
video but I've been inserting an image

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.560 
video but I've been inserting an image
as<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.690> header<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.380> then<00:04:58.100> getting<00:04:58.510> using<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
as a header and then getting using the

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.390 
as a header and then getting using the
suggests<00:05:00.110> colors<00:05:01.540> option<00:05:02.540> to<00:05:03.229> get<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:04.190> rest

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
suggests colors option to get the rest

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.580 
suggests colors option to get the rest
the<00:05:04.610> site<00:05:04.790> to<00:05:05.030> match<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.389> header<00:05:05.600> which<00:05:06.320> makes

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
the site to match the header which makes

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.930 
the site to match the header which makes
life<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.100> much<00:05:07.130> quicker<00:05:07.490> because<00:05:07.790> if<00:05:07.850> you

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
life so much quicker because if you

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.580 
life so much quicker because if you
think<00:05:08.090> about<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.600> you're<00:05:09.110> not<00:05:09.229> having<00:05:09.500> to

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
think about it you're not having to

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.230 
think about it you're not having to
worry<00:05:09.800> about<00:05:09.889> trying<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.490> figure<00:05:10.789> out<00:05:10.820> which

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
worry about trying to figure out which

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.390 
worry about trying to figure out which
colors<00:05:11.660> match<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.169> colors<00:05:12.470> in<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.710> image<00:05:12.740> it

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
colors match the colors in the image it

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.219 
colors match the colors in the image it
will<00:05:13.610> do<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.760> all<00:05:13.880> for<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:14.120> really<00:05:14.810> really
