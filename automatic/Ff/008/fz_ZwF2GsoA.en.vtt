00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
okay because the concept of the game is

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.490 
okay because the concept of the game is
to<00:02:24.360> slide<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.980> move<00:02:26.660> your<00:02:27.660> path<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
to slide and to move your path and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.430 
to slide and to move your path and
here's<00:02:30.350> these<00:02:31.350> guys<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:32.130> colorful<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:33.440> then

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
here's these guys look colorful and then

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.830 
here's these guys look colorful and then
you<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:34.740> each<00:02:34.890> flag<00:02:35.340> point<00:02:35.790> your<00:02:36.660> little

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
you see each flag point your little

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.720 
you see each flag point your little
character<00:02:37.410> let's<00:02:37.680> pull<00:02:37.860> out<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.160> yellow<00:02:40.730> come

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
character let's pull out the yellow come

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.970 
character let's pull out the yellow come
on<00:02:41.880> yellow<00:02:44.750> okay<00:02:45.750> cameras<00:02:46.200> don't<00:02:46.320> focus<00:02:46.800> when

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
on yellow okay cameras don't focus when

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.560 
on yellow okay cameras don't focus when
everything<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.730> background<00:02:47.940> okay<00:02:50.570> so

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
everything is in the background okay so

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.470 
everything is in the background okay so
can't<00:02:51.900> focus<00:02:52.140> much<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:53.090> let's<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.300> look

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
can't focus much on that let's just look

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.770 
can't focus much on that let's just look
down<00:02:54.720> here<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.940> refocus<00:02:56.940> down<00:02:57.330> here

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
down here and we can refocus down here

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.000 
down here and we can refocus down here
better<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.239> little<00:03:01.010> what

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
better so you have this little what

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
better so you have this little what
looks<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.370> kitty<00:03:02.700> cat<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:04.410> then<00:03:05.100> some

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
looks like a kitty cat and then some

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.210 
looks like a kitty cat and then some
more<00:03:06.209> character<00:03:06.630> pieces<00:03:07.350> now<00:03:07.560> how<00:03:07.830> they<00:03:08.040> play

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
more character pieces now how they play

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.060 
more character pieces now how they play
into<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.550> game<00:03:09.050> haven't<00:03:10.050> really<00:03:10.320> explored

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
into the game haven't really explored

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.520 
into the game haven't really explored
that<00:03:11.220> much<00:03:11.660> there's<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.900> lot<00:03:13.110> going<00:03:13.140> on

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
that much there's just a lot going on

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.979 
that much there's just a lot going on
here<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.790> Lego<00:03:15.090> set<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:15.570> you<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
here it is a Lego set so you have to

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.890 
here it is a Lego set so you have to
build<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.470> first<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.950> play<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.549> then<00:03:18.540> as<00:03:18.750> we

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
build it first to play it and then as we

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.890 
build it first to play it and then as we
said<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.680> kind<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.190> evolves<00:03:21.000> with<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.630> die

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
said it kind of evolves with this die

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.210 
said it kind of evolves with this die
because<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.320> can<00:03:22.440> change<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.829> die<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.070> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
because you can change the die in the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.560 
because you can change the die in the
games<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.549> little<00:03:23.790> different<00:03:24.090> every<00:03:24.150> time<00:03:24.390> what

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
games a little different every time what

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.199 
games a little different every time what
they<00:03:24.660> did<00:03:24.840> suggest<00:03:25.320> was<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.150> you

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
they did suggest was that you know you

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.350 
they did suggest was that you know you
remember<00:03:27.630> which<00:03:28.430> setup<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.579> had<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.150> if<00:03:30.269> you

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
remember which setup you had so if you

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.940 
remember which setup you had so if you
like<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> way<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.019> game<00:03:31.200> play<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.500> can<00:03:31.739> play

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
like the way that game play you can play

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.130 
like the way that game play you can play
it<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.450> there<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.780> go

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
it that way so there you go

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:45.350 
it that way so there you go
it's<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.650> Harry<00:03:35.640> Potter<00:03:35.810> Hogwarts<00:03:37.010> Lego<00:03:38.010> game

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.780 

okay<00:03:46.140> we're<00:03:46.350> back<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.920> we<00:03:47.430> thought<00:03:47.640> the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
okay we're back I know we thought the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.100 
okay we're back I know we thought the
video<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.120> over<00:03:48.300> but<00:03:48.540> it's<00:03:48.690> not

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
video is over but it's not

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.270 
video is over but it's not
we<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.680> wanted<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.920> give<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.160> little

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
we just wanted to give you a little

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.950 
we just wanted to give you a little
break<00:03:50.580> away<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.880> little<00:03:51.180> character<00:03:51.720> pieces

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
break away the little character pieces

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.770 
break away the little character pieces
so<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:52.410> see<00:03:52.590> them<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.800> little<00:03:53.100> better

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
so you can see them a little better

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.800 
so you can see them a little better
again<00:03:54.780> here's<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.050> dye<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:59.000> it's<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.180> it's<00:04:00.660> got

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
again here's the dye and it's a it's got

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.870 
again here's the dye and it's a it's got
our<00:04:00.960> routed<00:04:01.350> properly<00:04:01.500> sides<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.580> it

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
our routed properly sides to it

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.650 
our routed properly sides to it
so<00:04:03.330> these<00:04:03.480> inner<00:04:03.660> pieces<00:04:03.960> do<00:04:04.290> move<00:04:04.560> out<00:04:05.660> and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
so these inner pieces do move out and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.410 
so these inner pieces do move out and
maybe<00:04:06.900> here's<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.230> better<00:04:07.380> shot<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.770> that<00:04:07.830> cat

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
maybe here's a better shot of that cat

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.970 
maybe here's a better shot of that cat
let's<00:04:09.420> see<00:04:09.600> if<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:09.750> can<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:10.020> zoom<00:04:10.260> in<00:04:10.470> just<00:04:10.680> a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
let's see if we can just zoom in just a

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.449 
let's see if we can just zoom in just a
little<00:04:11.220> on<00:04:11.310> some<00:04:11.580> of<00:04:11.700> these<00:04:11.790> people<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.280> there

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
little on some of these people so there

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.200 
little on some of these people so there
you<00:04:17.549> go<00:04:17.730> you<00:04:17.790> get<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.060> nice<00:04:18.239> close<00:04:18.750> shot<00:04:23.210> so

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
you go you get a nice close shot so

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.460 
you go you get a nice close shot so
that's<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.630> just<00:04:24.990> wanted<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.260> give<00:04:25.350> you<00:04:25.440> a
