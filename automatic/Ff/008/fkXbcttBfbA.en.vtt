00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
obviously performance if you set this as

obviously performance if you set this as

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
your games governor the CPU will be

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.950 
your games governor the CPU will be
fully<00:02:02.549> ramped<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.030> as<00:02:03.210> soon<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> start

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
fully ramped up as soon as you start

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
fully ramped up as soon as you start
playing<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> game<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.890> once<00:02:05.520> you've<00:02:05.670> made<00:02:05.700> all

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
playing the game so once you've made all

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
playing the game so once you've made all
your<00:02:05.939> changes<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.630> back<00:02:06.869> out<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
your changes just back out and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.990 
your changes just back out and
everything<00:02:07.680> will<00:02:07.799> already<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.250> effect<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
everything will already be in effect of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.119 
everything will already be in effect of
course<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.780> add<00:02:09.899> more<00:02:09.929> games<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.649> apps<00:02:10.860> by

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
course you can add more games in apps by

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.250 
course you can add more games in apps by
repeating<00:02:11.550> these<00:02:11.640> same<00:02:11.879> steps<00:02:12.209> but<00:02:12.569> yeah<00:02:13.140> be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
repeating these same steps but yeah be

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.880 
repeating these same steps but yeah be
