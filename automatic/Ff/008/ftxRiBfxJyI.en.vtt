00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
maybe i'll switch into talonflame

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.879 
maybe i'll switch into talonflame
thinking<00:03:03.959> that'll<00:03:04.200> go<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> earthquake

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
thinking that'll go for the earthquake

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.990 
thinking that'll go for the earthquake
but<00:03:05.160> who<00:03:05.400> knows<00:03:05.750> okay<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:06.810> here's<00:03:07.590> Talon<00:03:08.040> Talon

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
but who knows okay so here's Talon Talon

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.620 
but who knows okay so here's Talon Talon
here's<00:03:09.480> Mamoswine<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.349> Icicle<00:03:10.739> crash

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
here's Mamoswine of the Icicle crash

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.809 
here's Mamoswine of the Icicle crash
hopefully<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.660> don't<00:03:13.049> miss<00:03:13.709> now<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.280> doubt<00:03:14.549> okay

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
hopefully I don't miss now I doubt okay

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.309 
hopefully I don't miss now I doubt okay
so<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.090> i<00:03:15.269> don't<00:03:15.480> think<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.900> crit<00:03:16.079> really

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
so that i don't think the crit really

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.670 
so that i don't think the crit really
mattered<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:16.859> there<00:03:17.130> goes<00:03:17.340> his<00:03:17.549> roserade<00:03:18.680> now

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
mattered but there goes his roserade now

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.409 
mattered but there goes his roserade now
he<00:03:19.769> brings<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.190> his<00:03:20.280> sizzle<00:03:20.700> I'll<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.359> the

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
he brings out his sizzle I'll go for the

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.860 
he brings out his sizzle I'll go for the
equate<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.910> don't<00:03:23.910> think<00:03:24.269> that'll<00:03:24.540> take<00:03:24.720> him

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
equate I don't think that'll take him

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
equate I don't think that'll take him
out<00:03:24.989> unless<00:03:25.349> he<00:03:25.500> has<00:03:25.709> speed<00:03:26.459> speed<00:03:27.360> ESA's<00:03:27.659> or

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
out unless he has speed speed ESA's or

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.230 
out unless he has speed speed ESA's or
who<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.950> lived<00:03:29.459> okay<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.299> was<00:03:30.450> perfect

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
who I lived okay that was perfect

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.540 
who I lived okay that was perfect
for<00:03:31.420> us<00:03:31.540> hopefully<00:03:32.530> quake<00:03:32.980> he<00:03:33.190> lives<00:03:33.460> with

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
for us hopefully quake he lives with

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.150 
for us hopefully quake he lives with
three<00:03:33.970> percent<00:03:34.450> but<00:03:34.780> unless<00:03:35.170> he<00:03:35.830> more<00:03:36.130> than

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
three percent but unless he more than

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.130 
three percent but unless he more than
likely<00:03:36.340> has<00:03:36.700> bullet<00:03:36.880> punch<00:03:37.180> though<00:03:37.510> unless

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
likely has bullet punch though unless

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140 
likely has bullet punch though unless
he's<00:03:38.320> choice<00:03:38.590> tin<00:03:38.830> okay<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.430> went<00:03:39.850> for<00:03:40.000> ice

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
he's choice tin okay I went for ice

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.210 
he's choice tin okay I went for ice
shard<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.600> took<00:03:40.660> him<00:03:40.900> out<00:03:41.020> so<00:03:41.860> there<00:03:42.010> goes

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
shard and I took him out so there goes

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.910 
shard and I took him out so there goes
his<00:03:42.430> scizor<00:03:42.970> let's<00:03:43.930> see<00:03:44.140> what<00:03:44.290> he<00:03:44.440> brings<00:03:44.470> out

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
his scizor let's see what he brings out

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.480 
his scizor let's see what he brings out
next<00:03:45.520> okay<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.180> here's<00:03:46.600> his<00:03:46.810> talonflame<00:03:47.490> I'll

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
next okay so here's his talonflame I'll

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.430 
next okay so here's his talonflame I'll
go<00:03:48.730> for<00:03:48.880> stone<00:03:49.180> edge<00:03:49.330> but<00:03:49.570> is<00:03:49.900> more<00:03:50.260> than

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
go for stone edge but is more than

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.040 
go for stone edge but is more than
likely<00:03:50.680> gonna<00:03:51.010> take<00:03:51.340> me<00:03:52.000> out<00:03:52.030> yeah<00:03:52.630> there's

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
likely gonna take me out yeah there's
