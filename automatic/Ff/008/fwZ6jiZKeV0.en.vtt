00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.233
 This is a brand new global map. 

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:15.633
 This is a huge game area where the various guilds struggle to fight for global hegemony and gold coins, which is a turn-based strategic model. 

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.900
 There are now more territories and it is easier to land on the map. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.567
 Earn influence, buy divisional forces, occupy new territories, and step by step toward victory. 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.167
 The global map has undergone major changes. 

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:38.767
 Players can learn all the interface elements and nuances of the game from the "Description" message. 

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:43.467
 Now, even without a high-level chariot guild, you can fight on a global map. 

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:47.533
 The sixth, eighth and tenth battles have fronts. 

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:51.567
 Fronts are groups of territories that share the same economic environment. 

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:57.233
 They are equivalent to general armored divisions, warrior armored divisions and up to armored divisions in base battles. 

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:04.200
 A new currency – influence – has been introduced in the global map model. 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.800
 Players can earn influence in two ways: destroying enemy forces on the map and participating in base battles. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.833
 Players cannot earn influence in base battles. 

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:20.033
 Players can accumulate unlimited impact and can be used for long-term planning. 

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:24.000
 New changes also affect how you map your map. 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.867
 Now, in addition to the normal landing method, players can also participate in the auction and then land in the selected territory. 

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:36.133
 To do this, the guild must participate in the landing auction. The highest bidder wins. 

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:41.000
 Players who do not have the target will get back the funds and the winner can land in the territory. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.933
 If the territory is attacked by land, the auction winner will fight other challengers in accordance with the rules of the game. 

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:54.900
 In addition to the common battle chips associated with the number of guild players, there are now divisions. 

00:01:55.033 --> 00:02:01.867
 The division is a fully equipped combat unit that is not affected by the number of guilds and is mainly used to occupy the territory. 

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:08.167
 They cannot be preserved or related to a territory. Only one division can be placed in each territory. 

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:10.867
 And only one transfer per turn. 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.133
 The status is displayed on the map based on the action the player has assigned to the division. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.400
 In addition, each division has three enhancements that can be divided into two types: strategic and combat. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.867
 The strategic enhancement road has: "Aerial Reconnaissance Team" can expand the field of vision of the division; 

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:33.033
 The Chemical Defense Camp protects players from being scouted by enemies. 

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:39.233
 The combat augmentation track has: "Bomber Team" allows the player to launch an air raid that is suitable for the parameters of the front line; 

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:43.767
 The "Artillery Battalion" allows players to launch artillery attacks. 

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:48.000
 We plan to improve the enhancements and increase the number in the future. 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.933
 To buy a division, the player needs to establish a headquarters on a territory. 

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:57.900
 The territory then began to generate income, and the income was affected by the ELO level of the guild. 

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:01.600
 The more battles a guild member wins, the higher the income. 

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:04.700
 Therefore, the guild can increase the income of the Territory. 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.133
 this is very simple. 

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:11.833
 Finally, the game will have regular seasons, they have time constraints and different conditions. 

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:16.300
 In each season, each front will host a variety of game activities. 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.533
 Winning in the event allows players to get a variety of rewards. 

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.667
 This is a strong and fun game mode. 

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:27.467
