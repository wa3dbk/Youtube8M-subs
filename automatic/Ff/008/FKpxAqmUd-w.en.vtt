00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.059
 you are dead 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.290
 that is impossible 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.580
 you are a human my name is jÃ¶rg 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.130
 I have been with for two years 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 not spoken to any other people 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.490
 Hello 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 That's the beginning of one 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.240
 love story 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.130
 nothing unusual 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.540
 apart from a fact we 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.620
 are in the future 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.070
 Humanity is as good as 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.070
 extinct 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.720
 were from a different species 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.610
 attack ours 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.590
 deleted to use our bodies 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.170
 but some of us are still 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.620
 struck back 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.620
 maxi way 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.870
 came with alina 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.080
 almost all bones are broken 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.080
 the organs are torn 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.900
 she desperately wants to live on human 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.760
 you have to get used to the body first 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.190
 they are not like the others we are 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.950
 So far your emotions have been used 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.200
 strong if your will along with yours 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.700
 survived memories is her 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.700
 inner resistance afford 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.720
 this is not a human 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.910
 We stop helping people 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 I miss everything about her I do everything around 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.600
 to get her back 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.600
 I have to know is that even more
