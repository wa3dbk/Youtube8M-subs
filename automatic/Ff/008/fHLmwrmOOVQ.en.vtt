we'll take it one movie at a time that's

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.360 
we'll take it one movie at a time that's
the<00:04:49.780> bad<00:04:50.020> approach<00:04:50.350> because<00:04:50.950> it's<00:04:51.160> going<00:04:51.250> to

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
the bad approach because it's going to

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.420 
the bad approach because it's going to
take<00:04:51.490> too<00:04:51.640> long<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.450> make<00:04:52.750> movies<00:04:53.250> talk<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.340> you

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
take too long to make movies talk to you

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.610 
take too long to make movies talk to you
later
