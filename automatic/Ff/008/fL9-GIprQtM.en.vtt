the inside here you'll see that there's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.270 
the inside here you'll see that there's
a<00:01:38.460> pretty<00:01:38.880> nicely<00:01:39.180> sized<00:01:39.540> keyboard<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.590> we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
a pretty nicely sized keyboard here we

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.139 
a pretty nicely sized keyboard here we
like<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.729> tactile<00:01:42.210> feel<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.409> keys

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
especially because there have kind of a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.030 
especially because there have kind of a
rubberized<00:01:46.920> soft<00:01:47.280> touch<00:01:47.520> feel<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.210> nice

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
rubberized soft touch feel which is nice

unfortunately<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> lot<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.970> click<00:01:54.270> pads

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
unfortunately like a lot of click pads

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.039 
unfortunately like a lot of click pads
it<00:01:54.810> has<00:01:54.990> problems<00:01:55.560> it's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.570> worst<00:01:57.780> we've

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
used it doesn't jump a lot but we did

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
used it doesn't jump a lot but we did
find<00:02:00.119> ourselves<00:02:00.509> often<00:02:01.320> getting<00:02:01.530> sort<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
accurate click pads that we've used

the HP logo it's kind of plain but it

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.690

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
which is deliberate it's really the look

of business pedigree we like the bottom

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.339 
of business pedigree we like the bottom
here<00:02:35.670> because<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.269> soft<00:02:36.510> touch<00:02:36.750> material

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
here because it's a soft touch material

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.490 
here because it's a soft touch material
but<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> bottom<00:02:38.670> actually<00:02:39.000> does<00:02:39.180> get<00:02:39.390> hot<00:02:39.660> in

loud<00:04:46.569> enough<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:46.930> fill<00:04:47.259> a<00:04:47.289> room<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:48.009> very<00:04:48.849> good

loud enough to fill a room and very good

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.510 
loud enough to fill a room and very good
fidelity<00:04:49.389> you<00:04:50.080> could<00:04:50.440> really<00:04:50.770> use<00:04:50.919> this<00:04:51.280> as<00:04:51.490> a

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
fidelity you could really use this as a

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.890 
fidelity you could really use this as a
stereo<00:04:53.099> the<00:04:54.099> screen<00:04:54.940> however<00:04:55.210> does<00:04:55.629> leave<00:04:55.870> a

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
stereo the screen however does leave a

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.249 
stereo the screen however does leave a
lot<00:04:56.020> to<00:04:56.199> be<00:04:56.440> desired<00:04:56.610> first<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.759> all<00:04:57.819> it's<00:04:58.030> only

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
lot to be desired first of all it's only

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.320 
lot to be desired first of all it's only
1366<00:04:59.259> x<00:04:59.379> 768<00:04:59.979> resolution<00:05:00.310> which<00:05:00.969> is<00:05:01.120> lower

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
1366 x 768 resolution which is lower

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.589 
1366 x 768 resolution which is lower
than<00:05:01.599> a<00:05:01.659> lot<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.020> its<00:05:02.199> competitors<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.509> is

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
than a lot of its competitors and it is

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.930 
than a lot of its competitors and it is
the<00:05:04.750> dimmest<00:05:05.169> screen<00:05:05.650> that<00:05:06.460> we've<00:05:06.580> seen<00:05:06.789> on

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
the dimmest screen that we've seen on

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.809 
the dimmest screen that we've seen on
any<00:05:07.210> ultrabook<00:05:08.110> measuring<00:05:08.979> only<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.460> the

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
any ultrabook measuring only in the

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.680 
any ultrabook measuring only in the
around<00:05:10.060> 130<00:05:10.719> 140<00:05:11.560> Lux<00:05:12.460> range<00:05:12.819> so<00:05:13.300> really

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
around 130 140 Lux range so really

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.119 
around 130 140 Lux range so really
really<00:05:13.960> low<00:05:14.169> brightness<00:05:14.409> even<00:05:14.919> at<00:05:15.039> the

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
really low brightness even at the

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.959 
really low brightness even at the
maximum<00:05:15.669> level<00:05:16.289> however<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:18.490> trade-off<00:05:18.940> is

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
maximum level however the trade-off is

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.119 
maximum level however the trade-off is
that<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.389> get<00:05:19.629> incredible<00:05:19.780> battery<00:05:20.469> life<00:05:20.860> of

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
that you get incredible battery life of

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.580 
that you get incredible battery life of
7<00:05:21.520> hours<00:05:21.759> and<00:05:21.789> 50<00:05:22.030> minutes<00:05:22.240> on<00:05:22.690> this<00:05:22.870> which<00:05:23.409> is

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
7 hours and 50 minutes on this which is

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.249 
7 hours and 50 minutes on this which is
over<00:05:23.860> an<00:05:23.949> hour<00:05:24.129> better<00:05:24.520> than<00:05:25.509> the<00:05:25.629> macbook<00:05:26.050> air

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
over an hour better than the macbook air

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.680 
over an hour better than the macbook air
13<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.069> all<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:27.819> other<00:05:27.969> ultrabooks<00:05:28.300> that

we've tested so in short things that we
like<00:05:33.430> about<00:05:33.639> this<00:05:33.909> notebook<00:05:34.650> we<00:05:35.650> love<00:05:35.889> the

connecting to wired connections we like

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.830 
connecting to wired connections we like
the<00:05:44.440> performance<00:05:45.240> and<00:05:46.240> we<00:05:46.900> like<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.500> keyboard

screen the stiff touchpad and sometimes
warm<00:05:59.560> temperatures<00:06:00.539> but<00:06:01.539> overall<00:06:02.340> this<00:06:03.340> is<00:06:03.400> a

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
warm temperatures but overall this is a

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.409
