00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:04.890
 I'm going to solve some weak powers passed on 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.070
 but do not imagine 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.289
 we show you the videos 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.579
 yes we have and elevated 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.219
 you can say that live 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.779
 as who has given 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.199
 to four 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.060
 for the fact of being a motive 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.079
 we know 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.259
 that when iniesta raised to a multiple of four 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.849
 final will correspond 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.690
 also a form of m 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.340
 to work with him 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.260
 is doing the following 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.140
 dyn did not intervene two equal 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.070
 on the 12th 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.270
 we can not live then 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.120
 i high 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.699
 April 1 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.600
 the sum sees us 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.270
 it could be all the sense 4 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.440
 could add the speakers these could what com 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.450
 polino 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.670
 there we have four by four also by all 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.770
 and we know 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.430
 Kelly raised four hits 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 they are greater one by one by one of which 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 the drawback of this is that if the number 10 200 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.770
 Soy-based youtube would be 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.690
 too much of god 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.020
 that's why the populous of minors of metapÃ¡n - telvent 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.000
 but I'm not going to work in a way 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.420
 and precise 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.840
 so improve piero alva for example to 27 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.480
 and I read 27 we know that we can not live like the one who beat 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.470
 4 by 6 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.750
 we the 24 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.800
 4 for 6 24 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.210
 and to get to 27 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.960
 then we have here 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.750
 a product a multiple of equator but that remains as reactor 3 and in agreement 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.780
 theorem 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.860
 pedro mendes min 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.510
 then it is optimal 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 let's condemn 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 I will place now 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.509
 29 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.509
 and raised to 29 we can live little 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.409
 and elevated for 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.339
 four or seven 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.889
 in 28 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.909
 plus a pump 29 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.909
 any condom result 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.679
 winter 2000 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.139
 we see that it corresponds to the double value 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.109
 you have then worked previously knowing always that one 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.379
 come back you can touch it in another way 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.549
 for example 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.029
 and I read 27 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.029
 elevated ii 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.329
 elevated 7 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.849
 fernandez de puente behind the proponent body in sports of 28 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.879
 and it's a limited 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:06.549
 crows and pp
