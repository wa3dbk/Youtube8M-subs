00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.619
 Formula 1 is already in Australia to open the 2011 season 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.099
 the albert park circuit will be the paradisiacal debut stage of the 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.619
 Pirelli tires are the mobile spoiler and the return of sherry 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.539
 this semi-urban circuit begins with a very long straight two highlight set 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.530
 the 300 kilometers per hour 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.980
 a strong braking brings us to the febraban foundation 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.520
 very delicate and scene of spectacular accidents since 1996 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.580
 I reached bottom to exceed 270 per hour 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.770
 and another nailed land in the curve huaico even more the rose that the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.130
 previous 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 the turns 4 and 5 that are passed in full acceleration 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.200
 very interesting 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.590
 all and there's some water on the track 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.540
 we are fully in the second part of the circuit 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.770
 right curve and start a quick way first to the left 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.980
 then we find the smooth curve the flight the steering wheel has to reduce to 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.980
 third in which to cancel 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.030
 a line slightly curved to the report 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.640
 the beautiful lake puts us back to 300 per hour 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.100
 before facing one of the fastest linked in the world 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.320
 the curves 22 months after commenting that the speed but without lowering the 225 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.340
 kilos 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.320
 we overcome the challenge with figures 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.680
 we will reach more than 290 forum to critique tahrir curves 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.050
 the most daring can try an overtaking here 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.880
 although vigilant to not lose again the position in the curve 15 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.460
 It requires many prizes and a good catch 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.130
 in the race the pilots will be able to activate the mobile rear spoiler at the exit of 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.150
 this curve 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.010
 and who knows if to overtake his rivals before the finish line
