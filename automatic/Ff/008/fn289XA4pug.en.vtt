00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
At sixteen she quit high school

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.100
to make her fortune in the promised land

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.300
She got a job behind the counter

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.280
in an all night hamburger stand

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.800
She wrote faithfully home to mama

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.000
"Now mama don't you worry none"

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.300
From small things, mama

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.800
Big things one day come

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.800
It was late one Friday

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.920
he pulled in out of the dark

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.000
He was tall and handsome

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.200
she took his order, then she took his heart

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.060
They bought a house up on the hillside

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.100
Where little feet would soon run

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300
From small things, mama

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700
Big things one day come

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.700
Oh but love is fleeting

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.700
it's sad but it's true

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.300
When your heart is beating

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.400
You don't wanna hear the news

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.600
She packed her bags

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
and with a Wyomie County real estate man

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.200
She ran down to Tampa

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.380
In an "El Dorado Grande"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.500
She wrote back home, "Dear Mama ...

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.700
... Life is just heaven in the sun ...

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.200
... From small things, mama ...

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.680
... Big things one day come"

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.400
Well she shot him dead

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.440
On a sunny Florida road

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.800
And when they caught her all she said

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.300
She couldn't stand the way he drove

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.520
Back home lonesome Johnny

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.740
Prays for his baby's parole

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.200
He waits on the hillside

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.200
Where the Wyomie waters roll

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.500
At his feet and almost grown now

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.700
A blue-eyed daughter and a handsome son

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.200
From small things, mama

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.500
Big things one day come

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.600
Well from small things, mama

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.060
Big things one day come

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.060
Well from small things, mama

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.000
Big things one day come
