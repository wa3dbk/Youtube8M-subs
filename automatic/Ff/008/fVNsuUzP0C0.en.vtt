this all the same I just removed like
the<00:00:19.960> stuff<00:00:20.170> at<00:00:20.350> the<00:00:20.380> berline<00:00:20.710> but<00:00:20.920> you<00:00:21.220> have<00:00:21.369> to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
the stuff at the berline but you have to

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.250 
the stuff at the berline but you have to
do<00:00:21.609> that<00:00:21.730> so<00:00:22.330> in<00:00:22.480> your<00:00:22.570> player<00:00:22.779> list<00:00:23.019> now<00:00:23.170> you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.260 
do that so in your player list now you

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.599 
do that so in your player list now you
want<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.439> the<00:00:23.619> event<00:00:23.859> handler<00:00:24.189> something<00:00:24.550> I

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.609 
want to the event handler something I

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.480 
want to the event handler something I
forgot<00:00:24.880> to<00:00:25.029> mention<00:00:25.150> is<00:00:25.539> event<00:00:26.349> priority<00:00:26.680> so

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
forgot to mention is event priority so

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.299 
forgot to mention is event priority so
if<00:00:27.609> you<00:00:27.760> do<00:00:27.990> event<00:00:29.010> priority<00:00:31.529> dot<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:32.710> then

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
if you do event priority dot and then

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.100 
if you do event priority dot and then
you've<00:00:33.550> got<00:00:33.730> these<00:00:34.030> stuff<00:00:34.420> but<00:00:34.690> if<00:00:34.780> you<00:00:34.870> don't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
you've got these stuff but if you don't

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.569 
you've got these stuff but if you don't
put<00:00:35.530> this<00:00:35.739> then<00:00:36.040> how<00:00:36.130> it<00:00:36.219> should<00:00:36.340> assume

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
put this then how it should assume

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.310 
put this then how it should assume
you're<00:00:36.790> doing<00:00:37.000> normal<00:00:37.360> so<00:00:37.780> we<00:00:37.989> don't<00:00:38.170> need

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
you're doing normal so we don't need

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.880 
you're doing normal so we don't need
that<00:00:39.510> event<00:00:40.510> handler<00:00:40.870> so<00:00:41.110> we're<00:00:41.559> going<00:00:41.649> to<00:00:41.739> is

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
that event handler so we're going to is

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.979 
that event handler so we're going to is
public<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:42.460> any<00:00:42.670> class<00:00:43.000> can<00:00:43.210> access<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.719> void

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
public so any class can access it void

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.930 
public so any class can access it void
so<00:00:44.379> it<00:00:44.469> doesn't<00:00:44.829> return<00:00:45.190> anything<00:00:45.550> like

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
so it doesn't return anything like

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.600 
so it doesn't return anything like
Abilene<00:00:46.390> does<00:00:46.600> when<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.200> call<00:00:47.440> this<00:00:47.590> on<00:00:47.770> player

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
Abilene does when I call this on player

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.959 
Abilene does when I call this on player
joint<00:00:49.360> this<00:00:49.840> can<00:00:50.050> be<00:00:50.140> anything<00:00:50.379> this<00:00:50.620> is<00:00:50.680> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
joint this can be anything this is a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.240 
joint this can be anything this is a
variable<00:00:51.969> it<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.390> can<00:00:52.539> change<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.250> it's

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
variable it you can change it so it's

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.250 
variable it you can change it so it's
going<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.489> be<00:00:54.610> if<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.090> type<00:00:55.329> player<00:00:55.750> join

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
going to be if the type player join

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950 
going to be if the type player join
event<00:00:56.770> and<00:00:57.219> we're<00:00:58.000> going<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.149> nickname<00:00:58.719> that

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
event and we're going to nickname that

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.889 
event and we're going to nickname that
event<00:00:59.440> so<00:00:59.710> we<00:00:59.829> can<00:00:59.980> use<00:01:00.160> it<00:01:00.309> easier<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.600> we're

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
event so we can use it easier so we're

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.609 
event so we can use it easier so we're
using<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:04.030> player<00:01:04.239> join<00:01:04.540> event<00:01:04.809> type<00:01:05.080> and<00:01:05.320> we

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
using the player join event type and we

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.679 
using the player join event type and we
can<00:01:05.830> name<00:01:06.040> that<00:01:06.220> event<00:01:06.670> so<00:01:06.939> we're<00:01:07.510> going<00:01:07.600> to

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
can name that event so we're going to

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:09.990 
can name that event so we're going to
get<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.960> player<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:08.979> because<00:01:09.670> we<00:01:09.790> don't<00:01:09.820> have

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
get the player so because we don't have

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.330 
get the player so because we don't have
sender<00:01:10.570> in<00:01:10.780> our<00:01:10.930> parameters<00:01:11.439> we<00:01:11.619> don't<00:01:11.860> have

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
sender in our parameters we don't have

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.590 
sender in our parameters we don't have
sender<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:12.909> we<00:01:12.970> have<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.210> do<00:01:13.270> it<00:01:13.360> another<00:01:13.479> way

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
sender so we have to do it another way

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.510 
sender so we have to do it another way
we're<00:01:13.810> doing<00:01:13.960> player<00:01:14.369> player

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
we're doing player player

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.179 
we're doing player player
equals<00:01:16.210> event<00:01:18.090> event<00:01:19.090> don't<00:01:19.659> get<00:01:20.439> player<00:01:20.830> so

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
equals event event don't get player so

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.620 
equals event event don't get player so
that's<00:01:21.310> getting<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.850> first<00:01:22.030> grabbing<00:01:22.540> the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
that's getting the first grabbing the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.520 
that's getting the first grabbing the
player<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.700> set<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.150> join<00:01:25.390> message<00:01:25.869> what

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
player so to set the join message what

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.149 
player so to set the join message what
you<00:01:26.619> would<00:01:26.770> do<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.460> you<00:01:27.820> would<00:01:27.850> do<00:01:28.119> event<00:01:29.159> dot

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
you would do is you would do event dot

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.999 
you would do is you would do event dot
set<00:01:30.939> join<00:01:31.509> message<00:01:31.960> now<00:01:32.500> what<00:01:32.650> that's<00:01:32.770> doing

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
set join message now what that's doing

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.359 
set join message now what that's doing
is<00:01:33.400> whenever<00:01:34.360> someone<00:01:35.170> joins<00:01:35.530> it's<00:01:35.860> gonna<00:01:36.009> run

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
is whenever someone joins it's gonna run

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.140 
is whenever someone joins it's gonna run
this<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:36.970> if<00:01:37.479> it's<00:01:37.900> gonna<00:01:38.020> look<00:01:38.290> for<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.150> join

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
this and if it's gonna look for the join
