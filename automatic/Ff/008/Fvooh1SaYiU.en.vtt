and we knew we're gonna have to deal

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.440 
and we knew we're gonna have to deal
with<00:00:22.009> balls<00:00:22.430> on<00:00:22.820> top<00:00:22.880> of<00:00:23.660> us<00:00:23.809> in<00:00:23.989> the<00:00:24.140> air

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
with balls on top of us in the air

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.229 
with balls on top of us in the air
that's<00:00:26.450> not<00:00:26.720> something<00:00:26.750> that<00:00:27.320> we're<00:00:28.239> normally

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
that's not something that we're normally

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.120 
that's not something that we're normally
good<00:00:29.390> at<00:00:29.540> dealing<00:00:29.689> with<00:00:29.840> we<00:00:30.710> don't<00:00:30.739> practice

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
good at dealing with we don't practice

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.100 
good at dealing with we don't practice
that<00:00:31.520> a<00:00:31.550> lot<00:00:31.790> we<00:00:32.149> practice<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:32.689> this<00:00:32.899> week

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
that a lot we practice it this week

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.810 
that a lot we practice it this week
because<00:00:33.260> we<00:00:33.469> knew<00:00:33.620> we<00:00:33.739> were<00:00:33.800> going<00:00:33.950> to<00:00:34.040> have<00:00:34.640> to

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
because we knew we were going to have to

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.299 
because we knew we were going to have to
deal<00:00:34.969> with<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:35.710> but<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:36.739> think<00:00:36.980> there<00:00:37.129> were<00:00:37.190> guys

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
deal with it but I think there were guys

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.940 
deal with it but I think there were guys
that<00:00:37.579> weren't<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:37.910> their<00:00:38.030> comfort<00:00:38.420> zone

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
that weren't in their comfort zone

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.250 
that weren't in their comfort zone
dealing<00:00:39.950> with<00:00:40.580> that<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.060> we<00:00:41.840> needed<00:00:42.020> to<00:00:42.110> do<00:00:42.230> a

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
dealing with that and we needed to do a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.690 
dealing with that and we needed to do a
better<00:00:42.440> job<00:00:42.560> of<00:00:42.770> wood<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.220> first<00:00:43.430> balls

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
better job of wood in the first balls

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.850 
better job of wood in the first balls
digging<00:00:44.690> out<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.870> second<00:00:45.350> balls<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:45.770> then

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
digging out the second balls and then

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.810 
digging out the second balls and then
getting<00:00:46.040> the<00:00:46.130> ball<00:00:46.250> down<00:00:46.310> and<00:00:46.640> playing

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
getting the ball down and playing

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.590 
getting the ball down and playing
playing<00:00:47.690> soccer<00:00:49.000> so<00:00:50.000> I<00:00:50.030> thought<00:00:50.329> there<00:00:50.480> was

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
playing soccer so I thought there was

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.910 
playing soccer so I thought there was
some<00:00:50.750> guys<00:00:50.930> early<00:00:51.350> in<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.500> game<00:00:51.680> especially

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
some guys early in the game especially

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.800 
some guys early in the game especially
that<00:00:52.400> led<00:00:52.820> us<00:00:52.940> down<00:00:53.650> they<00:00:54.650> weren't<00:00:54.829> sharp<00:00:55.160> and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
that led us down they weren't sharp and

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.650 
that led us down they weren't sharp and
focused<00:00:57.340> lost<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.489> little<00:00:58.670> bit<00:00:58.850> confidence<00:00:59.450> got

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
focused lost a little bit confidence got

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.880 
focused lost a little bit confidence got
rattled<00:01:00.079> early<00:01:00.860> with<00:01:01.430> some<00:01:01.610> mistakes<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:02.890> so

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
rattled early with some mistakes and so

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.229 
rattled early with some mistakes and so
we<00:01:04.009> had<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.250> make<00:01:04.369> some<00:01:04.549> changes<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.059> I

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
we had to make some changes and I

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.969 
we had to make some changes and I
thought<00:01:05.479> things<00:01:05.720> got<00:01:05.930> better<00:01:06.140> unfortunately

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979
