00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 probably under normal 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.469
 usually needs to bid 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.929
 rejects everyone 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.929
 with a difference, that assumes Goethe 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.869
 what is that 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.679
 terminate the value of the purchased Switzerland 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.699
 forbidden 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.040
 Ad hoc he is 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.030
 because the two satellites 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 took over 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.970
 that with each other 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.970
 Do not talk to anyone 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.550
 and now I have to be careful 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.650
 both are not important for the strength of 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.290
 I had to be it 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.290
 what comes out of the back with the EU 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.970
 The sal has to be tough 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.260
 why is the clock 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 that is 1 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.370
 and how to do it again 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.790
 I was really just lucky then 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.790
 if you do it differently 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.740
 this from it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.900
 something twisted out 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.840
 that is moving 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.140
 it does not exist can be tracked 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.510
 but if I'm a role model then you 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 he pulls himself up 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.510
 at the other
