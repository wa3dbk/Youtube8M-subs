00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
sao paulo nozzle this it's right there

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.960 
sao paulo nozzle this it's right there
can<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.510> get<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.720> fix<00:01:49.990> i<00:01:50.350> only<00:01:51.190> use<00:01:51.310> no<00:01:51.610> clean

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
can you get to fix i only use no clean

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.740 
can you get to fix i only use no clean
flux<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:53.350> if<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.550> didn't<00:01:54.910> then<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.600> would

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
flux because if I didn't then that would

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:24.770 
flux because if I didn't then that would
 up<00:01:56.110> your<00:01:56.290> xbox<00:01:57.600> so

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.110 

if<00:02:25.380> any<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.830> don't<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.520> Lux<00:02:26.760> does<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
if any of you don't know if Lux does it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.070 
if any of you don't know if Lux does it
cleans<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.450> impurities<00:02:31.100> from<00:02:32.990> from<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
cleans the impurities from from the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.930 
cleans the impurities from from the
motherboard<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.680> all<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:37.400> yeah<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.730> kind

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
motherboard and all that so yeah it kind

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.809 
motherboard and all that so yeah it kind
of<00:02:39.000> acts<00:02:39.300> as<00:02:39.569> an<00:02:39.690> insulator<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:42.260> hear

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
of acts as an insulator so it can hear

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.300 
of acts as an insulator so it can hear
me<00:02:44.819> flow<00:02:45.030> better<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.959> guess<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:47.010> doesn't

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
me flow better I guess but it doesn't

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.070 
me flow better I guess but it doesn't
really<00:02:47.400> matter<00:02:47.640> considering<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.600> thing<00:02:48.870> can

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
really matter considering this thing can

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.199 
really matter considering this thing can
get<00:02:49.260> up<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.590> 500<00:02:50.220> degree<00:02:50.459> celsius<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
get up to like 500 degree celsius and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.520 
get up to like 500 degree celsius and
the<00:02:51.830> melting<00:02:52.830> point<00:02:53.069> of<00:02:53.250> solder<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.209> only<00:02:54.530> lead

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the melting point of solder is only lead

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.300 
the melting point of solder is only lead
free<00:02:55.800> solder<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.280> only<00:02:57.200> 250<00:02:58.200> degrees<00:02:58.709> Celsius

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
free solder is only 250 degrees Celsius

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.710 
free solder is only 250 degrees Celsius
so<00:03:00.680> got<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.890> back<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.310> place<00:03:02.550> can<00:03:03.390> wait<00:03:05.720> yeah

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
so got that back in place can wait yeah

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.910 
so got that back in place can wait yeah
that's<00:03:06.959> not<00:03:07.260> even<00:03:08.180> close<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.239> being<00:03:11.510> set<00:03:12.510> like

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
that's not even close to being set like

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.370 
that's not even close to being set like
it's<00:03:13.920> not<00:03:14.069> even<00:03:14.130> more<00:03:14.430> easy<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.150> 0<00:03:15.380> times

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
it's not even more easy it's 0 times

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.380 
it's not even more easy it's 0 times
sake<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:16.890> just<00:03:17.040> gonna<00:03:20.630> skip<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.260> yeah

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
sake I'm just gonna skip it so yeah

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.170 
sake I'm just gonna skip it so yeah
alright<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.040> it's<00:03:26.040> at<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> 400<00:03:26.880> degrees

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
alright so it's at the 400 degrees

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.650 
alright so it's at the 400 degrees
Celsius<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.110> mean<00:03:28.319> fair<00:03:29.190> night<00:03:29.510> I'm<00:03:30.510> going

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
Celsius so I mean fair night I'm going

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.190 
Celsius so I mean fair night I'm going
to<00:03:30.750> turn<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.049> on

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
to turn this on

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.420 
to turn this on
do<00:03:32.770> you

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.140 

to<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.150> airport<00:03:36.650> so

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.230 

we're<00:03:42.629> gonna<00:03:42.810> let<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.370> flux<00:03:44.370> boil<00:03:44.700> for<00:03:45.150> bail

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.970 

climbing<00:03:49.960> up<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.590> would<00:03:50.710> she<00:03:50.860> let

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
climbing up the would she let

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.600 
climbing up the would she let
it<00:03:51.100> warm<00:03:51.280> up<00:03:52.170> for<00:03:53.170> about<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.350> minute

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.430 

so

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.600 

it's<00:04:02.770> been<00:04:03.010> about<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.340> minute<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:04.150> put<00:04:04.570> up<00:04:04.660> to

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
it's been about a minute and put up to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.310 
it's been about a minute and put up to
195<00:04:06.610> or<00:04:07.390> 19<00:04:09.330> that's<00:04:10.330> about<00:04:10.570> what<00:04:10.630> photo<00:04:10.990> is

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
195 or 19 that's about what photo is

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.680
