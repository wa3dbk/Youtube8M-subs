sure that that gray arrow is pointing to
the<00:00:45.239> left<00:00:45.270> see<00:00:45.780> how<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.079> kept<00:00:46.260> switching<00:00:46.530> over

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the left see how it kept switching over

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.459 
the left see how it kept switching over
to<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> right<00:00:47.309> put<00:00:48.239> them<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.570> behind<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> dt

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
and it screams right through the a gap
let's<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> look<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> replay<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
let's take a look at the replay as you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.119 
let's take a look at the replay as you
can<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.840> he<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.050> comes<00:00:55.440> right<00:00:55.590> through<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
can see he just comes right through the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.729 
can see he just comes right through the
a<00:00:56.160> gap<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.730> quarterback<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.620> all

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
a gap at the quarterback so it's all

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.020 
a gap at the quarterback so it's all
about<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> contain<00:00:59.460> basically<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
about the contain basically the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
about the contain basically the
contained<00:01:00.480> blitz<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.230> back<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
contained blitz is back but in a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.479 
contained blitz is back but in a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
six out of 335 again it doesn't matter

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.359

assignments for other players on the
field<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.140> easily<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> as<00:02:00.000> you

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
field you can easily do so and as you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.240 
field you can easily do so and as you
can<00:02:00.299> see<00:02:00.329> again<00:02:00.869> he<00:02:01.229> comes<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.860> through<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
can see again he comes right through the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.380 
can see again he comes right through the
middle<00:02:02.369> at<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> quarterback<00:02:03.630> easy<00:02:04.619> sack<00:02:05.390> so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
middle at the quarterback easy sack so

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.490 
middle at the quarterback easy sack so
this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.810> something<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> be

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this is something that's going to be

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
this is something that's going to be
pretty<00:02:07.710> deadly<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.550> makes<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
pretty deadly if it makes it to the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
pretty deadly if it makes it to the
retail<00:02:09.869> game<00:02:10.080> which<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> feeling

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
retail game which I do have a feeling

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.870 
retail game which I do have a feeling
that<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.520> will

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
that it will

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.300 
that it will
because<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.330> said<00:02:12.800> normally<00:02:13.800> even<00:02:14.160> with

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
because as I said normally even with

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.190 
because as I said normally even with
demos<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.510> there's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> lot<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.900> things

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
demos you know there's a lot of things

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.410 
demos you know there's a lot of things
in<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.440> demo<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.830> will<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.940> carry<00:02:18.330> over

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
in the demo that will not carry over

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.060 
in the demo that will not carry over
into<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.840> real<00:02:19.080> game<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.530> maybe<00:02:19.740> some

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
into the real game like maybe some

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.540 
into the real game like maybe some
defensive<00:02:20.580> AI<00:02:20.820> for<00:02:22.040> cornerback<00:02:23.040> play<00:02:23.340> and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
stuff like that but things like this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.340 
stuff like that but things like this
always<00:02:26.130> seem<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.820> carry<00:02:27.060> over<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:27.900> again<00:02:28.200> I'm

and get sacked immediately now this is

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.670 
and get sacked immediately now this is
how<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.490> cover<00:03:02.760> too<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.090> think<00:03:03.270> as<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:04.530> see

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
how to cover too I think as you can see

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.260 
how to cover too I think as you can see
he<00:03:04.830> loops<00:03:05.070> right<00:03:05.370> around<00:03:05.610> comes<00:03:05.970> right

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
he loops right around comes right

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.240 
he loops right around comes right
through<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.600> middle<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.070> sacks<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
through the middle and sacks the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.790 
through the middle and sacks the
quarterback<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.570> can't<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
quarterback now you can't just do it and

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.920 
quarterback now you can't just do it and
and<00:03:11.160> blitz<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.850> player<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.450> get<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.750> same

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and blitz a player and get the same

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.690 
and blitz a player and get the same
effect<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.500> can<00:03:13.620> see<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:13.830> tried<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.340> blitz<00:03:14.580> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
effect as you can see I tried to blitz a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.330 
effect as you can see I tried to blitz a
player<00:03:14.990> instead<00:03:15.990> of<00:03:16.170> using<00:03:16.410> contains<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.160> both

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
player instead of using contains on both

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.820 
player instead of using contains on both
sides<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.940> didn't<00:03:18.630> get<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.870> heat<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.680> was
