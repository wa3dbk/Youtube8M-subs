00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.659
 Y 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.700
 today 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Y 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.350
 or the florecillas good this video is 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.350
 to tell us that from now on 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.130
 I'll upload shopping makeup videos 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.590
 of makeup of reviews and others I do it 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.010
 because good apart from because I feel like 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.960
 because I started my channel with tricks with 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.270
 beauty things and so on then I want 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.390
 a little bit to go back and follow the 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.580
 walked because the truth is that I like 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.680
 and well you know that I 'm not a 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.660
 professional but neither am I in the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.720
 nails and like I've learned to do 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.180
 one thing and I get better because every time 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.810
 with makeup and everything I 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.570
 it will get better and better 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.270
 The fact is that well, I think that with 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.890
 this then we arrive I do not say that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 you have to do it the way I do it 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.010
 I but l clearer I give my advice what 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.210
 that I do the someone to help if 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.580
 someone serves you and well you'll see 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.070
 little by little in the videos and good in addition 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.590
 of the videos that I'm doing I'll leave 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.480
 more information in a blog that I will leave 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 because we have information in the box and 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.310
 in that good blog what is doing 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.340
 is to collaborate with kris with kirchner what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.410
 what you will see in that blog will be information 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 additional to the videos in the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.580
 that we go up and other information 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.040
 additional as I said for 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.380
 complement between the video and the blog or 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.270
 not for if there are things that are not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.570
 necessary to upload to youtube with the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 you have in the blog and good 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.970
 who does not have time can not see 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.360

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:59.330

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.020
