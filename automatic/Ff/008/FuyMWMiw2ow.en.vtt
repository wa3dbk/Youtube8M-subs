front of the laser cannon goes on and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.120 
front of the laser cannon goes on and
then<00:03:44.270> this<00:03:44.450> back<00:03:44.750> piece<00:03:45.080> just<00:03:45.350> pops<00:03:45.680> right<00:03:45.830> in

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
then this back piece just pops right in

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.350 
then this back piece just pops right in
right<00:03:46.310> there<00:03:46.550> like<00:03:47.300> so<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.990> then<00:03:49.000> this<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.240> the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
right there like so and then this is the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.410 
right there like so and then this is the
first<00:03:50.630> computer<00:03:51.110> panel<00:03:51.320> which<00:03:51.650> goes<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.070> there

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
first computer panel which goes in there

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.570 
first computer panel which goes in there

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
second computer panel goes in right here

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.770 
second computer panel goes in right here
and<00:03:56.830> then<00:03:57.830> this<00:03:58.610> little<00:03:58.790> piece<00:03:59.120> goes<00:03:59.390> in<00:03:59.570> here

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
and then this little piece goes in here

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.180 
and then this little piece goes in here
because<00:03:59.990> this<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.380> piece<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.800> used<00:04:01.040> to

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
into that piece right there and then you

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.150
