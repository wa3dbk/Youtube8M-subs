00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.190
 I know we are beautiful already arrived at 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.490
 final battle 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:13.519
 spider man has defeated meat now 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.519
 let's see where this hiccup ends up 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:23.670
 who is this oh my god and monster hoc 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.490
 I will show it does not appear in the animated series 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.800
 in comics and movies only appears in 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.710
 this video game but I have to give you a 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.430
 I recommend you guys and goats your snow 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 he orders you don't have to fight against 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.670
 the mgr 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 monster hoc you will have to escape immediately 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 instantly because this deposit on 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.280
 sea ​​is about to explode and we don't 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.110
 we want an underwater trench you must 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.239
 run away just remember you guys 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.030
 while running away use the cobwebs for 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.850
 rocking always allows the r2 e key 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.769
 if sometimes it happens to be 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.390
 surface immediately pressed the r1 key 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.049
 I don't know how long this will be 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:16.680
 path that we must escape the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:21.049
 monster hoc but you have to be careful 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.049
 because if it then explodes this place 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.240
 keep running the boys need 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.369
 keep running without ever making you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.740
 take from monster hoc because if you 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.740
 takes then start all over again 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 we cannot say monster hoc 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.540
 I didn't know that Dr. Octopus 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.270
 has had this transformation not 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.640
 had to undergo this transformation with 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.650
 the symbiosis becoming monster hoc e 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.720
 this would be the final battle that 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.210
 spider man had never faced in 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.560
 his spider man life never had 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.560
 faced monster hoc 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:18.920
 I don't know how far we are to the third 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.430
 plan they were careful because these 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.700
 things can also be dangerous 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:33.260
 sure but how does it get off the pipes as it does 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:34.430
 to break the spiderman force doors 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.140
 hurry up 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.140
 don't get caught by monster hoc 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.520

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.349

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.110
 run escapes don't stop and do 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.190
 monster hoc burned in the fire 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.230
 I think we're done 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.930
 look now the lady goes away and 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.120

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:54.850
 this vehicle those captain america 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:58.340
 that is really driving this danger 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.660
 but captain america was one of the members 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.840
 of the avengers 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.030
