00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.829
 hello to all and to pekin this word cure 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.090
 teeth on call of duty black ops on 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
 decided to make a small return 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.500
 resources how she had promised on 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.240
 the last video quite everything to 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.009
 so that's a way that you 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.029
 know like me I think since the 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.150
 time we see here I admit it's the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.940
 pocket of water that we made the 5th 6th 60th 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.960
 68 national schools 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.180
 no no but it's true the fifth 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.900
 video or a good it's not the most 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.840
 important no 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.440
 so we end up on a match to the death 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.390
 by team 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.620
 he made this evening there we had done 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.449
 a lot of that you'll be able to 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.510
 see for yourself that we 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.870
 had done the research and destruction 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.870
 will catch flag why you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.640
 i'm sorry i know this message 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.340
 would happen if we say that because in fact 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.110
 we'll admit everything is that on the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.640
 team death match we did not 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.340
 badly of rooms against others 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.470
 parties have been observed here that roll 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.390
 but by guys were sometimes 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.250
 level 10 or precious like that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.990
 but it's true that we quote françois 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.759
 we petit fours s here suddenly 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.259
 we say we said what we did but we 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.789
 did not bebeto that happens i think to 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.679
 the set of values ​​those are you doing 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.259
 sometimes a dozen parties you go 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.310
 to release a big gameplay there besides I 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.929
 am too much of a sense you see I 'm already 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.099
 pretty good then so yeah so 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.899
 mont blanc like this first of the name we have 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.830
 says it's exactly on xbox 360 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.270
 so the habit of looking at April the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.580
 small ring I missed it is that I 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.050
 hate fills so 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.700
 the cost for the rc ghz and stop at 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.140
 find a reach to stay block 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.800
 mouse but maybe one who knows 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.300
 although it shortens at the level of 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 class we have prices what exxon 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.520
 so suddenly you have a commando if you 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.900
 like everything here is the way screen 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.890
 suddenly cough then this engineer is 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.150
 the cap is called so it's the asset 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610
 pirates to see the roundabouts 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.380
 directly samak had no and blockade 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.520
 had left a brazen salary but 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.679
 do you still have to often 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.030
 death is my embarrassed job at the beginning at 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.910
 total that it is worth 1 tricolor to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.980
 dogs and indirectly the dogs with 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.390
 water so after your life lap pass 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.250
 normal pro pass to reload its 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.590
 ghosts proves that's it to be 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.720
 undetectable and wouri aberrations 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.430
 also a good there he will befall auxerre 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.170
 video the aircraft left the team essex 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.630
 hours of acton it can be an asset that 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.990
 is super interesting sincerely it's 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.310
 unlock it that's worth it 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.050
 there on the other hand I took a commando and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.730
 I saw that it was with double charger 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.900
 quite white after six innings and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:49.440
 thrill but it's still the tea trees auto 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.630
 flashy I was saying no it's done 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.890
 always one in parts like that 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.480
 so labatut perform the task is 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.340
 unknown who begot it say you let 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.670
 a little low we do not have much choice 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.340
 incessant and if not task n bass advance 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.340
 well thanks to exploits 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.090
 the chain because we realize that 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.190
 the gameplay on the discovery of the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.020
 language you liked it was censored at 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.850
 number of views to the number of genes are 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.160
 all the comments no no risk of 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.830
 to do another example discover that 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.920
 will surely be on metro is it metro 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:38.060

 these accounts were still the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.700
 studios as usual yes anyway 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.500
 they have all the thought providers 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.370
 to have a day in advance so as to 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.980
