00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
here and pretty much what this pollen

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.620 
here and pretty much what this pollen
does<00:01:56.200> if<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:56.740> look<00:01:56.920> closely<00:01:57.330> that's<00:01:58.330> what's

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
does if we look closely that's what's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.810 
does if we look closely that's what's
going<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.810> pollinate<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.470> corn<00:01:59.800> come<00:02:00.640> down

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
going to pollinate the corn come down

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.160 
going to pollinate the corn come down
here<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.900> see<00:02:01.930> we<00:02:02.350> got<00:02:02.500> one<00:02:02.800> corn

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
here you can see we got one corn

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.030 
here you can see we got one corn
starting<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.550> start<00:02:06.550> here<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:08.679> pollen

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
starting to start here and that pollen

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.580 
starting to start here and that pollen
is<00:02:09.100> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.280> fall<00:02:09.460> down<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:10.200> pollinate<00:02:11.200> this

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
is going to fall down and pollinate this

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.260 
is going to fall down and pollinate this
corn<00:02:12.010> hopefully<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:13.180> we'll<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:15.270> corn

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
corn hopefully and we'll have a corn

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.410 
corn hopefully and we'll have a corn
there<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.020> surprisingly<00:02:17.620> enough<00:02:18.120> we'll<00:02:19.120> only

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
there and surprisingly enough we'll only

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.060 
there and surprisingly enough we'll only
have<00:02:20.010> probably<00:02:21.010> one<00:02:22.260> husk<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.500> corn<00:02:24.010> per<00:02:24.700> plant

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
have probably one husk of corn per plant

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.970 
have probably one husk of corn per plant
we<00:02:27.070> may<00:02:27.280> get<00:02:27.459> two<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.420> usually<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.440> method<00:02:29.830> is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
we may get two but usually the method is

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.090 
we may get two but usually the method is
only<00:02:30.340> one<00:02:32.790> corn<00:02:34.020> per<00:02:35.020> plant<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.739> as<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.980> can

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
only one corn per plant but as you can

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.340 
only one corn per plant but as you can
see<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.330> where<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.630> corn<00:02:38.050> will<00:02:38.230> be

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
see this is where the corn will be

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.210 
see this is where the corn will be
growing<00:02:38.670> right<00:02:39.670> here<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:41.610> up<00:02:42.610> above<00:02:43.060> right

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
growing right here and up above right

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.160 
growing right here and up above right
here<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.959> pollen<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:48.580> falls<00:02:48.880> down<00:02:49.170> to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
here is the pollen that falls down to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.280 
here is the pollen that falls down to
pollinate<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.800> porn<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:52.019> there's<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.080> a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
pollinate the porn so there's just a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.420 
pollinate the porn so there's just a
quick<00:02:53.530> look<00:02:53.739> at<00:02:54.040> our<00:02:54.390> corn<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:56.100> don't<00:02:57.100> really

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
quick look at our corn I don't really

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.220 
quick look at our corn I don't really
have<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.970> much<00:02:58.209> playing<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.810> I'll<00:02:58.930> step<00:02:59.200> back

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
have that much playing it I'll step back

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.110 
have that much playing it I'll step back
so<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.650> can<00:02:59.769> see<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:01.030> have<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> very<00:03:02.580> small<00:03:03.580> area

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
so you can see we have a very small area

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.500 
so you can see we have a very small area
but<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.540> do<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.019> plant<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:06.090> enough<00:03:07.090> corn

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
but you do have to plant it enough corn

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.039 
but you do have to plant it enough corn
so<00:03:07.840> they<00:03:07.989> can<00:03:08.230> pollinate<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:09.900> don't<00:03:10.900> think

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
so they can pollinate I don't think

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.080 
so they can pollinate I don't think
there's<00:03:11.230> anybody<00:03:11.440> else<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.920> our<00:03:12.100> area<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.910> is

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
there's anybody else in our area that is

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.560 
there's anybody else in our area that is
growing<00:03:13.590> corn<00:03:14.590> I'm<00:03:15.489> not<00:03:16.000> sure<00:03:16.269> what<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
growing corn I'm not sure what the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.800 
growing corn I'm not sure what the
distance<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.200> has<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.430> between<00:03:18.810> varieties

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
distance is has to be between varieties

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.740 
distance is has to be between varieties
of<00:03:19.840> corn<00:03:20.230> for<00:03:20.410> planting<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.760> prevent<00:03:22.360> they

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
of corn for planting to prevent they

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.400 
of corn for planting to prevent they
cross<00:03:23.170> pollenization<00:03:23.769> but<00:03:24.900> I'm<00:03:25.900> pretty

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
cross pollenization but I'm pretty

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.229 
cross pollenization but I'm pretty
confident<00:03:26.920> there's<00:03:27.190> nobody<00:03:27.519> growing<00:03:27.790> corn

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
confident there's nobody growing corn

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.410 
confident there's nobody growing corn
around<00:03:29.200> here<00:03:29.769> so<00:03:30.519> I'm<00:03:30.580> really<00:03:30.760> not<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.030> worried

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
around here so I'm really not a worried

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.080 
around here so I'm really not a worried
too<00:03:31.720> much<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.140> about<00:03:32.950> cross<00:03:33.310> pollination<00:03:33.880> or

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
too much of about cross pollination or

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.789 
too much of about cross pollination or
the<00:03:35.049> cross<00:03:35.350> pollination<00:03:35.680> of<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.790> GMO<00:03:37.510> corn<00:03:38.110> that

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
the cross pollination of a GMO corn that

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.340 
the cross pollination of a GMO corn that
is<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.750> quite<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.930> talk<00:03:41.200> these<00:03:41.980> days<00:03:42.040> about<00:03:43.350> GMO

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
is a quite the talk these days about GMO

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.490 
is a quite the talk these days about GMO
and

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.960 
and
corn<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.129> one<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.400> them<00:03:47.760> number<00:03:48.420> one<00:03:49.099> of<00:03:50.099> many

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
corn is one of them number one of many

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.220 
corn is one of them number one of many
crops<00:03:51.810> probably<00:03:52.379> one<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> biggest<00:03:54.230> GMO

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
crops probably one of the biggest GMO

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.410 
crops probably one of the biggest GMO
crop<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:56.310> why<00:03:56.549> it's<00:03:56.730> quite<00:03:56.970> challenging

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
crop that's why it's quite challenging

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.190 
crop that's why it's quite challenging
to<00:03:57.900> find<00:03:58.140> bred<00:03:58.730> non-gmo<00:03:59.730> corn<00:04:00.510> seed<00:04:00.930> these

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
to find bred non-gmo corn seed these

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.759 
to find bred non-gmo corn seed these
days<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:03.030> there's<00:04:03.629> just<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:04.019> quick<00:04:04.230> look<00:04:04.439> at<00:04:04.709> our

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
days so there's just a quick look at our

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:12.679 
days so there's just a quick look at our
corn<00:04:05.489> as<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:06.629> can<00:04:06.810> see<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:12.060> our<00:04:12.239> corn<00:04:12.510> is

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
corn as you can see so our corn is

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.759 
corn as you can see so our corn is
coming<00:04:13.019> along<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.530> as<00:04:14.189> you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:14.459> see<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.909> just

starting to make and look down here got

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.100 
starting to make and look down here got
one<00:04:22.710> here<00:04:23.280> there's<00:04:24.180> some<00:04:24.419> more<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.840> back
