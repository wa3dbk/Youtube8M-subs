 If you like it and want to know how 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.790
 I made it good that the video is seen first 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.730

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.839
 eye test and apply it throughout the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.839
 eyelid mobile 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.910

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.400
 Yes now 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.400

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 umbrella 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.570
 of this color as half brown appointment with 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.120
 golden with many little stars then 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.149
 use this one of him 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.149
 and he's going to apply it with this little pin 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.630
 so all over the beard and up here from 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.630
 the basin also 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.520
 and now I'm going to grab these umbrellas 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.260
 blank is like a white with many 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.750
 flashes with many glitter 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.790
 and I'm going to apply 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.790
 near the tear here 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.560
 A) Yes 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.780
 and so 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.090
 Now let's apply a little more 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.140
 the brown quote that first at 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.140
 beginning of this one 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.690
 what 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.030
 and I'm going to grab this brown cited that is 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.310
 as a color more clarito plus matecito and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.600
 I 'm going to apply it in the eye socket 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.470
 to give it more definition 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.470
 oh what 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.820
 here 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.430
 So we give you a little more 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.430
 depth and intensity at 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.209
 what are you taking 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.690
 and so now with another pincelito I'm going to 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.770
 win and will put the same umbrella 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.530
 that we use in the second step is 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.210
 blanquita with spirits and I'm going to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.210
 apply below the eyebrows 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.660
 A) Yes 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.370
 the next step we're going to grab a pencil 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.040
 milestone or how you fill in the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.360
 eyebrows with shadow with pencil me in this 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.150
 case I will use this the dressing of 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.860
 brown color to fill them a little 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.680
 because like you to her always 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.780
 use the super-tight cities and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.450
 depending on the look he sometimes uses them 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.450
 as more chubby or finite 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.780
 a little bit 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.640
 yes 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.260
 and now let's think a super step 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.140
 important that is the delineated in black 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.640
 that is how fundamental to give it 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.500
 that dramatic touch that she always 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.989
 has as well as intrigued works and 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.840
 little things so good we're going to win a pencil 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.210
 black and we're going to use the line in the 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.860
 top part this time and we're going to 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.530
 get super takes off the tear 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.540
 while more out of the eye we go 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.540
 going wider and more on the line 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.509
 well since we have our our 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:56.099
 eyeliner in black on the part 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:59.319
 top now let's go to the tabs 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:02.949
 and it 's clear that this look called for 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:05.530
 to use much much much much mask 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.630
 so we can see the leaves so super 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.000
 intense then I'm going to apply quite 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.000
 I'm going to use this rimmel london 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.950
 complicate two chapels to make them look 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.950
 more dramatic 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.120
 and we are going to apply a little in the part 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.120
 lower 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.950
 and we apply our top coat 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.850
 then we have our eyes painted 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.160
 now let's go to the mouth this look what 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.110
 I will use with super mouth 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.440
 striking as I already use it and 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.110
 for this I'm going to apply this little red 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.550
 It's like a little redhead with golden brown 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.900
 I think it's super cute and it would be 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.900
 very good with this look 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.380
 well and we're going to apply a little bit of 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.490
 bronzer so you can see us more 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.490
 pronounced in the temples 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.720
 so and now he's going to put my hair to 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.720
 half 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.910
 although you already know that from the hair I 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.560
 combed like that more or less as she usually 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.590
 combing like that is how the look looks 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.780
 full 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.300
