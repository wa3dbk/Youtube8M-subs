 I'm starting it 's the third day and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 there are many more days left today 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.170
 this is going to be a boxing is from houston and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.480
 here two cubes are supposed to come 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.109
 then let's open it I imagine that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.109
 break it 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.440
 okay 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.750
 It is the first cube 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.750
 here is the second cube 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.850
 that there is nothing left of the bag 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.449
 let's throw that ok is what comes in 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.550
 the box are some cards from haiti store 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.829
 I'll focus on them if they like there 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.469
 take the phone the name and everything 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.899
 facebook twitter and this is where always 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.420
 you commit cubes because many have 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.869
 asked then let's leave it for 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.409
 here to see and so brings several 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.520
 nothing cards look here there are more let's 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.520
 focus what is 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.650
 this package brings two cubes and brings 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.010
 gift this lubricant with some stickers 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.010
 lets go see it 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.270
 and there's the lubricant there's club 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.270
 and here we are going to open this 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.009
 bring stickers 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.530
 ready from houston and let's move on what 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.700
 important that cubes are like 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.229
 they saw this is a really cool 4x4 and this 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.100
 it is an elusive 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.000
 let's open the skiff this first to 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.040
 Well, start 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.080
 ok the box I liked this pretty the box 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.080
 let's go to use the scissors 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.389
 there it is a skiff and I bought it then 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.100
 as it was already made official and all that thing 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:29.970
 well 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.930
 oh my god I do not know how to turn this 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.570
 that something out there is very good 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.970
 we will do well to do the first time 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.870
 that I try one this can also be 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.989
 turn 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.989
 ok I guess this is also 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.690
 Oh 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.920
 although it was very good but the truth 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.410
 I do not know how to rotate it and well I'm going to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.620
 learn to arm then I will do a tutorial 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.140
 of this and tomorrow I will do a review of 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.780
 any of the two cubes 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.420
 and maybe do not join with the tutorial yet 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.000
 I do not know, but his turn is very 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.000
 well to be to get it out of the box 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.310
 and well this is just a boxing not us 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.920
 we are going to take a lot of time he will come 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.580
 tomorrow I like colors like I do not 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.920
 they are the originals but they are not either 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.890
 phosphorescent although there are here I have two 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.520
 cubes this is' a sanchis with stickers 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.080
 originals and see how it changes little or 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.069
 it's like this is a bit more 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.170
 opaque 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.650
 they were like brighter these 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.030
 but they are not phosphorescent either 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.670
 there you get to notice they are not 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.999
 phosphorescent are like a point 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.700
 intermediate between normal and 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:54.340
 phosphorescent then let's move on with 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.980
 the second cube here we have our 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.739
 second cube and as you can see it's very 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.870
 cool psuv and well he had seen in many 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.569
 forums many youtube channels that all 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.730
 the world is buying is very and there 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.919
 very good answers that is very good 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.590
 so I said then because nothing is going to 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:15.290
 ask for it and well then here we have it 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.709
 as always a box 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.220
 white because he asked for it in black base 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:26.560
 then let's open it here I have my 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:30.220
 4x4 simpson to compare it 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.370
 as always here it brings an instructive 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.060
 it does not do any good to see if it 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.060
 help but good 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.339
 and there it is 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.310
 It was a bit like hard 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.879
 I feel like a little bit of europe I think 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.879
 I'll have to adjust it or I do not know 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.569
 it looks good let's compare it so much 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:05.270
 with the show show 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:08.720
 of the measures are the same 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.670
 are the same measurements and stickers 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.830
 this is like they are square and 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:16.220
 they cover the whole picture and this is how 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.980
 which are square but rounded 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.730
 the corners and the base looks very good 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.590
 black and so coming out of the box like that 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.040
 I expected another impression 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.010
 I feel very hard very dry but good 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.160
 it's the first impression and I'm going to do 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.190
 also something from Cuba and already lubricated 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.170
 adjusted and everything because until now 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.740
 this and has a little hair I feel here better 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.590
 this zhengzhou faster than this one 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.060
 I feel like hard hard to move 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.520
 so then I'm going to lubricate it and 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.620
 do everything he has to do and 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.310
 let's see how it looks okay 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.920
 after making them spinning a good time 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.409
 this my conclusions are that skiing 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.380
 it is excellently good 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:06.860
 turn perfectly 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.550
 and I loved it but pge this one like that 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.050
 it's half hard then I'll do it 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.500
 everything I have to do as I said 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.780
 a moment ago and good also the 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.520
 contrast of the colors this one looks 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.860
 good color is normal and this as well 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.570
 I have loved so much like me 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.750
 gave phosphor colors and combines very well 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.400
 with all and well that will be all the 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.260
