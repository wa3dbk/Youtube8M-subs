on the other side it says don't know if

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.360 
on the other side it says don't know if
you<00:02:29.239> can<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.840> this<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.380> me<00:02:30.709> in<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:30.920> USA

so

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.510 

pretty<00:02:38.020> smooth<00:02:38.350> flipping<00:02:39.870> feels<00:02:40.870> good<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.220> I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
pretty smooth flipping feels good and I

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.440 
pretty smooth flipping feels good and I
thought<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.850> was<00:02:42.940> going<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> little

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
thought it was going to be a little

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.190 
thought it was going to be a little
heavy<00:02:43.720> heavy<00:02:44.410> because<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:46.600> five<00:02:46.900> point<00:02:47.140> two

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
heavy heavy because it's five point two

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.090 
heavy heavy because it's five point two
ounces<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:49.350> apparently<00:02:50.350> people<00:02:50.680> say<00:02:50.860> that's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
ounces and apparently people say that's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.220 
ounces and apparently people say that's
pretty<00:02:51.430> heavy<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:52.600> it's<00:02:52.810> not<00:02:53.020> that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
pretty heavy for it but it's not that

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.470 
pretty heavy for it but it's not that
heavy<00:02:53.380> at<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:54.760> feels<00:02:55.060> normal<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:57.480> it's

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
heavy at all it feels normal but it's

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
heavy at all it feels normal but it's
pretty<00:02:58.690> good<00:03:01.710> it's<00:03:02.710> pretty<00:03:02.950> smooth<00:03:03.630> so

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
pretty good it's pretty smooth so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:15.570 
pretty good it's pretty smooth so
I'll<00:03:06.980> do<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.310> paper<00:03:07.640> test<00:03:07.940> rap<00:03:12.400> sheet<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.490> paper

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
I'll do a paper test rap sheet of paper

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:44.400 
I'll do a paper test rap sheet of paper
so<00:03:17.110> pretty<00:03:23.800> clean-cut

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.580 

seems<00:03:45.130> pretty<00:03:45.250> sharp<00:03:45.610> though<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:47.020> I<00:03:47.320> don't

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
seems pretty sharp though so I don't

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.500 
seems pretty sharp though so I don't
know<00:03:47.860> why<00:03:48.070> it's<00:03:48.280> not<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:51.330> cutting<00:03:52.330> right

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
know why it's not like cutting right

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.860 
know why it's not like cutting right
through<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:53.070> but<00:03:54.070> that's<00:03:54.820> all<00:03:54.970> right<00:03:55.090> I<00:03:55.330> really

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
through it but that's all right I really

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.110 
through it but that's all right I really
needed<00:03:56.050> that<00:03:56.200> shirt<00:03:56.820> because<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.910> don't<00:03:58.090> want

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
needed that shirt because I don't want

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.860 
needed that shirt because I don't want
to<00:03:58.300> have<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.450> bad<00:03:58.630> cut<00:03:59.220> yeah<00:04:01.740> so<00:04:03.240> that<00:04:04.240> is<00:04:04.450> a

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870
