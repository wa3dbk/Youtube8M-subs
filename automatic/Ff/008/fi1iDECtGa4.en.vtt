work<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.720> if<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.590> comes<00:01:57.890> out<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.580> little<00:01:58.670> bit

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
work and if it comes out a little bit

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.890 
work and if it comes out a little bit
wider<00:01:59.450> than<00:01:59.660> normally<00:02:00.440> well<00:02:00.920> that's<00:02:01.220> fine<00:02:01.460> and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
wider than normally well that's fine and

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.390 
wider than normally well that's fine and
here<00:02:02.900> i<00:02:02.930> don't<00:02:03.170> know<00:02:03.410> if<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:03.590> can<00:02:03.890> look<00:02:04.190> at<00:02:04.369> it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
but it looks dry you know it features

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.140 
but it looks dry you know it features
its<00:02:07.790> Patti<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.720> not<00:02:09.380> very<00:02:10.150> smooth

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
its Patti and not very smooth

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.100

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
continue and see how it works and see

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:38.800 
continue and see how it works and see
how<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.260> looks<00:02:18.290> at<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.920> end

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.190 

you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.259 

let's<00:02:45.200> move<00:02:45.379> on<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.860> mascara<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.610> as<00:02:47.060> you

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
let's move on to the mascara and as you

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.569 
let's move on to the mascara and as you
get<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.540> see<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.019> color<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.439> beautiful<00:02:48.860> it's

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
get to see the color is beautiful it's

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.690 
get to see the color is beautiful it's
like<00:02:49.790> electric<00:02:50.480> blue<00:02:50.810> very<00:02:51.799> very<00:02:52.040> intense<00:02:52.459> I

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
like electric blue very very intense I

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.420 
like electric blue very very intense I
in<00:02:53.239> love<00:02:53.810> I'm<00:02:54.049> not<00:02:54.260> going<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> deny<00:02:54.709> them<00:02:55.189> I'm

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
in love I'm not going to deny them I'm

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.429 
in love I'm not going to deny them I'm
very<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:56.000> love<00:02:56.120> with<00:02:56.269> it<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.569> I'm<00:02:57.170> going<00:02:57.379> to

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
very in love with it and I'm going to

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.740 
very in love with it and I'm going to
apply<00:02:57.590> it<00:02:57.890> on<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.250> upper<00:02:58.640> lashes<00:02:58.879> and<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.599> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
apply it on the upper lashes and on the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.899 
apply it on the upper lashes and on the
bottom<00:02:59.900> lashes<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:00.860> maybe<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.400> way<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:01.640> get

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
bottom lashes so maybe that way you get

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:11.940 
bottom lashes so maybe that way you get
to<00:03:01.970> ceiling<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.569> better<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.079> color

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.820

lashes I have no complaints about this
it's<00:03:33.790> pretty<00:03:34.790> good<00:03:35.030> now<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.410> push-up<00:03:36.860> liner<00:03:36.890> I

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
it's pretty good now the push-up liner I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.130 
it's pretty good now the push-up liner I
just<00:03:38.420> feel<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.350> is<00:03:40.060> dry<00:03:41.060> all<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.390> time<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.930> don't

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
just feel it is dry all the time I don't

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.320 
just feel it is dry all the time I don't
know<00:03:42.200> why<00:03:42.380> but<00:03:42.740> it<00:03:43.610> just<00:03:43.640> creates<00:03:44.120> these

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
know why but it just creates these

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.380 
know why but it just creates these
little<00:03:44.750> bumps<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:46.400> just<00:03:46.610> feels<00:03:46.820> dry<00:03:47.090> I

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
little bumps and it just feels dry I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.790 
little bumps and it just feels dry I
don't<00:03:47.600> know<00:03:47.690> why<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.900> don't<00:03:48.170> know<00:03:48.260> if<00:03:48.350> it's<00:03:48.530> mine

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
don't know why I don't know if it's mine

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.850 
don't know why I don't know if it's mine
or<00:03:49.160> it's<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.420> general<00:03:50.630> formula<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.620> all

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
or it's just the general formula of all

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.060 
or it's just the general formula of all
of<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.160> liners<00:03:52.610> but<00:03:52.640> I<00:03:52.940> find<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.710> kind<00:03:54.710> of<00:03:54.800> hard

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
of the liners but I find it kind of hard

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.880 
of the liners but I find it kind of hard
to<00:03:55.400> work<00:03:56.000> with<00:03:56.210> I<00:03:56.510> like<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.320> color<00:03:57.560> though

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
to work with I like the color though

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.750 
to work with I like the color though
it's<00:03:58.220> really<00:03:59.150> a<00:03:59.450> classic<00:04:00.380> blue<00:04:01.070> knob<00:04:01.580> that

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
it's really a classic blue knob that

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.790 
it's really a classic blue knob that
Navy<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.540> just<00:04:02.900> it's<00:04:03.590> great<00:04:04.070> for<00:04:04.460> brown<00:04:05.330> eyes

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
Navy it just it's great for brown eyes

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.550 
Navy it just it's great for brown eyes
but<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.340> formula<00:04:07.910> is<00:04:08.060> just<00:04:08.450> not<00:04:08.720> for<00:04:08.750> me<00:04:09.020> how

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
but the formula is just not for me how

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.700 
but the formula is just not for me how
many<00:04:10.010> dots<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.730> just<00:04:11.090> lines<00:04:11.450> I<00:04:11.750> try<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.410> make

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
many dots and just lines I try to make

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.850 
many dots and just lines I try to make
before<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.550> just<00:04:14.030> doing<00:04:14.510> my<00:04:14.660> liner<00:04:15.020> trying<00:04:15.590> to

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
before I just doing my liner trying to

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.280 
before I just doing my liner trying to
get<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.280> not<00:04:17.270> dry<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.900> know<00:04:18.020> I<00:04:18.049> was<00:04:18.140> thinking

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
get it not dry you know I was thinking

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.410 
get it not dry you know I was thinking
maybe<00:04:18.739> this<00:04:19.010> first<00:04:19.340> layer<00:04:19.609> is<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.940> little<00:04:20.299> bit

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
maybe this first layer is a little bit

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.180 
maybe this first layer is a little bit
dry<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:21.049> know<00:04:21.200> maybe<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:21.859> because<00:04:22.070> it's

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
dry you know maybe just because it's

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.310 
dry you know maybe just because it's
waiting<00:04:22.550> there<00:04:22.700> for<00:04:22.730> me<00:04:22.910> to<00:04:23.090> try<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.660> it's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
waiting there for me to try it and it's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.410 
waiting there for me to try it and it's
just<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.560> little<00:04:24.740> bit<00:04:24.830> old<00:04:25.040> but<00:04:25.340> no<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:25.730> mean<00:04:26.180> it's

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
just a little bit old but no I mean it's

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.650 
just a little bit old but no I mean it's
