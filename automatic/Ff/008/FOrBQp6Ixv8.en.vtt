00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.360
 well then have a crack urso a trick 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.909
 which is used when recording the batteries mm local studio as not very 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.289
 big 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.570
 and well really the trick is to practice the reverb generates the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.900
 battery what we recorded that this year can be done 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.989
 if you have recorded the battery with a midi instruments library 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.650
 if you want to make a date a little more more creams take real 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.120
 james can be applied 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.140
 this is what you're going to do the next percent I already selected one for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 apart from the theme 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.550
 that's why we're going to do it in the mix 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.550
 in lowering the hype levels 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.680
 Once this is done, what we do is 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.010
 export the whole battery not in this case are going to be a few bars 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.190
 but you what are you Cáceres export all the battery killing the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.430
 tracks 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 from the first beat to the last 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.190
 then we will export 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.760
 audio mix 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 here what we have is that to click this case the tabs to study folder of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.960
 project audio 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.289
 we have to click the pulti tab the spain track audio track 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.510
 so that the export we appear in the project 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.550
 by the way we put a man on the track 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.550
 and we export 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.550
 well percent we see that appears aquila 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.750
 Mena I bring it up here to have it more at hand and what we do is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.810
 the next 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.979
 we apply are let's listen to the track that mohsén 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 is a spokesperson 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.959
 this is days ago 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.719
 what we do is to apply a reverberating mountain to this track 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.859
 we can use directly 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.859
 are the koshino shipments 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.299
 go let's go to oviedo 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.729
 if we made the track 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.039
 let's go to oviedo 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:35.019
 We apply a plugin that bows if there is a network of its own 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.359
 kutxa 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.359
 a reverb because it cuts 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.249
 we hear 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 it's more or less 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.009
 now the track 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.009
 has its reverse 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.419
 and what we do now is go back to the mix raise the hype levels 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.079
 how was it 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.299
 not how we keep at the beginning eight tenths matter 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.909
 Pedraz and that is very high 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.279
 see the differences 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.319
 moody's dedicated g more body takes another peak color g that feeling benavente 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 before xala do not start use in general 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.599
 Well, this has been the resource the trick, I do not expect it to be useful for us 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.209
 your songs
