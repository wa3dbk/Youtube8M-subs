00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.140

 team is playing very well I want 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.070
 it's like being a very strange sense to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.350
 sit in the insular center outside 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.350
 court but supporting the team 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.100
 with different feeling to me normally 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.380
 is sitting on the bench in the 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.670
 court but I'm very happy is going to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.520

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.369
 I want to talk to my friends and see the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.479
 match and support the team when they 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.479
 they win against the regulation 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.659
 I have a lot 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.840
 on the court, do not be 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.079
 one thing 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.840
 the memory is always is reaching the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.840
 court with the fans asking for my name 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.209
 in matches the game with when you 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.240
 get the two free throws then to the 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.830
 extension against 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:27.220
 youth at home the glasses of the cups 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.700
 the beaches are many 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.940
 out of court is not 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.920
 eating on the beach with cons and 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.330
 marcus norris 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.820
 to English 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.450
 my time here I have many friends from 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.620
 basketball 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.620
 I always have a 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.120
 a place in my heart for for this 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.810
 club because it's a part of my life is 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.290
 very important to my life 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.290
 my love 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.420
 now I'm not not nervous but when 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.570
 he enters the pavilion when he sees the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.570
 faces of the hobby I think will be very 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.570
 exciting 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.900
 ten years of my life playing here in 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.900
 front of the marine tide 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.819
 It is a very important thing 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.739
 m 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.030
 grancanaria the team game more years than 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.400
 my life 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.000
 Game Four years in college or 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.600
 school but ten years here with the same 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.790
 team is is very strange especially 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.790
 with a New Yorker a foreigner 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.950
 but my first years here the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.860
 difference and I believe between this club and 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.930
 the others and not knowing why not 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.050
 I understand a lot with us teams 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.870
 because good here I tola 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.720
 but my life but here is a family 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.780
 among the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.320
 team managers the coaches or 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:20.079
 players is a team is a community 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.510
 and it's one thing this club is very 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.370
 important 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.040
 because we always have as many 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.460
 foreigners and when they arrive at 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.460
 palms 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.210
 they come to the family of white and 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.860
 that is very important for your life outside 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:45.370
 of balance this is easier 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.370
 it's easier to be part of the club 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.330
 and now 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.840
 jim moran today has more weight less 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.840
 hair 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.860
 I do not know now 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:06.889
 I am 22 years old when 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:11.740
 when I play my first match in the acb 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:15.009
 every match between the court with nerves 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.940
 playing with the best players in the league 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:21.020
 but 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:25.660
 with years I gain more experience and I can 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:29.560
 change my place in the team 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.780
 but help the young tomÃ¡s bellas 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.750

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.660
 trust 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.990
 and graphics are the captains is 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.689
 different when I finish my career here 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.499
 with another staff 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.499

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.870
 because every summer when I go back to 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.450

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.420
 I talk to my family and I say we have 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.910
 the best fans in the world 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.370
 they travel 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.340

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.570
 fans here 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:35.110
 and I hope to see the faces of my family 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:39.930
 when between them they enter the court and 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.930
 the track and they can see the plane full 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.650
 with a very exciting fan 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:50.250

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.250
