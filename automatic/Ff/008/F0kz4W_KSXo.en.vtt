00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.800
 what do you see here from their own backyard well that was 3 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.719
 growing orange went the ball 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.829
 and that was so rap rap says erik everyday was very strange saved they were 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:15.939
 not he 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.769
 they were really that big and the other one actually thought it was between van 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.239
 seen from this and are 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.900
 she said they were up 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 harvest the sport plane 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609
 and I've seen it, ehs 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.649
 here we were and then 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.120
 and they went direction goes above this house i saw three lights 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.140
 and they were there for each other 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 Well that was fantastic that I am my daughter-in-law who will be with me later 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.140
 I went to get it and there it was a light pole eleven 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.150
 flew off 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.420
 moments later it would have been there to attract the routes on the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.130
 The Observatory in Middelburg will explain what they think it was 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.140
 sounds strange but a bouncing ball bulky makes the crown doinchem 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.570
 and there it comes 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.570
 maxime lestienne 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.900
 that writes among a number it rises 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.350
 it will be a bit like the eighties 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.410
 and therefore it goes up in the air 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.650
 and then it is very difficult to estimate because that is the height 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.080
 because there is no background 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.270
 it is difficult to compare what the distances are 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.260
 but there it seems that now it does indeed look like some sort of 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.970
 balloons 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.210
 but if it is up to its old age it looks like yes it also just has one 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.310
 balloon in the color 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.050
 and who is frequently in the hot air 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.830
 and it goes with the wind and that is the whole phenomenon or some 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.790
 people think that should be before 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.520
 but yes everyone frame to follow which does not fly by immediately and is one 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.280
 accident 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.030
 the balloons belong to his home a tradition annual thanksgiving to the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.799
 goddess 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.520
 admire its just to buy a tree shops a pity but unfortunately so no mistake 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.479
 I just inexplicably think of invaders on the campsite 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.680
 last time 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.220
 and there I am dismissed as my own beer 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.750
 with tea lights but that is not the case 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.009
 and what do you think 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.899
 I also do not think that 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.570
 something is it must be something else such they were when i might be in 100 years 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.029
 are it affectionate 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.529
 but it was very special to see really clearly this is really going to tell 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.839
 that the tea lights are definitely not sure either 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:25.109
