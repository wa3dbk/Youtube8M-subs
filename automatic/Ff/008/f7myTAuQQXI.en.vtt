paddle here under the bridge I'm not

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.540 
paddle here under the bridge I'm not
sure<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.550> tide<00:00:33.000> pulling<00:00:33.450> me<00:00:33.540> out<00:00:33.570> or<00:00:34.550> how

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
sure this is tide pulling me out or how

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:53.900 
sure this is tide pulling me out or how
much<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:38.250> wind<00:00:52.699> tide<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> going

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
much is actually the wind tide is going

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.510 
much is actually the wind tide is going
out<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> wind<00:00:55.260> has<00:00:55.469> picked<00:00:56.340> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
out but I think the wind has picked it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.729 
out but I think the wind has picked it
up<00:00:56.550> cause<00:00:56.629> Excel<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:58.340> slightly<00:00:59.340> bowed<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.739> few
