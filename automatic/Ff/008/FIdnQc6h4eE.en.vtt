00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
sections so this is just our first

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.130 
sections so this is just our first
section<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:32.059> does<00:00:32.239> not<00:00:32.419> have<00:00:32.629> to<00:00:32.660> be<00:00:32.809> neat

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
section it does not have to be neat

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.140 
section it does not have to be neat
because<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.770> waves<00:00:33.980> will<00:00:34.280> all<00:00:34.430> blend<00:00:34.820> in<00:00:35.000> very

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
because the waves will all blend in very

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.720 
because the waves will all blend in very
nicely<00:00:35.570> together<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:36.530> then<00:00:37.220> i'm<00:00:37.340> using<00:00:37.460> a

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
nicely together and then i'm using a

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.610 
nicely together and then i'm using a
large<00:00:38.000> curling<00:00:38.480> iron<00:00:38.629> i<00:00:38.809> will<00:00:38.960> put<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.170> exact

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
large curling iron i will put the exact

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.829 
large curling iron i will put the exact
inches<00:00:40.070> down<00:00:40.309> below<00:00:40.640> for<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.300> i'm

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
inches down below for you and i'm

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:43.479 
inches down below for you and i'm
curling<00:00:42.140> away<00:00:42.440> from<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.769> face<00:00:42.949> so<00:00:43.190> i<00:00:43.220> just

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
curling away from the face so i just

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.310 
curling away from the face so i just
split<00:00:43.760> that<00:00:43.909> first<00:00:44.239> section<00:00:44.659> into<00:00:45.080> two<00:00:45.290> large

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
split that first section into two large

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.100 
split that first section into two large
panels<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:47.239> don't<00:00:47.479> want<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.690> hold<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.930> too

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
panels and you don't want to hold it too

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.689 
panels and you don't want to hold it too
long<00:00:48.140> because<00:00:48.530> your<00:00:48.769> bottom<00:00:49.070> section<00:00:49.460> does

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
long because your bottom section does

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.250 
long because your bottom section does
not<00:00:49.729> want<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.150> be<00:00:50.210> very<00:00:50.449> tight<00:00:50.780> because<00:00:51.140> you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
not want to be very tight because you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.890 
not want to be very tight because you
want<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.500> have<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.769> really<00:00:52.129> nice<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.489> length

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
want to have that really nice to length

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.920 
want to have that really nice to length
so<00:00:53.979> this<00:00:54.979> is<00:00:55.129> now<00:00:55.309> my<00:00:55.339> second<00:00:55.909> section<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:56.870> i'm

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
so this is now my second section so i'm

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.110 
so this is now my second section so i'm
doing<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.350> exact<00:00:57.680> same<00:00:57.710> thing<00:00:58.220> taking<00:00:58.699> quite

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
doing the exact same thing taking quite

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.119 
doing the exact same thing taking quite
large<00:00:59.360> panels<00:00:59.839> and<00:01:00.049> waving<00:01:00.589> them<00:01:00.710> away<00:01:00.920> from

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
large panels and waving them away from

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.920 
large panels and waving them away from
my<00:01:01.220> face<00:01:01.430> but<00:01:01.760> i'm<00:01:01.909> going<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.150> hold<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.540> second

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
my face but i'm going to hold the second

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.710 
my face but i'm going to hold the second
second<00:01:03.739> section<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.430> little<00:01:04.729> bit<00:01:04.850> longer<00:01:05.030> so

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
second section a little bit longer so

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.090 
second section a little bit longer so
that<00:01:05.840> way<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.020> have<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.260> more<00:01:06.530> tighter<00:01:06.830> and

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
that way you have a more tighter and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.789 
that way you have a more tighter and
wavy<00:01:07.909> or<00:01:07.940> curl<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:08.510> that<00:01:08.690> is<00:01:08.900> what<00:01:09.229> half<00:01:09.440> of<00:01:09.650> my

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
wavy or curl so that is what half of my

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.310 
wavy or curl so that is what half of my
head<00:01:10.010> looks<00:01:10.250> like<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.790> then<00:01:11.659> this<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.170> our

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
head looks like and then this is our

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.050 
head looks like and then this is our
third<00:01:12.560> section<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.340> i'm<00:01:13.430> doing<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.760> exact

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
third section so i'm doing the exact

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.240 
third section so i'm doing the exact
same<00:01:14.090> thing<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.990> can<00:01:15.140> also<00:01:15.290> mix<00:01:15.590> up<00:01:15.830> by<00:01:16.040> using

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
same thing you can also mix up by using

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.610 
same thing you can also mix up by using
smaller<00:01:16.820> sections<00:01:17.330> as<00:01:17.480> well<00:01:17.510> and<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.470> now

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
smaller sections as well and this is now

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.550 
smaller sections as well and this is now
our<00:01:18.650> last<00:01:18.920> section<00:01:19.460> or<00:01:19.610> fourth<00:01:19.940> section<00:01:20.560> so

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
our last section or fourth section so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.960 
our last section or fourth section so

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
i'm just going to be doing the exact

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.090 
i'm just going to be doing the exact
same<00:01:23.000> thing<00:01:23.540> it's<00:01:23.780> super<00:01:24.260> easy<00:01:24.440> especially

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
same thing it's super easy especially

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.200 
same thing it's super easy especially
when<00:01:25.400> you<00:01:25.490> have<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.670> stake<00:01:25.970> for<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.330> lion

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
when you have a stake for the lion

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.140 
when you have a stake for the lion
and<00:01:27.680> then<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> completely<00:01:29.700> look<00:01:29.940> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and then that is the completely look so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
and then that is the completely look so
it's<00:01:30.299> nice<00:01:30.510> and<00:01:30.750> super<00:01:31.140> wavy<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.740> we're<00:01:31.860> just

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's nice and super wavy so we're just

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's nice and super wavy so we're just
going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.190> spray<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.119> some

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
going to spray that down with some

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.410 
going to spray that down with some
hairspray<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.729> then<00:01:35.729> we're<00:01:35.970> also<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
hairspray and then we're also going to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
hairspray and then we're also going to
flip<00:01:36.659> our<00:01:36.810> head<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.560> we're<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.070> to

continue spraying that with hairspray

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.749 
continue spraying that with hairspray
and<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.650> follow<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.159> step<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.490> couple

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and you can follow the step a couple
