00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
underneath a main block and both sides

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.350 
underneath a main block and both sides
and<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> want<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.110> pistons<00:01:38.360> sorry

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
have done that and then you want to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980 
have done that and then you want to
place<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.890> pistons<00:01:44.280> alone<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.000> on

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
place your pistons alone like that on

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.149 
place your pistons alone like that on
both<00:01:46.229> sides<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> now<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.140> your<00:01:49.590> pistons

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
both sides so now you have your pistons

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.020 
both sides so now you have your pistons
I<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:52.710> both<00:01:53.399> sides<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I don't like that on both sides of the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.590 
I don't like that on both sides of the
UM<00:01:54.259> thing<00:01:55.700> then<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.969> place<00:01:57.180> your

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
UM thing then you want to place your

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.139 
UM thing then you want to place your
blocks<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.740> sandstone<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.969> use

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
blocks your like sandstone don't use

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.100 
blocks your like sandstone don't use
sand<00:02:00.540> because<00:02:00.990> I'm<00:02:02.180> very<00:02:03.180> efficient<00:02:03.780> just

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
sand because I'm very efficient just

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
sand because I'm very efficient just
balls<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.799> stuff<00:02:05.299> okay<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.689> want<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
balls and stuff okay then you want to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.380 
balls and stuff okay then you want to
dig<00:02:07.110> twice<00:02:07.469> down<00:02:08.720> not<00:02:09.720> three<00:02:09.929> times<00:02:11.180> on<00:02:12.180> both

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
dig twice down not three times on both

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.020 
dig twice down not three times on both
sides

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
sides

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.820 
sides
and<00:02:16.160> twice<00:02:17.160> back<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> got<00:02:18.209> twice<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.470> depth

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and twice back so you got twice to depth

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.020 
and twice back so you got twice to depth
and<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:22.050> whip<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:23.340> doesn't<00:02:23.580> matter<00:02:23.730> about<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
and to whip it doesn't matter about the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.210 
and to whip it doesn't matter about the
length<00:02:24.209> depends<00:02:24.870> how<00:02:24.959> many<00:02:25.080> customs<00:02:26.069> you've

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
length depends how many customs you've

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.640 
length depends how many customs you've
laid<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.880> that's<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.209> length<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:29.610> width

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
laid down so that's the length to width

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.780 
laid down so that's the length to width
and<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:32.700> death<00:02:33.770> okay<00:02:34.770> then<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.580> want<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and to death okay then what you want to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
and to death okay then what you want to
do<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.060> get<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.569> place<00:02:37.230> your<00:02:37.350> repeaters

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
do is get in and place your repeaters

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.630 
do is get in and place your repeaters
down<00:02:39.350> like<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:40.860> place<00:02:41.069> your<00:02:41.100> redstone

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
down like so then place your redstone

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.870 
down like so then place your redstone
and<00:02:42.800> then<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> want<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.069> dig<00:02:44.310> through<00:02:44.580> like

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
and then you want to dig through like

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.170 
and then you want to dig through like
this<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.600> where<00:02:47.870> your<00:02:48.870> price<00:02:49.110> pleats<00:02:49.410> are<00:02:49.650> and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
this to where your price pleats are and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.080 
this to where your price pleats are and
replace<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.360> block<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.750> was<00:02:52.050> there<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:53.090> I'm

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
replace the block that was there and I'm

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.840 
replace the block that was there and I'm
just<00:02:54.269> gonna<00:02:54.360> quit<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.690> pray<00:02:55.370> pressure<00:02:56.370> put<00:02:56.700> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
just gonna quit it pray pressure put a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.410 
just gonna quit it pray pressure put a
little<00:02:57.120> pressure<00:02:57.540> pads<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.239> want

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
little pressure pads there and you want

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.100 
little pressure pads there and you want
an<00:03:00.510> inverter<00:03:00.870> here<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.040> place<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> block

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
an inverter here so you place a block

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.080 
an inverter here so you place a block
yeah<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.290> was<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.470> place<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> block<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.940> get

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
yeah that was you place a block and get

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.840 
yeah that was you place a block and get
a<00:03:06.120> redstone<00:03:06.450> torch<00:03:09.950> place<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.100> like<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.400> and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
a redstone torch place it like that and

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.400 
a redstone torch place it like that and
then<00:03:12.030> another<00:03:12.150> block<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.750> then<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.230> other

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
then another block and then the other

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.800 
then another block and then the other
side<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.769> place<00:03:13.980> your<00:03:14.970> normal<00:03:16.579> redstone<00:03:17.810> okay

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
side you place your normal redstone okay

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:28.630 
side you place your normal redstone okay
like<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:21.560> get<00:03:22.560> my<00:03:22.709> shovel<00:03:22.980> back<00:03:25.010> oops

you<00:03:41.010> know<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.220> doesn't<00:03:41.430> matter<00:03:41.549> just<00:03:42.650> dig

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
you know it doesn't matter just dig

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.770 
you know it doesn't matter just dig
along<00:03:43.980> with<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.310> however<00:03:44.850> deep<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.450> want<00:03:45.570> just

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780

along with it however deep you want just
make<00:03:45.810> sure<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.170> they<00:03:46.410> can't<00:03:46.620> jump<00:03:46.890> out<00:03:47.010> off<00:03:47.250> so

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
make sure you they can't jump out off so

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.970 
make sure you they can't jump out off so
they're<00:03:47.519> in<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.239> it<00:03:48.329> should<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.570> fun<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.079> make

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
they're in and it should be fun and make

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.840 
they're in and it should be fun and make
sure<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.519> redstone<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:52.040> underneath<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
sure the redstone is underneath the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.800 
sure the redstone is underneath the
pressure<00:03:54.420> plates<00:03:55.820> yeah<00:03:56.820> so<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:57.359> I<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.660> spray

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
pressure plates yeah so if I just spray

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.430 
pressure plates yeah so if I just spray
that<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.079> as<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.470> see<00:03:58.590> it's<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:59.209> know

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
that on as you can see it's you know

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.440 
that on as you can see it's you know
activating<00:04:01.440> when<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.940> underneath<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.209> block

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
activating when it's underneath a block

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.539 
activating when it's underneath a block
of<00:04:03.750> when<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:05.010> what<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> pressure

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
of when the of the what the pressure

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.180 
of when the of the what the pressure
paper<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:07.530> basically<00:04:07.709> just<00:04:07.890> when<00:04:08.070> we

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
paper and you basically just when we

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.250 
paper and you basically just when we
repeat<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.820> other<00:04:09.000> side<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:10.400> take<00:04:11.400> out

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
repeat that the other side so take out

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:25.189 
repeat that the other side so take out
repeaters<00:04:14.630> redstone

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:35.070 

remember<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.319> inverter<00:04:33.120> like<00:04:34.120> sir<00:04:34.389> and

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
remember the inverter like sir and

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.279 
remember the inverter like sir and
that's<00:04:36.009> it<00:04:36.280> then<00:04:36.490> they<00:04:36.639> done<00:04:37.000> you're<00:04:37.569> done<00:04:37.780> so

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
that's it then they done you're done so
