ok the fact that you know they came in

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.940 
ok the fact that you know they came in
with<00:00:51.300> some<00:00:51.450> really<00:00:51.690> big<00:00:51.810> numbers<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
with some really big numbers but you

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.410 
with some really big numbers but you
know<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> first<00:00:53.399> half<00:00:53.730> i<00:00:53.880> think<00:00:54.059> i<00:00:54.120> had<00:00:54.239> them

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
know the first half i think i had them

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.049 
know the first half i think i had them
less<00:00:54.630> than<00:00:54.840> 100<00:00:55.500> yards<00:00:55.530> total<00:00:56.399> offense<00:00:56.670> i

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
less than 100 yards total offense i

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.270 
less than 100 yards total offense i
guess<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.420> shows<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.630> lot<00:00:57.720> about<00:00:57.899> how<00:00:58.320> how
