problem<00:00:55.390> with<00:00:55.629> these<00:00:55.750> guys<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.500> low

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
problem with these guys is that the low

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.779 
problem with these guys is that the low
voltage<00:00:57.010> cutoff<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.660> 64<00:00:58.660> volts<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.789> there's

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
voltage cutoff is 64 volts and there's

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.160 
voltage cutoff is 64 volts and there's
also<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:02.699> high<00:01:03.699> voltage<00:01:03.910> cutoff<00:01:04.300> which<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.930> like

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
also a high voltage cutoff which is like

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.060 
also a high voltage cutoff which is like
90<00:01:06.040> volts<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:06.610> my<00:01:07.450> spare<00:01:08.020> pads<00:01:08.229> were<00:01:08.439> all<00:01:08.560> 6<00:01:08.860> L

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
90 volts so my spare pads were all 6 L

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.550 
90 volts so my spare pads were all 6 L
gave<00:01:09.670> me<00:01:09.820> 100<00:01:10.150> volts<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.479> bike<00:01:10.600> one<00:01:10.750> run<00:01:10.930> so<00:01:11.530> I

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
gave me 100 volts the bike one run so I

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.359
