so you find yourself in a dilemma you
want<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.939> large<00:00:03.840> auto<00:00:04.319> or<00:00:04.859> even<00:00:05.220> assisted<00:00:05.700> blade

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
want a large auto or even assisted blade

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.970 
want a large auto or even assisted blade
would<00:00:06.120> work<00:00:06.330> but<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.990> allows<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.589> your<00:00:07.710> area

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
would work but the allows in your area

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.580 
would work but the allows in your area
don't<00:00:08.160> allow<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.670> an<00:00:08.730> assisted<00:00:09.269> blade<00:00:09.590> you

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
don't allow for an assisted blade you

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.560 
don't allow for an assisted blade you
don't<00:00:10.710> want<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> spend<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.160> ton<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.370> money<00:00:11.580> and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
don't want to spend a ton of money and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.419 
don't want to spend a ton of money and
I'd<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.170> say<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.590> great<00:00:13.830> solution<00:00:14.099> would

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
I'd have to say a great solution would

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.500 
I'd have to say a great solution would
be<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:15.590> Ontario<00:00:16.590> rat<00:00:18.830> 12<00:00:19.830> larger<00:00:20.220> blade<00:00:20.510> three

both with about black pocket clip and a
very<00:00:34.110> cool<00:00:34.410> blade<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.190> folding<00:00:35.489> blade

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
very cool blade and it's a folding blade

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.299 
very cool blade and it's a folding blade
it's<00:00:36.239> not<00:00:36.420> assisted<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
it's not assisted but because of the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's not assisted but because of the
engineering<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> dual<00:00:39.930> sided<00:00:40.170> thumb<00:00:40.440> stud

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
engineering of the dual sided thumb stud

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.700 
engineering of the dual sided thumb stud
I'd<00:00:41.340> say<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.059> position<00:00:42.420> pocket<00:00:42.809> clip<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.559> can

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I'd say for position pocket clip you can

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.049 
I'd say for position pocket clip you can
clip<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.129> pocket<00:00:44.489> however<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> like

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
clip in your pocket however you like

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.020 
clip in your pocket however you like
pull<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.190> get<00:00:47.190> your<00:00:47.340> thumb<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> right

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pull it out get your thumb in the right

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.350 
pull it out get your thumb in the right
position<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.399> late<00:00:50.399> comes<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.820> quickly

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
position and late comes out very quickly

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
position and late comes out very quickly
that<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> folding<00:00:52.140> blade<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:53.280> are<00:00:53.399> very

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that is a folding blade these are very

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.250 
that is a folding blade these are very

YouTube<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.370> wanted<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> bring<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
YouTube I just wanted to bring up the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
YouTube I just wanted to bring up the
fact<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> don't<00:00:57.600> always<00:00:57.840> need<00:00:58.140> an

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
fact that you don't always need an

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.580 
fact that you don't always need an
automatic<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> spring<00:01:00.300> assisted<00:01:00.690> blade<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
automatic or a spring assisted blade to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.219 
automatic or a spring assisted blade to
have<00:01:01.820> rapid<00:01:02.820> blade<00:01:03.149> deployment<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.019> mean<00:01:04.140> if

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
have rapid blade deployment I mean if

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.170 
have rapid blade deployment I mean if
you<00:01:04.290> need<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> wave<00:01:04.650> feature<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.909> something

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you need a wave feature get something

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
you need a wave feature get something
like<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.479> Emerson<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> wave<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
like that Emerson with a wave on it or a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.690 
like that Emerson with a wave on it or a
spyderco<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.540> something<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
spyderco or something like that but the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
spyderco or something like that but the
rat<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.619> engineering<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
rat one because of the engineering of

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.429 
rat one because of the engineering of
where<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> thumb<00:01:14.880> stud<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.330> comes<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.140> very

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
where the thumb stud is comes out very

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.460 
where the thumb stud is comes out very
very<00:01:17.369> quick<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.540> inexpensive<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
very quick it's inexpensive and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.880 
very quick it's inexpensive and
hopefully<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> dilemma<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:22.080> not

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
hopefully if you have the dilemma of not

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
hopefully if you have the dilemma of not
being<00:01:23.100> able<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> own<00:01:23.460> an<00:01:23.610> assisted<00:01:24.090> blade<00:01:24.360> or

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
being able to own an assisted blade or

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.010 
being able to own an assisted blade or
an<00:01:25.110> auto<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.670> could<00:01:26.880> fill<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.689> void

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
an auto that this could fill that void

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.370 
an auto that this could fill that void
if<00:01:28.490> if<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.939> need<00:01:30.119> rapid<00:01:30.600> blade<00:01:30.840> deployment

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
