00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 well guys we have already seen the first ones 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.430
 two operations with their sum and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.440
 the subtraction 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.420
 we then saw that in reality not 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.759
 there is a clear distinction between the two 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.429
 and we can directly refer 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 to the algebraic sum operation now 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.199
 I would like to talk about multiplication e 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.250
 of the division between the relative numbers 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.830
 moretti can you tell me what the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 multiplication prof 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 multiplication a lot 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.429
 physics that allows me to multiply 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.329
 between them two numbers thus obtaining a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.410
 number x another is another x a number 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.450
 or moretti what are you babbling about that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.399
 what we do we try to use 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.440
 a somewhat more understandable language 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.480
 meanwhile we try to say above all 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.039
 smart things 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.059
 oh well let's leave this last thing alone 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.190
 what I've said 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.840
 we were saying multiplication e 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.090
 that operation that matches 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.370
 two numbers a third number obtained 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 performing the diction of many addends 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 equal to the first number 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.579
 how many indicates the second one the same 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.420
 what applies to the relative numbers but va 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.950
 considered the sign the boys are me 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.630
 your simplifying little devil 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.420
 you guys have faces 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.610
 incredibly confusing and you're right 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 explained so I didn't understand it either 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.600
 let's try to clarify a bit first 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.409
 rest assured because it is simpler than 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.540
 what it seems 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.920
 just concentrate a little and remember 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.900
 what is the absolute value of a number 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.490
 its hard snout with no sign 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.759
 we are very good moretti 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.049
 now listened to or carefully 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.549
 we can summarize all the cases that 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.619
 we saw saying the product 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.329
 between two relative numbers is in turn a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.640
 relative number that has value 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.460
 absolute the product of absolute values 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.770
 and as a plus sign the 2 2 numbers are 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.409
 agree and minus 6 2 numbers are 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.960
 disagreement, kids, it's easy enough 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.100
 remembering these two simple things is enough 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740
 then do a simple multiplication 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.540
 with the absolute values ​​of the numbers and then 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.790
 put the sign according to the sign of the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.509
 two numbers I always remember 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.420
 as well as for longer he wants less for less 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.090
 equal more ie the two cases in which you mark 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.269
 I'm something 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.730
 hardy less for more equals less is more for 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.120
 less equal less ie in the two cases in 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.080
 whose signs differ, for example, that 5 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:24.400
 for p5q it takes 25 minus 5 for minus 5 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:29.140
 equal 25 minus 5 for p5 which minus 25 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.989
 5 for less 5 equal at least 25 light 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.459
 no then since you understood everything 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.260
 we can go on with the last one 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.959
 topic of today's division between the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.190
 related you will surely remember for 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.900
 the division the operation it does 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.640
 correspond to two numbers a third 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.190
 number that multiplied by the second 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.799
 this gives the first result 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.329
 also applies to the related continuing 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.019
 but to keep in mind the presence of 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.720
 signs 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.760
 so for example more 12 divided by 3 is 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.129
 equal to four more just because more 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.879
 43 is equal to more 12 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.739
 and so on for the other boys cases 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.510
 even in the case of division there is not 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.340
 need to complicate life 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.200
 the quotient between two relative numbers is 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.940
 still a relative number that has like 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.519
 absolute value and allows values 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.310
 absolute and as a plus sign 2 2 numbers 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.019
 they agree and minus 6 2 numbers are 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.940
 disagree yes boys 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.100
 exactly like multiplication 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.130
 just remember this simple 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.790
 governs both operations 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.680
 always that simple no you died what 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.150
 we do now we can't go wrong 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.060
 once again leads to risk the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.040
 life you are not right we are calm and 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.950
 let's try to think about where it may have been 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.250
 hidden we must think like him where 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.180
 you could hide their lord lord 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.310
 relative mort appearance or sheet on 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.889
 table, however, full of dust and reds 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.389
 moretti because you keep me it seems to me 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.750
 time to think about the police of 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:58.780
 this place hand no ogbonna weapons 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.720
 you understand maybe the dust hid 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.660
 something maybe a sign in front of the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.030
 number see the doors the left one 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.160
 they are number of negative numbers and those 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.799
 on the right are merits with positive numbers 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.069
 maybe the right door was the number 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.700
 minus 7 but yes you are right now 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.690
 I understood 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.690
 let's go come on
