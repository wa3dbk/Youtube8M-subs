00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.270 
hands this does tend to pop out too so
that's<00:01:58.150> just<00:01:58.330> something<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.540> note<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.830> wing

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280

note of is this red section here when

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.230 
note of is this red section here when
you<00:02:36.130> bend<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.490> first<00:02:36.730> part<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.090> knee

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.450 
you bend the first part of the knee
nothing<00:02:38.110> happens<00:02:38.470> when<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.860> bend<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> second

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
nothing happens when you bend the second

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.120 
nothing happens when you bend the second
part<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.930> entire<00:02:40.930> section<00:02:41.200> slides<00:02:41.680> up<00:02:41.950> and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
part that entire section slides up and

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.040 
part that entire section slides up and
you<00:02:42.310> can<00:02:42.460> see<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.790> there's<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.030> sort<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
you can see that there's a sort of a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.560 
you can see that there's a sort of a
rail<00:02:44.890> that<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.250> follows<00:02:45.640> there<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.390> that's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
rail that it follows there so that's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.880 
rail that it follows there so that's
really<00:02:46.780> cool<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:49.209> leg<00:02:49.540> itself<00:02:49.930> or<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.740> lower

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
really cool the leg itself or the lower

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.449 
really cool the leg itself or the lower
leg<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.790> flap<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.930> opens<00:02:53.709> up<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.160> this

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
leg this flap actually opens up and this

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.310 
leg this flap actually opens up and this
is<00:02:54.520> all<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.940> accommodate<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.600> stem<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.140> ball

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
is all to accommodate the stem the ball

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.260 
is all to accommodate the stem the ball
joint<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.830> ankle<00:02:57.220> which<00:02:57.430> can<00:02:58.000> move

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
joint for the ankle which can move

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.910 
joint for the ankle which can move
everywhere<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.020> when<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.440> want<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> do<00:02:59.740> wide

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
everywhere so when you want to do wide

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.250 
everywhere so when you want to do wide
legged<00:03:00.130> stances<00:03:00.550> this<00:03:00.730> opens<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.260> make

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
legged stances this opens up to make

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.430 
legged stances this opens up to make
sure<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:03.720> foot<00:03:04.720> isn't<00:03:04.840> hindered<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
sure that this foot isn't hindered and

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.520 
sure that this foot isn't hindered and
then<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.800> course<00:03:06.010> there's<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.310> giant<00:03:06.760> toe<00:03:07.180> joint

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
then of course there's a giant toe joint

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.780 
then of course there's a giant toe joint
overall<00:03:08.530> he<00:03:08.740> has<00:03:08.890> all<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.190> makings<00:03:09.340> for<00:03:09.610> I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
overall he has all the makings for I

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.880 
overall he has all the makings for I
figured<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.270> have<00:03:10.390> great<00:03:10.810> articulation<00:03:11.680> the

figured to have great articulation the
one<00:03:12.490> thing<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.730> will<00:03:12.940> say<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.390> because<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.380> his

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
one thing I will say is because of his

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.540 
one thing I will say is because of his
just<00:03:14.980> overly<00:03:15.820> massive<00:03:16.780> design<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:18.310> doesn't

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
just overly massive design it doesn't

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.699 
just overly massive design it doesn't
matter<00:03:18.670> how<00:03:18.970> much<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.480> you<00:03:19.750> pose<00:03:19.989> this<00:03:20.230> guy<00:03:20.410> it

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
get a little connector right here for a

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.660 
get a little connector right here for a
tamashii<00:03:53.320> stage<00:03:53.560> what<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.280> about<00:03:54.400> this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
tamashii stage what I like about this

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.640 
tamashii stage what I like about this

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
connector is that it is very hidden it

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.240 
connector is that it is very hidden it
just<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.580> slides<00:03:57.970> up<00:03:58.150> into<00:03:58.600> here<00:03:59.080> and

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
just it just slides up into here and

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.789 
just it just slides up into here and
when<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.340> pull<00:04:00.519> his<00:04:01.440> backpack<00:04:02.440> down<00:04:02.650> you
