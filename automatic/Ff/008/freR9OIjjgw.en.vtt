is my kind of BMX glitching into the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
is my kind of BMX glitching into the
checkpoint<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.810> possible<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
checkpoint and you is possible to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.190 
checkpoint and you is possible to
survive<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.369> full<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.689> really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

difficult to do and it is very

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.440 
difficult to do and it is very

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
how to do is going to be impossible oh

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.820 
how to do is going to be impossible oh
my<00:02:46.320> god

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830

do and if you invite your friends will

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.610 
do and if you invite your friends will
probably<00:02:51.450> end<00:02:51.540> up<00:02:51.690> doing<00:02:52.020> if<00:02:52.140> they<00:02:52.260> don't<00:02:52.440> know

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
probably end up doing if they don't know

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.490 
probably end up doing if they don't know
what<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.100> do<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.700> I'll<00:02:53.820> show<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.030> how<00:02:54.320> much<00:02:55.320> it

what to do and I'll show you how much it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.050 
what to do and I'll show you how much it
doesn't<00:02:55.650> work<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.130> they'll<00:02:56.280> probably<00:02:56.400> sprint

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
doesn't work so they'll probably sprint

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.280 
doesn't work so they'll probably sprint
up<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> end<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:58.560> sprint<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.280> go<00:02:59.430> oh<00:02:59.640> shit
