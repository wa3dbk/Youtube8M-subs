00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.270 
and tape that as well so I've already
cut<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.450> I<00:05:00.720> would<00:05:01.350> cut<00:05:01.560> right<00:05:01.740> across<00:05:01.860> the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
cut this I would cut right across the

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
level you decide is the bottom and then

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.930 
level you decide is the bottom and then
