so what are we talking about with this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
so what are we talking about with this
car<00:00:25.890> well<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:28.110> very<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.980> clearly<00:00:29.460> an

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
absolute head-on rival for the four five

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.270 
absolute head-on rival for the four five
and<00:00:33.330> eight<00:00:33.390> spider<00:00:33.720> there<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.710> no<00:00:34.830> question

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and eight spider there is no question

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.180 
and eight spider there is no question
about<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.660> it's<00:00:36.660> priced<00:00:37.050> within<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.770> couple

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
about that it's priced within a couple

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.770 
about that it's priced within a couple
of<00:00:38.280> thousand<00:00:38.700> pounds<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> four<00:00:39.570> five

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.140 
eight spider a hundred ninety six grand
they've<00:00:43.290> made<00:00:43.470> all<00:00:43.620> sorts<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.100> changes<00:00:44.370> subtle

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
they've made all sorts of changes subtle

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.960 
they've made all sorts of changes subtle
changes<00:00:45.949> underneath<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.100> skin<00:00:47.370> both<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
changes underneath the skin both to the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.279 
changes underneath the skin both to the
coupe<00:00:48.210> mate<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.140> spider

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
coupe mate and to the spider

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.220 
coupe mate and to the spider
the<00:00:51.800> 3.8<00:00:52.429> twin-turbo<00:00:53.269> v8<00:00:53.660> engine<00:00:54.019> is<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.199> same

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
the 3.8 twin-turbo v8 engine is the same

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.220 
the 3.8 twin-turbo v8 engine is the same
capacity<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:55.519> has<00:00:55.870> it's<00:00:56.870> just<00:00:56.960> been

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
capacity but it has it's just been

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.049 
capacity but it has it's just been
tweaked<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.589> produce<00:00:58.010> quite<00:00:58.609> a<00:00:58.670> bit<00:00:58.879> more

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
tweaked to produce quite a bit more

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.630 
tweaked to produce quite a bit more
power<00:00:59.359> actually<00:00:59.769> 616<00:01:00.769> bhp<00:01:01.339> rather<00:01:01.609> than<00:01:01.820> 552

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
power actually 616 bhp rather than 552

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.670 
power actually 616 bhp rather than 552
and<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:04.759> produces<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.330> power<00:01:05.600> 500<00:01:06.259> RPM

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
and it produces that power 500 RPM

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.190 
and it produces that power 500 RPM
higher<00:01:07.130> up<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.549> rev<00:01:07.729> range<00:01:07.759> so<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:08.990> feels

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
higher up the rev range so it just feels

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.289 
higher up the rev range so it just feels
a<00:01:09.440> bit<00:01:09.470> north<00:01:09.830> here<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.220> a<00:01:10.250> bit<00:01:10.399> more<00:01:10.580> manic<00:01:11.090> as

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
a bit north here and a bit more manic as

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.999 
a bit north here and a bit more manic as
you<00:01:11.570> homed<00:01:11.750> in<00:01:11.780> on<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.320> eight<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> half

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
you homed in on the eight and a half

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.609 
you homed in on the eight and a half
thousand<00:01:13.640> rpm<00:01:13.729> redline<00:01:14.210> which<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.229> good<00:01:15.440> you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
thousand rpm redline which is good you

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.590 
thousand rpm redline which is good you
notice<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.070> on<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.310> road<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.490> lot<00:01:16.759> there's<00:01:17.479> no

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
notice that on the road a lot there's no

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.990 
notice that on the road a lot there's no
more<00:01:17.810> talk<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:19.100> what<00:01:19.220> they<00:01:19.340> have<00:01:19.520> done<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
more talk but what they have done and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.520 
more talk but what they have done and
they've<00:01:20.210> really<00:01:20.479> concentrated<00:01:21.080> hard<00:01:21.259> on<00:01:21.409> this

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
they've really concentrated hard on this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.800 
they've really concentrated hard on this
one<00:01:21.799> it's<00:01:22.700> tweaked<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.119> software<00:01:23.569> of<00:01:23.720> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
one it's tweaked the software of the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.730 
one it's tweaked the software of the
gearbox<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.940> sound<00:01:26.179> of<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.450> engine<00:01:26.810> so

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
gearbox and the sound of the engine so

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.279 
gearbox and the sound of the engine so
that<00:01:28.090> when<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.270> want<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.569> gear<00:01:29.690> changes<00:01:30.110> to

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
that when you want the gear changes to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.859 
that when you want the gear changes to
be<00:01:30.409> really<00:01:30.830> quick<00:01:31.069> really<00:01:31.520> snappy<00:01:31.729> they<00:01:32.720> are

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
be really quick really snappy they are

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.260 
be really quick really snappy they are
there<00:01:33.229> even<00:01:33.619> faster<00:01:33.830> than<00:01:34.220> before<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.119> when

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
there even faster than before but when

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.059 
there even faster than before but when
you<00:01:35.360> stick<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.840> into<00:01:35.990> Auto<00:01:36.259> mode<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.039> just

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
you stick it into Auto mode you just

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.180 
you stick it into Auto mode you just
want<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.549> car<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.940> flow<00:01:38.710> smoothly<00:01:39.710> without

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
want the car to flow smoothly without

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.340 
want the car to flow smoothly without
really<00:01:40.700> they're<00:01:41.360> being<00:01:41.569> perceptible<00:01:42.170> gear

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
really they're being perceptible gear

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.199 
really they're being perceptible gear
changes<00:01:42.740> at<00:01:42.830> all<00:01:43.069> well<00:01:43.549> they've<00:01:43.789> tweaked<00:01:44.030> that

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
changes at all well they've tweaked that

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.199 
changes at all well they've tweaked that
too<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:44.929> really<00:01:45.170> works<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.819> it<00:01:46.819> sounds

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
too and it really works and it sounds

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:56.510 
too and it really works and it sounds
better<00:01:47.450> than<00:01:47.600> ever<00:01:47.899> too
