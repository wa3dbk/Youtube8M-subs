across some high leveled locks by doing

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.220 
across some high leveled locks by doing
so<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.430> also<00:02:44.459> makes<00:02:44.910> leveling<00:02:45.360> less<00:02:45.570> boring

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
so it also makes leveling less boring

is<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.390> slowest<00:02:51.750> skills<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.170> level<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
is one of the slowest skills to level so

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.500 
is one of the slowest skills to level so
I<00:02:52.860> do<00:02:52.980> recommend<00:02:53.280> making<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.970> point<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.330> pick

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
I do recommend making a point to pick

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.240 
I do recommend making a point to pick
every<00:02:54.930> lock<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.680> when<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.010> begin

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
every lock that you see when you begin

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.790 
every lock that you see when you begin
the<00:02:56.310> game<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:57.330> you'll<00:02:57.540> reach<00:02:57.750> 100<00:02:58.320> naturally

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
the game then you'll reach 100 naturally

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.920 
the game then you'll reach 100 naturally
make<00:02:59.340> sure<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.610> subscribe<00:02:59.820> more<00:03:00.360> guides<00:03:00.660> and
