00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello everyone with you rock and today I tell you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.350
 show how to quickly do or two Lubek 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.120
 any animal on the example of a horse for 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.179
 beginning we will add any block in this 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:23.460
 case it will be the earth after all attach 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:25.850
 horse to her then drown the ground under 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.850
 card 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.140
 choose a horse and raise this one 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.140
 to the surface 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.210
 then we move this land 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:46.030
 where we need well, let's say not 50 to 50 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:50.860
 om frame I will move it here after 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:55.570
 what you need to do the movement of the legs of the head and 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:01:00.710
 horse's tail for this we choose legs 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:05.170
 and the original position I'm his chair 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.170
 like movement 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.119
 this will be the very first position 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.670
 in this case it will be 5 millisecond 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.670
 we change the position of the horse's legs 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.170
 here we have a step but a horse 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.170
 rides a little so you need to move 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.820
 keys 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.190
 here depending on the number of frames and 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.730
 on how far the horse needs to go 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.900
 pick up 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.900
 10 too many 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
 fine 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.709
 after which you need to do in between 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.709
 agile and lords who go forward 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.690
 thought a new bend also do with 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.690
 opposite to her 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.580
 Here we have so far 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.800
 step after which you need to do so 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.270
 the horse rose a little for that 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.030
 already choose the horse itself and in the same 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.960
 I slightly raise it for 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.030
 more for more walking effect also 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.030
 we have to make the tail and head 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.030
 since it's not very fast there head 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:59.310
 will move up and down not very 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:02.819
 strongly put the key to the final step 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.739
 and in the interval we cant 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.739
 head and it turns out like this 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.349
 if a horse should do this in principle 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.450
 and left tail tail we will move 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.230
 no intermediate key 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.060
 and with the initial key that is step by step 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.569
 feet moving and 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:31.030
 in the original position we put let's say 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:34.130
 here are the keys ending step 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.160
 move the tail here 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.160
 but 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.060
 need to do another step then another 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.060
 by foot 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.580
 now after we did it we 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:09.370
 we can safely copy the horseâ€™s walking 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:15.030
 there is just select all the keys that have 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.030
 we have and copy 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:25.240
 so let's say and we get here 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.300
 Such is walking and that is we simply to 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.229
 end for copying movement 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.770
 everything is exactly to the tenth frame of the tape a little 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.770
 a little further away 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:44.500
 let's say this 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.720
 and here comes the animation of the horse like this 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.040
 you can quickly and easily make animation 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.250
 any animal with you was rock all 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.250
 until
