00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.750
 couplet lady of the loan what does 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.740
 makes you gerber 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.740
 apparently I'm bothering 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.100
 humor and emotion intersected and 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.020
 intertwined Friday night on the stage of 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.850
 Milan says the theater LuÃ§onnais 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.340
 indeed welcomed the room the squat 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.170
 of jean marie chevret a worn piece 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.000
 by two famous Geneva artists 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.620
 fontanel and marion range 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 and if this last triumph 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.520
 currently in the character of the get 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.750
 of household scenes she had a real 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.510
 favorite for this piece 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.420
 rewarded with the solidarity award and 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.370
 anti-racism of ol's ngos is a 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.250
 very very beautiful piece very very strong 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.050
 very effective in terms of humor 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.950
 but who worries all the time funny 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.290
 through the human truth 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.520
 was never free never know 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.619
 do not stir fins like I say 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.680
 elegantly we are in demand 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.560
 in in life in life in the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.810
 heart and it's a beautiful piece 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.610
 it's a piece a message since good 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.149
 it's a subject that's growing 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.430
 topical 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.530
 it is obviously the galley of the kids 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.470
 currently as soon as they have a 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.020
 foreign connotation then no the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.910
 doors close we hear the the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.950
 bellows that falls into the oven and the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.830
 doors are closing so they're in 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.869
 galley galley to lodge 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.399
 that's it but we these treaties on the plane 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.229
 obviously funny finally like not comic 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.759
 comedy it's a comedy story 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.950
 is simple a bourgeois apartment is 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.619
 squatted by a young marginal couple 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.539
 samir and natacha and this thanks to the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.050
 complicity of the son of the concierge of 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.330
 the building 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.459
 he thinks himself calm but the return 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.740
 premature of the two sisters owner 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.350
 of the apartment will upset everything 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.000
 forced cohabitation takes place between 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.610
 these two worlds that everything opposes 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.039
 marion game plays the role of a 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.470
 sisters figeac hard and intolerant 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.479
 in any case at the beginning of the play a role 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.430
 who first frightened him is a 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.930
 roll I was very scared I was very scared 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.349
 because when I read the piece I 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.310
 follow me but what she says during the 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.530
 first half hour of the play but 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.819
 it's just not possible they go they 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.360
 are going to scream in the room they will do 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.510
 waters 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.010
 they are going to be panicked and dying of 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.659
 laugh which is still extremely 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.550
 weird 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.990
 the more you type 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.200
 way but I tell you but really 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.230
 primary racist primary 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.630
 and then people are comfortable in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400
 their sneakers with that and we're good 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.960
 far, of course, in this room of 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.790
 huguette rom from the series scenes of 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.160
 households a role that has brought to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 the actress a second notoriety but 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.800
 she does not make a mistake and knows where is 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.390
 his real job 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.650
 it's great because we fall back on 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.600
 our legs make theater is 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.880
 difficult when you could see there 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.720
 must go to coal in fact you know it 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.820
 come from paris in the livestock me 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.370
 stupidly with the trail my car I say 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.080
 it's a job it's a job 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.070
 difficult but it's the real job 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.690
 what should we do 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.010
 the rest is bling bling it's but 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.990
 that's our job 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.670
 I do not want to get away from that because 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:22.080
 that obviously we are offered and we will 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.350
 do a series of things and we'll 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.570
 do this strengthen no I leave them 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.530
 star to them 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.790
 is that what's curious 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.830
 they do not understand why 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.690
 we are we are adopted by the French 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.750
 do not understand he knows their escapes 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.520
 completely that they are far from the job 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.650
 I mean gerard and I have 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.780
 sold enough to handle this 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.020
 deal there I say no it's okay it's our 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.360

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.640
 the scene remains so his true passion a 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.709
 passion that does not safadi over the years 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.420
 yes because we put ourselves in danger because 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.370
 we are there we are we are stimulated we are 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.440
 there when we are afraid before entering it 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.930
 a crazy thing we are always afraid we have 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.080
 a jitters before going on stage and then 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.700
