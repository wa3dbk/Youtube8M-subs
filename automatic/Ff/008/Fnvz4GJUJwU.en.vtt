some people EDC

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.830 
some people EDC
you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.060> Anna's<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.510> something

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you know like at Anna's or something

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
you know like at Anna's or something
from<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> sounds<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.549> people

can<00:01:11.939> EDC<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.510> think<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:12.900> great<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
can EDC and I think that's great if you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.550 
can EDC and I think that's great if you
can<00:01:13.710> swing<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:15.170> for<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> little

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
can swing it but for me it's a little

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.760 
can swing it but for me it's a little
too<00:01:16.710> big<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.130> edie<00:01:17.520> seed<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
too big to be edie seed and the the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
too big to be edie seed and the the
blade<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> little<00:01:20.820> thin<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.229> use<00:01:22.740> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
blade is a little thin to really use is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.219 
blade is a little thin to really use is
a<00:01:22.950> hard<00:01:23.220> used<00:01:23.430> knife<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> dedicated

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
a hard used knife or like a dedicated

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.649 
a hard used knife or like a dedicated
tactical<00:01:25.830> knife<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.360> think<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> could<00:01:27.630> work

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
tactical knife I think it could work

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
tactical knife I think it could work
maybe<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> martial<00:01:30.030> artist

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
maybe if you are like a martial artist

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.870 
maybe if you are like a martial artist
and<00:01:30.509> some<00:01:30.750> blade<00:01:31.500> arts<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.280> stuff<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.640> that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and some blade arts and stuff like that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.770 
and some blade arts and stuff like that
because<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:35.490> could<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.880> very<00:01:36.090> devastating

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
because it could be a very devastating

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
because it could be a very devastating
weapon<00:01:37.079> let's<00:01:37.259> face<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.890> got<00:01:38.070> plenty<00:01:38.250> of

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
weapon let's face it it's got plenty of

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
weapon let's face it it's got plenty of
reach<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.360> gonna<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
reach so if you're gonna use it in that

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260 
reach so if you're gonna use it in that
capacity<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.950> could<00:01:41.070> work<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.549> for

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
capacity I think it could work but for

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.980 
capacity I think it could work but for
me<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> an<00:01:43.140> average<00:01:43.710> Joe<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.700> user<00:01:44.990> I

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
me more of an average Joe kind of user I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
me more of an average Joe kind of user I

take<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> look<00:02:17.730> though<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.440> know<00:02:19.590> not

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
take a look though that is you know not

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.850 
take a look though that is you know not
gonna<00:02:20.160> lie<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.580> pretty<00:02:20.880> thin<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.650> again<00:02:22.650> I

gonna lie it's pretty thin and again I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.620 
gonna lie it's pretty thin and again I
would<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.160> be<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.640> careful<00:02:24.060> with<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.360> tip

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
would just be very careful with this tip

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.870 
would just be very careful with this tip
so<00:02:25.260> depending<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.580> use<00:02:26.700> it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
so depending on what you want to use it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.720 
so depending on what you want to use it
for<00:02:27.830> one<00:02:28.830> thing<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.130> interesting<00:02:29.280> about

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
for one thing that's interesting about

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.390 
for one thing that's interesting about
this<00:02:30.000> knife<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:31.200> been<00:02:31.440> given<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:32.070> very

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
this knife is it's been given a very

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.760 
this knife is it's been given a very
light<00:02:32.700> stone<00:02:33.000> wash<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.290> don't<00:02:34.560> know<00:02:34.620> if

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
light stone wash so I don't know if

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.860 
light stone wash so I don't know if
we'll<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.920> able<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.190> really<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:36.720> it

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
we'll be able to really really see it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.810 
we'll be able to really really see it
but<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.800> know<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:37.950> looks<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.610> from<00:02:38.730> a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
but you know it looks like from a

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.490 
but you know it looks like from a
distance<00:02:39.000> that's<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.510> satin<00:02:39.810> finish<00:02:40.110> but<00:02:40.140> when

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
distance that's a satin finish but when

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
distance that's a satin finish but when
you<00:02:40.590> take<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> closer<00:02:41.100> look<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.670> satin

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
you take a closer look it's a satin

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.550 
you take a closer look it's a satin
finish<00:02:42.300> but<00:02:42.330> they<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.720> applied<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.080> very

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
finish but they have applied a very

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.920 
finish but they have applied a very
light<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.870> nice<00:02:45.870> stone<00:02:46.320> wash<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.930> pretty

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
light a nice stone wash to it so pretty

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.530 
light a nice stone wash to it so pretty
neat<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.850> pretty<00:02:51.000> much<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.330> for<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
neat and that's pretty much it for the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.690 
neat and that's pretty much it for the
blade<00:02:51.780> let's<00:02:52.140> take<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> look<00:02:52.830> at<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.280> handle

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
blade let's take a look at the handle

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.920 
blade let's take a look at the handle
here<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:55.020> is<00:02:55.230> g10<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> very<00:02:57.330> grippy<00:02:57.720> piece

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
here it is g10 not a very grippy piece

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.060 
here it is g10 not a very grippy piece
of<00:02:58.080> g10<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:59.490> for<00:02:59.820> such<00:03:00.000> an<00:03:00.090> elegant<00:03:00.510> knife<00:03:00.690> I

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
of g10 but for such an elegant knife I

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.350 
of g10 but for such an elegant knife I
think<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.160> totally<00:03:02.280> works<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.180> got<00:03:03.330> a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
think it totally works and it's got a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.860 
think it totally works and it's got a
big<00:03:03.570> handle<00:03:03.900> anyway<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.700> grip<00:03:05.700> isn't<00:03:06.690> really

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
big handle anyway so grip isn't really

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.330 
big handle anyway so grip isn't really
my<00:03:06.990> primary<00:03:07.260> concern<00:03:07.770> when<00:03:07.860> we've<00:03:07.980> got<00:03:08.130> such<00:03:08.310> a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
my primary concern when we've got such a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.560 
my primary concern when we've got such a
big<00:03:08.580> handle<00:03:08.880> begin<00:03:09.240> with<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.790> take<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> look<00:03:12.300> at

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
big handle begin with and take a look at

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.400 
big handle begin with and take a look at
that<00:03:13.730> nice<00:03:14.730> texture<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.630> resulted<00:03:16.290> when

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
that nice texture that resulted when

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.740 
that nice texture that resulted when
they<00:03:16.530> smooth<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.010> out<00:03:17.360> almost<00:03:18.360> looks<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.630> a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
they smooth this out almost looks like a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.680 
they smooth this out almost looks like a
wood<00:03:19.080> grain<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:20.239> like<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.420> lot

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.640 

everything's<00:03:24.690> been<00:03:24.840> screwed<00:03:25.140> together<00:03:25.290> on

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
everything's been screwed together on

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.070 
everything's been screwed together on
this<00:03:25.800> knife<00:03:26.040> you've<00:03:26.610> got<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> back<00:03:27.330> spacer<00:03:27.840> so

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
this knife you've got a back spacer so

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.060 
this knife you've got a back spacer so
it's<00:03:28.230> not<00:03:28.380> really<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.709> flow-through

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
it's not really a flow-through

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.550 
it's not really a flow-through
construction<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.300> still<00:03:30.989> easy<00:03:31.200> enough<00:03:31.320> to

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
construction but still easy enough to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.820 
construction but still easy enough to
clean<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.209> if<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.420> notice<00:03:34.320> it's<00:03:34.470> got<00:03:34.590> some

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
clean and if you notice it's got some

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.390 
clean and if you notice it's got some
blackened<00:03:36.380> liners<00:03:37.380> here<00:03:37.590> which<00:03:37.980> are<00:03:38.160> really

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
blackened liners here which are really

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.790 
blackened liners here which are really
nice<00:03:38.580> nice<00:03:39.150> touch<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.660> think<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.110> these<00:03:40.530> liners

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
nice nice touch I think and these liners

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.590 
nice nice touch I think and these liners
have<00:03:40.980> actually<00:03:41.280> been<00:03:41.370> milled<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.060> pretty

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
have actually been milled out and pretty

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.150 
have actually been milled out and pretty
extensively<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.530> even<00:03:43.890> though<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.100> thing

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
extensively so even though this thing

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.880 
extensively so even though this thing
weighs<00:03:44.550> like<00:03:44.790> seven<00:03:45.120> ounces<00:03:45.420> they<00:03:45.660> tried<00:03:45.989> to

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
weighs like seven ounces they tried to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.670 
weighs like seven ounces they tried to
knock<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.760> down<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.940> little<00:03:48.180> bit<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:49.560> know

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
knock it down a little bit and you know

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.699 
knock it down a little bit and you know
I<00:03:49.709> think<00:03:50.070> it's<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.310> good<00:03:50.459> effort<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:51.620> cool<00:03:52.620> to

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
I think it's a good effort so cool to

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.000 
I think it's a good effort so cool to
see<00:03:52.860> them<00:03:52.950> do<00:03:53.100> that<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:54.739> really<00:03:55.739> do<00:03:55.860> like

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
see them do that and I really do like

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.550 
see them do that and I really do like
the<00:03:56.160> handle<00:03:56.489> it's<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.060> beautiful

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
the handle it's just a beautiful

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.750 
the handle it's just a beautiful
beautifully<00:03:58.560> finished<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.160> smooth

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
beautifully finished so smooth

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.970 
beautifully finished so smooth
ergonomics<00:04:00.630> are<00:04:00.720> pretty<00:04:00.959> nice<00:04:01.080> too<00:04:01.380> as<00:04:01.800> you

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
ergonomics are pretty nice too as you

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.440 
ergonomics are pretty nice too as you
would<00:04:02.070> expect<00:04:02.459> from<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.700> larger<00:04:03.060> knife<00:04:03.180> like

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
would expect from a larger knife like

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.630 
would expect from a larger knife like
this<00:04:03.480> you've<00:04:04.260> got<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.620> finger<00:04:04.980> choil<00:04:05.190> down

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
this you've got this finger choil down

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.780 
this you've got this finger choil down
here<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.739> your<00:04:07.739> hand<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.160> sits<00:04:08.430> comfortably

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
here and your hand just sits comfortably

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.050 
here and your hand just sits comfortably
back<00:04:09.300> back<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.650> kind<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:10.920> gives<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.030> a

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
back back it's kind of gives you a

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.550 
back back it's kind of gives you a
little<00:04:12.209> more<00:04:12.300> reach<00:04:12.600> or<00:04:12.840> setback<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.260> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
little more reach or setback on the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.150 
little more reach or setback on the
knife<00:04:13.739> which<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.010> cool<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.730> could<00:04:14.880> also

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
knife which is cool but you could also

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.470 
knife which is cool but you could also
choke<00:04:17.160> up<00:04:17.340> on<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.580> if<00:04:17.850> say<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.090> wanted<00:04:18.419> to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
choke up on it if say you wanted to

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.360 
choke up on it if say you wanted to
start<00:04:18.840> peeling<00:04:19.440> some<00:04:19.650> potatoes<00:04:20.100> or<00:04:20.250> something

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
start peeling some potatoes or something

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.640 
start peeling some potatoes or something
with<00:04:20.609> this<00:04:20.669> blade<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.120> could<00:04:21.269> do<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.660> there

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
with this blade you could do that there

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.620 
with this blade you could do that there
is<00:04:22.830> no<00:04:23.039> jimping<00:04:23.610> which<00:04:24.860> honestly

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
is no jimping which honestly

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.540 
is no jimping which honestly
I<00:04:26.720> don't<00:04:27.050> really<00:04:27.200> think<00:04:27.290> you<00:04:27.590> need<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:28.190> lot<00:04:28.430> of

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
I don't really think you need a lot of

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.010 
I don't really think you need a lot of
jumping<00:04:28.850> on<00:04:28.970> this<00:04:29.120> knife<00:04:29.330> again<00:04:29.720> because<00:04:29.900> it's

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
jumping on this knife again because it's

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.310 
jumping on this knife again because it's
just<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.320> big<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:31.720> again<00:04:32.720> considering<00:04:33.140> how

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
just so big and again considering how

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.490 
just so big and again considering how
beautiful<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:33.920> is<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.340> could<00:04:34.910> see<00:04:35.200> they<00:04:36.200> wanted

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
beautiful it is I could see they wanted

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500 
beautiful it is I could see they wanted
to<00:04:36.560> take<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.770> path<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.340> was<00:04:37.490> airing<00:04:38.300> on<00:04:38.390> the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
to take the path that was airing on the

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.750 
to take the path that was airing on the
side<00:04:38.540> of<00:04:38.720> a<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:39.440> know<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> simple<00:04:40.340> refined

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
side of a you know like a simple refined

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.700 
side of a you know like a simple refined
elegance<00:04:41.270> rather<00:04:41.540> than<00:04:41.750> just<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.470> full-out

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
elegance rather than just a full-out

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.390 
elegance rather than just a full-out
tactical<00:04:43.400> knife<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.960> totally<00:04:45.680> understand<00:04:46.130> I

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
tactical knife so totally understand I

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.550 
tactical knife so totally understand I
think<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.120> works<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:48.440> pocket<00:04:48.860> clip<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:50.560> large

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
think it works the pocket clip is large

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.790 
think it works the pocket clip is large
as<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.520> can<00:04:52.700> see<00:04:52.940> it's<00:04:53.090> very<00:04:53.360> large<00:04:53.660> and<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.770> is

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
as you can see it's very large and it is

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.650 
as you can see it's very large and it is
hardened<00:04:55.460> stainless<00:04:55.670> steel<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.330> has<00:04:56.480> been

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
hardened stainless steel that has been

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.820 
hardened stainless steel that has been
given<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:58.900> wood<00:04:59.900> loose<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.200> be<00:05:00.290> like<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.470> black

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
given a wood loose to be like a black

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.030 
given a wood loose to be like a black
chrome<00:05:01.750> in<00:05:02.750> fact<00:05:03.260> this<00:05:03.470> may<00:05:03.590> not<00:05:03.740> even<00:05:03.800> be

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
chrome in fact this may not even be

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.340 
chrome in fact this may not even be
steel<00:05:04.550> this<00:05:04.820> might<00:05:05.030> be<00:05:05.180> nickel<00:05:05.690> I'm<00:05:05.840> not<00:05:05.990> 100%

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
steel this might be nickel I'm not 100%

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.950 
steel this might be nickel I'm not 100%
sure<00:05:06.910> it's<00:05:07.910> really<00:05:08.150> cool-looking<00:05:08.390> either<00:05:08.780> way

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
sure it's really cool-looking either way

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.590 
sure it's really cool-looking either way
I<00:05:08.990> like<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:10.820> finish<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.360> put<00:05:11.480> on

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
I like that that finish that put on

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.310 
I like that that finish that put on
there<00:05:11.860> pretty<00:05:12.860> nice<00:05:13.480> tip<00:05:14.480> up<00:05:14.660> right-hand

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320

carry<00:05:18.470> which<00:05:19.280> is<00:05:19.430> kind<00:05:19.670> of<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.820> bummer

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
carry which is kind of a bummer

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.170 
carry which is kind of a bummer
but<00:05:21.160> when<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.250> see<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.580> way<00:05:22.700> that<00:05:22.730> they<00:05:22.970> put

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
but when you see the way that they put

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.640 
but when you see the way that they put
this<00:05:23.330> clip<00:05:23.540> on<00:05:23.720> there<00:05:23.960> they<00:05:24.110> actually<00:05:24.440> had<00:05:24.560> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
this clip on there they actually had the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.920 
this clip on there they actually had the
flat<00:05:24.920> in<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.130> handle<00:05:25.490> out<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:26.450> accept<00:05:26.810> this

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
flat in the handle out to accept this

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.540 
flat in the handle out to accept this
large<00:05:28.150> base<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.450> the<00:05:29.540> clip<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.920> can<00:05:31.160> see<00:05:31.370> why

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
large base of the clip so I can see why

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.580 
large base of the clip so I can see why
they<00:05:31.850> just<00:05:32.510> left<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:32.930> on<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.110> right<00:05:33.290> side

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
they just left it on the right side

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.120 
they just left it on the right side
again<00:05:34.360> you<00:05:35.360> know<00:05:35.680> erring<00:05:36.680> on<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.830> side<00:05:36.920> of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
again you know erring on the side of

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.290 
again you know erring on the side of
keeping<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:37.640> thing<00:05:37.700> looking<00:05:38.120> clean

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
keeping this thing looking clean

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.680 
keeping this thing looking clean

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
as smooth yet as my other bench mains I

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.720 
as smooth yet as my other bench mains I
might<00:05:51.530> need<00:05:51.620> to<00:05:51.680> break<00:05:51.920> it<00:05:52.100> a<00:05:52.220> little<00:05:52.400> bit<00:05:52.520> more

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
might need to break it a little bit more

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.650 
might need to break it a little bit more
and<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:54.880> there<00:05:55.880> isn't<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.180> lot<00:05:56.300> of<00:05:56.330> weight<00:05:56.540> at

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
and the there isn't a lot of weight at

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.360 
and the there isn't a lot of weight at
the<00:05:56.690> tip<00:05:56.990> obviously<00:05:57.530> so<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:57.770> think<00:05:58.070> that<00:05:58.220> might

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
the tip obviously so I think that might

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.400 
the tip obviously so I think that might
have<00:05:58.460> something<00:05:58.520> to<00:05:58.790> do<00:05:58.970> with<00:05:59.230> just<00:06:00.230> getting

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
have something to do with just getting

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.580 
have something to do with just getting
it<00:06:00.620> opening<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:01.610> closing<00:06:02.090> as<00:06:02.210> easily<00:06:03.200> as

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
it opening and closing as easily as

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.530 
it opening and closing as easily as
mother<00:06:03.800> knives<00:06:04.070> it's<00:06:04.310> very<00:06:04.520> smooth<00:06:04.880> though<00:06:05.120> so

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540
