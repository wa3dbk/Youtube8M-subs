00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.270
 I guess I'm sorry the map 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:12.850
 iphone rose to zix from os ios 5 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:16.690
 os goes to 6 and iphone 5 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:23.500
 Something is confusing I 'll leave such a story 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:25.860
 ios -5 There are more useful places, but I'm sorry map 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.830
 Half playful 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.030
 I hate more than that or the news site I have been Toka or find the pachinko Gundam station 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.400
 Naha 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:45.850
 Ne'm more of milo map'm intuitive now of the map, for example, brainwashing 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:48.110
 If you go out of the zone you say it's because you do not take n 4 consecutive villas 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.120
 There is also an opinion to say 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.440
 I also I'm a surprisingly important me this line without the use railway 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:02.469
 It becomes standard when we act 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:05.140
 I think you are not thinking of everybody, but even if you drive a car this way of railway 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.850
 One of the railway networks 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:15.820
 I think there are a lot of people driving based on it, I can not see it at all 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.430
 Yone r You feel like you can see the track when you zoom in 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.440
 National road 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.620
 The average length of roads such as national roads is the same 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:32.300
 But the highway is I'm so not far away 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:36.420
 National Highway is when exactly the hey, for example, zoom-out is the same thickness the same as or study 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.159
 I will show Toka Route 1 brother as it not a devil 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.640
 If 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:48.659
 I think I'm criteria do not know when you drag 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.000
 After that, I was able to see outside the bar press in front of the station and the shape of the station, but now 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.880
 I only station of the icon comes out 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.939
 I want you to stop in the conventional lines but is this okay with you were subway 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.759
 I also tried using roughly up etc 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:10.720
 I could not find it intuitively compared to the number of maps . 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.920
 Pieces of map rest to some extent left to zoom out a Tokoro to that purpose I was in Figure 6 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.310
 Follow 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.910
 So 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:22.840
 Also zoom in and zoom in again to the intended market as a zoomer 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.470
 I think I was that kind of use 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.800
 I think it's a timer 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.920
 The same seven articles as the old car navigation system 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:38.220
 Will follow the road in minutes-in stirrer the magnification not 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.819
 I'm not going to follow the track but I 'm not going back 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.980
 google map 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:49.489
 But there is also a place where can this zoom 淫妻 whether intuitive as the reason for the epidemic 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.640
 I think it's because I can secure the level of this road 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.180
 Zoom out 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.990
 Even if you pull 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.720
 I can see the way you are 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.470
 We were able intuitive smoothly 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:09.130
 But the new map ios 6 map 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.030
 All I have unrefined something map already are making the place of another to say that if I do not use 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:16.200
 I think 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:18.550
 google is I want to put to make the map in the application Neato is 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.730
 I may not go back though 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:27.240
 Return the standard map to the google map again 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.240
 It I want to work honestly I guess is to use warm
