00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.920
 so for this recipe a little bit 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.830
 special you will need endive 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.690
 then you're going to need some carrot 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.639
 so I took the a40 outright 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.840
 whole but I'm going to cut bits of 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.180
 carrots of course I do not do the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.140
 leave it all right then it's going to take 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.419
 spinach leaves so here's a 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.210
 only that will be enough then he will you 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.460
 have god cucumbers so me the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.960
 cucumber I took several balls 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.430
 as you can see but in real 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.240
 I will not put much in 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.640
 interior 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.739
 then we'll need some tops 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.050
 carrots and finally he'll go 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.550
 have fennel next in 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.289
 regards the material 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.000
 you will need a board so that 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.579
 whether it's wood or plastic that does not 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.739
 change absolutely nothing then he goes 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.410
 you need a knife so a knife 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.679
 of cooking finally kelkoo well what and he 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.710
 will have a container so me it's 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.690
 a part of coconut that my 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.789
 mother got to recover by breaking 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.470
 of course a coconut so that's it 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.120
 so let's go for the recipe 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.100
 so what I come to do in all 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.930
 first took off the stem of the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.030
 spinach leaf and I come to place it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.250
 at the bottom of my bowl then I come 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:22.240
 simply cut the carrot a 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:24.100
 little washer so after cutting my 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.200
 carrots in small slices I come 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.820
 do the same with a piece of cucumbers 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.030
 but I will not show it to the camera 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.340
 but when I put it right after the tips 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.640
 of carrots and con against in the EU 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.500
 in the coconut ring the ends of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.210
 cucumbers are cut in half so 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.350
 it's absolutely normal it's just that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 I will not show on camera 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.250
 so then I'm going to come and take my 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.900
 endives and I'm going to cut it and then 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 I will put everything I cut 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.440
 in my little bowl if you have points of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.060
 my handsome fennel but like tiny 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.830
 do not like that too much I came to him 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.990
 give a little bit but after that in 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.190
 function on your guinea pig likes 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.710
 or not before coming to put my tips 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.880
 of fennel in the bowl I'm going to do this 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.180
 that I want to do is I'm going 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.940
 cut the carrot fan and I'm going 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.130
 remove the rod is right after i'm going 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:34.200
 come put his last forwards 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:36.780
 ingredients in the bowl I came 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.660
 to take two endive leaves but I 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.610
 only cut one and you go 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.460
 see later that what I did 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.990
 in the bowl it did not much more 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.070
 so I made a change but I 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.070
 will not be shown to the camera 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.980
 so here is this special recipe 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.660
 birthday is finally over I hope 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.310
 that she will have pleased you so the little 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.739
 modification is that I carved a 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.420
 so it's loose of tiny in one end 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.620
 of endives so after what you have 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.700
 just to do it's seen that it's a 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.620
 birthday cake 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.170
 you just have to size and age of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.060
 your pig gives a blood sausage 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.950
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.810
