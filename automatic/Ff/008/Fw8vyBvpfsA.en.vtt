00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello I hope you are fine me 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.730
 I wanted to be 15 15 today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.830
 give tips or life tips or 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.059
 Just give hints like you 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.009
 maybe a little happier 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 can live and this video is not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.240
 just so maybe I'm one of you 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 can help or be attentive 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
 can do what you can change but 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 I also hope that I like her 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.060
 and I would say we're going to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.779
 much compliments other people 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.040
 at least one person a day because that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 not only makes you happy but 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.430
 the others eat the other as well 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 This makes people real and was 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.149
 the other is so happy you are too 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.940
 happy to be ready for other people 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.980
 help because the actual positive 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.890
 can have an impact remains healthy 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.219
 or to live unhealthily because of the body 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.199
 that's his only body and that 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.469
 would be a pity if it was unhealthy 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.940
 and therefore take care of this body if 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.949
 you change something because I do not speak that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.500
 just about it but just do it and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.149
 start to change something and constantly 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.150
 could be there before that but 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 just do be honest be honest 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 to you and be honest with other people 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.600
 war enough sleep but not too much 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 sleep that you missed the whole tank 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 we have to get a fresh one once a day 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.229
 air and just make a head fall 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.650
 when you are stressful or busy 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.110
 have 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.939
 He still wants you because if you always 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.540
 continue and we do not take a break 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.820
 kind of a 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.400
 even then it is getting worse are 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.530
 curious simply do in what you 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.710
 love and what you just want 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.510
 and pick the hobby from what you do 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.620
 want and I was you do you think so 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.570
 have this hobby 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.060
 this does not hold up with other people 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.420
 serious but stand by what you do 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.640
 generally did not expect too much from 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.680
 any situations any 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.090
 plans or any people and 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.710
 In the end you may be positive 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.290
 Surprised and that has only good and 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.420
 otherwise you will not be disappointed 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.360
 new things from whatever food or 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.119
 any event or something 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.119
 Just do the last one and I think so 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.830
 almost the most important one or one of 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.990
 most important thing is that you are grateful 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.420
 it should be for what you already have 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.250
 if you think you are unhappy at the moment 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.030
 all the stuff and take yes 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.920
 just moment and be thankful for that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.750
 things you already have that was 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.120
 the whole video fell early 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.620

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.890
