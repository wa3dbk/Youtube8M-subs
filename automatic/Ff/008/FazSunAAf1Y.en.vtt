let's take a look at that this is a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.330 
let's take a look at that this is a
single<00:00:29.039> oven<00:00:29.340> model<00:00:30.619> so<00:00:31.619> here's<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.039> oven

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
single oven model so here's the oven

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
single oven model so here's the oven
which<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:33.930> side<00:00:34.879> it's<00:00:36.350> broiler

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
which is on the right side it's broiler

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
which is on the right side it's broiler
and<00:00:37.789> see<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:38.909> broiler<00:00:39.329> their<00:00:41.510> element<00:00:42.510> open

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and see the broiler their element open

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.200 
and see the broiler their element open
and<00:00:45.499> needs<00:00:46.499> a<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:46.739> cleaning<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.909> overall

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and needs a little cleaning but overall

drawers underneath it's got these nice
chrome<00:01:00.690> handles<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.409> is<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.589> warming<00:01:02.100> drawer

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:02.209 
chrome handles this is a warming drawer

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:06.770 
chrome handles this is a warming drawer
actually<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.909> does<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> heating

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
actually so it does have a heating

Frigidaire<00:01:24.510> had<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.050> radiant<00:01:25.590> tube<00:01:26.240> GE<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
Frigidaire had a radiant tube GE and I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.610 
Frigidaire had a radiant tube GE and I
think<00:01:28.020> Hotpoint<00:01:28.530> both<00:01:28.950> had<00:01:29.280> Cal<00:01:29.610> rod

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
think Hotpoint both had Cal rod

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.080 
think Hotpoint both had Cal rod
different<00:01:31.620> manufacturers<00:01:32.340> had<00:01:32.580> different

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
different manufacturers had different

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.200 
different manufacturers had different
names<00:01:33.330> for<00:01:33.510> their<00:01:33.870> elements<00:01:34.620> these<00:01:34.830> are<00:01:35.210> corax

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
names for their elements these are corax

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
names for their elements these are corax
which<00:01:36.480> are<00:01:36.690> very<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.080> units

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
which are very good units

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.060 
which are very good units
this<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.120> right<00:01:39.300> here<00:01:39.360> you'll<00:01:39.840> note<00:01:40.080> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this one right here you'll note is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.890 
this one right here you'll note is
called<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:43.140> super<00:01:43.710> core<00:01:44.040> X<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
called a super core X and if you take a

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.500 
called a super core X and if you take a
look<00:01:46.290> you'll<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.370> that<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.790> outer<00:01:50.510> ring

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
look you'll see that this outer ring

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.050 
look you'll see that this outer ring
here<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:52.830> wider<00:01:53.130> than<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> other

we have the right oven and so you set
the<00:04:32.929> control<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.219> your<00:04:34.729> temperature<00:04:36.009> this<00:04:37.009> is

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:37.279 
the control to your temperature this is

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.189 
the control to your temperature this is
your<00:04:37.489> minute<00:04:37.789> timer<00:04:38.119> so<00:04:38.479> this<00:04:38.629> is<00:04:38.779> just

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199
