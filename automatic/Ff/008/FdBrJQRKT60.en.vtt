to have sex but I do believe that if
there's<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> methyl<00:01:27.119> think<00:01:27.270> about<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.840> you're

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
there's a methyl think about if you're

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
there's a methyl think about if you're
willing<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.649> eat<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> raw<00:01:29.159> voice<00:01:29.369> or<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.820> else

put
let<00:01:39.480> us<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.780> big<00:01:39.990> line<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.890> lime

over<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:42.770> perfect<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.980> then<00:01:44.700> give

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
over there perfect and then give

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.360 
over there perfect and then give

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
yourself a little pinch of shrub upper

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.640 
yourself a little pinch of shrub upper
salt<00:01:47.640> over<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:49.670> that's<00:01:50.670> good<00:01:51.050> it<00:01:52.050> should<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.320> k

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
salt over it that's good it should be k

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.830 
salt over it that's good it should be k
and<00:01:53.400> then<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.030> use<00:01:54.120> a<00:01:54.150> fork<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> might<00:01:54.720> be

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and then you can use a fork it might be

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
and then you can use a fork it might be
easier<00:01:55.230> for<00:01:55.260> you<00:01:55.620> you<00:01:56.250> gotta<00:01:56.370> pick<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.850> or

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
easier for you you gotta pick it up or

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.870 
easier for you you gotta pick it up or
slip<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> show<00:01:58.340> yeah<00:01:59.340> since<00:01:59.729> it's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
really does a great job there's a lot of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.340 
really does a great job there's a lot of
people<00:02:27.780> who<00:02:27.989> use<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:29.190> tecate<00:02:29.850> or<00:02:30.239> Tabasco<00:02:30.870> on

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
people who use like tecate or Tabasco on

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.960 
people who use like tecate or Tabasco on
there's<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:32.130> heat<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:32.850> me

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
there's a get a little heat but for me

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.270 
there's a get a little heat but for me
that<00:02:33.000> vinegar<00:02:33.600> really<00:02:33.900> doesn't<00:02:34.620> do<00:02:34.860> well<00:02:35.070> on

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
that vinegar really doesn't do well on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.900 
that vinegar really doesn't do well on
oyster<00:02:35.670> where<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.720> serrano<00:02:37.230> pepper<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
oyster where the serrano pepper in the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.040 
oyster where the serrano pepper in the
salt<00:02:39.350> really<00:02:40.350> makes<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.770> big<00:02:40.800> difference<00:02:41.459> then

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
salt really makes a big difference then

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.120 
salt really makes a big difference then
getting<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.140> little<00:02:43.230> bit<00:02:43.380> Brian<00:02:43.650> here's<00:02:43.950> my

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
getting a little bit Brian here's my

going on the half shell who put into a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.140 
going on the half shell who put into a
shot<00:03:06.739> glass<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.069> what<00:03:07.519> I've<00:03:07.610> done<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:08.030> I've
