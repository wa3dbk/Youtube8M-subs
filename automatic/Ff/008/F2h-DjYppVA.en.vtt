Jace and yeah here it is it's a looking
a<00:00:30.820> bit<00:00:32.129> raggedy<00:00:33.129> ass<00:00:33.309> at<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.550> moment<00:00:33.910> that's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
a bit raggedy ass at the moment that's

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.910 
a bit raggedy ass at the moment that's
the<00:00:34.540> wire<00:00:34.750> sticking<00:00:35.080> out<00:00:35.320> of<00:00:35.440> it<00:00:35.559> because<00:00:35.680> the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
the wire sticking out of it because the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.160 
the wire sticking out of it because the
battery<00:00:36.280> clip<00:00:36.430> came<00:00:36.790> loose<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.239> I've<00:00:37.870> had<00:00:38.020> to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
battery clip came loose and I've had to

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.229 
battery clip came loose and I've had to
like<00:00:38.350> solder<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.309> together<00:00:39.640> again<00:00:39.940> because<00:00:40.149> it

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
like solder it together again because it

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.540 
like solder it together again because it
wasn't<00:00:40.480> working<00:00:40.510> when<00:00:40.870> I<00:00:40.899> got<00:00:41.110> it<00:00:41.230> so<00:00:42.040> it's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
wasn't working when I got it so it's

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.119 
wasn't working when I got it so it's
showing<00:00:42.879> its<00:00:42.969> age<00:00:43.090> a<00:00:43.149> bit<00:00:43.620> better<00:00:44.620> I<00:00:44.980> think

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
showing its age a bit better I think

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.400 
showing its age a bit better I think
it's<00:00:45.430> pretty<00:00:45.640> good<00:00:45.940> chorus<00:00:46.750> pedal<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:47.170> stuff

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
it's pretty good chorus pedal and stuff

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.310 
it's pretty good chorus pedal and stuff

let's<00:01:45.810> try<00:01:45.990> winding<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.580> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
let's try winding that right up to a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:05.740 
let's try winding that right up to a
three<00:01:48.270> course

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.760 

and<00:02:07.550> maximum<00:02:08.550> rate<00:02:08.789> with<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.750> hold<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.410> mia

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and maximum rate with that hold it mia

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.820 
and maximum rate with that hold it mia
famous<00:02:11.340> thing<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.820> there's<00:02:12.000> pizza<00:02:12.420> ready

famous thing is that there's pizza ready
I'll<00:02:13.830> make<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.220> quick<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.610> i'll<00:02:14.700> eat<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I'll make this quick and i'll eat and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.600 

that's<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.780> base<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.190> range<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.400> sounds

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
that's the base of the range of sounds

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.720 
that's the base of the range of sounds
just<00:02:39.210> show<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.450> minimum<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.740> with<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
just show the minimum on that with the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:57.789 
just show the minimum on that with the
right<00:02:41.910> down<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.480> depth<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.110> switch<00:02:43.470> down

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.080 

that's<00:02:58.799> more<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.129> flange<00:02:59.430> sort<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.790> sounds

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
that's more of a flange sort of sounds

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.449 
that's more of a flange sort of sounds
you've<00:03:00.239> got<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.620> depth<00:03:01.620> down<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.190> their<00:03:02.280> end

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
you've got the depth down and their end

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.339 
you've got the depth down and their end
up<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.940> right<00:03:03.120> down<00:03:03.330> at<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.510> bomb<00:03:03.720> so

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
up on the right down at the bomb so

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.860 
up on the right down at the bomb so
let's<00:03:04.500> flick<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.250> depth<00:03:06.120> switch<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.659> see

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
let's flick that depth switch and see

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.830 
let's flick that depth switch and see
like<00:03:06.989> what<00:03:07.260> happens<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.099> sound<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.849> going

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
like what happens to the sound so going

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:30.380 
like what happens to the sound so going
down<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.409> vinyl<00:03:10.739> end<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:30.030> yeah<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.329> a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
down into the vinyl end so yeah it's a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.030 
down into the vinyl end so yeah it's a
really<00:03:30.569> lush<00:03:30.840> chorus<00:03:31.379> I<00:03:31.590> mean<00:03:31.769> there's<00:03:31.980> a

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
really lush chorus I mean there's a

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.099 
really lush chorus I mean there's a
reason<00:03:32.069> it's<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.459> popular<00:03:32.730> let's<00:03:33.690> pull<00:03:33.930> that

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
reason it's so popular let's pull that

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.000 
reason it's so popular let's pull that
right<00:03:34.319> out<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.709> middle<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.739> getting

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
right out to the middle this is getting

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:48.089 
right out to the middle this is getting
a<00:03:38.040> bit<00:03:38.069> more<00:03:38.370> absurd<00:03:38.970> now

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:04:18.150 

so<00:03:49.099> like<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.280> really<00:03:49.610> extreme<00:03:50.150> sort<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.599> beach

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.759

so yeah so with the depth Nova I can get

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.060 
so yeah so with the depth Nova I can get
pretty<00:04:22.010> mental<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.700> used<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.270> play<00:04:23.830> round<00:04:24.830> about

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
pretty mental I used to play round about

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.800 
pretty mental I used to play round about
here<00:04:25.310> just<00:04:25.790> with<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.030> depth<00:04:26.240> down<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.750> the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
here just with the depth down and the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.500 
here just with the depth down and the
right<00:04:26.990> kind<00:04:27.320> of<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.590> three<00:04:28.550> quarters<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.180> found

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
right kind of a three quarters I found

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:53.350 
right kind of a three quarters I found
that<00:04:29.690> was<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.930> sweet

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.969 

so<00:04:54.360> there<00:04:54.509> we<00:04:54.599> go<00:04:54.629> so<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.529> a<00:04:55.620> really<00:04:55.770> cool

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
so there we go so it's a really cool

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.920 
so there we go so it's a really cool
pedal<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.550> think<00:04:56.969> probably<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.360> best<00:04:57.569> chorus

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
pedal I think probably the best chorus
