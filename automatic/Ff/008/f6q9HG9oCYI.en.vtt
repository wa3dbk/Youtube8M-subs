is a producer of ethanol it's expensive

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.840 
is a producer of ethanol it's expensive
because<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.350> high<00:01:13.530> demand<00:01:13.950> despite

that the water ethanol mixing this

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.529 
that the water ethanol mixing this

good<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.170> why<00:01:22.380> aren't<00:01:22.619> automakers<00:01:23.340> beating<00:01:23.759> a

good so why aren't automakers beating a
path<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> Idaho<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> opening<00:01:25.470> their<00:01:25.649> minds<00:01:25.920> to

ethanol<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> those<00:01:27.600> things
