second video going to be about can give
us<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.899> spoilers<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.859> think<00:00:45.760> that<00:00:45.850> we<00:00:46.149> should

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
us the spoilers I think that we should

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.779 
us the spoilers I think that we should
keep<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:46.629> underwrite<00:00:47.350> bit<00:00:48.129> secretive<00:00:48.460> and

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
keep that underwrite bit secretive and

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.430 
keep that underwrite bit secretive and
so<00:00:48.910> we<00:00:49.030> have<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.179> little<00:00:49.480> bit<00:00:49.600> more<00:00:49.780> well<00:00:50.320> that

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
so we have a little bit more well that

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.509 
so we have a little bit more well that
