00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.950
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.670
 Alina would be today I want you 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.070
 to offer 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.860
 very interesting workshop 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.119
 same mainly for beginners master 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.390
 kanzashi class 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.509
 I want to answer this one often 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.940
 asked question what can be done from 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.440
 so you are one and a half customers 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.960
 or two centimeters 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.810
 Today I have a tape of one and a half centimeters 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.430
 and I want to offer you these 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.440
 nice rezinochki and lines 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.600
 making them is very easy and I think even 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.290
 beginning to handle this assignment and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.690
 It will turn out very nicely and the volume is not much 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.770
 how do we make the petal itself we take 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.870
 here is such 30 clients and a half la 4 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:08.579
 centimeter and do take off that of course 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.079
 the same professionals already know what can 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.400
 do it with a soldering iron but we today with 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.890
 you make scissors for both 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.319
 beginners means we take the first thing 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 we do so here we can 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:22.649
 do not apply if you already have time 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.289
 budget and cut with scissors 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.219
 at an angle further we take 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:34.880
 lighter 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:37.259
 and we cauterize we cauterize so 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.399
 Here we have this 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.399
 little petal 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.040
 like here on chrysanthemum and on big and we 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.330
 with him we do the same thing to him 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.310
 laying here here is the middle and 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.570
 once again the middle with the little work 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.960
 a little harder 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:05.510
 it turns out also very beautiful 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.160
 level and now we cauterize why I 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.280
 decided today to show this master class 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.620
 because mostly people think that he 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.970
 let's say such petals 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.550
 let's say chrysanthemums can be made 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.980
 also only big flowers and ladies dressings 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.830
 wine bezel i'm here i want to show you what 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.750
 even on such a rezinochku too 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.000
 make such a pretty flower 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.910
 it means that we are dear friends 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.970
 Here are the petals on one flower to us 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.489
 need somewhere trick 20 such petals 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.130
 and I think that will be enough 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.260
 then we make the petals warm up 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.750
 curve pistol and we will proceed to 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:47.090
 assembly and so I took just such a rezinochku 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.989
 such red claret is possible 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.290
 say the colors using a ribbon thin 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.060
 I secured a felt circle on top 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.660
 you can make no felt here 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.330
 let's say i used to just 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.519
 took a circle of cardboard pasted over new 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.470
 his ribbon and pasted baskets too 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.140
 principle before well well just with the wind 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.680
 everything is easier now just took a piece 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.670
 felt and stuck so now we start 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.670
 our assembly 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:37.080
 so dear friends basically everything is ready 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.999
 Here we have turned them rezinochka 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.889
 the last thing left for us to stick here 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:42.900
 such a bead can do it or with 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.779
 using an adhesive moment or using 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.159
 hot melt glue since we are already here 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:48.150
 hot glue all just a little bit here 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:51.659
 need to add 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:05:02.840
 and glue in here neatly mkusi night 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:05:07.789
 and take our bead and glue 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.789
 just gently pressing 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.150
 it turns out we are so cute 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.250
