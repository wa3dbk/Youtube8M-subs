sick of looking at these poor onions did
some<00:00:09.840> research<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.440> found<00:00:10.530> out<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:10.889> once

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
some research and found out that once

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.680 
some research and found out that once
the<00:00:11.280> stocks<00:00:11.550> fall<00:00:11.820> over<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.179> bulb<00:00:12.389> stopped

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the stocks fall over the bulb stopped

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.200 
the stocks fall over the bulb stopped
growing<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.610> there's<00:00:14.610> no<00:00:14.700> point<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.089> leaving

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
growing so there's no point of leaving

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.180 
growing so there's no point of leaving
these<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.890> keep<00:00:17.039> getting

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
these in it's just going to keep getting

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.960 
these in it's just going to keep getting
worse<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:18.410> they<00:00:19.410> may<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.680> bigger<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
worse and they may get bigger but the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.460 
worse and they may get bigger but the
bulbs<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> grow<00:00:21.810> anymore<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
bulbs not going to grow anymore so I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.189 
bulbs not going to grow anymore so I
won't<00:00:22.650> get<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.859> good<00:00:22.980> onion<00:00:23.810> at<00:00:24.810> least<00:00:25.019> out<00:00:25.170> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
won't get a good onion at least out of

these<00:00:25.410> two<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.859> one<00:00:26.070> still<00:00:26.369> seems<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.849> be

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
these two this one still seems to be

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.320 
these two this one still seems to be
growing<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.420> bit<00:00:28.340> I'm<00:00:29.340> trying<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.179> see

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
growing a little bit I'm trying to see

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.290 
growing a little bit I'm trying to see
the<00:00:30.449> stock<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.820> started<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:32.969> thick

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the stock on that started really thick

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.319 
the stock on that started really thick
it<00:00:33.450> out<00:00:33.770> release<00:00:34.770> ones<00:00:35.040> least<00:00:35.700> instead<00:00:36.120> they

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
it out release ones least instead they

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.090 
it out release ones least instead they
stayed<00:00:36.570> real<00:00:36.750> spindly<00:00:37.230> i<00:00:37.410> figured<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.860> just

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
stayed real spindly i figured it's just

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.160 
stayed real spindly i figured it's just
a<00:00:38.219> light<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:38.430> had<00:00:38.730> wrong<00:00:39.770> but<00:00:40.770> i<00:00:41.760> did<00:00:42.270> plant<00:00:42.600> or

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
a light i had wrong but i did plant or

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.979 
a light i had wrong but i did plant or
that<00:00:43.520> onion<00:00:44.520> i<00:00:44.640> started<00:00:45.239> over<00:00:45.420> there<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that onion i started over there is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.450 
that onion i started over there is
actually<00:00:46.500> starting<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> come<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.070> well

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
actually starting to come out well

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.360 
actually starting to come out well
hopefully<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:48.000> my<00:00:48.440> new<00:00:49.440> fancy<00:00:49.770> light<00:00:50.160> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
hopefully with my new fancy light it

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
hopefully with my new fancy light it
will<00:00:50.489> i<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.780> better<00:00:51.989> than<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> first<00:00:52.469> rounded

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
will i do better than the first rounded

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.950 
will i do better than the first rounded
