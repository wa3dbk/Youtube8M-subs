was upgraded to the newer H 111 which

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.009 
was upgraded to the newer H 111 which
you<00:00:27.119> see<00:00:27.330> right<00:00:27.539> here

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
you see right here

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.150 
you see right here
and<00:00:28.250> although<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.699> H<00:00:29.820> 101<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.720> EH<00:00:31.109> 111<00:00:31.859> looked

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
and although the H 101 and EH 111 looked

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.819 
and although the H 101 and EH 111 looked
almost<00:00:32.399> identical<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.390> their<00:00:33.600> design<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.620> two

almost identical in their design the two

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.350 
almost identical in their design the two
machines<00:00:35.040> did<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.640> some<00:00:35.910> very<00:00:36.149> big

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
machines did have some very big

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.750 
machines did have some very big
differences<00:00:37.129> now<00:00:38.129> let's<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
differences now let's go and get a

stick you can see two cylinders which

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.399 
stick you can see two cylinders which
will<00:01:04.650> curl<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> bucket<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:07.170> up

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
will curl the bucket in and out and up

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
will curl the bucket in and out and up
top<00:01:07.619> under<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> boom<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.030> one

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
top under the boom you can see one

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
top under the boom you can see one
single<00:01:09.689> big<00:01:09.869> cylinder<00:01:10.320> which<00:01:11.010> will<00:01:11.189> push<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
single big cylinder which will push the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.020 
single big cylinder which will push the
stick<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:16.009> now<00:01:17.009> let's<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.850> the
