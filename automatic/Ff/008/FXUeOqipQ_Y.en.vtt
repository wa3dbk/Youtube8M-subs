00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.559
 that takes advantage of their locality and beats a bilbao that was dangerous in the 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.129
 second half 7 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.010
 I would actively say yes it had its opportunities but 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.010
 very few activate the first goal of Barcelona 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.310
 the two he got in the match from the bush 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.670
 the first at the service of said law that pulls the center first post in this 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.249
 move 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.339
 we already said traditional in the way of attacking the barsa and that way 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.629
 marks forests and then hard to stay iniesta for a clear criminal if 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.320
 I had no reason to stretch years 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.290
 touched the defender's leg 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.510
 and here in the definition by messi deceiving the goalkeeper and made two 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.810
 that is to say based on being these see this play that is impressive first 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.620
 to the overflow of chickens and on the right side and then the high chili 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.910
 it just happened to buzzing it's amazing that I could say that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.020
 plays we do not know that he is a tough man he is an aggressive man to defend and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.830
 he also knows how to attack Cuba 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.080
 the shot of iniesta that had already beaten the goalkeeper but the post 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.920
 it prevents the note without league acb we are seeing them the first action but in 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 Overall, I counted 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.070
 of goal by barcelona 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.520
 of not achieving it 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.490
 and how many passed by eta should call the stretched by the defender 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.650
 after iraola saving the pique goal on the line 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.970
 although the betis 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.730
 the barcelona dominated there yes I think we found nothing action of time 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.530
 in the second half but here 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.380
 on three failed occasions 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.700
 previously Rafael Marquez had finished off his head and the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.590
 barcelona another failure of tokelau returns 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.980
 to hit the crossbar and whose recent 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.710
 the one that originates the leak 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.330
 in the absence of dani alves and again puyol gets into the area opened the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.440
 space and the stick that all that again with the left handed dump 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.010
 I do not know but it seems that you have to have results that will teach were 10 and 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.090
 here we see how the general classification is and this barsa 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.640
 has recovered more advantage to six points on real madrid third seville with 46 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.850
 cease
