for today's tip video on transit black
ops<00:00:11.190> 2<00:00:11.490> just<00:00:12.480> showing<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.809> about<00:00:12.929> teleport

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
ops 2 just showing you about teleport

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.799 
ops 2 just showing you about teleport
not<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.160> many<00:00:14.280> people<00:00:14.460> will<00:00:15.450> know<00:00:15.570> about

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
not that many people will know about

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.140 
not that many people will know about
these<00:00:15.990> there<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.590> actually<00:00:16.980> teleporters<00:00:17.670> in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
these there is actually teleporters in

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.120 
these there is actually teleporters in
transit<00:00:18.660> instead<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.380> taking<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.740> bus<00:00:19.890> so

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
transit instead of taking the bus so

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.300 
transit instead of taking the bus so
I'll<00:00:20.220> running<00:00:20.520> through<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:22.020> mist<00:00:22.380> right

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
I'll running through the mist right

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.650 
I'll running through the mist right
after<00:00:23.580> these<00:00:23.670> teleporters<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> first

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
after these teleporters on the first

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.019 
after these teleporters on the first
thing<00:00:24.810> you'll<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.680> turbine<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:27.140> if<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
thing you'll need is a turbine or if you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.980 
thing you'll need is a turbine or if you
if<00:00:30.029> you're<00:00:30.150> doing<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.449> later<00:00:30.660> rounds<00:00:30.810> you

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
if you're doing it in later rounds you

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.209 
if you're doing it in later rounds you
can<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.260> use<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> power<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.009> you'd<00:00:32.130> actually

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
can just use the power so you'd actually

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.150 
can just use the power so you'd actually
need<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> turbine<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.649> come<00:00:34.649> over<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
need a turbine and come over here and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.130 
need a turbine and come over here and
just<00:00:35.940> pop<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> turbine<00:00:36.660> down

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
just pop a turbine down

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110 
just pop a turbine down
you<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.620> lump<00:00:37.920> posts<00:00:38.399> there's<00:00:38.760> wooden

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you see these lump posts there's wooden

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
you see these lump posts there's wooden
one<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.719> every<00:00:39.930> area<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.440> there's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> few<00:00:41.040> in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
one in every area and there's a few in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.030 
one in every area and there's a few in
the<00:00:41.250> mists<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> gets<00:00:42.600> power<00:00:42.920> see<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the mists and when it gets power see the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
the mists and when it gets power see the
green<00:00:44.250> light<00:00:44.460> comes<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.960> need

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
green light comes on and then you need

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.319 
green light comes on and then you need
to<00:00:46.200> go<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> mist<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:46.980> into<00:00:47.160> these

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
to go into the mist and get into these

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.900 
to go into the mist and get into these
calling<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> blue<00:00:49.050> chase<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:50.610> he<00:00:50.700> needed

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
calling on the blue chase and he needed

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.200 
calling on the blue chase and he needed
it<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:52.100> he<00:00:53.100> didn't<00:00:53.370> jump<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.879> head<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it to he didn't jump on your head and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
it to he didn't jump on your head and
then<00:00:54.440> run<00:00:55.440> over<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> lamp<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
then run over to the lamp and what it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.510 
then run over to the lamp and what it
does<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:58.109> buries<00:00:58.649> itself<00:00:58.980> underneath<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
does is it buries itself underneath a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.350 
does is it buries itself underneath a
lamp<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.000> creates<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> poor

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.320 

yeah<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:07.340> just<00:01:07.520> get<00:01:07.760> on<00:01:07.790> your<00:01:08.030> head<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.270> then

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
yeah so just get on your head and then

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.240 
yeah so just get on your head and then
run<00:01:08.540> over<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.900> one<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.050> those<00:01:09.200> lamps<00:01:09.410> and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
run over to the one of those lamps and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.490 
run over to the one of those lamps and
then<00:01:10.400> what<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.330> do<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.480> just<00:01:11.690> jump<00:01:11.930> on<00:01:12.230> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
then what you do is just jump on the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.890 
then what you do is just jump on the
pole<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.610> takes<00:01:13.820> you<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:14.450> think

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
pole and then it takes you to I think

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.490 
pole and then it takes you to I think
I'm<00:01:15.050> at<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.260> yeah<00:01:15.590> I'm<00:01:15.680> at<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.830> diner<00:01:16.070> now<00:01:16.340> but

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
I'm at the yeah I'm at the diner now but

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.830 
I'm at the yeah I'm at the diner now but
each<00:01:18.500> time<00:01:18.800> is<00:01:19.010> random<00:01:19.430> because<00:01:20.090> I'd<00:01:20.450> go<00:01:20.630> back

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
each time is random because I'd go back

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.360 
each time is random because I'd go back
to<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.180> best<00:01:23.390> fo<00:01:23.979> after<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.100> pole

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
to the to the best fo after this pole

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.900 
to the to the best fo after this pole
and<00:01:26.350> then<00:01:27.350> try<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:27.920> once<00:01:28.070> more<00:01:28.190> an<00:01:28.400> action<00:01:28.580> the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
and then try it once more an action the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.250 
and then try it once more an action the
drops<00:01:29.150> we're<00:01:29.930> gonna<00:01:30.140> move<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.920> time<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:32.540> it's

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
drops we're gonna move a time so it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.590 
drops we're gonna move a time so it's
not<00:01:33.500> like<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.770> guaranteed<00:01:34.840> teleport<00:01:36.400> so<00:01:37.600> you

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
not like a guaranteed teleport so you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.240 
not like a guaranteed teleport so you
don't<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:38.990> know<00:01:39.140> where<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.380> will<00:01:39.530> be<00:01:39.740> once

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
don't really know where you will be once

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.150 
don't really know where you will be once
you<00:01:40.340> tell<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.670> part<00:01:41.259> yeah<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.009> don't

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
you tell the part yeah so you don't

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.950 
you tell the part yeah so you don't
necessarily<00:01:43.250> need<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.820> turbine<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.570> just

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
necessarily need the turbine and just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.499 
necessarily need the turbine and just
make<00:01:45.110> sure<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.320> got<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.500> power<00:01:45.710> on<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.509> then

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
make sure you got the power on and then

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.719 
make sure you got the power on and then
all<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:47.900> teleport<00:01:48.320> should<00:01:48.500> work<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:48.950> just

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
all the teleport should work and just

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:59.260 
all the teleport should work and just
get<00:01:49.910> rid<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.119> those<00:01:50.270> creatures<00:01:55.660> just<00:01:58.119> make<00:01:59.119> one

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
get rid of those creatures just make one

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.130 
get rid of those creatures just make one
of<00:01:59.360> those<00:01:59.479> poles<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:01.700> if<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.149> helps<00:02:02.450> out

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
of those poles so if this helps out

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.900 
of those poles so if this helps out
leave<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> like<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.550> noise<00:02:04.729> in<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
leave a like that noise in the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.910 
leave a like that noise in the
background<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.420> filters<00:02:05.930> right<00:02:06.229> so<00:02:06.470> my<00:02:06.619> window

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
background is filters right so my window

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.310 
background is filters right so my window
so<00:02:07.160> I'm<00:02:07.550> gonna<00:02:07.729> leave<00:02:07.940> this<00:02:08.090> video<00:02:08.300> areas<00:02:08.750> all

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
so I'm gonna leave this video areas all
