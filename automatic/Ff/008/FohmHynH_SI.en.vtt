we'll<00:00:19.109> use<00:00:19.289> unit<00:00:19.560> fractions<00:00:20.039> so<00:00:21.000> begin<00:00:21.330> by

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
we'll use unit fractions so begin by

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.519 
we'll use unit fractions so begin by
writing<00:00:21.660> 90<00:00:22.439> km/h<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> fraction<00:00:24.529> which

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
writing 90 km/h as a fraction which

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.179 
writing 90 km/h as a fraction which
would<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.859> ninety<00:00:26.490> kilometers<00:00:27.800> per<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.760> hour

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
would be ninety kilometers per one hour

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
would be ninety kilometers per one hour
and<00:00:32.189> our<00:00:32.309> goal<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> convert<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and our goal here is to convert this

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.139 
and our goal here is to convert this
rate<00:00:34.190> into<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> rate<00:00:35.489> where<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.540> metres

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
rate into a rate where we have metres

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.440 
rate into a rate where we have metres
per<00:00:39.290> second

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
per second

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.090 
per second
let's<00:00:42.450> begin<00:00:42.570> by<00:00:42.719> converting<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.469> kilometers

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
let's begin by converting the kilometers

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
let's begin by converting the kilometers
to<00:00:44.399> meters<00:00:44.750> we'll<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.989> using<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
to meters we'll do this using the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.400 
to meters we'll do this using the
conversion<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.309> kilometer<00:00:47.850> equals

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
conversion that when kilometer equals

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.860 
conversion that when kilometer equals
1,000<00:00:49.410> meters<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> multiply<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> unit

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
1,000 meters so we to multiply by a unit

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.650 
1,000 meters so we to multiply by a unit
fraction<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.280> want<00:00:53.660> kilometers

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
fraction and because we want kilometers

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.850 
fraction and because we want kilometers
to<00:00:54.780> simplify<00:00:55.199> out

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to simplify out

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
to simplify out
we'll<00:00:56.610> put<00:00:56.820> kilometers<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.600> denominator

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we'll put kilometers in the denominator

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.889 
we'll put kilometers in the denominator
and<00:00:58.469> meters<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.670> numerator<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.270> again

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and meters in the numerator and again

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
and meters in the numerator and again
the<00:01:00.989> conversion<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.859> one<00:01:02.070> thousand

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the conversion is that one thousand

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.859 
the conversion is that one thousand
meters<00:01:03.409> equals<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:05.100> kilometer

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
meters equals one kilometer

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.210 
meters equals one kilometer
because<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:06.960> units<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.350> equal<00:01:07.680> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
because these units are equal this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
because these units are equal this
fraction<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.820> equal<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.439> but<00:01:10.439> notice<00:01:10.740> how

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
fraction is equal to one but notice how

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.130 
fraction is equal to one but notice how
the<00:01:10.920> units<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.310> kilometers<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.540> simplifies

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the units of kilometers now simplifies

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.240 
the units of kilometers now simplifies
out<00:01:13.409> leaving<00:01:14.400> us<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.670> meters<00:01:15.950> now<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.009> still

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
out leaving us with meters now we still

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.179 
out leaving us with meters now we still
have<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.430> convert<00:01:17.729> hours<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.479> seconds<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> will

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
have to convert hours to seconds so will

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.670 
have to convert hours to seconds so will
first<00:01:20.430> convert<00:01:20.670> hours<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.540> minutes<00:01:21.720> by

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
first convert hours to minutes by

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.760 
first convert hours to minutes by
multiplying<00:01:23.189> by<00:01:23.369> another<00:01:23.430> unit<00:01:23.880> fraction<00:01:24.770> we

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
multiplying by another unit fraction we

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580 
multiplying by another unit fraction we
don't<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.159> hours<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.909> our<00:01:27.420> answer<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.020> we'll

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
don't want hours in our answer so we'll

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.580 
don't want hours in our answer so we'll
have<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.860> hours<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> numerator<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
have to have hours in the numerator and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.740 
have to have hours in the numerator and
minutes<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> denominator<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.750> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
minutes in the denominator and the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.719 
minutes in the denominator and the
conversion<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.740> hour<00:01:34.890> equals<00:01:35.340> 60

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
conversion is that one hour equals 60

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.190 
conversion is that one hour equals 60
minutes<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.290> 1<00:01:37.530> hour<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:37.950> 60<00:01:38.640> minutes

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
minutes so of 1 hour over 60 minutes

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.039 
minutes so of 1 hour over 60 minutes
notice<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.310> units<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.820> hours<00:01:42.329> simplifies

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
notice now the units of hours simplifies

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.380 
notice now the units of hours simplifies
out<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.700> now<00:01:44.700> we're<00:01:44.850> left<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> convert

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
out and now we're left to convert

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.550 
out and now we're left to convert
minutes<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.380> seconds<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.960> multiply<00:01:49.110> by

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
minutes to seconds so we multiply by

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.700 
minutes to seconds so we multiply by
another<00:01:49.619> unit<00:01:49.979> fraction<00:01:51.200> we<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.380> minutes<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
another unit fraction we want minutes to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
another unit fraction we want minutes to
simplify<00:01:53.130> out<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.610> we'll<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.329> minutes<00:01:54.659> in

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
simplify out so we'll have minutes in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
simplify out so we'll have minutes in
the<00:01:54.930> numerator<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.850> seconds<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the numerator and seconds to the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
the numerator and seconds to the
denominator<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.810> our<00:01:58.469> conversion<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
denominator and our conversion is that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.359 
denominator and our conversion is that
one<00:01:59.460> minute<00:01:59.670> equals<00:02:00.180> 60<00:02:00.689> seconds<00:02:01.369> minute

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
one minute equals 60 seconds minute

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.030 
one minute equals 60 seconds minute
simplifies<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.439> notice<00:02:04.439> how<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.829> have

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
simplifies out notice how now we have

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
simplifies out notice how now we have
the<00:02:05.159> correct<00:02:05.340> units<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:06.899> we'll<00:02:07.020> multiply

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the correct units so now we'll multiply

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
the correct units so now we'll multiply
across<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> numerator<00:02:08.190> multiply<00:02:09.090> across<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
across the numerator multiply across the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.990 
across the numerator multiply across the
denominator<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:11.069> divide<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
denominator and then divide to get the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.539 
denominator and then divide to get the
unit<00:02:12.300> rate

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
unit rate

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.069 
unit rate
so<00:02:14.549> in<00:02:14.609> the<00:02:14.670> numerator<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.150> 90<00:02:15.780> times

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
so in the numerator we have 90 times

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.129 
so in the numerator we have 90 times
1,000<00:02:16.890> times<00:02:17.040> 1<00:02:17.340> times<00:02:17.519> 1<00:02:17.939> that's<00:02:17.969> 90<00:02:18.659> thousand

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:19.139 
1,000 times 1 times 1 that's 90 thousand

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.670 
1,000 times 1 times 1 that's 90 thousand
meters<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:21.599> our<00:02:21.689> denominator<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.319> 1

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
meters in our denominator we have 1

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.440 
meters in our denominator we have 1
times<00:02:22.920> 1<00:02:23.219> times<00:02:23.400> 60<00:02:23.909> times<00:02:23.939> 60<00:02:24.299> seconds<00:02:25.139> or

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
times 1 times 60 times 60 seconds or

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.679 
times 1 times 60 times 60 seconds or
3600<00:02:27.450> seconds<00:02:28.819> again<00:02:29.819> will<00:02:29.969> now<00:02:30.090> convert<00:02:30.480> this

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
3600 seconds again will now convert this

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.089 
3600 seconds again will now convert this
to<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.930> unit<00:02:31.170> rate<00:02:31.319> by<00:02:31.560> performing<00:02:32.010> this

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
to a unit rate by performing this

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.920 
to a unit rate by performing this
division<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.870> 90<00:02:34.319> thousand<00:02:37.189> divided<00:02:38.189> by<00:02:38.930> 3600

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
division so 90 thousand divided by 3600

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.009 
division so 90 thousand divided by 3600
is<00:02:41.329> equal<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.480> 25<00:02:44.209> which<00:02:45.209> means<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.569> unit<00:02:45.840> rate

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
is equal to 25 which means a unit rate

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.069 
is equal to 25 which means a unit rate
is<00:02:46.049> 25<00:02:48.079> meters<00:02:49.079> per<00:02:49.519> 1<00:02:50.519> second<00:02:51.030> which<00:02:51.810> can<00:02:51.959> also

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
is 25 meters per 1 second which can also

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.349 
is 25 meters per 1 second which can also
be<00:02:52.260> written<00:02:52.379> as<00:02:52.620> 25<00:02:53.480> meters<00:02:54.480> per<00:02:54.689> second<00:02:56.359> but

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
be written as 25 meters per second but

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.550 
be written as 25 meters per second but
our<00:02:57.480> goal<00:02:57.629> here<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.930> find<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.290> distance

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
our goal here is to find the distance

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.399 
our goal here is to find the distance
traveled<00:02:58.919> in<00:02:59.010> 3<00:02:59.219> seconds<00:02:59.840> where<00:03:00.840> distance

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
traveled in 3 seconds where distance

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.390 
traveled in 3 seconds where distance
equals<00:03:01.889> rate<00:03:02.129> times<00:03:02.370> time<00:03:03.889> so<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:05.010> distance

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
equals rate times time so the distance

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.839 
equals rate times time so the distance
traveled<00:03:05.939> is<00:03:06.150> equal<00:03:06.449> to<00:03:06.949> 25<00:03:07.949> meters<00:03:08.549> per

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
traveled is equal to 25 meters per

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.909 
traveled is equal to 25 meters per
second<00:03:10.010> times<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.430> time<00:03:11.669> of<00:03:12.090> 3<00:03:12.359> seconds<00:03:12.919> which

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
second times the time of 3 seconds which

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:20.030 
second times the time of 3 seconds which
gives<00:03:14.189> us<00:03:14.370> 75<00:03:15.180> meters<00:03:15.599> a<00:03:18.560> lot<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.650> times<00:03:19.859> when

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
gives us 75 meters a lot of times when

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.159 
gives us 75 meters a lot of times when
working<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> distance<00:03:20.819> formula<00:03:21.169> we

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
working with the distance formula we

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.170 
working with the distance formula we
leave<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.439> units<00:03:22.769> off<00:03:22.919> like<00:03:23.250> we<00:03:23.370> did<00:03:23.519> here<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
leave the units off like we did here and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.149 
leave the units off like we did here and
then<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.049> put<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.290> units<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.739> our<00:03:25.859> answer

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
then just put the units in our answer

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.580 
then just put the units in our answer
but<00:03:26.849> I<00:03:26.909> do<00:03:26.970> want<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.239> show<00:03:27.389> this<00:03:27.479> again<00:03:27.590> leaving

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
but I do want to show this again leaving

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.319 
but I do want to show this again leaving
the<00:03:28.680> units<00:03:28.979> in<00:03:29.220> we<00:03:29.759> could<00:03:29.909> have<00:03:30.000> written<00:03:30.120> this

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
the units in we could have written this

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.469 
the units in we could have written this
as<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.840> distance<00:03:31.019> equals<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.519> rate<00:03:32.699> of<00:03:32.909> 25

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.479 
as the distance equals the rate of 25

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.059 
as the distance equals the rate of 25
meters<00:03:33.930> per<00:03:34.349> 1<00:03:35.310> second<00:03:35.930> times<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.199> time<00:03:37.439> of<00:03:37.829> 3

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
meters per 1 second times a time of 3

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.550 
meters per 1 second times a time of 3
seconds<00:03:38.659> which<00:03:39.659> can<00:03:39.840> be<00:03:39.900> written<00:03:40.139> as<00:03:40.259> 3

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
seconds which can be written as 3

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.119 
seconds which can be written as 3
seconds<00:03:40.949> over<00:03:41.159> 1<00:03:42.349> notice<00:03:43.349> how<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.650> this<00:03:43.769> form

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
seconds over 1 notice how in this form

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.749 
seconds over 1 notice how in this form
the<00:03:44.819> units<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.180> seconds<00:03:45.569> simplifies<00:03:46.169> out<00:03:46.759> the

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:47.759 
the units of seconds simplifies out the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.069 
the units of seconds simplifies out the
thing<00:03:47.939> is<00:03:48.060> with<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> same<00:03:48.540> result

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
thing is with the same result

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.849 
thing is with the same result
of<00:03:49.199> 75<00:03:50.189> meters<00:03:51.379> so<00:03:52.379> one<00:03:52.530> thing<00:03:52.680> nice<00:03:52.829> about

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
of 75 meters so one thing nice about

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.949 
of 75 meters so one thing nice about
leaving<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> unit's<00:03:53.639> in<00:03:53.879> is<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.689> we<00:03:54.810> never

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
leaving the unit's in is that we never

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.899 
leaving the unit's in is that we never
have<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.139> second-guess<00:03:55.470> ourselves<00:03:55.909> about

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
have to second-guess ourselves about

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.699 
have to second-guess ourselves about
what<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.180> unit<00:03:57.419> should<00:03:57.659> be<00:03:57.840> because<00:03:58.500> the

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
what the unit should be because the

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.640 
what the unit should be because the
unit's<00:03:58.979> work<00:03:59.159> themselves<00:03:59.340> out<00:03:59.759> I<00:04:00.500> hope<00:04:01.500> you

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
unit's work themselves out I hope you

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.790 
unit's work themselves out I hope you
found<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:01.979> explanation<00:04:02.159> helpful
