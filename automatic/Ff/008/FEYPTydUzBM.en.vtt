them up on top of that line of glue so
you're<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.719> build<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you're actually going to kind of build a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.759 
you're actually going to kind of build a
u-shape<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.430> will<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
u-shape is what this will look like and

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.990 
u-shape is what this will look like and
there's<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.040> more<00:01:05.189> piece<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.460> you'll<00:01:05.760> have

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
there's one more piece that you'll have

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
there's one more piece that you'll have
that<00:01:06.299> will<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.140> stability<00:01:07.350> for

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that will actually be your stability for

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
that will actually be your stability for
the<00:01:08.189> step<00:01:08.430> stool<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.540> piece<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> going

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the step stool and this piece is going

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
the step stool and this piece is going
to<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.200> straight<00:01:10.650> down<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> middle

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to go straight down in the middle

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.450 
to go straight down in the middle
perpendicular<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.140> sides<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
perpendicular to the sides it's going to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.179 
perpendicular to the sides it's going to
create<00:01:14.880> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> T<00:01:15.420> shape<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.990> once<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.040> do

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
create kind of a T shape and once you do

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
create kind of a T shape and once you do
that<00:01:17.220> you've<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:18.119> your<00:01:18.270> sides<00:01:18.479> pressed<00:01:19.290> up

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
that you've got your sides pressed up

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
that you've got your sides pressed up
against<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.770> T<00:01:19.979> shape<00:01:20.280> press<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
against the T shape press down on the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.749 
against the T shape press down on the
base<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> glue<00:01:22.890> will<00:01:23.130> start<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> set

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
base so the glue will start to set

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.450 
base so the glue will start to set
you're<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.150> feel<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.659> it'll<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.020> strong

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.620 
you're going to feel it it'll get strong
when<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> build<00:01:26.850> these<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.210> home<00:01:27.360> sometimes

when I build these at home sometimes

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
when I build these at home sometimes
I'll<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:27.990> clamps<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> don't<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I'll use clamps but you don't have to

I'll use clamps but you don't have to
the<00:01:30.060> glue<00:01:30.299> should<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.869> strong<00:01:31.140> enough<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.409> hold

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
the glue should be strong enough to hold

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.710 
the glue should be strong enough to hold
you're<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:32.850> let<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.119> sit<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.570> about

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you're gonna let that sit for about

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200 
you're gonna let that sit for about
twenty<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.350> thirty<00:01:34.560> minutes<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.189> once<00:01:35.670> that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
twenty to thirty minutes and once that

twenty to thirty minutes and once that
glue<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.540> set<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.500> flip<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
glue is set up and you can flip the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.469 
glue is set up and you can flip the
thing<00:01:38.100> upside<00:01:38.490> down<00:01:38.700> you've<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.270> step

install<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.259> called<00:01:43.439> Miller<00:01:43.740> dowels

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
install what are called Miller dowels

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.429 
install what are called Miller dowels
Miller<00:01:45.149> dowels<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.899> different<00:01:46.140> than

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
Miller dowels are a bit different than

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.170 
Miller dowels are a bit different than
regular<00:01:46.619> dowels<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.700> something<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
regular dowels and it's something that I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.450 
regular dowels and it's something that I
had<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.810> search<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.380> find<00:01:49.680> they're

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
had to really search to find they're

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.700 
had to really search to find they're
specifically<00:01:51.060> designed<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.780> join<00:01:52.049> half-inch

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
specifically designed to join half-inch

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
specifically designed to join half-inch
plywood<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.240> perfect<00:01:54.840> strength

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
plywood so it's a perfect strength

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.800 
plywood so it's a perfect strength
joinery<00:01:56.130> piece<00:01:56.579> because<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.210> gives<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
joinery piece because it gives you that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.870 
joinery piece because it gives you that
stability<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.890> also<00:01:59.070> gives<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> really

nice look you also have a Miller dowel
drill<00:02:02.490> bit<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.090> once<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.600> put<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.840> into

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
drill bit and once you put that into

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.289 
drill bit and once you put that into
your<00:02:04.320> drill<00:02:04.740> you'll<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.640> able<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> create<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
your drill you'll be able to create the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.600 
your drill you'll be able to create the
same<00:02:06.540> shape<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.560> Miller<00:02:07.770> dowels<00:02:08.069> with

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
same shape as the Miller dowels with

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.830 
same shape as the Miller dowels with
this<00:02:08.849> particular<00:02:09.119> drill

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
this particular drill

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720 
this particular drill
so<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.649> you're<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:10.800> you're<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.580> look

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so then you're just you're going to look

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.370 
so then you're just you're going to look
at<00:02:11.880> your<00:02:12.000> step<00:02:12.209> stool<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.720> top<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.200> the

seat and you're going to create holes or

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.780 
seat and you're going to create holes or
drill<00:02:15.780> down<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:16.349> each<00:02:16.860> corner<00:02:17.250> all<00:02:17.550> four

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
drill down in each corner all four

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420 
drill down in each corner all four
corners<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.390> your<00:02:18.420> step<00:02:18.810> stool<00:02:19.250> once<00:02:20.250> you

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
corners of your step stool once you

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.000 
corners of your step stool once you
create<00:02:20.670> those<00:02:21.030> poles<00:02:21.660> for<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.319> Dow's<00:02:22.620> then

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
create those poles for the Dow's then

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.229 
create those poles for the Dow's then
you're<00:02:23.130> going<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.310> take<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.790> little<00:02:24.060> bit<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
you're going to take a little bit of

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.870 
you're going to take a little bit of
glue<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.810> maybe<00:02:25.050> two<00:02:25.380> two<00:02:26.160> drops<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.640> glue

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880

and put two drops in each one of those

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.280 
and put two drops in each one of those
holes<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:30.480> you're<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.900> take<00:02:31.140> your

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
holes then you're going to take your

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.570 
holes then you're going to take your
Miller<00:02:31.500> dowels<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.430> insert

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
Miller dowels and you're going to insert

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.000 
Miller dowels and you're going to insert
those<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.300> each<00:02:33.630> one<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.830> take<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
those in each one and then just take a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.660 
those in each one and then just take a
hammer

lightly<00:02:36.180> tap<00:02:36.420> them<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.080> they're<00:02:37.170> going<00:02:37.290> to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
lightly tap them in and they're going to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.440 
lightly tap them in and they're going to
go<00:02:37.500> flush<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.430> you'll<00:02:38.580> see<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.000> circular

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
go flush so you'll see the circular

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.420 
go flush so you'll see the circular
dowel<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.019> then<00:02:40.560> around<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.130> will<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:41.400> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
dowel and then around that will be a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.890 
dowel and then around that will be a
flush<00:02:41.819> suit<00:02:43.100> after<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.430> install<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> dowels

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
flush suit after you install the dowels

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.050 
flush suit after you install the dowels
you're<00:02:46.140> pretty<00:02:46.380> much<00:02:46.590> done<00:02:46.920> except<00:02:47.700> for<00:02:47.910> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
you're pretty much done except for you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.550 
you're pretty much done except for you
want<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.299> sand<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.780> make<00:02:48.959> sure<00:02:48.989> there's<00:02:49.290> no
