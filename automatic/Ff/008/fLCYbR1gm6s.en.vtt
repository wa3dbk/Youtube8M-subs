00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 Hello here Sophie and I show you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 Now how to make beautiful flowers on these 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 already made-up butterfly 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.210
 if you can insert first 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 I want to learn how to make the butterfly 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.880
 make-up please click on the link now 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.820
 which just seems to leave otherwise 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.430
 start us right with the flowers 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.220
 the butterfly with flowers is that of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.980
 Girls most sought after face painting 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.100
 motivates this at events 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.910
 again to paint the flowers need 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.370
 I, however, space between the wings 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.700
 Therefore, I remove first the body of the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.460
 butterfly with a damp cloth 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.830
 the petals to paint namely 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.340
 two different colors at the same time 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.070
 Brush on a cat's tongue first 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.500
 deeper already that I'm on that 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.440
 both sides of the brush much make-up 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.040
 Wear the consistency of the color 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.630
 be rather creamy and not too liquid 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.750
 right after that I take my second one 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.330
 color on a dark pink and the rest 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.510
 The surface of the paint only with the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.560
 tip of the brush in a back and forth 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.320
 trade vigo 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.869
 I continue to do this until the color 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.130
 both sides of the peak clearly 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.910
 is visible 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.460
 I am laying down the first flower place 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.250
 the brush completely flat on the skin and 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.000
 quickly lift the brush up again 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.360
 then I paint the other leaves in 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.940
 a circle until the flower is perfect 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.640
 Closed is with the same technology 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.820
 because I have two more petals 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.830
 along the butterfly wing and 1 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.330
 still above 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.729
 then on the other's face 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.729
 course, the same procedure 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.329
 suddenly at each corner then two 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.329
 more flowers leaves 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.239
 As you can see I could do all these 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.420
 flowers leaves with the paint paint the 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.760
 I had taken in order to completely 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.730
 to paint many leaves in a short time 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.450
 you just have to use the brush 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.450
 absorb a lot of color 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.050
 for the next step I use 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.050
 a round bensel of size 3 and the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.709
 color dark green I mean little 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:44.560
 leaf around the flowers and try 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.560
 to fill in the gaps 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.150
 with the same island namely now the 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.800
 color yellow 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.260
 and I add many equal points 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.860
 first in the middle of the big flower and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.950
 then in addition to the other flowers, the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.910
 color yellow is a good color around the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.800
 contrasting with purple 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.800
 I have just cleaned my bindl 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.080
 made and when he was still wet 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.160
 I brush the hair in green glitter 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.190
 immersed 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.830
 Unfortunately, the camera just wants the brush 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.200
 not a buzz 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.600
 I love glitter but like flowers 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.330
 I do not scatter blitzer everywhere 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.600
 when too much glitter will make the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.940
 I cover it with small details 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.069
 the glitter prefer only at certain 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.890
 put up 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:42.340
 In this case, I wear the green 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.670
 Glitter only on the green leaves 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.060
 I need my brush again and again 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.629
 in the glittering streaks and as long as the green 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.590
 color is still wet the glitter 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.590
 stick to it 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.750
 so I get a nice glowing 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.880
 effect 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.880
 the flowers are ready now and me 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.160
 Hope you liked it a lot 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.420
 thanks for looking and see you 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.420
 next time bye
