00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.170
 so planting grapes I will take 2 videos 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.429
 first video is about how to cook 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.300
 pit for planting 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.580
 and the second video is about how directly 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.580
 plant grapes in a hole 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.560
 why two videos because 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.870
 really need to share 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.469
 one video and the second because just 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:37.980
 so poke grapes in the ground I think 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.219
 wrong why because here's 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.379
 excavated pit as you see below one 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:54.329
 light clay layer above darker lina 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:58.109
 even higher is already fertile soil and so 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.649
 first video that is i shot i dug 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.380
 pit sizes and 80 80 by 80 and 8 depth 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.850
 width is 80 80 by 80 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.350
 why such a pit 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.900
 first if you want grapes of roses 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.670
 OK 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.260
 for this and need such a pit that is, we 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.260
 choose the entire length and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.620
 this whole me we will fall asleep 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.240
 directly prepared by soil 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.780
 how to prepare the ground now I will tell 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.660
 I'll take it as if you understand that if we 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.300
 just you to them grapes in the usual 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.920
 normal well 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.170
 drilled a shovel you hit our 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.690
 the roots will grow in a line that is 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.400
 upper layer 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.740
 30 centimeters is fertile soil 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.180
 then goes or that is your roots will be 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.280
 pressure naturally no vitamins 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.240
 they will not receive there this 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.020
 the roots of the vine so we dig here 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.020
 I didnâ€™t take a hole like that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.560
 I laid the fertile soil separately in 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.890
 the side 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.459
 top layer 30 centimeters alina i 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.230
 brought out of here, let me show you again 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.750
 pit depth 80 and see two layers of clay 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.380
 one layer and second layer and top 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.310
 fertile soil here's how to cook and 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.060
 the very soil that is i will take one to 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.360
 one that is i will pour out 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.610
 for example two buckets 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.640
 two buckets of earth here is the core of the earth this 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.300
 top layer of earth one bucket here second 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.470
 I poured out 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.890
 and sand two buckets ie two buckets 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:57.440
 the sand is your core of the earth that is one to 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.880
 one, and I will fill not fill 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.470
 eat and that way 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:07.760
 also in this ground specially 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:12.200
 cooked i will add fertilizer here 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.400
 fertilizer called nitroammofoska she 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 contains 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.340
 contains nitrogen 16 percent phosphorus 16 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.480
 percent and potassium 16 percent that is 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.850
 these are not substances that are really 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:34.600
 fertilizer vitamins that will be for 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:38.159
 for our soil, now that I am all 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:43.209
 mix and continue 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:47.500
 so the pit is ready here at a depth of 80 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.530
 80 centimeters wide and a soil mixture too 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.140
 ready 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.370
 we need to fill the pit 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.600
 to a depth of 30 centimeters right now I 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.680
 took the bottom 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:09.360
 measured 30 centimeters from below and shoved 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.980
 Here is such a wand for this I on it 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.750
 I will equal that is to fill a hole 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.820
 need to 30 centimeters again I repeat 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.470
 and soil mixture that she enters here 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.880
 part of the sand 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:30.750
 The same part of the earth can be a little more I 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.810
 by the way added another bucket of ashes 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:39.050
 and fertilizer 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.590
 fertilizer nitroammophoska 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:49.040
 it contains say again 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.040
 phosphorus potassium phosphorus potassium 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:00.650
 and I put it in nitrogen 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:05.000
 half a cup half a cup enough on our 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:08.340
 for planting grapes no longer but for 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.180
 now we take and ready mix soil 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.180
 falling asleep pit 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.790
 correct it on the channel completely again 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.449
 well sit down well spill 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.309
 two weeks we can 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.309
 plant our grape varieties 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:09.660
 as for the preparation of the pit 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:14.900
 our pits yakhimovich 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:18.460
 Actually she was already almost 1 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.460
 it will be possible to invent and put
