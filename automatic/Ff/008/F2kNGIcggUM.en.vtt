those shiny spots with some sandpaper

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.140 
those shiny spots with some sandpaper
and<00:01:41.600> start<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.800> process<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.820> getting<00:01:43.910> it

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
and start the process of getting it

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.530 
and start the process of getting it
ready<00:01:44.270> for<00:01:44.390> paint<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:46.340> shiny<00:01:46.580> spots<00:01:46.940> it's

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
ready for paint the shiny spots it's

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.969 
ready for paint the shiny spots it's
just<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.810> raised<00:01:48.020> resin<00:01:48.440> in<00:01:48.560> between<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
just the raised resin in between the

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.260 
just the raised resin in between the
weave<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.370> we<00:01:49.460> want<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.670> get<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:49.910> as<00:01:50.030> smooth

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
weave so we want to get that as smooth

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.270 
weave so we want to get that as smooth
as<00:01:50.420> possible<00:01:50.450> so<00:01:51.350> up<00:01:51.500> comes<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.860> sand<00:01:52.040> paper

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
as possible so up comes the sand paper

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
as possible so up comes the sand paper
you<00:01:52.460> can<00:01:52.580> start<00:01:52.820> with<00:01:52.940> something<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.270> bit

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
you can start with something a bit

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.140 
you can start with something a bit
coarser<00:01:53.810> 120<00:01:54.470> grit<00:01:54.680> 180<00:01:55.370> would<00:01:55.550> be<00:01:55.700> fine<00:01:55.910> just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
coarser 120 grit 180 would be fine just

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.020 
coarser 120 grit 180 would be fine just
be<00:01:56.960> careful<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.740> don't<00:01:57.860> go<00:01:58.100> through<00:01:58.370> the

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
be careful that you don't go through the

be careful that you don't go through the
fiberglass<00:01:59.479> cloth<00:01:59.870> itself<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.830> into<00:02:01.190> the

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
fiberglass cloth itself and into the

fiberglass cloth itself and into the
weave<00:02:01.550> if<00:02:02.120> you<00:02:02.390> do<00:02:02.540> you'll<00:02:02.750> know<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.080> you'll

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.120 
and then we'll be filling it with some
body<00:03:05.060> filler<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:06.380> before<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.770> put<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.980> body

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
body filler so before you put the body

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.560 
body filler so before you put the body
filler<00:03:07.370> on<00:03:07.580> make<00:03:07.730> sure<00:03:07.850> all<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.090> dust<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.420> off

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
filler on make sure all the dust is off

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.820 
filler on make sure all the dust is off
and<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:08.990> probably<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> good<00:03:09.350> idea<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.620> give

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
and it's probably a good idea to give

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.930 
and it's probably a good idea to give
everything<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.160> could<00:03:10.310> wipe<00:03:10.490> down<00:03:10.700> with<00:03:10.730> a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
everything you could wipe down with a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.720 
everything you could wipe down with a
paper<00:03:11.540> towel<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:11.870> some<00:03:12.380> alcohol<00:03:13.160> or<00:03:13.550> some

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
paper towel and some alcohol or some

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.790 
paper towel and some alcohol or some
other<00:03:13.880> type<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.120> thinner<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:15.320> notice<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.650> have

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
other type of thinner you notice I have

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.980 
other type of thinner you notice I have
quite<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.310> pile<00:03:16.520> of<00:03:16.670> dust<00:03:16.880> here<00:03:17.180> probably<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:17.930> a

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
quite a pile of dust here probably not a

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.870 
quite a pile of dust here probably not a
good<00:03:18.140> idea<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.500> breathe<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.860> in<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.310> if<00:03:19.790> you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
good idea to breathe that in so if you

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.950 
good idea to breathe that in so if you
want<00:03:20.060> to<00:03:20.120> wear<00:03:20.210> a<00:03:20.240> dust<00:03:20.420> mask<00:03:20.570> or<00:03:20.900> something

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
want to wear a dust mask or something

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.630 
want to wear a dust mask or something
while<00:03:21.380> you're<00:03:21.500> sanding<00:03:21.890> probably<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.460> good

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
while you're sanding probably a good

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.600 
while you're sanding probably a good
idea<00:03:23.650> like<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.740> said<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.010> took<00:03:25.160> about<00:03:25.220> 20

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
idea like I said this took about 20

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.850 
idea like I said this took about 20
minutes<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.910> get<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.240> this<00:03:26.360> stage<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.680> not

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
minutes to get to this stage this is not

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.560 
minutes to get to this stage this is not
a<00:03:27.890> short<00:03:28.220> process<00:03:28.640> by<00:03:28.790> any<00:03:28.820> means<00:03:29.240> it<00:03:29.420> takes

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
a short process by any means it takes

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.960 
a short process by any means it takes
quick<00:03:29.870> takes<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.350> couple<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.680> days<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.130> some

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
quick takes a couple of days and some

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.710 
quick takes a couple of days and some
time<00:03:32.210> to<00:03:32.390> get<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.540> good<00:03:32.690> finish<00:03:32.900> on<00:03:33.170> this<00:03:34.600> if<00:03:35.600> it

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
time to get a good finish on this if it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.510 
time to get a good finish on this if it
was<00:03:35.810> quick<00:03:36.080> RF<00:03:36.560> builders<00:03:36.920> would<00:03:37.160> do<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.430> right

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
was quick RF builders would do it right

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.610 
was quick RF builders would do it right
well<00:03:40.520> we<00:03:40.700> have<00:03:40.790> our<00:03:40.970> cowl<00:03:41.150> sanded<00:03:41.720> we<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.530> to

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
well we have our cowl sanded we have to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.610 
well we have our cowl sanded we have to
get<00:03:42.710> it<00:03:42.830> ready<00:03:42.950> for<00:03:43.040> paint<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.940> it<00:03:44.090> may<00:03:44.210> look

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
get it ready for paint and it may look

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.810 
get it ready for paint and it may look
like<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:45.830> were<00:03:45.950> good<00:03:46.100> enough<00:03:46.310> for<00:03:46.460> paint<00:03:46.670> but

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
like it's were good enough for paint but

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.040 
like it's were good enough for paint but
it's<00:03:46.940> not<00:03:47.120> if<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:47.420> look<00:03:47.540> close<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.750> can<00:03:47.930> see

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
it's not if you look close you can see

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.710 
it's not if you look close you can see
surface<00:03:48.530> irregularities<00:03:48.710> a<00:03:49.400> few<00:03:50.120> pinholes<00:03:50.540> in

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
surface irregularities a few pinholes in

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.090 
surface irregularities a few pinholes in
the<00:03:50.780> fiberglass<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:51.620> have<00:03:51.710> to<00:03:51.800> get<00:03:51.920> rid<00:03:52.040> of

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
the fiberglass so we have to get rid of

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.420 
the fiberglass so we have to get rid of
those<00:03:52.240> what<00:03:53.240> I<00:03:53.270> like<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.600> use<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:54.190> plays<00:03:55.190> and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
those what I like to use is plays and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.720 
those what I like to use is plays and
Spock<00:03:55.610> putty<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.270> bondo<00:03:56.660> brand<00:03:56.930> that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
Spock putty this is bondo brand that

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.490 
Spock putty this is bondo brand that
solvent<00:03:58.730> base<00:03:58.910> so<00:03:59.300> it<00:03:59.840> is<00:03:59.960> extremely

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
solvent base so it is extremely

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.580 
solvent base so it is extremely
flammable<00:04:00.710> and<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.430> does<00:04:01.610> stink<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.410> just<00:04:03.410> keep

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
flammable and it does stink so just keep

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.680 
flammable and it does stink so just keep
that<00:04:03.620> in<00:04:03.830> mind<00:04:03.980> when<00:04:04.160> you're<00:04:04.280> doing<00:04:04.370> it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.570 

so<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.810> way<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:08.930> do<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.260> it's<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.430> like

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
so the way I do it it's just like

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.979 
so the way I do it it's just like
putting<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:10.940> white<00:04:11.150> stuff<00:04:11.420> on<00:04:11.629> to<00:04:11.780> start

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
putting that white stuff on to start

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.039 
putting that white stuff on to start
with<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.319> put<00:04:12.440> on<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.590> blob<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:14.180> usually<00:04:14.900> use<00:04:15.019> a

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
with and put on a blob I usually use a

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.569 
with and put on a blob I usually use a
bit<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.349> spreader<00:04:15.650> because<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.280> stuff<00:04:16.489> is

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
bit of a spreader because this stuff is

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.840 
bit of a spreader because this stuff is
kind<00:04:16.790> of<00:04:16.880> bit<00:04:17.630> nastier<00:04:18.109> than<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.380> water-based

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
kind of bit nastier than the water-based

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:29.110 
kind of bit nastier than the water-based
and<00:04:19.850> they<00:04:20.660> just<00:04:20.870> butter<00:04:21.139> it<00:04:21.320> on<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.760> as<00:04:29.060> you

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
and they just butter it on and as you

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.939 
and they just butter it on and as you
push<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.990> right<00:04:30.139> into<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.530> weave<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.710> the

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
push it right into the weave of the

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.830 
push it right into the weave of the
glass<00:04:31.190> or<00:04:31.699> any<00:04:31.850> imperfections<00:04:32.540> there<00:04:32.690> are

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
glass or any imperfections there are

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.530 
glass or any imperfections there are
you'll<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.800> able<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:34.070> see<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:35.060> holes<00:04:35.300> that

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
you'll be able to see the holes that

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.290 
you'll be able to see the holes that
starts<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.020> fill<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:37.400> will<00:04:37.580> mostly<00:04:37.940> be<00:04:38.030> all

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
starts to fill this will mostly be all

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.060 
starts to fill this will mostly be all
sanded<00:04:38.690> off<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.410> don't<00:04:39.500> worry<00:04:39.650> about<00:04:39.770> wait

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
sanded off so don't worry about wait

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.980 
sanded off so don't worry about wait
it'll<00:04:40.820> be<00:04:40.970> quite<00:04:41.180> light<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.539> go<00:04:44.660> over<00:04:44.780> the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
it'll be quite light and you go over the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.140 
it'll be quite light and you go over the
hole<00:04:45.169> count<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:47.510> all<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.870> surfaces<00:04:49.150> and

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
hole count and all the surfaces and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.340 
hole count and all the surfaces and
again<00:04:50.389> you<00:04:50.510> don't<00:04:50.600> have<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.840> worry<00:04:50.990> about<00:04:51.050> me

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
again you don't have to worry about me

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.840 
again you don't have to worry about me
this<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:53.090> get<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.389> in<00:04:53.510> there<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.610> he's<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.639> bit

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
this just get it in there and he's a bit

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.110 
this just get it in there and he's a bit
of<00:04:55.940> pressure<00:04:56.180> with<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.510> spatula<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.850> butter
