00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
phone and so when I took the CST test I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
phone and so when I took the CST test I
was<00:01:14.909> nervous<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.810> didn't<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.680> how<00:01:16.829> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890

was nervous and I didn't know how to
deal<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.579> but<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.270> since<00:01:18.329> this<00:01:18.930> year

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369
