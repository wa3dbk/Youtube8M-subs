blue<00:00:54.719> tude<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.850> something

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
blue tude and here we have something

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.750 
blue tude and here we have something
very<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.480> cool<00:00:57.780> already<00:00:58.109> laid<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.010> just

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
very very cool already laid in and just

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
very very cool already laid in and just
a<00:00:59.879> matter<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.120> seconds<00:01:00.570> very<00:01:00.780> expressionist

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a matter of seconds very expressionist

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.130 
a matter of seconds very expressionist
so<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.980> addition<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> pressure<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.570> pressure

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so in addition to pressure the pressure

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.260 
so in addition to pressure the pressure
is<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> controllable<00:01:05.250> parameter<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.210> as

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
is a controllable parameter in here as

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
is a controllable parameter in here as
well<00:01:06.360> pressure<00:01:06.659> shapes<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.100> can

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
well pressure shapes you can see you can

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.960 
well pressure shapes you can see you can
use<00:01:09.170> akin<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> breath<00:01:10.710> controller<00:01:11.250> perhaps

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
use akin to a breath controller perhaps

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000 
use akin to a breath controller perhaps
I'm<00:01:12.270> always<00:01:12.450> intrigued<00:01:13.020> by<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.200> synthase

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I'm always intrigued by this synthase

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.630 
I'm always intrigued by this synthase
Jie<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.049> aspects<00:01:16.189> correlating<00:01:17.189> between<00:01:17.490> our

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
Jie and aspects correlating between our

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.910 
Jie and aspects correlating between our
senses<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:19.020> also<00:01:19.170> select<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
senses so you can also select this as a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.609 
senses so you can also select this as a
mic<00:01:20.100> shape<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.600> different<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> bit

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
mic shape this is different so a bit

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
mic shape this is different so a bit
more<00:01:22.650> drastic<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.210> let's<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.600> ahead

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
more drastic there and let's go ahead

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.010 
more drastic there and let's go ahead
and<00:01:25.020> choose<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> healthy<00:01:25.830> pink<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> color

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
and choose a healthy pink as a color

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.530 
and choose a healthy pink as a color
healthy<00:01:28.020> pink<00:01:28.670> varied<00:01:29.670> line<00:01:29.909> weight<00:01:30.150> make<00:01:30.420> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
healthy pink varied line weight make it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
healthy pink varied line weight make it
a<00:01:30.570> fatter<00:01:30.930> or<00:01:31.259> thinner<00:01:31.700> thin<00:01:32.700> e

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
a fatter or thinner thin e

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.990 
a fatter or thinner thin e
ORS<00:01:33.509> its<00:01:34.409> Hollow

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
ORS its Hollow

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.020 
ORS its Hollow
it<00:01:36.210> looks<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> an<00:01:37.740> intestine<00:01:38.670> that's

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it looks like a an intestine that's

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.020 
it looks like a an intestine that's
going<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.630> down<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:39.869> down<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.220> past

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
going down down down down like that past

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.899 
going down down down down like that past
where<00:01:42.299> my<00:01:42.420> head<00:01:42.570> could<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.399> we'll<00:01:44.610> go

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
where my head could be and then we'll go

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
where my head could be and then we'll go
to<00:01:44.939> green<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.869> all<00:01:45.990> know<00:01:46.140> green<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
to green because we all know green is a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.120 
to green because we all know green is a
fundamental<00:01:47.399> complement<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.119> pink

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
fundamental complement to pink

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.530 
fundamental complement to pink
fundamental<00:01:50.130> complement<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.090> let's<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.390> into

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
fundamental complement now let's go into

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.179 
fundamental complement now let's go into
some<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.840> other<00:01:51.869> shapes<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.979> will

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
some of the other shapes so I will

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
some of the other shapes so I will
choose<00:01:53.520> some<00:01:53.700> other<00:01:53.729> colors<00:01:54.270> too<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> file

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
choose some other colors too and to file

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.740 
choose some other colors too and to file

this and now it's not my voice although

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.529 
this and now it's not my voice although
this<00:02:04.649> would<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.860> cool<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.070> voice<00:02:05.310> too

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
this would be cool with voice too

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.290 
this would be cool with voice too
when<00:02:07.289> you<00:02:07.710> are<00:02:07.979> done<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:09.090> ahead<00:02:09.179> and

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
like I think it would let's write pool

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.979 
like I think it would let's write pool
ships<00:03:04.940> pool<00:03:06.170> pool<00:03:07.220> dinosaur<00:03:08.220> pool<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.840> not

got<00:03:24.000> we<00:03:24.239> got<00:03:24.389> well<00:03:24.889> got<00:03:25.889> purple<00:03:26.190> issues<00:03:26.489> there

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
got we got well got purple issues there

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.470 
got we got well got purple issues there
some<00:03:27.900> stuff<00:03:28.440> came<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.680> after<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.489> they<00:03:30.120> just

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
some stuff came up after and they just

some stuff came up after and they just
go<00:03:30.810> ahead<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.200> save<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.950> clear<00:03:32.790> it

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
go ahead and save that and clear it

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.490 
go ahead and save that and clear it
again<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.600> can<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.019> all<00:03:34.230> these<00:03:34.350> things
