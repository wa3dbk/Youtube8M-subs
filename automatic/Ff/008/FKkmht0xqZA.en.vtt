tuners<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.240> these<00:01:56.509> things<00:01:56.659> are<00:01:56.840> awesome<00:01:57.159> 18

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159

to<00:01:58.280> 1<00:01:58.429> gear<00:01:58.640> ratio<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.770> lock<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.130> string<00:02:01.429> down

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
to 1 gear ratio you lock the string down

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.100 
to 1 gear ratio you lock the string down
it<00:02:01.909> locks<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.179> string<00:02:02.479> in<00:02:02.569> place<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:03.020> then
