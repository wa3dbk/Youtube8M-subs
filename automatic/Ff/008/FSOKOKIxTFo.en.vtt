00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.119
 the new bobic tags from murat dir 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.700
 imagine 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.610
 the stacks are like all basins of 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.730
 material from a b20 government and 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.099
 hammered completely hand I have you 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.589
 today two variants brought once 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.989
 110 ass.tec consisting of one tens 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:39.379
 bottom and a tens top and one 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.379
 mixture of one 12 14 that is on 14 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.329
 expectation and a twelve top that 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.970
 interesting at the orbit stacks is in 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.949
 the top end we have here 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.080
 China which again the edge again 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.760
 bent down that's natural 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.920
 Sound interesting 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.750
 history and also for the material very 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.470
 already speaks the sticks sat down 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.470
 not so fast 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.610
 The stacks can be petty 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.380
 arrange between splash minidresses 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.270
 and maybe another trash red 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.740
 the whole comes from very 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 assertive therefore and offers itself 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.250
 so of course , give an interesting greeting 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.130
 maybe also in the jungle 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.130
 range and also for succinct bring
