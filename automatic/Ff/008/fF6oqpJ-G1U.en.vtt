have some health guides that are on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.889 
have some health guides that are on
there<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.030> use<00:00:48.210> those<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> follow

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
there and you can use those as a follow

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.549 
there and you can use those as a follow
along<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.379> you'd<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:51.109> fuel<00:00:52.109> gauge<00:00:52.289> works

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
along if you'd like to fuel gauge works

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
along if you'd like to fuel gauge works
on<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.769> basic<00:00:53.160> principle<00:00:53.609> it<00:00:53.820> has<00:00:54.000> power<00:00:54.269> ground

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
on a basic principle it has power ground

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.189 
on a basic principle it has power ground
and<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:56.129> input<00:00:56.789> signal<00:00:57.359> from<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> sending<00:00:57.929> unit

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and a input signal from the sending unit

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.959 
and a input signal from the sending unit
to<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> ohms<00:00:58.530> input<00:00:58.949> signal<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.519> vary<00:00:59.730> from

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to the ohms input signal will vary from

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
to the ohms input signal will vary from
0<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.809> empty<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.829> 90<00:01:02.160> ohms<00:01:02.370> full<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.410> linear

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
0 on empty to 90 ohms full it's a linear

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.940 
0 on empty to 90 ohms full it's a linear
scale<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.550> 1/2<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.090> tank<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.500> 45

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
scale so 1/2 the tank is going to be 45

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.400 
scale so 1/2 the tank is going to be 45
ohms<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.480> look<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.870> gauge<00:01:10.110> we're

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
ohms so if you look at this gauge we're

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.810 
ohms so if you look at this gauge we're
sitting<00:01:10.770> there<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> said<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
sitting there right now and it said a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.950 
sitting there right now and it said a
half<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.150> tank<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.140> take<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.950> zero

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
half a tank we can take it down to zero

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
half a tank we can take it down to zero
which<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> empty<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.710> take<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.190> over<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
which is empty we can take it over to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.820 
which is empty we can take it over to
full<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:18.030> we're<00:01:18.750> using<00:01:19.020> what's<00:01:19.350> called<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
full and we're using what's called a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
full and we're using what's called a
linear<00:01:20.190> potentiometer<00:01:21.140> but<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.230> can<00:01:22.380> order

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
linear potentiometer but you can order

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
linear potentiometer but you can order
them<00:01:22.740> online<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:23.460> they're<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.750> fairly

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
them online and they're actually fairly

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.580 
them online and they're actually fairly
cheap<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.580> want<00:01:26.730> to<00:01:26.820> test<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.590> an

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
cheap if you want to test with one an

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
cheap if you want to test with one an
old-school<00:01:28.980> way<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.280> testing<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:29.910> be<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
old-school way of testing would be to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.290 
old-school way of testing would be to
use<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.360> flasher<00:01:30.960> instead<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.590> potentiometer

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
use a flasher instead of a potentiometer

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.850 
use a flasher instead of a potentiometer
flasher<00:01:33.300> usually<00:01:33.600> generates<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.260> 50<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> 55

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
flasher usually generates about 50 to 55

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
flasher usually generates about 50 to 55
ohms<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.640> resistance<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.380> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
ohms of resistance and you can use that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.800 
ohms of resistance and you can use that
for<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:37.770> sending<00:01:38.130> wire<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.850> need<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.240> but

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
for your sending wire if you need be but

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.510 
for your sending wire if you need be but
basically<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.470> we're<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.040> run

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
basically what we're going to do is run

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.180 
basically what we're going to do is run
it<00:01:41.610> through<00:01:41.730> some<00:01:41.790> tests<00:01:42.650> let's<00:01:43.650> say<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.010> ohms

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
it through some tests let's say the ohms

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.310 
it through some tests let's say the ohms
wire<00:01:44.490> falls<00:01:44.820> off<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.300> gas<00:01:45.480> tank<00:01:45.510> sending<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
wire falls off your gas tank sending in

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.550 
wire falls off your gas tank sending in
it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620 
it
if<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.130> ohms<00:01:47.280> wire<00:01:47.520> falls<00:01:47.850> off<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.330> sending

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
if the ohms wire falls off your sending

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.900 
if the ohms wire falls off your sending
unit<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.080> it's<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.350> touching<00:01:49.620> anything<00:01:50.010> your

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
unit and it's not touching anything your

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.120 
unit and it's not touching anything your
gas<00:01:51.150> gauge<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.660> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.900> go<00:01:52.080> basically<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
gas gauge is going to go basically to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.760 
gas gauge is going to go basically to
just<00:01:53.490> above<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> top<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.510> rivet<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
just above the top of the rivet if you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.320 
just above the top of the rivet if you
see<00:01:55.980> this<00:01:56.160> on<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.550> fuel<00:01:56.820> gauge<00:01:56.850> when<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
see this on your fuel gauge when you

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.450 
see this on your fuel gauge when you
turn<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:57.720> key<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.110> that's<00:01:59.070> what<00:01:59.340> your

help and repair file will give you a

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.410 
help and repair file will give you a
little<00:02:13.140> bit<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.769> advice<00:02:14.519> as<00:02:14.760> far<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:14.970> technique

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
little bit of advice as far as technique

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.619 
little bit of advice as far as technique
on<00:02:15.599> finding<00:02:15.959> out<00:02:16.080> where<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> problem<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.629> the

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
on finding out where the problem is the

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.600 
on finding out where the problem is the
next<00:02:18.840> test<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.739> confirm<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
next test is going to confirm that the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.540 
next test is going to confirm that the
wire<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.849> good<00:02:21.450> between<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.310> tank<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
wire is good between the tank and the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.760 
wire is good between the tank and the
sending<00:02:23.880> unit<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.410> basically<00:02:25.410> what<00:02:25.680> you're

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
sending unit and basically what you're

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.560 
sending unit and basically what you're
going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.010> do<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.460> you've<00:02:26.670> been<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.880> ground<00:02:27.330> out

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
going to do is you've been a ground out

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to do is you've been a ground out
that<00:02:27.840> wire

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
that wire

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.230 
that wire
so<00:02:28.740> if<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.070> pull<00:02:29.280> your<00:02:29.310> ohms<00:02:29.580> wire<00:02:29.850> off<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
so if you pull your ohms wire off the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.210 
so if you pull your ohms wire off the
sinning<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.440> grant<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.800> after<00:02:32.100> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
sinning in it and you grant it after the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.920 
sinning in it and you grant it after the
frame<00:02:32.520> you're<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> reading

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
frame you're going to get a reading

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.580 
frame you're going to get a reading
that's<00:02:34.020> going<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.320> look<00:02:34.470> something<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:34.890> this

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
that's going to look something like this

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.910 
that's going to look something like this
and<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:38.520> goes<00:02:38.700> all<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.030> way<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.270> e<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.470> that's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and it goes all the way to e so that's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.570 
and it goes all the way to e so that's
if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.460> ground<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.180> sending<00:02:42.510> unit<00:02:42.570> wire

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
if you ground out the sending unit wire

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.850 
if you ground out the sending unit wire
now<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:45.150> will<00:02:45.390> tell<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.930> if<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.650> get<00:02:46.830> a

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
now that will tell you that if you get a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.350 
now that will tell you that if you get a
gauge<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.310> responds<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:48.150> that's

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
gauge that responds like this that's

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.760 
gauge that responds like this that's
going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.600> tell<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.020> -<00:02:49.200> units<00:02:49.560> working

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
going to tell you the - units working

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.650 
going to tell you the - units working
fine<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.760> won't<00:02:50.970> tell<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.270> if<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.450> working

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
fine it won't tell you if it's working

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.780 
fine it won't tell you if it's working
accurately<00:02:52.020> or<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.310> will<00:02:53.460> tell<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
accurately or not but it will tell you

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.870 
accurately or not but it will tell you
that<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> -<00:02:54.750> unit<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.230> working<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.610> in

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
that the - unit is working and in

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.390 
that the - unit is working and in
working<00:02:57.300> order<00:02:57.480> you'll<00:02:58.380> notice<00:02:58.710> how<00:02:58.860> slow<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
working order you'll notice how slow the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.760 
working order you'll notice how slow the
gauge<00:02:59.580> responds<00:03:00.270> -<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:01.020> doesn't<00:03:01.260> just<00:03:01.530> zip

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
gauge responds - it doesn't just zip

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.670 
gauge responds - it doesn't just zip
over<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:03.180> fuel<00:03:03.420> gauge<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.170> water

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
over the fuel gauge the water

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.230 
over the fuel gauge the water
temperature<00:03:05.070> gauges<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.700> oil<00:03:05.910> pressure

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
temperature gauges and the oil pressure

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.110 
temperature gauges and the oil pressure
gauges<00:03:06.780> pretty<00:03:07.320> much<00:03:07.440> any<00:03:07.680> gauge<00:03:08.120> that's

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
gauges pretty much any gauge that's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.840 
gauges pretty much any gauge that's
available<00:03:09.360> or<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:09.960> that's<00:03:10.640> been<00:03:11.640> produced

available or that that's been produced
is<00:03:12.380> is<00:03:13.380> basically<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:14.750> plastic<00:03:15.750> retainer

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
is is basically a plastic retainer

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.930 
is is basically a plastic retainer
housing<00:03:16.680> that's<00:03:16.860> filled<00:03:17.100> full<00:03:17.340> resistance

housing that's filled full resistance
oil<00:03:18.320> some<00:03:19.320> gauges<00:03:19.500> used<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:20.040> lighter<00:03:20.250> oil<00:03:20.580> than

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
oil some gauges used a lighter oil than

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.080 
oil some gauges used a lighter oil than
others<00:03:21.710> when<00:03:22.710> this<00:03:22.860> all<00:03:23.040> dissipates<00:03:23.640> with<00:03:23.970> the

others when this all dissipates with the
fuel<00:03:24.330> gauge<00:03:24.540> what<00:03:25.470> you'll<00:03:25.620> get<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.100> sway<00:03:27.140> in

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
fuel gauge what you'll get is a sway in

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.460

the gauge or over reactive fuel gauge if

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.590 
the gauge or over reactive fuel gauge if
you<00:03:32.160> look<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.640> piece<00:03:32.910> right<00:03:33.120> here<00:03:33.180> that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
you look at this piece right here that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.720 
you look at this piece right here that
I'm<00:03:33.690> sitting<00:03:34.050> down<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.500> think<00:03:34.770> we<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:35.100> we

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
I'm sitting down and I think we can we

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.850 
I'm sitting down and I think we can we
can<00:03:35.910> get<00:03:36.060> on<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.360> that's<00:03:37.230> basically<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
can get on that that's basically the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.910 
can get on that that's basically the
internals<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.550> gauge<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.380> I've<00:03:40.380> posted<00:03:40.830> a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
internals of a gauge and I've posted a

the gauge just flops and sways all over
the<00:04:09.660> place<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.560> we've<00:04:10.709> done<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.070> no<00:04:12.060> ohms

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330

unfortunately if the gauge is missing
the<00:04:25.200> ground<00:04:25.440> it's<00:04:25.590> going<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.800> give<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.070> the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
exact same response and this is what it

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.750 
exact same response and this is what it
gives<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:29.070> is<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.310> exact<00:04:29.610> same

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
gives you this is the exact same

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
response you get if your ohms wire is

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.710 
response you get if your ohms wire is
grounded<00:04:32.430> out<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.760> back<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:33.600> going

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
grounded out in the back so it's going

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.909 
grounded out in the back so it's going
to<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.870> kind<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.169> tough<00:04:34.230> you're<00:04:34.590> going<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.770> have

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
to be kind of tough you're going to have

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.290 
to be kind of tough you're going to have
to<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.700> see<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:38.370> other<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.880> other<00:04:39.000> test

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
to to see the other if the other test

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.360 
to to see the other if the other test
works<00:04:39.600> if<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.289> other<00:04:40.410> test<00:04:40.710> works<00:04:40.979> then<00:04:41.250> your

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
works if the other test works then your

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.180 
works if the other test works then your
gauge<00:04:41.550> does<00:04:41.880> have

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
gauge does have

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.430 
gauge does have
ground<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.480> that<00:04:43.660> would<00:04:43.780> be<00:04:43.930> if<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.260> gauge

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
ground and that would be if the gauge

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.200 
ground and that would be if the gauge
goes<00:04:44.770> from<00:04:45.010> empty<00:04:45.220> to<00:04:45.340> full<00:04:45.370> when<00:04:45.730> you<00:04:45.820> spin

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
goes from empty to full when you spin

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.470 
goes from empty to full when you spin
you<00:04:46.330> ground<00:04:46.690> or<00:04:46.990> or<00:04:47.560> unhook<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.460> ohms<00:04:48.640> wire<00:04:48.940> so

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
you ground or or unhook the ohms wire so

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.080 
you ground or or unhook the ohms wire so
you<00:04:49.540> can<00:04:49.810> eliminate<00:04:50.220> no<00:04:51.220> ground<00:04:51.520> gauge<00:04:51.820> by

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
you can eliminate no ground gauge by

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.430 
you can eliminate no ground gauge by
performing<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.660> other<00:04:52.810> test<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:55.440> obviously

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
performing the other test the obviously

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.140 
performing the other test the obviously
if<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.740> gauge<00:04:56.950> doesn't<00:04:57.190> have<00:04:57.490> power<00:04:57.730> it's<00:04:58.060> not

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
if the gauge doesn't have power it's not

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.600 
if the gauge doesn't have power it's not
going<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.510> read<00:04:58.660> anything<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.320> you<00:05:00.220> can<00:05:00.430> see

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
going to read anything and you can see

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.190 
going to read anything and you can see
here<00:05:00.820> there's<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:01.180> gauge<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.750> move<00:05:02.050> it

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
here there's a gauge you can move it

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.230 
here there's a gauge you can move it
wherever<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.590> want<00:05:02.620> to<00:05:03.010> it<00:05:03.730> doesn't<00:05:04.090> matter

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
wherever you want to it doesn't matter

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.480 
wherever you want to it doesn't matter

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
going to jump right back to where it's

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.130 
going to jump right back to where it's

tips<00:05:11.410> are<00:05:11.590> gauge<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:11.890> a<00:05:11.920> little<00:05:12.100> bit<00:05:12.190> different

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
tips are gauge is a little bit different

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.250 
tips are gauge is a little bit different
temperature<00:05:12.910> gauge<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.330> faster<00:05:13.720> responding

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.800 
gauge that you can see it jumped right
back<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.910> there's<00:05:18.910> only<00:05:19.030> one<00:05:19.240> more<00:05:19.360> test<00:05:19.600> that

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
back so there's only one more test that

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.450 
back so there's only one more test that
we<00:05:19.900> can<00:05:20.050> do<00:05:20.200> on<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.350> fuel<00:05:20.620> gauge<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:21.130> basically

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
we can do on a fuel gauge and basically

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.870 
we can do on a fuel gauge and basically
that's<00:05:21.700> what<00:05:22.000> if<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:23.550> resistor<00:05:24.550> on<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.730> back

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
that's what if the resistor on the back

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.420 
that's what if the resistor on the back
of<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.120> gauge<00:05:25.300> is<00:05:25.510> grounded<00:05:25.930> at<00:05:26.130> I'm<00:05:27.130> gonna

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
of the gauge is grounded at I'm gonna

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.490 
of the gauge is grounded at I'm gonna
pause<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.360> video<00:05:28.630> here<00:05:28.960> I'm<00:05:29.140> going<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.320> take

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
pause the video here I'm going to take

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.380 
pause the video here I'm going to take
the<00:05:29.650> resistor<00:05:30.100> out<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.460> then<00:05:30.550> resume<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:31.030> so

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
the resistor out and then resume it so

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.090 
the resistor out and then resume it so
what<00:05:31.750> we've<00:05:31.870> done<00:05:32.050> now<00:05:32.110> is<00:05:32.320> we've<00:05:32.470> removed<00:05:32.920> the

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
what we've done now is we've removed the

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.090 
what we've done now is we've removed the

resistor off the back of the gauge as
can<00:05:36.970> we<00:05:37.090> see<00:05:37.240> this<00:05:37.360> resistance<00:05:37.930> this<00:05:38.740> is<00:05:38.950> the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
can we see this resistance this is the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.060 
can we see this resistance this is the
resistor<00:05:39.610> it's<00:05:40.450> a<00:05:40.570> 90<00:05:40.840> ohm<00:05:40.990> resistor<00:05:41.530> when

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
resistor it's a 90 ohm resistor when

there be kind of a pain to sock in the
back<00:05:59.520> though<00:06:00.520> in<00:06:00.820> the<00:06:02.040> in<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:03.310> past<00:06:03.550> we<00:06:03.760> have

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
back though in the in the past we have

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.330 
back though in the in the past we have
had<00:06:03.970> to<00:06:04.419> I<00:06:04.750> just<00:06:05.320> put<00:06:05.650> regular<00:06:05.950> resistors

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
had to I just put regular resistors

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.680 
had to I just put regular resistors
across<00:06:06.640> the<00:06:06.820> back<00:06:06.970> and<00:06:07.000> we<00:06:07.240> put<00:06:07.450> the<00:06:07.570> little

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
across the back and we put the little

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.270 
across the back and we put the little
eyelet<00:06:08.140> loop<00:06:08.320> terminals<00:06:08.800> on<00:06:08.890> there<00:06:09.010> so<00:06:09.160> they

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
eyelet loop terminals on there so they

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.900 
eyelet loop terminals on there so they
can<00:06:09.340> bolt<00:06:09.640> right<00:06:09.790> in<00:06:09.940> place<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:12.220> resistor<00:06:12.550> is

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
can bolt right in place this resistor is

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.300 
can bolt right in place this resistor is
not<00:06:13.060> available<00:06:13.600> so<00:06:13.660> you<00:06:14.470> know<00:06:14.560> you<00:06:14.650> either<00:06:15.010> got

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
not available so you know you either got

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.080 
not available so you know you either got
to<00:06:15.340> replace<00:06:15.669> it<00:06:15.730> or<00:06:16.120> repair<00:06:16.510> it<00:06:17.640> now<00:06:18.640> we've<00:06:18.910> got

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
to replace it or repair it now we've got

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.360 
to replace it or repair it now we've got
the<00:06:19.240> gauge<00:06:19.419> here<00:06:19.690> and<00:06:20.500> now<00:06:20.620> we've<00:06:20.830> removed<00:06:21.010> the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
the gauge here and now we've removed the

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.100 
the gauge here and now we've removed the
resistor<00:06:22.030> basically<00:06:22.450> so<00:06:22.690> we<00:06:22.780> could<00:06:22.930> show<00:06:23.080> you

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
resistor basically so we could show you

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.670 
resistor basically so we could show you
what<00:06:23.260> it<00:06:23.380> does<00:06:23.410> when<00:06:23.710> it's<00:06:23.830> blown<00:06:25.350> it's<00:06:26.350> kind

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
what it does when it's blown it's kind

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.020 
what it does when it's blown it's kind
