00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.960 
did a video on this not too long ago and
a<00:00:30.769> lot<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.039> have<00:00:31.189> these<00:00:31.339> little<00:00:31.429> cameras

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
and i think it sucks about these little

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.479 
and i think it sucks about these little
cameras<00:00:34.430> is<00:00:34.720> there<00:00:35.720> are<00:00:35.930> no<00:00:36.230> lens<00:00:36.920> adapters<00:00:37.460> or

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
cameras is there are no lens adapters or

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.350

anything for them until now so i found

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.770 
anything for them until now so i found
something<00:00:41.629> that<00:00:41.900> was<00:00:41.989> really<00:00:42.229> cool<00:00:42.409> and<00:00:43.780> even

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
something that was really cool and even

twelve dollars that i had to wait
forever<00:01:36.409> her<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.249> get<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:37.520> me<00:01:37.549> you<00:01:38.359> can<00:01:38.509> pay<00:01:38.689> a

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
little bit more and probably get it

overnight but uh yeah figure out wait

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.319 
overnight but uh yeah figure out wait
but<00:01:45.499> i<00:01:45.829> was<00:01:46.219> really<00:01:46.369> skeptical<00:01:46.789> about<00:01:47.119> this

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
but i was really skeptical about this

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.590 
but i was really skeptical about this
because<00:01:47.569> it<00:01:48.049> is<00:01:48.079> you<00:01:48.920> know<00:01:49.240> held<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:50.389> by<00:01:50.539> an

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
because it is you know held on by an

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.690 
because it is you know held on by an
adhesive<00:01:51.079> but<00:01:51.859> it<00:01:52.009> actually<00:01:52.219> works<00:01:52.579> really

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
adhesive but it actually works really

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.609 
adhesive but it actually works really
good<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:53.420> i<00:01:53.450> thought<00:01:53.630> i<00:01:53.689> would<00:01:53.780> share<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.380> it's

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
good so i thought i would share it it's

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.330 
good so i thought i would share it it's
actually<00:01:55.039> really<00:01:55.639> cool<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:57.889> the<00:01:58.069> lens

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
actually really cool this is the lens

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.260 
actually really cool this is the lens
right<00:01:58.609> here's<00:01:58.999> this<00:01:59.179> little<00:01:59.299> tiny<00:01:59.810> rule<00:02:00.109> a

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
right here's this little tiny rule a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.379 
right here's this little tiny rule a
little<00:02:02.270> tiny<00:02:02.450> little<00:02:02.689> thing<00:02:04.060> pretty<00:02:05.060> much<00:02:05.209> you

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
little tiny little thing pretty much you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:08.080 
little tiny little thing pretty much you
just<00:02:05.829> take<00:02:06.829> it<00:02:06.950> all<00:02:07.069> there

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
just take it all there

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.749 
just take it all there
it's<00:02:08.989> got<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.440> pretty<00:02:09.679> good<00:02:09.830> magnet<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.640> it

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
it's got a pretty good magnet so it

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.089 
it's got a pretty good magnet so it
stays<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.239> very<00:02:11.510> well<00:02:11.599> you<00:02:12.080> can<00:02:12.260> shake<00:02:13.069> it

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
stays on very well you can shake it

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.670 
stays on very well you can shake it
around<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.640> not<00:02:13.819> going<00:02:14.090> anywhere<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:15.590> know

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
around it's not going anywhere you know

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.550 
around it's not going anywhere you know
recommend<00:02:16.459> dropping<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:21.379> actually

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
recommend dropping it but it actually

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.729 
recommend dropping it but it actually
does<00:02:21.860> really<00:02:22.220> well<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.879> video<00:02:23.470> with<00:02:24.470> this

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
does really well and the video with this

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.550 
does really well and the video with this
is<00:02:25.069> pretty<00:02:25.430> amazing<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.239> it's<00:02:27.080> well<00:02:27.349> worth<00:02:27.530> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
is pretty amazing so it's well worth the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.580 
is pretty amazing so it's well worth the
