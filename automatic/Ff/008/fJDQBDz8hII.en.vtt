00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
Pistons on the inside to make it more

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.010 
Pistons on the inside to make it more
seamless<00:00:16.920> looking<00:00:17.520> like<00:00:17.820> nothing's<00:00:18.359> there

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
seamless looking like nothing's there

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.950 
seamless looking like nothing's there
realistically<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.390> pretty<00:00:21.630> sake

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
realistically it's just for pretty sake

realistically it's just for pretty sake
that's<00:00:22.260> about<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.830> candy<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> map<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.320> flat

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that's about it I candy the map is flat

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.050 
that's about it I candy the map is flat

thanks for this mod love it hope it gets
into<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.840> actual<00:00:37.110> game<00:00:37.380> eventually<00:00:39.920> also<00:00:41.030> I'm

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
into the actual game eventually also I'm

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.520 
into the actual game eventually also I'm
using<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.750> T<00:00:43.530> flip-flop<00:00:44.390> Luke<00:00:45.390> dude<00:00:45.690> 5<00:00:46.050> made<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
using a T flip-flop Luke dude 5 made it

great<00:00:46.770> tutorial<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:48.110> it<00:00:49.110> worked<00:00:49.350> well

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
great tutorial on that it worked well

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.240 
great tutorial on that it worked well
for<00:00:49.649> me<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.960> at<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:51.989> end<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.039> looks

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
for me and at the end of it it looks

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.630 
for me and at the end of it it looks
like<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.480> basically<00:00:55.350> pulls<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.219> end<00:00:56.430> over

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
like this basically pulls one end over

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.959 
like this basically pulls one end over
to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> side<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.770> my<00:00:58.770> improvement<00:00:59.309> basically

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
to the side and my improvement basically

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.100 
to the side and my improvement basically
to<00:01:00.570> come<00:01:00.809> down<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.670> right<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> there

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to come down and right there and there

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.920 
to come down and right there and there
there'll<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> two<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.400> come<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.930> when

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
there'll be two that come up just when

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
there'll be two that come up just when
you<00:01:07.020> close<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> inside<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
you close it from the inside just to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.530 
you close it from the inside just to
make<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.060> pretty<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.880> yeah<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.180> get<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> nice

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
make it pretty and yeah you get a nice

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
make it pretty and yeah you get a nice
little<00:01:12.720> room<00:01:12.930> going<00:01:14.960> just<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.850> what<00:01:17.850> it's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
little room going just so what it's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.399 
little room going just so what it's
actually<00:01:18.180> happening<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> there's<00:01:19.170> four

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
actually happening is there's four

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
actually happening is there's four
Pistons<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.580> then<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.750> were<00:01:21.869> on

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
Pistons to there and then if you were on

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
Pistons to there and then if you were on
the<00:01:22.140> other<00:01:22.170> side<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.920> line<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.460> there's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the other side in line with this there's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.300 
the other side in line with this there's
two<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.060> facing<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.020> direction<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:26.009> one

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
two more facing that direction then one

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.969 
two more facing that direction then one
pushing<00:01:26.970> these<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.390> bookcases<00:01:27.600> forward<00:01:28.259> one

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
pushing these two bookcases forward one

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.740 
pushing these two bookcases forward one
underneath<00:01:29.610> there<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.210> pulling<00:01:30.540> those

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
underneath there and there pulling those

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.410 
underneath there and there pulling those
up<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.170> then<00:01:31.229> those<00:01:31.680> two<00:01:31.860> gold<00:01:32.130> basically<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
up and then those two gold basically the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.170 
up and then those two gold basically the
opposite<00:01:33.950> this<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.030> one

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
opposite this one this one and this one

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.640 
opposite this one this one and this one
and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.200> circuit

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
and this one are on the same circuit

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.230 
and this one are on the same circuit
just<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.430> inversed

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
just you know inversed

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.260 
just you know inversed
I<00:01:39.710> think<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.829> said<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.070> right<00:01:41.220> anyhow<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
I think I said that right anyhow and the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.260 
I think I said that right anyhow and the
timing<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.930> pain-in-the-ass<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.000> mean

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
timing is pain-in-the-ass really I mean

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.380 
timing is pain-in-the-ass really I mean
it's<00:01:48.990> fun<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.799> looks<00:01:49.829> good<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> end<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's fun it looks good but at the end of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.080 
it's fun it looks good but at the end of
the<00:01:51.450> day<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.780> pretty<00:01:52.350> complicated<00:01:52.850> I'm<00:01:53.850> not

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the day it's pretty complicated I'm not

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.580 
the day it's pretty complicated I'm not
going<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> say<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.689> greatest<00:01:55.020> person

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
going to say I'm the greatest person

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.789 
going to say I'm the greatest person
with<00:01:55.710> redstone<00:01:56.990> but<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> someone<00:01:58.680> could

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
with redstone but and someone could

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.319 
with redstone but and someone could
probably<00:01:58.979> improve<00:01:59.189> upon<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.790> I'm<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
probably improve upon it I'm going to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.109 
probably improve upon it I'm going to
also<00:02:00.479> put<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.380> link<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> base<00:02:02.009> where<00:02:02.880> every

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
also put a link in the base where every

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.539 
also put a link in the base where every
that<00:02:03.659> thing<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.049> calling<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.340> map

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that thing is calling and for this map

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.660 
that thing is calling and for this map
so<00:02:06.530> people<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.649> screw<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> learn<00:02:08.640> from

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so people can screw out if it learn from

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.400 
so people can screw out if it learn from
it<00:02:09.060> etc<00:02:09.330> etc<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.739> need<00:02:10.950> piston<00:02:11.610> mod

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it etc etc you will need piston mod

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.230 
it etc etc you will need piston mod
also<00:02:12.860> have<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> link<00:02:13.280> for<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:15.760> yeah<00:02:16.760> so

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
also have a link for that and yeah so

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
also have a link for that and yeah so
this<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.930> wiring<00:02:18.770> setup<00:02:19.370> for<00:02:19.820> um<00:02:20.260> III

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
this is the wiring setup for um III

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.290 
this is the wiring setup for um III
human<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:22.280> works<00:02:22.460> rather<00:02:22.670> well<00:02:22.790> for<00:02:22.910> me<00:02:23.120> I

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
human it works rather well for me I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.850 
human it works rather well for me I
think<00:02:23.330> there's<00:02:23.930> another<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.530> he's<00:02:24.650> made

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
think there's another one that he's made

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.260 
think there's another one that he's made
I<00:02:25.100> haven't<00:02:25.400> really<00:02:25.580> messed<00:02:25.730> around<00:02:25.910> with<00:02:26.060> it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
I haven't really messed around with it

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.360 
I haven't really messed around with it
frankly<00:02:26.720> just<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.590> stick<00:02:28.040> with<00:02:28.160> what's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
frankly just I just stick with what's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.120 
frankly just I just stick with what's
working<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:29.120> four<00:02:29.840> Pistons<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.320> way<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:30.980> I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
working so four Pistons that way like I

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.450 
working so four Pistons that way like I
said<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.990> then<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.470> from<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.770> top<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.690> then

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
said and then to from the top and then

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.040 
said and then to from the top and then
the<00:02:37.460> one<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.850> see<00:02:38.030> right<00:02:38.060> there<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:38.960> the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the one that you see right there in the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.780 
the one that you see right there in the
crosshair<00:02:39.440> gets<00:02:39.650> slid<00:02:39.950> over<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.340> pushes

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
crosshair gets slid over and pushes

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.310 
crosshair gets slid over and pushes
forward<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.400> yeah<00:02:44.180> that's<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.810> gist<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
forward so yeah that's the gist of it

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.130 
forward so yeah that's the gist of it
also<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.370> T<00:02:46.610> flip-flop<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:47.950> just<00:02:48.950> down<00:02:49.130> here

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
also the T flip-flop is just down here

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.200 
also the T flip-flop is just down here
also<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.740> said<00:02:51.770> tutorial<00:02:52.640> from<00:02:52.850> Luke<00:02:53.000> dude

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210
