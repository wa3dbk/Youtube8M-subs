credit<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.160> is<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.370> very<00:00:11.639> good<00:00:11.910> drawing<00:00:12.509> program

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
credit it is a very good drawing program

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.839 
credit it is a very good drawing program
and<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.410> wanted<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> do<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.340> draw<00:00:14.580> lines

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
and if you wanted to do is draw lines

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.480 
and if you wanted to do is draw lines
arcs<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.049> fill<00:00:16.199> dates<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.650> fill<00:00:17.130> things<00:00:17.279> in

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
arcs and fill dates and fill things in

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.670 
arcs and fill dates and fill things in
with<00:00:17.640> hatches<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.240> other<00:00:18.359> things<00:00:18.660> AutoCAD<00:00:19.560> is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
with hatches and other things AutoCAD is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.260 
with hatches and other things AutoCAD is
still<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> very<00:00:20.279> good<00:00:20.400> program<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.119> that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
still a very good program to do that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.460 
still a very good program to do that
probably<00:00:21.420> easy<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> use<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> rapid

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
probably easy to use a rapid

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.439 
probably easy to use a rapid
architecture<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.939> show<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.240> some

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
architecture so I like to show you some

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.700 
architecture so I like to show you some
techniques<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.990> regard<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> putting<00:00:25.590> your

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
techniques and regard to putting your

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
techniques and regard to putting your
logo<00:00:26.010> together<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.090> I've<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.330> opened<00:00:27.779> up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
logo together so I've just opened up

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.560 
logo together so I've just opened up
regular<00:00:28.140> old<00:00:28.349> AutoCAD<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.240> first<00:00:30.449> thing

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
regular old AutoCAD and the first thing

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.209 
regular old AutoCAD and the first thing
I'm<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> create<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.710> new<00:00:31.740> level<00:00:32.189> so

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
I'm going to do is create a new level so

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.510 
I'm going to do is create a new level so
right<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:32.910> all<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.540> level<00:00:33.840> level<00:00:34.290> 0

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
right now all we have is level level 0

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.709 
right now all we have is level level 0
this<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.640> nothing<00:00:35.969> else<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.329> let's<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.660> ahead

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
this is nothing else so let's go ahead

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.850 
this is nothing else so let's go ahead
and<00:00:36.809> create<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.079> new<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.350> let's<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> our

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and create a new one let's go to our

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.040 
and create a new one let's go to our
layer<00:00:38.070> properties<00:00:38.610> I'll<00:00:39.300> put<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> guy<00:00:39.870> up

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
layer properties I'll put it at a guy up

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.920 
layer properties I'll put it at a guy up
and<00:00:40.320> open<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.980> new<00:00:41.129> layer<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.750> one

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and open up a new layer and this one

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.580 
and open up a new layer and this one
we're<00:00:43.050> gonna<00:00:43.140> call<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.410> image<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:49.170> color

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
we're gonna call it image and color

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.660 
we're gonna call it image and color
let's<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.070> make<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.520> bit

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
let's just make it a little bit

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.040 
let's just make it a little bit
different<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:51.059> some<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> other<00:00:51.690> colors

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
different from some of the other colors

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.200 
different from some of the other colors
uses<00:00:52.860> standard<00:00:53.190> colors<00:00:53.460> maybe<00:00:53.730> green<00:00:54.000> would

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
uses standard colors maybe green would

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
uses standard colors maybe green would
be<00:00:54.360> fine<00:00:54.629> or<00:00:55.469> Alissa<00:00:55.949> actually<00:00:56.370> excuse<00:00:56.699> red

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
be fine or Alissa actually excuse red

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
be fine or Alissa actually excuse red
rattle<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.899> okay<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.590> least<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.949> me<00:00:59.070> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
rattle be okay at least for me that

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
rattle be okay at least for me that
that'll<00:00:59.820> work<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the green checkmark and choose that as

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
the green checkmark and choose that as
my<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.360> layer<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.140> draw<00:01:07.439> on

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
my it's a layer that I want to draw on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399 
my it's a layer that I want to draw on
when<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.220> back<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.520> AutoCAD<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.900> what<00:01:10.290> I'm

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
when I get back to AutoCAD but what I'm

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
when I get back to AutoCAD but what I'm
desiring<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.490> import<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.119> image

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
desiring to do here is import an image

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.230 
desiring to do here is import an image
into<00:01:12.890> AutoCAD<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.430> draw<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.820> top<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
into AutoCAD and a draw right on top of

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.740 
into AutoCAD and a draw right on top of
it<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.860> it's<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> X<00:01:17.700> close<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> out

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it so it's go to the X close that out

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
it so it's go to the X close that out
now<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.140> two<00:01:19.290> layers<00:01:19.500> images<00:01:20.130> chosen

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
now we have two layers images chosen

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550 
now we have two layers images chosen
here<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.360> let's<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:21.630> ahead<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.409> the

here so let's go ahead and go to the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.600 
here so let's go ahead and go to the
insert<00:01:22.799> tab<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:24.150> go<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> attach<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:26.280> allows

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
insert tab and go to attach this allows

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
insert tab and go to attach this allows

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
the settings here let's just choose the
default<00:01:39.750> setting<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.350> okay<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.310> allows

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
default setting to go to okay it allows

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.550 
default setting to go to okay it allows
us<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.820> drop<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> screen<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:43.259> it's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
us to drop it on the screen and it's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.940 
us to drop it on the screen and it's
going<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> red<00:01:45.060> rectangle<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.619> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
going to be in that red rectangle and I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.710 
going to be in that red rectangle and I
could<00:01:47.310> scale<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.030> down<00:01:48.119> from<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.570> but

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
could scale it up or down from here but

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120 
could scale it up or down from here but
if<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.200> enter<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> just

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
if I just do enter right now it just

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310 
if I just do enter right now it just
puts<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> into<00:01:50.610> regular<00:01:51.149> size<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:52.110> i<00:01:52.259> think

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
puts it into regular size which i think

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.109 
puts it into regular size which i think
is<00:01:52.909> six<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.210> eight<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:54.990> nine<00:01:55.259> inches<00:01:56.000> all<00:01:57.000> right

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
is six or eight or nine inches all right

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.370 
is six or eight or nine inches all right
we<00:01:57.240> could<00:01:57.360> check<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.570> let's<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.110> ahead<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
we could check that let's go ahead and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.130 
we could check that let's go ahead and
do<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> line<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.040> draw<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.310> line<00:01:59.490> across<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
do a line and draw a line across and it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.569 
do a line and draw a line across and it
looks<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.530> about<00:02:01.590> 13<00:02:02.070> inches<00:02:02.159> across

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
looks like it's about 13 inches across

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.999 
looks like it's about 13 inches across
maybe<00:02:02.969> six<00:02:03.270> inches<00:02:03.420> tall<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.649> works<00:02:04.799> out

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
maybe six inches tall so that works out

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.639 
maybe six inches tall so that works out
okay<00:02:05.369> when<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.149> insert<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.079> into<00:02:07.320> Revit

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
okay when we insert this into Revit

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.809 
okay when we insert this into Revit
architecture<00:02:07.740> we're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.459> scale<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
architecture we're going to scale this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.750 
architecture we're going to scale this
down<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.270> order<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.569> make<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> fit<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:11.280> space

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
down in order to make it fit the space

is allocated for it on
title<00:02:13.550> block<00:02:14.650> okay<00:02:15.819> let's<00:02:16.819> draw<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.810> not

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
title block okay let's draw it's not

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.300 
title block okay let's draw it's not
drawing<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.380> image<00:02:18.560> later<00:02:18.800> will<00:02:18.920> destroy<00:02:19.190> him

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
drawing the image later will destroy him

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.730 
drawing the image later will destroy him
is<00:02:19.430> zero<00:02:19.610> layer<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.440> fun<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.620> it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
is zero layer and just for the fun of it

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.860 
is zero layer and just for the fun of it
let's<00:02:21.920> go<00:02:22.040> up<00:02:22.160> here<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.520> change<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.569> the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
let's go up here and change the the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.420 
let's go up here and change the the
color<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.500> we're<00:02:24.950> gonna<00:02:25.040> change<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.370> to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
color of it we're gonna change it to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.970 
color of it we're gonna change it to
magenta<00:02:25.850> I<00:02:26.000> think<00:02:26.270> magenta<00:02:26.660> will<00:02:26.780> look<00:02:27.380> a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
magenta I think magenta will look a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.979 
magenta I think magenta will look a
little<00:02:28.550> bit<00:02:28.700> better<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.030> actually<00:02:29.390> stand<00:02:29.780> out<00:02:29.959> a

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
little bit better I actually stand out a

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.449 
little bit better I actually stand out a
little<00:02:30.170> bit<00:02:30.350> better<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.739> can<00:02:31.160> draw<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.340> a

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
little bit better you can draw on a

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.100 
little bit better you can draw on a
white<00:02:31.640> line<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.090> bike<00:02:32.270> light<00:02:32.569> background

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
white line and a bike light background

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.740 
white line and a bike light background
it's<00:02:33.290> impossible<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.010> see<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:35.030> this<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.239> you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
it's impossible to see and this is you

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.199 
it's impossible to see and this is you
don't<00:02:35.810> have<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.080> be<00:02:36.200> very<00:02:36.319> uh<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.910> know<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:38.090> you

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
don't have to be very uh you know if you

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.520 
don't have to be very uh you know if you
have<00:02:38.330> something<00:02:38.569> sketched<00:02:38.900> out<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.319> want<00:02:39.440> to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
have something sketched out you want to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.350 
have something sketched out you want to
take<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> picture<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.190> scan<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.060> put<00:02:41.270> it

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
take a picture of it scan it and put it

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.699 
take a picture of it scan it and put it
in<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> background<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.959> all<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.319> technique

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
in the background of all this technique

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.470 
in the background of all this technique
you're<00:02:42.860> welcome<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.640> way<00:02:43.819> but<00:02:44.360> it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
you're welcome to do it that way but it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.750 
you're welcome to do it that way but it
doesn't<00:02:44.810> really<00:02:44.900> have<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.290> be<00:02:45.380> precise<00:02:45.800> if<00:02:46.670> you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
doesn't really have to be precise if you

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.070 
doesn't really have to be precise if you
just<00:02:46.940> want<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.180> draw<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> right<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.660> top<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.989> this

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
just want to draw a right on top of this

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.509 
just want to draw a right on top of this
thing

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
thing

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.860 
thing
you<00:02:49.519> have<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.790> worry<00:02:49.970> about<00:02:50.030> offsets<00:02:50.660> of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you have to worry about offsets of

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.360 
you have to worry about offsets of
specific<00:02:51.440> distances<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:53.709> now<00:02:54.709> dimensions<00:02:55.220> of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
specific distances and now dimensions of

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.620 
specific distances and now dimensions of
certain<00:02:55.640> sizes<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.180> don't<00:02:56.300> have<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.480> worry

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
certain sizes you don't have to worry

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.870 
certain sizes you don't have to worry
about<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.989> so<00:02:57.920> let's<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.430> draw<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> line

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
about that so let's just draw a line

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.540 
about that so let's just draw a line
straight<00:02:59.030> across<00:02:59.890> can<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:00.950> get<00:03:01.100> away<00:03:01.190> from<00:03:01.340> me

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
straight across can I get away from me

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.229 
straight across can I get away from me
there<00:03:03.310> that's<00:03:04.310> my<00:03:04.430> bridge<00:03:04.610> into<00:03:04.880> line<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.150> can

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
there that's my bridge into line you can

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.680 
there that's my bridge into line you can
just<00:03:05.420> Braille<00:03:05.569> this<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.930> not<00:03:06.470> gonna<00:03:06.590> copy<00:03:06.890> that

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
just Braille this it not gonna copy that

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.880 
just Braille this it not gonna copy that
I'm<00:03:08.690> gonna<00:03:08.870> copy<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.170> for<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.440> point<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.769> that

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
I'm gonna copy it for that point to that

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.420 
I'm gonna copy it for that point to that
point<00:03:10.870> good<00:03:11.870> am<00:03:11.959> i<00:03:12.050> three-point<00:03:12.500> arc<00:03:12.650> remember

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
point good am i three-point arc remember

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.430 
point good am i three-point arc remember
it's<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.640> start<00:03:13.940> middle<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.540> dark<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.380> I'm

middle here and then we're going to end

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.460 
middle here and then we're going to end
it<00:03:18.500> down<00:03:18.650> here<00:03:20.110> go<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.290> offset<00:03:21.650> command

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
it down here go to the offset command

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.289 
it down here go to the offset command
where<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.500> set<00:03:24.769> our<00:03:24.890> offset<00:03:25.280> distance<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.269> you

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
where a set our offset distance if you

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.479 
where a set our offset distance if you
look<00:03:26.480> just<00:03:26.600> as<00:03:26.840> far<00:03:27.049> as<00:03:27.170> your<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.190> can<00:03:28.370> see

look just as far as your you can see

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.310 
look just as far as your you can see
what<00:03:28.640> it's<00:03:28.760> asking<00:03:28.880> for<00:03:29.299> so<00:03:29.930> if<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.079> click<00:03:30.290> on

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
what it's asking for so if I click on

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.170 
what it's asking for so if I click on
this<00:03:30.560> line<00:03:30.769> in<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.220> line<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.730> gives<00:03:31.850> us<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
this line in that line it gives us the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.880 
this line in that line it gives us the
distance<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:32.660> we're<00:03:32.750> gonna<00:03:32.840> offset<00:03:33.260> it

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
distance that we're gonna offset it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.680 
distance that we're gonna offset it
gives<00:03:34.040> me<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.220> little<00:03:34.400> pick<00:03:34.640> box<00:03:34.880> then<00:03:35.600> you're

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
gives me a little pick box then you're

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.610 
gives me a little pick box then you're

clicking this arc click to the inside

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.780 
clicking this arc click to the inside
now<00:03:39.620> if<00:03:39.769> I<00:03:39.860> click<00:03:40.100> on<00:03:40.130> all<00:03:40.310> these<00:03:40.459> lines<00:03:40.700> you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
now if I click on all these lines you

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.229 
now if I click on all these lines you
can<00:03:40.970> see<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.360> I<00:03:41.390> have<00:03:41.750> now<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:43.670> know<00:03:43.760> one<00:03:44.060> to

can see that I have now you know one to
two<00:03:44.690> lines<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.290> two<00:03:45.500> arcs<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.420> can<00:03:47.660> go

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
two lines and two arcs and I can go

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.150 
two lines and two arcs and I can go
ahead<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.170> complete<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.799> side<00:03:49.010> by

spacebar draw this one down here I'm

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.360 
spacebar draw this one down here I'm
gonna<00:03:59.750> pick<00:03:59.930> up<00:04:00.049> that<00:04:00.079> relationship<00:04:00.709> over

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
gonna pick up that relationship over

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.340 
gonna pick up that relationship over
there<00:04:01.549> so<00:04:02.209> now<00:04:02.329> I<00:04:02.359> have<00:04:02.630> one<00:04:02.840> quarter<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.230> a

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
there so now I have one quarter of a

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.240 
there so now I have one quarter of a
drawn<00:04:03.650> oops

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
drawn oops

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.470 
drawn oops
that<00:04:07.250> looks<00:04:07.400> like<00:04:07.519> it's<00:04:07.670> still<00:04:07.850> in<00:04:07.880> place<00:04:08.180> what

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
that looks like it's still in place what

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.990 
that looks like it's still in place what
I'm<00:04:08.570> gonna<00:04:08.690> do<00:04:08.870> is<00:04:08.959> enter<00:04:09.290> my<00:04:09.320> image<00:04:09.680> off<00:04:10.000> its

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
I'm gonna do is enter my image off its

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.729 
I'm gonna do is enter my image off its
going<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.209> reveal<00:04:11.510> portion<00:04:12.049> of<00:04:12.140> my<00:04:12.230> logo<00:04:12.620> in

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
going to reveal portion of my logo in

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.680 
going to reveal portion of my logo in
the<00:04:12.829> background<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.459> then<00:04:14.090> I'm<00:04:14.299> going<00:04:14.600> to

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
the background and then I'm going to

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.930 
the background and then I'm going to
mirror<00:04:15.380> it<00:04:15.470> see<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:15.980> other<00:04:16.100> side<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.549> kind<00:04:16.910> of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
mirror it see the other side and kind of

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.789 
mirror it see the other side and kind of
complete<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:18.200> let's<00:04:18.410> go<00:04:18.560> up<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.739> our

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
complete this so let's go up to our

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.740 
complete this so let's go up to our
layer<00:04:18.950> manager<00:04:19.430> let's<00:04:20.150> go<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.419> light<00:04:20.539> bulb

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
layer manager let's go to the light bulb

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.670 
layer manager let's go to the light bulb
up<00:04:20.840> here<00:04:21.079> for<00:04:21.260> image

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
up here for image

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.159 
up here for image
turn<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.130> off<00:04:22.340> makes<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.539> lot<00:04:23.720> easier<00:04:24.110> to

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
turn that off makes it a lot easier to

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:24.920 
turn that off makes it a lot easier to
draw

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
draw

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.779 
draw
make<00:04:25.320> manipulations<00:04:26.070> here<00:04:26.250> now<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.610> we<00:04:26.669> got

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
make manipulations here now that we got

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.730 
make manipulations here now that we got
that<00:04:26.970> image<00:04:27.150> out<00:04:27.330> of<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.509> background<00:04:27.930> so

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
that image out of the background so

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.050 
that image out of the background so
let's<00:04:28.889> do<00:04:28.979> this<00:04:29.130> let's<00:04:29.550> take<00:04:29.729> this<00:04:29.850> we're

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
let's do this let's take this we're

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.020 
let's do this let's take this we're
going<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.240> mirror<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.169> bottom

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
going to mirror that to the bottom

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.580 
going to mirror that to the bottom
remember<00:04:33.030> how<00:04:33.120> we<00:04:33.180> mirror<00:04:33.509> it<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.470> it

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
remember how we mirror it and to it

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.080 
remember how we mirror it and to it
we're<00:04:34.650> going<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:34.860> keep<00:04:34.979> both<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.220> them<00:04:35.430> now

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
we're going to keep both of them now

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.700 
we're going to keep both of them now
when<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.300> take<00:04:36.449> this<00:04:36.660> side<00:04:36.900> a<00:04:37.229> mirror<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.590> to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
when you take this side a mirror it to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.260 
when you take this side a mirror it to
the<00:04:37.800> other<00:04:37.949> side<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.460> there<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:44.970> middle<00:04:45.180> of

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
the other side so there is the middle of

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.909 
the other side so there is the middle of
it<00:04:45.389> if<00:04:45.600> we<00:04:45.690> want<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:45.990> do<00:04:46.080> some<00:04:46.259> hatching<00:04:46.650> we<00:04:46.770> can

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
it if we want to do some hatching we can

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.850 
it if we want to do some hatching we can
do<00:04:47.009> that<00:04:47.160> at<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.150> point<00:04:48.389> and<00:04:48.660> just<00:04:48.740> for<00:04:49.740> our

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
do that at this point and just for our

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.140 
do that at this point and just for our
own<00:04:49.979> convenience<00:04:50.310> we<00:04:50.669> made<00:04:50.880> everything

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
own convenience we made everything

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.659 
own convenience we made everything
magenta<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.139> color<00:04:52.500> but<00:04:53.400> we're<00:04:53.580> gonna

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
magenta in color but we're gonna

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.249 
magenta in color but we're gonna
eventually<00:04:54.150> turn<00:04:54.300> everything<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.810> white<00:04:54.990> so

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
eventually turn everything to white so

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.930 
eventually turn everything to white so
we<00:04:55.410> import<00:04:55.800> our<00:04:55.889> image<00:04:56.190> into<00:04:56.550> Revit

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
we import our image into Revit

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.060 
we import our image into Revit
architecture<00:04:57.320> you<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.440> colors<00:04:58.770> if<00:04:58.949> you<00:04:59.039> like

architecture you do colors if you like

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.120 
architecture you do colors if you like
then<00:04:59.970> we<00:05:00.120> report<00:05:00.570> in<00:05:00.690> when<00:05:01.199> we<00:05:01.289> import<00:05:01.680> images

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
then we report in when we import images

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.469 
then we report in when we import images
in<00:05:02.280> the<00:05:02.370> Revit<00:05:02.639> architecture<00:05:02.699> we<00:05:03.240> like<00:05:03.389> to

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
in the Revit architecture we like to

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.600 
in the Revit architecture we like to
have<00:05:03.599> a<00:05:03.630> black<00:05:03.930> or<00:05:03.960> white<00:05:04.370> so<00:05:05.370> we're<00:05:05.490> gonna

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
have a black or white so we're gonna

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.180 
have a black or white so we're gonna
make<00:05:05.789> everything<00:05:06.000> here<00:05:06.300> white<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.099> think

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
make everything here white so I think

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.740 
make everything here white so I think
that's<00:05:08.400> enough<00:05:08.610> for<00:05:08.729> this<00:05:08.820> video<00:05:09.150> we'll<00:05:09.720> go

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
that's enough for this video we'll go

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.029 
that's enough for this video we'll go
ahead<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.169> complete<00:05:10.440> this<00:05:10.590> in<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.860> next

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
ahead and complete this in the next

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.220 
ahead and complete this in the next
video
