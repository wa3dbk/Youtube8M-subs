 I have a big engine and the same closes a door for 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.869
 40 percent 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.569
 not just the questions I do not like 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:31.759
 more a very difficult question though 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.460
 Integration took a snapshot of Mystic Tan 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.520
 worst case is 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.250
 I became my sportiness or my hobbies 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.200
 asking the question can mean linking 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.410
 and though her hobby FCE there are football at the moment have the handicap 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.110
 because I'm still alive 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.110
 from having halved surgery on the cruciate ligament in the knee 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.850
 but I play volleyball 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.380
 I would love to 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.380
 and that's enough for the Council and the Judge of the 4 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.680
 I play an instrument 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.570
 I can say that I have two years ukulele and move on like that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 with four days four pages 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.320
 Now he wants to work longer 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.580
 and we conclude my musical talent 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.940
 I have a driver's license 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.270
 dipped in the pale light 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.210
 who like or other services 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.080
 So I read a lot in itself but he magazine in the play of the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.820
 Subconscious I have read a very good year piece 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.070
 that is to say 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.580
 Class enemy from school into 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.030
 who is my favorite part respectively 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.570
 known person 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.560
 So there are many if I have to think about it now 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.580
 I only say 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.230
 Klemens send known German actors 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.510
 why can we speak the Elektra in the series as well? 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.100
 we have him a coach 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 the us-actor also did some language lessons 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.130
 from the female followers where I also asked 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.530
 if I am happy at the moment however 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.350
 If I'm right in the club or in moderation we will 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.320
 of course not 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 because it also depends on the character not just on the look 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.790
 A sea of ​​many questions was also on the road 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.759
 Turning video games was 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.089
 so for us actors «less than us for the direction 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:22.809
 because there were lots of extras on site and it was very loud and very stressful 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.329
 but the place was fun for the people 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.059
 the coup in the single 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.399
 At the end, of course, a thank you to our fans 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:35.319

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 Comments 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.919
 which of course I did not think at first is really a very cool one 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.189
 around 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.129
 a and writes ask us question and that makes me really happy
