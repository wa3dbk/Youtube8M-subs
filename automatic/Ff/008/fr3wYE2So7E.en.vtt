what<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.330> are<00:00:27.599> some<00:00:28.349> diagrams<00:00:28.769> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
what we have here are some diagrams that

what we have here are some diagrams that
i<00:00:29.189> made<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:31.380> three<00:00:31.650> octave<00:00:31.980> scales<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
i made for the three octave scales and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
i made for the three octave scales and
since<00:00:33.750> my<00:00:33.989> students<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:35.570> grown<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.780> using

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
since my students have grown up using

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.260 
since my students have grown up using
all<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.410> those<00:00:37.680> fingerboard<00:00:38.250> charts<00:00:38.640> they

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
all of those fingerboard charts they

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.200 
all of those fingerboard charts they
take<00:00:39.510> really<00:00:39.870> well<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.320> these<00:00:41.090> seeing<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
take really well to these seeing the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.520 
take really well to these seeing the
three<00:00:42.450> octave<00:00:42.750> scales<00:00:43.010> in<00:00:44.010> chart<00:00:44.879> form<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
three octave scales in chart form and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.810 
three octave scales in chart form and
they're<00:00:46.530> able<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.950> play<00:00:47.129> through<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
they're able to play through these and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.959 
they're able to play through these and
learn<00:00:48.570> them<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.350> effectively<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
learn them really effectively and you

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.279 
learn them really effectively and you
know<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.510> they're<00:00:51.539> playing<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
know when to shift so for example on the
