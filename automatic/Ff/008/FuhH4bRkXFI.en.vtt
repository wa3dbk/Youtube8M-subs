00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and I will pick the best a couple of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.240 
and I will pick the best a couple of
things<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.289> take<00:01:02.070> into<00:01:02.960> consideration<00:01:04.250> I'm

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
things to take into consideration I'm

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.920 
things to take into consideration I'm
pretty<00:01:05.640> close<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> maximum<00:01:06.390> amount<00:01:06.750> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
pretty close to the maximum amount of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.520 
pretty close to the maximum amount of
characters<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.960> layer<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> should

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
characters so I will layer so I should

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.120 
characters so I will layer so I should
say<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.119> probably<00:01:12.119> end<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:13.290> having<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.799> remove

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
say so probably end up having to remove

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.590 
say so probably end up having to remove
a<00:01:14.280> tattoo<00:01:14.460> or<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:15.869> depends<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
a tattoo or two it really depends so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
a tattoo or two it really depends so
take<00:01:18.600> into<00:01:18.840> consideration<00:01:19.470> simplicity<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
take into consideration simplicity I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.749 
take into consideration simplicity I
like<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.630> be<00:01:21.750> cool<00:01:22.009> but<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.310> needs<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> be

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
like it to be cool but it needs to be

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.810 
like it to be cool but it needs to be
simple<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.560> end<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.130> wearing<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> now

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
simple and I will end up wearing it now

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
simple and I will end up wearing it now
that's<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.110> only<00:01:28.140> thing<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.189> will

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that's not the only thing that you will

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
that's not the only thing that you will
win<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> win<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.070> competition<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.229> will

win if you win the competition you will

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.310 
win if you win the competition you will
also<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:35.360> given<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.900> vehicle<00:01:37.619> by<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.979> be

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
also be given a vehicle by me it will be

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.560 
also be given a vehicle by me it will be
three<00:01:43.320> slots

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.170 

and<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:47.470> pretty<00:01:47.710> much<00:01:47.800> have<00:01:48.190> all<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.970> three

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
and I pretty much have all the three

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.530 
and I pretty much have all the three
slots<00:01:49.450> open<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:54.040> pick<00:01:54.220> any<00:01:55.060> three

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
slots open so you can pick any three

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.219 
slots open so you can pick any three
slaughter<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.290> do<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:57.040> four<00:01:57.580> slots<00:01:58.000> for<00:01:58.900> some

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
slaughter I do have four slots for some

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.800 
slaughter I do have four slots for some
but<00:01:59.440> I<00:01:59.500> don't<00:01:59.940> yeah<00:02:00.940> I<00:02:00.970> guess<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.420> tradable

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
but I don't yeah I guess it is tradable

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.260 
but I don't yeah I guess it is tradable
so<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.500> guess<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.130> broad-winged<00:02:03.760> would<00:02:04.060> could

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
so I guess the broad-winged would could

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.960 
so I guess the broad-winged would could
have<00:02:04.420> four<00:02:04.630> slots<00:02:05.220> as<00:02:06.220> long<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.729> can<00:02:06.850> have

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
have four slots as long as it can have

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.260 
have four slots as long as it can have
four<00:02:07.180> slots<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.950> pick<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.550> as<00:02:09.729> well

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
four slots you can pick that it as well

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.960 
four slots you can pick that it as well
but<00:02:11.050> for<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.320> most<00:02:11.440> part<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.890> three<00:02:12.130> slots<00:02:12.370> do

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
but for the most part is three slots do

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.830 
but for the most part is three slots do
keep<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.330> mind<00:02:13.600> i<00:02:13.900> do<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.860> vegas<00:02:15.790> kit<00:02:16.060> the
