strong<00:00:37.110> pool<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.860> we've<00:00:37.950> got<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> pool<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.520> we

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
strong pool but we've got a pool that we

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
strong pool but we've got a pool that we
could<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:38.969> well<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> if<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.719> fail<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> leave

with<00:00:51.120> their<00:00:51.239> six<00:00:51.449> nations<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
with their six nations but you know that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
with their six nations but you know that
they<00:00:52.739> did<00:00:52.920> sort<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.309> well<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.760> parts

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
they did sort of go well in parts

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
they did sort of go well in parts
they're<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> team<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.230> thrive<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.710> success

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160

teams like that have a lot of ability
and<00:01:03.510> they<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.719> possibly<00:01:04.199> get<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and they don't possibly get the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.170 
and they don't possibly get the
opportunity<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> prepare<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.460> well<00:01:05.610> when<00:01:06.090> they

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
opportunity to prepare as well when they

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.429 
opportunity to prepare as well when they
get<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> little<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> buildup<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> World

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and certainly the Ottomans Nationals

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.149 
and certainly the Ottomans Nationals
they've<00:01:16.320> been<00:01:16.409> playing<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> best<00:01:16.799> rugby<00:01:16.979> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
they've been playing the best rugby I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:17.770 
they've been playing the best rugby I
think<00:01:17.310> they've<00:01:17.400> been<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> most<00:01:17.670> consistent

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
think they've been the most consistent

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.820 
think they've been the most consistent
you<00:01:18.780> know<00:01:18.869> people<00:01:19.110> talk<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.259> New<00:01:19.500> Zealand's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you know people talk about New Zealand's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
you know people talk about New Zealand's
aura<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.310> whether<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.570> know

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
aura and whether that can you know

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.820 
aura and whether that can you know
people<00:01:21.900> lose<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> game<00:01:22.350> before<00:01:22.560> they've<00:01:22.740> even

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
people lose the game before they've even

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
people lose the game before they've even
started<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.820> important<00:01:24.240> i

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
started I think that is important i

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.580 
started I think that is important i
think<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> will<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.659> magnified<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.409> New

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
think that will be magnified in New

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
think that will be magnified in New
Zealand<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.820> are<00:01:26.970> human<00:01:27.270> they

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
Zealand but you know they are human they

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149 
Zealand but you know they are human they
do<00:01:27.600> make<00:01:27.810> mistakes<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.770> think<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.040> if

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
do make mistakes and I think that if

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
do make mistakes and I think that if
teams<00:01:29.670> impose<00:01:29.970> themselves<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.659> then

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
teams impose themselves on them then

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
teams impose themselves on them then
they<00:01:31.710> will<00:01:31.829> get<00:01:31.979> results<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
they will get results but they are the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.640 
they will get results but they are the
team<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.329> beat<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> French<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.500> go

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
team to beat I think the French will go

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.990 
team to beat I think the French will go
well<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:34.979> torn<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.430> obviously<00:01:35.850> they've

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
well in this torn and obviously they've

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
well in this torn and obviously they've
had<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> mixed<00:01:36.299> six<00:01:36.540> nations<00:01:36.930> where<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
had a mixed six nations where you know I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.260 
had a mixed six nations where you know I
think<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.610> towards<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> end<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
think you know towards the end of it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.300 
think you know towards the end of it
they<00:01:39.329> started<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.689> show<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> form

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
they started to show that the form

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
they started to show that the form
they're<00:01:41.310> capable<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.630> I've<00:01:42.720> learnt<00:01:42.899> over

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
they're capable of what I've learnt over

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.690 
they're capable of what I've learnt over
playing<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.470> Paris<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
playing in Paris is is that the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.249 
playing in Paris is is that the
emotional<00:01:45.210> state<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.659> important<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.110> these

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
emotional state is so important if these

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
emotional state is so important if these
guys<00:01:46.409> don't<00:01:46.680> turn<00:01:47.130> up<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.460> they're<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.640> on

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
guys don't turn up and they're all on

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.429 
guys don't turn up and they're all on
the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:47.970> page<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.409> very

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the same page they can be very

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.990 
the same page they can be very
disjointed<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.310> sometimes<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.759> see

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
disjointed and then sometimes you see

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.249 
disjointed and then sometimes you see
what<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> very<00:01:51.479> talented<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.960> I'd<00:01:52.020> fall

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
what it's a very talented so I'd fall

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.960 
what it's a very talented so I'd fall
apart<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.159> if<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.460> master<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
apart I think if they can master that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.580 
apart I think if they can master that
they're<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.630> talented<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.170> they'll<00:01:55.409> always

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
they're so talented that they'll always

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.719 
they're so talented that they'll always
be<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.130> they're<00:01:56.219> about<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.579> perform

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
be there are they're about to perform

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.119 
be there are they're about to perform
well
