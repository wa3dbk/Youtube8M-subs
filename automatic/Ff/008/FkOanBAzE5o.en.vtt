00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.479 
that I used for a chicken Caesar was
soaked<00:03:17.800> in<00:03:18.010> water<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.670> about<00:03:20.040> two<00:03:21.040> hours

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
soaked in water for about two hours

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.390 
soaked in water for about two hours
and<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:22.269> will<00:03:22.630> give<00:03:22.930> another<00:03:23.320> smoky<00:03:23.890> flavor

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
and this will give another smoky flavor

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.850 
and this will give another smoky flavor
so<00:03:25.090> between<00:03:25.330> those<00:03:25.660> two<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.230> will<00:03:26.410> be<00:03:26.530> perfect

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
so between those two it will be perfect

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.460 
so between those two it will be perfect
place<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.130> chicken<00:03:30.430> on<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.420> middle<00:03:31.750> rack<00:03:32.019> far

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
place the chicken on the middle rack far

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.699 
place the chicken on the middle rack far
apart<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:33.070> each<00:03:33.310> other<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:37.090> see<00:03:37.360> how

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
apart of each other you see how

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.089 
apart of each other you see how
beautiful<00:03:38.709> is<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:39.130> smoke

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.770 

aging<00:03:42.849> a<00:03:43.920> little<00:03:44.920> bit<00:03:45.159> of<00:03:45.459> black<00:03:46.120> pepper<00:03:46.150> on

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
aging a little bit of black pepper on

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.899 
aging a little bit of black pepper on
top<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.709> think<00:03:47.980> that's<00:03:48.189> it<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:49.530> brine<00:03:50.909> the

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
top and I think that's it the brine the

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.750 
top and I think that's it the brine the
salt<00:03:52.450> make<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.260> moist<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.890> so<00:03:54.129> tender<00:03:54.159> you

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
salt make it so moist and so tender you

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.410 
salt make it so moist and so tender you
have<00:03:54.939> no<00:03:55.150> idea<00:03:55.569> how<00:03:55.780> good<00:03:56.019> it<00:03:56.079> is<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.420> just

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
have no idea how good it is so just

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.440 
have no idea how good it is so just
leave<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.900> for<00:03:59.109> about<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.470> think<00:03:59.769> four<00:04:00.280> hours<00:04:00.760> or

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
leave it for about I think four hours or

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.500 
leave it for about I think four hours or
you<00:04:02.230> can<00:04:02.439> make<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.489> little<00:04:03.760> trick<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:04.359> can

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
you can make a little trick you can

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.619 
you can make a little trick you can
smoke<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.019> for<00:04:05.049> hour<00:04:05.470> or<00:04:05.799> so<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:06.579> then<00:04:07.120> pop<00:04:07.480> it

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
smoke it for hour or so and then pop it

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.660 
smoke it for hour or so and then pop it
inside<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:08.170> oven<00:04:08.379> and<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:09.250> will<00:04:09.489> be

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
inside the oven and it will be

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.899
