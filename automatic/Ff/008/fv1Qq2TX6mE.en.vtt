00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.560
 you do not have to be afraid to do that 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.539
 for what we are called 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.960
 to fight against our rival 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.850
 no matter how many times they hit us 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.500
 it does not matter how many times they throw us 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.920
 if it is not we get up to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.920
 keep fighting 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.660
 and now it's time to recover 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.910
 our identity we clean our house 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.300
 let's clean up our country Spain does not 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.300
 homeland 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.300
 and so he picks up 36 still on the street not 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.340
 to dig to be able to learn 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.040
 that boy is full of hate just going to 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.400
 have problems and train them together 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.400
 death 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.980
 it happens that the same level is very clear 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 if it's going to be that you're seeing a lot in the 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.260
 virus is sticking something 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.770
 one year 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.190
 but you 're fucking wrong you're 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.190
 a shit 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.940
 the violence goes with me 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.130
 what matters to defend scum 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.759
 you are putting yourself against your 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.759
 Julia colleagues 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.189
 we should not be afraid to do that 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.880
 for what we are called there is no need 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.880
 be afraid to live
