00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 the implementation of a bicycle lane 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.580
 to the colegio madre cabrini in the Marian village 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.570
 It has caused controversy among 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.639
 local people 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.799
 see video reportage of renata 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 falzoni and murilo azevedo 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.859
 aiming to meet a flow solution of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.250
 cyclists students parents and students and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.289
 drivers created a new solution in the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.050
 neighborhood of Mariana village in front of 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.140
 cabrini mother school solution 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 add a space for cyclists 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.050
 signs that must pass very 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 slowly because the whole extension has a 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 pedestrian track a large blue carpet 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.309
 to contemplate the free passage of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 students a left lane of the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.110
 vehicles with students 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 one more to the left of the drivers 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 passing the street in their cars 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 during 60 minutes we were at the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.809
 front of this school there was no 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.480
 congestion to opinions however 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.250
 are divided support this solution has 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.109
 why enter the site if a queue 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 giant you've been waiting for in the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.159
 bus stop to get down here 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.600
 with rodrigo it's faster what goes 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.970
 seek to find who will deliver to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 delivery and then I think it's a 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.689
 absurd I think there was not done any 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 impact study 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.950
 For me this installation I think 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.140
 should be on the left side and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 kicked with great fear of running over 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.330
 here you have to pay attention that the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.509
 child has no idea she sees the car comes 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.850
 with this condition in which they placed 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.680
 this bike path we are taking risk 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.560
 of cyclist driver accident 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.290
 pedestrians and especially children I 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.610
 I liked it because it's getting over the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.259
 sidewalks is often even dangerous 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 You do not like people either, eh? 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.100
 end up hurting people also have 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 to get off to push the bike 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.360
 Give it to everybody, if you respect him. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.979
 respecting descending slowly knowing that 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.170
 here is a school that he who also 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.719
 cross the children gets off the bike 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.130
 slowly slowly has been braking from the 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.560
 when I respect the pedestrian 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.570
 What are you going through for sure? 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 respect for their part is what 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.649
 need the language about it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.050
 in your opinion what would be the solution 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.410
 this impasse here looks at my solution 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.920
 would be or change track 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.020
 or change my solution to another street 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.690
 is this even we are 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.440
 requesting ceitec to review this 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.180
 project 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.130
 Has she ever been run over since 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.890
 been deployed not yet 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.940
 due to the reduced number of cyclists 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.940
 what you are currently
