00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.540
 there I am mar felipe and today we are going to 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 review 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 the smart image stabilizer 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 stabilizing is manufactured by gas 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.010
 equipment brusque and Santa Catarina 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.740
 he is a stabilizer with a goal of 4 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.990
 bearings and lightweight of the opera and easy to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.960
 adjust the equivalent of a model 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.149
 imported bligh of 2000 yoke that has 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 in its main advantage is the relationship 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.140
 cost benefit because third of the cost 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.989
 value of imported 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.000
 well let's see the smart images being there and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.010
 gas equipment for us 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.739
 we work with image capture 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.090
 doing institutional business videos 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 event coverage and other work 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.800
 with video we are always in search of 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.649
 innovations and new languages in the scenes 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.359
 mini leisure Marxist is one of those 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.110
 equipment that can not be missed 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.970
 in our kit and carry it handy and easy 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 work as we can see in these 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.930
 one side with stabilizers 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 on the other side without stabilizer 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.100
 it is well assembled all in aluminum with 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.350
 excellent finish is manufactured by 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.900
 gas equipment there in brusque santa 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.640
 catarina which is a great advantage because 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.890
 usually here we always end up leaving 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.900
 it 's time to arrange some 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.700
 production items, ie due to lack of 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.040
 voluntary resource or even that 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.860
 I would run and they would send me 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.290
 ready for the review we did well 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.079
 quick balance the manufacturer provides a 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.880
 table for setting and configuring the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.460
 pilots 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.659
 it comes with a low for rest in 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 an irregular moment 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.680
 she will fix it on a lighting tripod 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.970
 and threads of 14 or 18 which are patterns that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 practicing exploring the potential of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.710
 marginal and mini we arrived at two 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 adjustment situations very interesting 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.329
 in the first configuration we used it well 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.460
 compact with the help of the base 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.060
 at least to pass through small 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 places 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.980
 thus increasing the versatility 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.200
 of movement 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.840
 for this we need to give a little more 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.210
 the weight setting and the second 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.220
 soft lighter shape setting 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.500
 for the scenes plus names in that format 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.600
 lighter we already use the art of the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.820
 long and less dangerous because 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.930
 higher and pedro lower the need for 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.240
 Weight 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.130
 that's all it takes to travel in creativity and then 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.110
 enjoy the scenes in editing 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.150
 if you were also interested in giving 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.730
 one raised in his scenes there goes and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.980
 middle of the gaia gas point equipment 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.780
 equipment at gmail.com 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.790
 take this opportunity to have a 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.980
 booth that is totally national very 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.020
 good equivalent to imported models 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.490
 which are much more expensive than the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.050
 get your hands on 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.780
 the next video I'll show you both 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.640
 ways we find to balance the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.450
 established milestones and friends 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.450
 stay tuned 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.600
 males stÃ¡bile cef estimates to pay 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.820
 equipment is really fantastic will 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.110
 bring smooth and continuous movements 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.650
 their productions 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.690
 I really liked him and he recommends very well 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.120
