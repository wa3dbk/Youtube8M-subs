00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.430 

you<00:00:55.940> see<00:00:56.210> mine<00:00:56.629> was<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:56.870> little<00:00:57.199> bit<00:00:57.320> flat

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.030 

so<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.070> needed<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.580> tighten<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:05.890> make<00:01:06.890> the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
so I needed to tighten it make the

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.860 
so I needed to tighten it make the
string<00:01:07.340> tighter<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:09.170> check<00:01:09.350> out<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:09.680> a<00:01:09.979> here

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.300 

same<00:01:14.870> thing

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
same thing

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.740 
same thing
let's<00:01:18.310> hear<00:01:18.550> that<00:01:18.580> again

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.400 

there<00:01:26.740> we<00:01:26.890> go<00:01:27.040> now<00:01:27.630> let's<00:01:28.630> just<00:01:28.840> say<00:01:29.020> we<00:01:29.170> go<00:01:29.350> to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
there we go now let's just say we go to

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.610 
there we go now let's just say we go to
this<00:01:29.650> D<00:01:33.660> let's<00:01:34.660> just<00:01:34.870> say<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.140> it's<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.350> little

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
this D let's just say that it's a little

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.779 
this D let's just say that it's a little
bit<00:01:35.740> sharp

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.020 

you<00:01:39.789> wanna<00:01:40.030> loosen<00:01:40.840> it

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.760 

but<00:01:45.030> here's<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.420> trick<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> loosen

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
but here's the trick you want to loosen

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.120 
but here's the trick you want to loosen
it<00:01:50.070> below<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.240> pitch<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.950> get

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it below the pitch so that when you get

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.399 
it below the pitch so that when you get
it<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.369> tune<00:01:53.610> you're<00:01:53.970> actually<00:01:54.509> tightening<00:01:55.259> it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
it in tune you're actually tightening it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.770 
it in tune you're actually tightening it
does<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.710> make<00:01:55.890> sense<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
does that make sense so if here is the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.440 
does that make sense so if here is the
pitch<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.020> we're<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.450> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
pitch that we're going for and it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.039 
pitch that we're going for and it
happens<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> be<00:02:01.020> sharp<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.539> over<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
happens to be sharp or we we go over it

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800 
happens to be sharp or we we go over it
we<00:02:04.200> overshoot<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.460> loosen<00:02:05.970> it<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.390> down

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
we overshoot it we loosen it back down

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.949 
we overshoot it we loosen it back down
and<00:02:07.170> then<00:02:07.229> bring<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.759> pitch<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.690> want

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and then bring it up to pitch you want

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.930 
and then bring it up to pitch you want
to<00:02:10.050> go<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.649> slow<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:11.790> not

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to go really slow with this you're not

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.150 
to go really slow with this you're not
cranking<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:12.810> all<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.530> way<00:02:13.680> around<00:02:14.010> you're

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
cranking this all the way around you're

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.559 
cranking this all the way around you're
not<00:02:14.190> cranking<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> tuning<00:02:14.880> pegs<00:02:15.030> all<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> way

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
not cranking the tuning pegs all the way

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.830 
not cranking the tuning pegs all the way
around<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:16.410> doing<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:16.860> slight<00:02:17.840> slight

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
around you're doing just slight slight

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.949 
around you're doing just slight slight
turns<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.430> constantly<00:02:21.000> check<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
turns and you constantly check it to

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.040 
turns and you constantly check it to
make<00:02:22.170> sure<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:23.580> you're<00:02:23.760> not<00:02:23.940> way<00:02:24.390> under<00:02:24.780> or

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
make sure that you're not way under or

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.040 
make sure that you're not way under or
way<00:02:25.230> over

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.950

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
he is just a little teeny tiny bit flat

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.860 
he is just a little teeny tiny bit flat
so<00:05:24.710> you<00:05:24.740> see<00:05:25.009> even<00:05:25.759> with<00:05:25.909> the<00:05:26.090> reference<00:05:26.539> tones

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
so you see even with the reference tones

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.890 
so you see even with the reference tones
and<00:05:27.349> Tooting<00:05:28.009> it<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.249> itself<00:05:28.669> we<00:05:29.509> did<00:05:29.659> a<00:05:29.719> pretty

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
and Tooting it to itself we did a pretty

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.499 
and Tooting it to itself we did a pretty
good<00:05:30.169> job<00:05:30.229> but<00:05:31.129> it's<00:05:31.310> always<00:05:31.610> nice<00:05:32.180> to<00:05:32.210> have

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
good job but it's always nice to have

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.739 
good job but it's always nice to have
something<00:05:32.569> to<00:05:32.930> say<00:05:33.400> yes<00:05:34.400> or<00:05:34.699> no<00:05:35.029> that<00:05:35.479> is

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:35.749 
something to say yes or no that is

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:41.480 
something to say yes or no that is
correct<00:05:35.990> or<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.099> is<00:05:37.189> not<00:05:37.460> correct

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.590 

sound<00:05:42.490> so<00:05:42.759> much<00:05:42.940> better<00:05:42.970> than<00:05:43.419> when<00:05:43.570> we

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
sound so much better than when we

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.970 
sound so much better than when we
started<00:05:44.169> right<00:05:44.380> I<00:05:44.650> hope<00:05:45.220> so

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.910
