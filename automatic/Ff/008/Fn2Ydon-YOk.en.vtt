00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
this is the water of the mother because

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470 
this is the water of the mother because
you<00:01:01.320> got<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> keep<00:01:02.070> track<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.460> both<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:03.180> I'm

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you got a keep track of both really I'm

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
you got a keep track of both really I'm
gonna<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> raise<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.320> water<00:01:04.500> level<00:01:04.650> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
gonna need to raise the water level like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.810 
gonna need to raise the water level like
an<00:01:05.729> inch<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:08.340> think<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
an inch or so because I don't think the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
an inch or so because I don't think the
babies<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.659> climb<00:01:09.960> those<00:01:10.170> steps<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
babies can really climb those steps to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
babies can really climb those steps to
good<00:01:10.830> I'll<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.159> how<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.430> do<00:01:11.510> maybe<00:01:12.510> they

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
good I'll see how they do maybe they

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
good I'll see how they do maybe they
just<00:01:12.960> need<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> last<00:01:14.130> step<00:01:14.520> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
just need to it up to the last step I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.920 
just need to it up to the last step I
don't<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.880> later<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.390> when

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
don't know but later when they when

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
don't know but later when they when
they're<00:01:19.080> over<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.430> transport

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
they're over there you know transport

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.640 
they're over there you know transport
shock<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> everything<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> fill<00:01:22.619> this

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
shock and everything I want to fill this

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
shock and everything I want to fill this
up<00:01:22.920> higher<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.390> those<00:01:24.540> floating

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
up higher and get one of those floating

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.530 
up higher and get one of those floating
docks<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.850> extra<00:01:27.330> room<00:01:27.509> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
docks so they can have extra room to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
docks so they can have extra room to
swim<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.890> got<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.310> fake<00:01:29.640> plants

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
swim in they got some little fake plants

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.520 
swim in they got some little fake plants
over<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.960> need<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.320> more

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
over there but I need to get more

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.399 
over there but I need to get more
decorations<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.400> guess<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:33.049> little<00:01:34.049> places

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
decorations I guess like little places

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.050 
decorations I guess like little places
for<00:01:34.560> them<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> hide<00:01:34.799> they<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.430> crawl<00:01:35.759> under

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
for them to hide they can crawl under

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.929 
for them to hide they can crawl under
this<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:37.200> dock<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.770> hide<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
this little dock and hide actually so

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
this little dock and hide actually so
that<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.810> probably<00:01:40.079> going<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.380> their

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that that's probably going to be their

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.660 
that that's probably going to be their
favorite<00:01:40.740> hiding<00:01:41.189> spot

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
favorite hiding spot

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.569 
favorite hiding spot
and<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.509> course<00:01:43.040> again<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.159> are<00:01:44.369> little

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
and of course again these are little

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580 
and of course again these are little
babies<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.299> I'm<00:01:45.420> gonna<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> bigger

rep Tooman turtle food and this is the
tub<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.350> gonna<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.680> feeding<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.189> in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
tub that I'm gonna be feeding them in

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.649 
tub that I'm gonna be feeding them in
because<00:01:59.490> I'm<00:01:59.579> gonna<00:01:59.670> feed<00:01:59.909> them<00:02:00.000> separately

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
because I'm gonna feed them separately

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.920 
because I'm gonna feed them separately
I'm<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.829> feed<00:02:02.040> them<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.310> their<00:02:02.430> tank

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
I'm not gonna feed them in their tank

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.870 
I'm not gonna feed them in their tank
apparently<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.229> poop<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.399> same<00:02:05.610> time

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
apparently they poop at the same time

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.180 
apparently they poop at the same time
that<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.180> eat<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.930> eating<00:02:07.469> time<00:02:07.829> gets

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that they eat so eating time gets

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.820 
that they eat so eating time gets
extremely<00:02:08.789> gross<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.479> messy<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.649> feed

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
extremely gross and messy so if you feed

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.650 
extremely gross and messy so if you feed
them<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.160> separate<00:02:11.489> tub<00:02:11.810> you'll<00:02:12.810> save<00:02:13.230> your

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
them in a separate tub you'll save your

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.320 
them in a separate tub you'll save your
most<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.140> mess<00:02:14.550> right<00:02:15.550> now<00:02:15.790> I'm<00:02:16.030> waiting

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
most of the mess right now I'm waiting

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.580 
most of the mess right now I'm waiting
on<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.960> water<00:02:17.320> heater<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:19.030> filter<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.470> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
on a water heater and a filter for the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.240 
on a water heater and a filter for the
tank<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:22.290> again<00:02:23.290> eventually<00:02:23.860> I'll<00:02:23.980> get<00:02:24.100> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
tank and again eventually I'll get the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.110 
tank and again eventually I'll get the
floating<00:02:24.610> dock<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:26.580> for<00:02:27.580> now<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.940> guess

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
floating dock so for now and I guess

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.670
