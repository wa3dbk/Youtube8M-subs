00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.859
 twice and their 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.820
 I'm glad you are arguing 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.249
 good 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.179
 were good bad weather 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.089
 the project was planned 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.390
 all players 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.980
 great dedication 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 but not everything worked yielded 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.450
 he was in my opinion very high quality 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.310
 enough 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.310
 with the exception of 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 this is not a solution to the implementation on 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.990
 sold much to be desired 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.990
 46 years 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 gave up the initiative 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.290
 we gave up the initiative 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.850
 Sergey unpleasant moments she was 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.310
 injury don't scream like feeling in yourself 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.960
 this is a very unpleasant moment 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.410
 German Yushchenko dropped out 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.410
 for how long is difficult to say 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 Maccabi players 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.420
 Today 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.450
 for the match spent 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.579
 at the gate of the team Alexander Shovkovsky 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.960
 in the second half, respectively 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.399
 Nesmachny Andrew 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.399
 what caused such a choice 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.500
 I think it does not need to emphasize 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.340
 owned 1 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.340
 due to this 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.870
 big games spent 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.069
 more 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.069
 there is the most experienced 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:21.959
 nothing in our village 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.959
 against the most important 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 defining a group 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.159
 closer 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.159
 auction has become 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.179
 very good 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.179
 and the translation of the thermometer is right 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.689
 I think vermalen 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.679
 issuance of certificates 6 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.679
 on the right side played 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.799
 Messi plays on the right side 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.729
 that's how it would turn out anyway 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.639
 in the first half with a in the most interesting 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.829
 match 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.089
 but 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:22.259
 in defense 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.069
 you had some problems with that and 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.329
 has become 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.329
 on the problems of struggle because 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.749
 in maccabi 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.589
 characteristic rival second they are more 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.399
 tormented by the clinical condition 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.599
 loves champions rank 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.599
 but we understood the moment 2 more 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.489
 we have to draw 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.479
 almost long ago 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:56.949
 but quite possible 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.349
 Turkey plays 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.149
 60 years
