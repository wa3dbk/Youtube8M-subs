to to be the mascot there's a couple

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.460 
to to be the mascot there's a couple
things<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.330> do<00:00:51.540> but<00:00:51.690> Ludovic

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
things that I think they do but Ludovic

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.649 
things that I think they do but Ludovic
would<00:00:52.680> change<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.519> doesn't<00:00:54.330> really<00:00:54.449> do

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
would change like doesn't really do

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.390 
would change like doesn't really do
anything<00:00:54.900> she<00:00:55.229> is<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.040> could<00:00:56.220> do

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
anything she is I think you could do

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.119 
anything she is I think you could do
some<00:00:56.670> cheers<00:00:57.600> terribly<00:00:58.290> right<00:00:58.680> next<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.040> her

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
some cheers terribly right next to her

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.649 
some cheers terribly right next to her
behind<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> cheerleaders<00:01:00.150> I<00:01:00.330> think<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
behind the cheerleaders I think that

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.719 
behind the cheerleaders I think that
would<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.839> pretty<00:01:01.019> funny<00:01:01.400> we<00:01:02.400> have<00:01:02.550> one

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
would be pretty funny we have one

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.340 
would be pretty funny we have one
returning<00:01:03.150> this<00:01:03.300> year<00:01:03.479> so<00:01:03.720> we<00:01:03.839> do<00:01:03.989> usually

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
returning this year so we do usually

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.930 
returning this year so we do usually
like<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.650> hold<00:01:04.830> three<00:01:05.100> or<00:01:05.220> four<00:01:05.430> positions

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
like to hold three or four positions

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.660 
like to hold three or four positions
typically<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.740> have<00:01:08.520> them

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
typically for because we do have them

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.640 
typically for because we do have them
travel<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.150> us<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.870> who's<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> decider

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
travel with us is the who's the decider

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
travel with us is the who's the decider

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
in terms of the guys trying out who

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.670 
in terms of the guys trying out who
makes<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.080> those<00:01:13.200> decisions<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:16.409> want

them to be just like you that's less

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.810 
them to be just like you that's less
