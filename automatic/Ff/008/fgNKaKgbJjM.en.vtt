 he is our friend to villarroya us 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.540
 asks the next question is 28 years old 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.580
 and after so much time training 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.710
 Well, it says it's time to 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.250
 take it seriously, I encourage you, Pablo 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.950
 butt 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.880
 what happens in my problem in doubt is 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.890
 that I have insomnia for years and 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.040
 sometimes clear it does not allow you to sleep 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.690
 well I would like you to explain me from 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.980
 the biological point of view that supposes 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:53.809
 sleep some remedy to avoid the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:54.920
 pablo good result does well 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.290
 I need to explain it in a way 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.720
 ideological what does not sleep 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.450
 because rest is paramount in the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.149
 human being is worth but above all in the 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.840
 case of us athletes that when 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.850
 we train we put on an exhibition of 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.399
 anaerobic routine lifting weights 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.140
 the first thing that is expressed in our 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.909
 nervous system our system 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.100
 nervous is the one who works hard 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.719
 the one who makes the healer lift 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.969
 the impulse that sends the force 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.069
 then the nervous system in the 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.590
 moments that rest most in the day that 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.150
 when it's when we sleep, it's worth 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.620
 recommendation is the following 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.650
 take a product derived from casein my 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.720
 loom for before bedtime just before 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.080
 of sleeping to avoid catabolism 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.450
 nightly and recover more effectively 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.600
 and to sleep I advise you these mixtures 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.720
 take a supplement that contains 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.320
 melatonin with tryptophan fasting is worth 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.070
 20 minutes before caffeine and we 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 you will tell how you are going 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.980
 if not
