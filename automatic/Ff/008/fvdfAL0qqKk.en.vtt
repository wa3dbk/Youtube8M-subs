00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.060
 good the one that we are with roberto and with 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.420
 Caesar who were the ones who organized 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 expo drone and see how Roberto like 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.540
 How is this idea coming up? 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.840
 idea arises I think it was trial and error 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.900
 it was a year and a half ago that we created the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.449
 group of drones mexico for a need 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.010
 mine to find more people who would 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.390
 I would like this not that I did not know how to put it 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.820
 how to assemble my multi rotor that had 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.199
 bought and I did not know how and you see 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.420
 tutorials and all that I said I will come 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.850
 a group to see who else knows and so with 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.980
 the surprise that I opened it and found 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 thousands of people who love what 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.790
 same as me more or less how many 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 followers do you have on facebook and what is 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.170
 your faith then we have in the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.969
 facebook in the drones group mexico 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.219
 from facebook we have about 8000 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.800
 people already a year and a half a year eight 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.949
 months or so since it opened 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 eight thousand people eight thousand people and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.980
 How many drones do I have? 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.120
 I got to have 5 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.830
 Well, I decided to dedicate myself to 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.050
 what I liked that the picture then 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.880
 I bought one or two I think I have there and 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.240
 with that's what I'm doing has not 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 seen more 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.480
 reason this is also to start 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.890
 organize this event also dedicate a 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.440
 little bit more to the organization and even now 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.020
 the community beyond flying 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.780
 and well, you, Caesar, tell us what is it 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.310
 who called you from the drones the truth is 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.450
 that what is very father is that it is a 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.650
 industry that is growing very much 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.410
 in the last year at this price the 300 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.870
 percent more or less then let's say 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.440
 which is an industry is growing 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:55.040
 much today and that does have a lot of potential 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.570
 then it will investigate and bring the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.910
 different actors in the industry to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.150
 participate in this new ecosystem that 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.470
 is creating drones 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.110
 whom to invite representatives of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.790
 the entire republic actually came to us 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.920
 people even from guatemala 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.560
 of the interior paul karting or people from 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.370
 veracruz de aguascalientes low 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.859
 california and we invite those who are 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.819
 as most recognized within the 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.870
 industry 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.310
 like those of trini robotics that we have 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.420
 conferences with them our 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.459
 workshops are also super 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.670
 recognized then all the intention 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.950
 was that having people who were well 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.470
 positioned within the sector so that 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.319
 so we could offer something 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.970
 attractive to people and this and when it was 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.980
 when you queue up your first robert drone 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.230
 well, my first drone and colo colo 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.419
 three years exactly but my first 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.280
 wolf plane made him 15 years or so 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.200
 he had flown remote-controlled aircraft 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.120
 before flying drones that is like the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.470
 same logic a little bit more 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.730
 systematized but in the same 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.290
 the transition was not easy 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.090
 and I have no knowledge of anything 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.220
 drivers in the mathematical part and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.450
 all that but flying from from 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.700
 chavito 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.430
 and great versatility of the drones 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.959
 are being used for doctors look 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.620
 that there are many uses from architecture 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.750
 cartography there are even in some in 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 Peru uses them for example for security 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.569
 so they avoid looting in areas like 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.000
 that are not as well explored or that 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.280
 They have very easy access use them 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.650
 to keep track of the some 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280
 as archaeological zones 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.380
 then from this from security 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.030
 archeology cartography 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.930
 entertainment of course all that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.930
 it helps to somehow have a 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.790
 so great versatility all then 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.010
 we will be seeing more of the drones in 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.890
 Mexico 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.879
 to see much more this is the principle go 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.379
 to see that we are going to have more things 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.420
 great because this is the first 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.170
 exhibition if it's the first one I say in 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.909
 the next we plan I will have brands 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.700
 that Mexico still does not know how to bring the other 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.230
 and this is the first as a witness for 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.389
 see that this is a real project 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.789
 that has a lot of where to give us 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.530
 then next year or in the 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.020
 next six months and this month not 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.449
 we still know this you are going to see 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.340
 news shows and this and about the 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.979
 regulations not because there is not yet 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.310
 regulations in Mexico of how to fly the 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.470
 drones what is your point of view 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.030
 well look at everything except ask that in the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.380
 part of regulation but effectively 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.180
 there is no regulation in mexico although 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.010
 is not so strict and there is , as a 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.110
 circular says you do not go near 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.820
 airports does not go beyond space or 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.190
 is the limit is to know or allowed 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.419
 which is approximately 150 meters but 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.100
 beyond that there is no law that you 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.530
 prohibit not then is what is us 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.330
 helping it grow but if 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.580
 we need to have a regulation 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.110
 we are in a regulation that benefits 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.580
 to the whole industry either those that 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.300
 we do these events 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.129
 on equipment to which they film etc is not a 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.610
 win-win that we hope in Mexico will 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.800
 give in a good way and I think we are not 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.750
 very involved in that part as of 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.939
 policy but I hope someday we 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.460
 we can approach that good part and in 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.199
 social networks on twitter 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.449
 what are your twitter what is your 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.719
 facebook I do not know they are not in expo 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.449
 drone on twitter expo drone punto mx en 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:32.270
 the web expo drone on facebook and drones 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.240
 mexico on facebook as a group ok 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.699
 there is another group of drones mexico twitter 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.319
 it's also not ok 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.319
 well thank you very much thank you
