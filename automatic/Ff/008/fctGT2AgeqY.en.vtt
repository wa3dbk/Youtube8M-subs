empty<00:03:24.720> case<00:03:25.199> that<00:03:25.409> that's<00:03:25.650> what<00:03:25.829> me<00:03:26.009> um<00:03:27.319> let's

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
empty case that that's what me um let's

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.020 
empty case that that's what me um let's
see<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.859> it's<00:03:29.099> taken<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.489> while<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.669> load
