00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
pretty unreal I don't think there's a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.800 
pretty unreal I don't think there's a
handful<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.910> people<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> entire<00:03:02.750> world

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
handful of people in the entire world

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.720 
handful of people in the entire world
that<00:03:03.320> have<00:03:03.440> been<00:03:03.590> able<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.800> do<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.070> so<00:03:04.310> it's

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
that have been able to do that so it's

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.560 
that have been able to do that so it's
very<00:03:04.910> exciting

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
very exciting

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.840 
very exciting
you<00:03:05.720> just<00:03:05.930> gave<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> ticket<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.520> outer<00:03:07.700> space

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
you just gave a ticket to outer space

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.670 
you just gave a ticket to outer space
away<00:03:08.480> that's<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:09.020> think<00:03:09.140> that's<00:03:09.380> pretty

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
away that's I think that's pretty

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.980 
away that's I think that's pretty
unprecedented<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:11.480> seems<00:03:11.660> like<00:03:11.810> it's

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
unprecedented so it seems like it's

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.300 
unprecedented so it seems like it's
right<00:03:12.410> around<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.650> corner<00:03:12.710> that<00:03:12.980> we'll<00:03:13.190> all

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
right around the corner that we'll all

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.640 
right around the corner that we'll all
be<00:03:13.340> able<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:14.390> know<00:03:14.420> honeymoon<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.350> space

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
be able to you know honeymoon in space

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.290 
be able to you know honeymoon in space
or<00:03:15.890> something<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.430> don't<00:03:16.580> think<00:03:16.730> it's<00:03:16.940> set<00:03:17.090> in<00:03:17.210> I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.650 
or something I don't think it's set in I
think<00:03:17.360> I'm<00:03:17.600> still<00:03:17.810> in<00:03:17.930> shock<00:03:18.970> but<00:03:19.970> I'm<00:03:20.390> very

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
think I'm still in shock but I'm very

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.140 
think I'm still in shock but I'm very
