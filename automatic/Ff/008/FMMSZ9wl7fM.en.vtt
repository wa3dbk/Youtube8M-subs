00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.010
 Hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.650
 I'm always a squirrel not today I decided 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.010
 tell you about the loss of the luminous 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.919
 one of the most famous and famous 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.919
 characters of world of warcraft so 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.109
 let's start after the first war 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.789
 the archbishop file which at the time 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.850
 headed the church 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.329
 was shocked by that strength and fear 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.789
 which carried arches with it was clear that 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.520
 unusual vest with unusual knights 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.789
 failed to put up against such pressure 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.000
 would 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.309
 and the archbishop dawned on what was best 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.640
 unite the priests and the knights into one 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.410
 class paladin capable of how to shred 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.160
 enemies with a sword and ax and 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.949
 use the power of the holy light of the essence of the frames 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.289
 the archbishop was familiar for a long time he was always 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.230
 was a follower of the church is not true 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.390
 supporter of holy light therefore him 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.020
 one of the first to become 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.450
 paladin however the war was supposed to be 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.960
 very cruel my army commander 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.930
 Alliance Andwin Lotar considered uter too 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 so pious and therefore not quite ready for 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.729
 new war with the orcs 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.130
 Lothar understood by the answers of this young 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.549
 man that for light wedge 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.710
 converged on faith and he had no doubt that 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.310
 uther can be a powerful force on the field 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.020
 battle but something in this knight and vorbei 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.380
 didn't bother him 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.759
 he suspected that the shooting gallery was too 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.979
 Concentrated honor and faith to 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.880
 use less noble methods 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.079
 for success himself lotar learned by 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.229
 bitter experience 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:56.140
 dealing with the orcs that 1 was clean 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.210
 not enough to survive against the horde 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.079
 they had to use each 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.119
 come across arm he also 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.250
 I understand that the loss does not have to like 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.600
 soldiers for the same reason 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.190
 therefore the most correct decision was made 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.870
 I thought he would give a lot of reasons 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.140
 to take command 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.910
 calmly supposedly their hangar he does not want 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430
 said tourlion 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.100
 yes he wants to lead but only as 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.550
 a role model is better for him 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.850
 to command the order of the silver dan 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.310
 the canopy paladins are the same however 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.100
 on all the fears of lotar on the battlefield 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.440
 mutter proved extremely effective 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.080
 especially only paladins and could 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.950
 deal with warlock not knight 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.860
 the death of the orcs soon behind them seemed 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.340
 wiped whose huge hammer pounded the orcs 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.340
 right and left a bright glow surrounded 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.930
 he was not his weapon that made the orcs 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.640
 turn away protects eyes from color 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.890
 just after the second war at the shooting range 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.560
 nicknamed luminous in honor of the saint 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.950
 the light brought by him on this day 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.530
 the battlefield and after the war the buter helped 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.010
 treat people and also he became a mentor 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.820
 young prince arthas who also must 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.650
 was soon to become a paladin 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.860
 however grown arthas as you know 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.470
 got out of the body of the paladin had an effect on him 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.240
 muzzle battle 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.540
 when uther arrived to help the young prince 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.360
 it was already quite late deaths 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.950
 too much 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.140
 devastated exhausted arthas decided 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.570
 go to the stud hill to kill 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.360
 Malganis and the culprit in all 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.080
 misadventures but the city was already infected 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.290
 plague 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.530
 Arthas was not ordered at ters polish city 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.600
 to which he said there must be some 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.500
 another way is not spoiled for you 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.420
 the harvest is a city where is full of living people 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.840
 as you understand, after these words, the road 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.150
 prince and uter parted artas crossed 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.300
 to the side of the lich king and killed his 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.390
 father of terenas he was ceremonial 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.200
 cremated and his ashes closed magic 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.220
 level uter volunteered to personally protect the urn 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.430
 Wanda Rally 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.640
 and artas and his undead raided 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.430
 this city is in search of an urn for them 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.680
 romantic goals 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.289
 there was a battle between the paladin and 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 a knight whose outcome I think you are and so 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:34.410
 know where there is light there is a shadow there 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.860
 gs day there is night and even the brightest 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.430
 Candle can be extinguished as the lightest 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.850
 life life wiped cut short by hand and 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.759
 god of the disciple he lowered the runeblade 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.580
 straight down through the throat to force 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.630
 his recalcitrant voice is silent forever 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.330
 right in his big heart Putin died on 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.120
