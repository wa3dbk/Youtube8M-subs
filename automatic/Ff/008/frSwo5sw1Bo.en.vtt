00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.489
 see my respects my respects many 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.320
 thank you not to you it's good let's do 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.120
 an almond milk how to make 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.309
 Milk month is very easy to do 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.690
 Sometimes I will tell how it is done 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.210
 easier that you have to do that is very 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.219
 face and it is very expensive the liter is at 40 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.949
 people then let's do it 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.229
 us for about 8 pesos 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.210
 used the central supply the kilo 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.920
 of almonds of between 80 and 90 pesos 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.670
 we are not using like 100 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.440
 grams and let's see nothing more water 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.190
 algae aja we are going to put water 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.850
 to cover approximately five 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.860
 centimeters ok and the joke of this from 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.619
 to make an almond milk is to leave it 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.409
 rest let it rest and let the 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.770
 almond is completely hydrated if 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.810
 they have 2 to 3 days is much better 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.909
 listen to me well it's much better I 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.399
 I have them for two days and see the 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.920
 difference of an almond is fine not 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.530
 let's find out how big it is 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.780
 moisturizes big make much bigger is 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.850
 exactly aguaditas aguaditas is such 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.800
 they are totally hydrated from it 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.229
 are watching the then 23 days of 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.119
 size is totally different while 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.220
 that as these grew one or the other is not 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.470
 ok well we already made our first step 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.030
 we do not have to complain, I do not complain 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.880
 I let go about 12 hours 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.369
 I need a blender a blender 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.020
 I rinse them perfectly is very 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.750
 important I have four cups of water 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.050
 hot that did not boil is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.720
 every hotter no more real and well I'll 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:20.380
 to leave tantito for a pinch of salt very 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.750
 little bit and to sweeten I'll go 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.700
 to put agave honey agave honey 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.959
 has as one of its properties that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.270
 diabetics can consume it eye is 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.090
 very important that you ask yourself first 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.300
 his endocrinologist clear the favor did not say 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.860
 is that manny said yes yes no not doing 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.530
 I create new ones that recommend it already 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.930
 better those that do not put them in a process 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.870
 let's liquefy 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:56.190
 let's connect it we see it instantaneous 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.190
 and connected this way now 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.510
 I'm watching it 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.760
 we need it to be perfectly fine 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.760
 same 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.230
 good for memory 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.170
 5 tickets per day are very good countries 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.170
 like blood 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.590
 and the almond milk can not use 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.590
 for anything there is 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.810
 when we have 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.190
 because many people had asked me 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.050
 many 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.590
 and what you have 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.590
 yes 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.480
 very good unit 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.050
 like milk like milk let's see 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.560
 and there it is there is 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.440
 and now I have a strainer a strainer or a 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.190
 Sky blanket with very little eyes 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.190
 little ones 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.729
 and there is the milk of our milk 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.979
 menu that rick are fixed is up this 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.740
 appointment does not have so so our so 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.729
 liquid like water and here I come back 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.729
 a spatula is worth 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:54.210
 because those little granites that do not 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.670
 discards but well nothing else as is 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.000
 here everything solid is a solid not the 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.290
 I'm going to throw them, I'm going to press 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.550
 perfectly but that is I wanted to be 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.590
 because like the stadium saying as 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.390
 Maybe I did not give me many people you have 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.000
 asked for this milk because this for the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.620
 people who are good rich have 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.530
 lactose intolerance can 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.690
 perfectly consume me consumption 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.820
 very much for example in the morning in a 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.980
 serial I like it a lot and I was 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.530
 buying the stadium buying and the 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.650
 truth is very expensive very expensive 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.380
 it is very expensive as expensive this is a 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.990
 peanut type is a mannequin is a help to 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.690
 the people so that people make it clear 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.870
 which is come, it's the people who do not 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.990
 take any derivative or even milk 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.810
 no dairy to these people well in 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.880
 many bakeries there are for drinks for 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.890
 they user reads this paper in the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.810
 store that you pass me by one of the 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.050
 spatulas talks already hard of consistency 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.160
 hard not sure rapper maybe this one 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.130
 I could 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.160
 this camera and what I'll do I'll 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.650
 press, let's push to get out 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.840
 more milk exactly because it's the best 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.840
 way there is 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.880
 see as if it's a lot of almonds 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.919
 man and when the water has to do 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.270
 be hot and then let her in 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.250
 and already the mete 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.100
 currently it is going very well but it is very 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.919
 important to look at all these solids 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.620
 press them perfectly because 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:28.210
 there still has a neighbor now 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.850
 you see that your milk is a little 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.040
 Thickness can be diluted with water not 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.070
 go to pour milk please not 0 lecce 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.870
 0 we are making a very milk 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.210
 nutritious as is almond milk 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:44.039
 that we are doing very basic things 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.039
 for the house for us to have it 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.610
 a sadness but with this the best 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.710
 we could do something because I do not invent 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.660
 me something and then saying something some 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.270
 pancakes something to do I would like the 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.199
 We will try to see maniglia fabrics son and 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.199
 try it please 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.760
 and already has the consistency of milk 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.030
 I'm in credit at hand we're going to 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.030
 try out 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.400
 but good very good very good 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:20.270
 perfect 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.270
 to try it cristian it's worth it 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:31.710
 a cup was a war of almonds a 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:34.710
 cup of almonds and what we did can 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.020
 adapt the with five centimeters more than 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.490
 water and liquefy it, add honey 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.919
 agave a pinch of salt when 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.690
 flavors and here we are starting to look 

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:45.210
 how to start waiting immediately 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.669
 and the only thing I do to lighten up is 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.830
 add water remember how well 40 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:52.620
 pesos to 8 pesos is quite the 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.150
 difference and it's a very healthy milk over 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.840
 everything for the people when we premiere a 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.250
 serial instead of using a dairy 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.440
 we can replace it with this edition 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.570
 which gives the recipe if you want more 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.669
