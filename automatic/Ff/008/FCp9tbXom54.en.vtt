00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.689
 hi my name is kimbo and today in this 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:09.820
 video I want to talk about something that already 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.309
 introduce yesterday in the previous video 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.400
 we were talking about the secret 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.000
 number one to have a coffee shop 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.130
 success and I establishing that it is the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.190
 cappuccino well done the cream of the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.550
 well-excited milk makes your 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.460
 customers are really going to come for this 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.339
 star drink that you have in your business 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.339
 but there is a why there is a fact of 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:39.190
 making a well-made cappuccino coffee is 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.129
 a double- row weapon that I want to say 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.820
 with this when you have a product 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.850
 which is not in condition means 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.659
 when you have a coffee that is a coffee or 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.589
 badly badly selected badly roasted or badly 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:59.140
 ground or badly extracted the fact 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.899
 make a cappuccino or a cream well 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.129
 done on top of this express is not going to 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.720
 save the life 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.560
 yes, very few people 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.380
 really recognize the difference between 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 a cappuccino made with a little coffee 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.400
 good more or less or a cappuccino with a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.970
 coffee very well done because of that is a risk 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.870
 to make a good cappuccino when you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.510
 coffee itself is not in a condition for a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.810
 yes, it is true that very few people 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.110
 will recognize or will have the palate 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.440
 so refined so that between milk and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 the sugar can notice the taste of coffee 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.930
 but there will be people who will drink their coffee alone 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.430
 also then they will be given 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.070
 realize that coffee is not only worth it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.470
 that the cappuccino is trying to create 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.290
 that's why yesterday I told you that I was 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.680
 working in a site in Antwerp where 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.030
 they had a very very very good product was 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.550
 something very different because it was a coffee 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.709
 special and it was a well- made coffee and in 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.750
 a place or a place like antwerp 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.200
 where they were not used to either 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.690
 drink 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.129
 the types of express then what 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.370
 occurred 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.010
 when he wanted to sell his coffee only the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.440
 most people did not accept it 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.720
 because it was a different flavor to 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.450
 what they were used to but when 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.630
 he started serving this coffee in 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.440
 cappuccinos and in combinations like 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.080
 with coffee if he had a lot of success 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.180
 then in this way he has got 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.330
 that people who start drinking and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.240
 appreciate these well-made Chinese fields 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.640
 begins little by little to take coffees with 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.610
 less milk for example they started to 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.590
 try a cut a macchiato and then 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.380
 they started to taste the coffees alone 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.170
 then in this way you can get 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.170
 If you have a good product only 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.850
 that the people who come to take 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.450
 cappuccinos well done little by little 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.390
 start to meet other of your coffees and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.570
 little by little he starts to leave the milk for 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.230
 what it is and start drinking more coffee 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.590
 solos or filtered coffees that's why I wanted 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.970
 had warned him to use this one 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.370
 double row weapon is the technique of 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.550
 make the milk well the emotion well 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.240
 it's pretty dangerous if you use it 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.400
 to cover the defects that the 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.730
 coffee that is serving because of that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.160
 please those who watch this video and try 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.240
 use this technique to 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.330
 good and really try to create a 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.150
 drink one with cappuccino but based on 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.870
 a super good coffee and it will turn out to be 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.280
 super sweet or super nice that's why you 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.709
 I wanted to make this clear 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.010
