 Serious thing in Brazil. 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.129
 We visited a breeding ground 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.730
 pleasant in the interior of são paulo seu 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.199

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 everything is legalized here 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.039
 the first birds reached 25 years

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.090
 continuing later on is 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.159
 expand this business that I liked in 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 your carlos 's kitchen is done all 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.229
 process of reproduction of the bird as 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.570
 that the puppies are born receive a 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.700
 shackle like this is the way to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.720
 certify the legal creation 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.610
 the scientific name oryzoborus 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.930
 maximiliani originates from the Americas 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.210
 south and central 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.540
 this step is the owner of one of the most beautiful 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 corners and training starts early in the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 breeding period the puppy from the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.149
 of the eighth day is in the nursery along with 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.399
 the mother 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.340
 and in this place he will learn to sing 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.340
 with the help of a recording like this 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.950
 and he just listen to a cd from a corner 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.590
 standardized with the defined notes that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.590

 practice the teaching of this field beyond 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.880
 of pleasure his carlos saw in the creation 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.130
 of birds a source of income 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.920
 alternative search is very large no 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.590
 Only in Brazil, I repeat, not only in the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.989
 Brazil to the West in America 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.959
 central north america in europe 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.150
 there is a market for the Brazilian fauna 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.549
 wild yes sir is a fountain 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.519
 family alternative even the 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.570
 commercial works as a company everything 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.250
 is documented all the steps will be 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.730
 marketed through this note 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 where taxes are paid and taxes are 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.890
 usually the creators sometimes some 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.570
 their activity beyond the date of the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.989
 their owners also with 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.280
 employees and this generates up to 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.709
 out there 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.470

 over 30 years if well cared for 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.239
 the beauty of the little brother's song made him a 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.390
 bird treasured by breeders and lovers 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.079
 of birds in general uriona Tupi language 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.600

 serves is undoubtedly rodrigo he is 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.410
 considered a friend of the man because 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.290
 the antiquity 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.660
 in the regions where the curious lived 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.120
 close to indigenous tribes 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.690
 there was a close proximity to the 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.360
 Indians 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.940
 so today they come to admire and it is 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.180
 considered as a friend and today if this 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.489
 also translates into days 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.109
 today because of the proximity we have and 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.229
 the appreciation we mean by 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.780
 these spaces with the establishment of 50 birds 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.169
 Sergio tells how the creation began 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.310
 started a little goldfinch and was 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:30.440
 I was getting a taste for the hobby. 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.030
 given to create a bird and then 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.750
 passing the time we arrived at 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.970
 grubby 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.160
 then when he arrived with scarf and was the 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.759
 of the hobby really there that the 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.250
 We arrived at the highest stage of 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.470
 creation is from pithy sun beard 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.990
 which will determine the value of the bird 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.370
 is the genetic lineage and quality of 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.550
 corner 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.460
 There are those who say that there are in brazil more 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 100 types of different corners of the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.919
 curió this creator specialist in singing 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.919
 highlights the type a on days 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.930
 the anadia is a bird that when 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.660
 caught in the wild 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:16.159
 He has a very beautiful field. 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:21.080
 those in love with singing decided to have 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:23.150
 he as the base of the chirpy's song 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.360
 the passion is so great that he can 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.889
 describe the song twitter bird until 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:35.210
 fifth 8 and ceiling act quintet witeck 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:38.060
 quinton and current ceiling is considered a 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:42.070
 Perfect Perfect Classical Perfect Corner 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.560
 which is what everyone looks for in the curious 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.840
 the legal creation of these animals is 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.130
 that a hobby gives an alternative income 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:56.389
 and that it would help and contribute 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:58.009
 immensely in eliminating trafficking and 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.500
 trafficking in wild animals 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.539
 certainly through the creation today is 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.099
 very well preserved 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.110
 there is no need today there and 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.690
 seek out there commercial creators 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.180
 that you can today, you can search 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.210
 with these creators today we already have the 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.090
 for example, if it is not 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.550
 was the creation and domestic environment 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.370
 sure would be an extinct category already 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.100
 today environmental laws are strict 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.010
 capturing birds from nature is that 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.690
 and to maintain a breeding ground it is necessary 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.250
 follow several rules 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.470
 the person who wants to be regularized as 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.810
 creator it should first of all be 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.790
 register with ibama as such 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.310
 so from the time she filled in 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.980
 her registration she goes until the ibama takes 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.630
 all its documentation and from there it 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.850
 have to train your squad 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.460
 he buys his animals from another 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.690
 creator and he maintains his 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.460
 updated list 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.160
 the number of bird seizures 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.000
 created irregularly is great throughout 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.000
 the country 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.500
 the police do inspections 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.770
 often the most common offenses 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.080
 exactly when the person removes the 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.260
 animal that is loose in nature 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.220
 this animal should not be 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.730
 imprisoned and she tries to 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.740
 way to violate washer that irregularly 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.560
 would be some step created in captivity 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.690
 then in these cases the person responds by 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.260
 environmental crime and also for infringement 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:28.700
 environmental value can be valued 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:33.590
 beauty joy the fine Color 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:37.160
 perfection of the songs preserve the 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:39.550
 native birds is a must at all times. 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.550
 Brazilian 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.980
 really people that matter on 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.310
 wild and very beautiful birds and 

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:55.000
 that curió as kan has that curio is 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:57.160
 an artist he owes to the concern of the 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.880
 man in relation to the preservation of 

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.980
 species 

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.610
 really relevant to what we have 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:06.340
 many endangered species carry and 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.950
 preserve nature because it is the 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.980
 natural habit of taking our steps to 

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.790
 that they can say freely 

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.790
 that's it
