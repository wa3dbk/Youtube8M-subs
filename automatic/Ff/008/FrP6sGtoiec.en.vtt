00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.879 
the store I would have bought that but
as<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.239> isn't<00:02:10.539> unboxing<00:02:11.019> for<00:02:11.109> the<00:02:11.170> 5g<00:02:11.709> I'm

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:11.889 
as this isn't unboxing for the 5g I'm

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.070 
as this isn't unboxing for the 5g I'm
sure<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:13.239> will<00:02:13.689> probably

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
sure this will probably

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.720 
sure this will probably
get<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> little<00:02:14.680> bit<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.830> attention<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.310> isn't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
website it's a lot more of a faded blue

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.020 
website it's a lot more of a faded blue
I<00:02:34.410> actually<00:02:35.410> was<00:02:35.800> about<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.190> buy<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> V<00:02:36.610> purple

I actually was about to buy a V purple
for<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.690> reason<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.650> colors<00:02:38.920> on<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
for the reason that the colors on the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.650 
for the reason that the colors on the
Apple<00:02:39.400> side<00:02:39.550> are<00:02:39.670> just<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.030> far<00:02:40.210> off<00:02:40.450> it's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
Apple side are just so far off it's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.900
