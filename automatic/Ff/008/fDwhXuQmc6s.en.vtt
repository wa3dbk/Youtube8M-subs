00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
all right so this is the club fairly

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.270 
all right so this is the club fairly
straightforward<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.830> clip<00:00:08.099> we're

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
straightforward and this clip we're

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.310 
straightforward and this clip we're
gonna<00:00:08.370> be<00:00:08.519> drawing<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.179> cousin<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.019> club

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
gonna be drawing a cousin of the club

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.499 
gonna be drawing a cousin of the club
but<00:00:10.740> one's<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.160> little<00:00:11.400> bit<00:00:11.700> more<00:00:11.730> dangerous

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
but one's a little bit more dangerous

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.240 
but one's a little bit more dangerous
and<00:00:12.900> deadly<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.259> would<00:00:13.559> say<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.920> takes<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.160> little

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
and deadly I would say it takes a little

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.860 
and deadly I would say it takes a little
bit<00:00:14.370> more<00:00:14.429> skill<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.849> use<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.389> called<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
bit more skill to use it's called the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.170 
bit more skill to use it's called the
flail<00:00:16.289> not<00:00:17.250> sure<00:00:17.490> what<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.789> you're<00:00:18.090> gonna

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
flail not sure what it is you're gonna

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.490 
flail not sure what it is you're gonna
find<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.600> we're<00:00:18.750> gonna<00:00:18.810> come<00:00:19.020> down<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
find out we're gonna come down here and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.620 
find out we're gonna come down here and
draw<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.770> right<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.250> corner<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.880 

flail<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:25.789> name<00:00:26.900> actually<00:00:27.900> makes<00:00:28.140> quite<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.619> bit

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
flail a name actually makes quite a bit

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.659 
flail a name actually makes quite a bit
of<00:00:29.010> sense<00:00:29.310> once<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.730> see<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.330> final<00:00:30.570> product

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
of sense once you see the final product

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.600 
of sense once you see the final product
might<00:00:32.669> be<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.820> little<00:00:33.180> bit<00:00:34.370> confusing<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.579> first

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
might be a little bit confusing at first

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
might be a little bit confusing at first
but<00:00:36.239> believe<00:00:36.600> me<00:00:36.630> once<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
but believe me once you see what it is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
but believe me once you see what it is
we're<00:00:38.489> drawing<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.960> understand

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
we're drawing here you'll understand

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.979 
we're drawing here you'll understand
completely<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.910> first<00:00:42.120> you're<00:00:42.270> gonna<00:00:42.360> draw<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
completely so first you're gonna draw a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
completely so first you're gonna draw a
little<00:00:43.890> staff<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.270> bit<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.539> loop

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
little staff with a little bit of a loop

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.459 
little staff with a little bit of a loop
at<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.899> end<00:00:45.989> there

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
at the end there

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.740 
at the end there
maybe<00:00:46.770> yeah<00:00:47.180> give<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> nice<00:00:48.600> little

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
maybe yeah give it like a nice little

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
maybe yeah give it like a nice little
like<00:00:48.899> leather<00:00:49.260> strap<00:00:49.770> thing<00:00:50.070> winding<00:00:50.489> down

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
like leather strap thing winding down

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
like leather strap thing winding down
and<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.930> little<00:00:52.110> handle<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.500> bottom<00:00:54.350> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and a little handle at the bottom you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.439 
and a little handle at the bottom you
know<00:00:55.440> something<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.829> hang<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:57.239> what

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
know something to hang on to then what

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
know something to hang on to then what
we're<00:00:57.600> gonna<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.920> we're<00:00:59.010> gonna<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.340> out

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
we're gonna do so we're gonna come out

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.860 
we're gonna do so we're gonna come out
here<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:01.050> work<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> draw<00:01:02.539> some<00:01:03.539> chain

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
here and work in the draw some chain

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.980 
here and work in the draw some chain
link<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:05.960> think<00:01:08.299> you<00:01:09.299> might<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.659> starting<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
link I think you might be starting to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.510 
link I think you might be starting to
see<00:01:10.110> where<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.770> going

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.920 

and<00:01:18.520> incidentally<00:01:19.030> just<00:01:19.299> on<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.509> side<00:01:19.720> note

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
and incidentally just on the side note

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.330 
and incidentally just on the side note
when<00:01:20.079> you're<00:01:20.229> drawing<00:01:20.380> chain-link<00:01:20.979> try<00:01:21.189> not

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
when you're drawing chain-link try not

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.280 
when you're drawing chain-link try not
to<00:01:21.399> draw<00:01:21.549> too<00:01:21.759> much<00:01:22.299> detail<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.140> inner

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
to draw too much detail to the inner

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.870 
to draw too much detail to the inner
portion<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.920> chain-link<00:01:24.159> just<00:01:24.520> along<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
portion of the chain-link just along the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.760 
portion of the chain-link just along the
draw<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.360> line<00:01:25.570> stick<00:01:25.840> on<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.049> outside<00:01:26.439> then

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
draw the line stick on the outside then

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.060 
draw the line stick on the outside then
on<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.009> inside<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.509> fun<00:01:29.049> part<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.950> a

so there you go that is the flail so now

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.660 
so there you go that is the flail so now
we'll<00:02:21.640> move<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.060> some<00:02:22.209> more<00:02:22.359> weapons
