00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello we do today facial gymnastics 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.760
 and our area is now the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.130
 cheek area and that is an area 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.830
 that is with exercises because these are not so 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.849
 easy to execute 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.949
 Let's try this area too 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.400
 to tighten and I'll show you two 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.740
 Exercises and the first exercise is easy 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.740
 smile with all my might 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.300
 smile and if you look sideways then 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.460
 may be restrained with them 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.230
 then it's almost my turn or you can too 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.450
 So when you realize you are doing 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 The exercise on eyes here then folds 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.380
 You can also do a bit of that here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.750
 Do it on your hands and with all your might 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.050
 smile and we hold the 5 seconds 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.760
 and 23 seconds break made it ten to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.739
 15 times I do it all now 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.739
 easy three times before that 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.940
 at this exercise markets here in the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.400
 bank area how things are moving and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.980
 what does he do that punishes her so that's the one 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.210
 first exercise comes the other exercise is 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.620
 he is now in as if you were 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.260
 say you can do it, too 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.960
 loud as a say, attempting to 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.550
 mouth shut and that looks like that 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.550
 out with an a 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.120
 had in the exercise here too he noted 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.490
 Do it right if you feel this here 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.890
 and always the same always five 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.370
 for example, then tighten the exercise 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.950
 so keep it for a few more seconds 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.960
 and then live ten to fifteen times 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.520
 repeat and try again 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.979
 do that again with my adviser 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:57.410
 said an aha try to shut up 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.790
 So yes, when we do these exercises 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.890
 then we have beautiful ones here 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.060
 Cheek and punish also this area 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:09.820
 So have fun while practicing 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.820
 That's it for today until next time
