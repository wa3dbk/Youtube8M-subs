00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.799
 ducati diavel carbon is the union of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.599
 beauty strength and technology 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.710
 staged by a two-cylinder engine 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.230
 with 1,198 cubic centimeters the these 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.019
 black eleventh delivery a force 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.810
 almost desperate that the grass 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.650
 force per meter of maximum torque 8 mil 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.850
 rotations per minute in 162 horsepower 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.260
 power of 9 thousand 500 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.180
 enough to have the feeling that 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.180
 is to be left behind 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.110
 just speed up speed recovery 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.850
 in order to control so much force and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.940
 water power has an arsenal of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.239
 technology that increases pleasure and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.550
 safety during the piloting of the three 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.339
 with abs sound system of brembo brand of 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.720
 the latest generation with extreme efficiency and 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.430
 The sought after bike still offers 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.220
 eight levels for traction control 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.259
 to Fix Acceleration Errors 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.869
 mainly inputs or outputs of 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.759
 curves and three power modules that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.289
 the motor to rotate in the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.080
 road and sportive auxiliary city 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.560
 brand total mileage odometer 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 partial odometer two there in the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.929
 right side below the average consumption 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.190
 at that moment the average of them usually 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.860
 stay in 17 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.500
 here's the march so let's go to the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.100
 power modules 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.660
 here is urban and urban sports in 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.310
 sporty 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:53.640
 you have 162 horsepower with 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:59.459
 all the force says loaded at once 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.789
 and I entered level 8 abs higher is a 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.380
 woman who the urban power module 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.190
 for you to ride in the city 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.120
 it has delivery of 100 hps urban mode and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.690
 the ABS brake in module 5 with 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.459
 Traction passing pro Turin 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.400
 you have 162 horsepower but with 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 a smooth delivery in module 3 of the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.190
 traction control and abs brake 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.099
 already in the sports module 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.360
 You have the same 162 horses of 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.030
 power 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.730
 here it is regulated by a level 8 abs 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.160
 but she can you can change that for one 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.319
 and you get the bike with a delivery 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.329
 of full power at full power 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.430
 the public with combinations that allow 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.370
 to reach strongly in the most 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.859
 notes until a sports performance 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.620
 in which the pilot turns off electronic part 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.620
 who assumed the death command portal 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.330
 the aunt comes from the iva sliding clutch 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.310
 avoids locking in order 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.710
 images 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.650
 the precision of the electronic accelerator 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.220
 leaves state dosing makes it easier with sound 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.220
 of the disorder 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:25.890
 you think you need the final position and 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:28.920
 It even happened to happen more silom 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.099
 surprises in meandering stretches the bike and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.690
 grabs the ground and good cycling invites 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.690
 for more intimate curves 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.290
 This steel trellis win with him since 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.270
 the required program is a good one 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.480
 driver with the front suspension with 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.570
 upside - down telescopic fork in the sea did 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.710
 rear like bravo both with funk 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.030
 bull to enter the position to pilot and 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.340
 comfortable 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.290
 the lake does not leave its arms in position 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.160
 relaxed and helps when handling 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.230
 firm on the pull, the leg gets a little 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.750
 folded his design of the bank also by 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.830
 love that fits well to hold the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.990
 boy already in the design additive conquers the 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.540
 heart and eyes are a beauty and all 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.989
 probability of a little more with my 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.440
 and bus services 20 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.479
 even in his house 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.759
 such an exchange is the first 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.039
 calling attention by the case of default 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.340
 in the state box growth engine 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:42.940
 and then by the shape the marks that the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:45.580
 makes the imposing design buses the 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.669
 radiators positioned on the sides of the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.030
 tank left the front even bigger 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:05:02.979
 the rear pedals and the handle for the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:05.080
 are retractable and ducati are not 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:09.310
 saved on engineering to assemble the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.039
 card holder the rear flashlight 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.849
 is in the bottom of the seat in two 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.560
 parts until the engine has design closing 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.810
 which transmits a lot of 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.810
 opportunity and aggressiveness 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.879
 the panel breaks the cable is divided into 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.129
 two parts above it by the belts and 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.870
 digital counter -gyro total odometer and 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.870
 two in addition to the clock to 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.029
 engine temperature in the lower part of the 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.430
 pilot your life the dead if they were 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.560
 trace an average gait indicator of 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.599
 travel time and up to 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.999
 ambient temperature, among others 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:51.719
 This padlock information is
