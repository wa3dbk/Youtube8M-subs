the<00:00:01.110> following<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:02.540> demonstration<00:00:03.540> of

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
the following is the demonstration of

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.810 
the following is the demonstration of
the<00:00:05.759> first<00:00:06.029> construction<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.960> our<00:00:07.820> geometry

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
the first construction in our geometry

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.140 
the first construction in our geometry
class<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:10.200> first<00:00:10.440> construction<00:00:10.980> took<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
class the first construction took on a

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.250 
class the first construction took on a
second<00:00:12.650> congruent<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> given<00:00:14.490> segment

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
second congruent to a given segment

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.710 
second congruent to a given segment
let's<00:00:16.260> say<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.560> example<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.190> this

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
let's say for example we have this

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.710 
let's say for example we have this
segment<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.960> B<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.640> want<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:22.070> copy<00:00:23.720> now

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
segment a B that we want to copy now

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.990 
segment a B that we want to copy now
what<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.199> will<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.740> will<00:00:26.070> first<00:00:26.460> draw<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
what we will do first will first draw a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.040 
what we will do first will first draw a
line<00:00:32.239> long<00:00:33.239> enough<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.660> course<00:00:33.719> we

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
line long enough of course we

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.700 
line long enough of course we
approximately<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:35.309> approximately<00:00:36.710> construct

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
approximately we approximately construct

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.190 
approximately we approximately construct
something<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.940> longer<00:00:39.210> than<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.690> okay

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
something a bit longer than there okay

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.790 
something a bit longer than there okay
and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.920> pick<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> point<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.450> line

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
and then we pick a point on this line

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.540 
and then we pick a point on this line
here<00:00:43.969> let's<00:00:44.969> say<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.280> call

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
here let's say it's here and we call

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
here let's say it's here and we call
that<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:48.629> copy<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.920> let's<00:00:50.309> say<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.760> prime<00:00:51.890> as

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that the copy of a let's say a prime as

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.369 
that the copy of a let's say a prime as
the<00:00:54.260> point<00:00:55.260> correspond<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> point<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.899> ok<00:00:57.899> now

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the point correspond to point a ok now

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.250 
the point correspond to point a ok now
then<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.039> will<00:00:59.340> use<00:00:59.579> my<00:00:59.989> comm<00:01:00.989> pass<00:01:03.080> with<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
then I will use my comm pass with the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.500 
then I will use my comm pass with the
pivot<00:01:04.559> point<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.549> hope<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
pivot point at a I hope you can see the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.609 
pivot point at a I hope you can see the
pivot<00:01:09.510> point<00:01:09.930> there<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.920> needle<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:12.380> ok<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
pivot point there the needle here ok and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.219 
pivot point there the needle here ok and
then<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.640> tried<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> start<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.930> be

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.800 

now<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.290> hope<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.789> put<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
now I hope you can see that I put a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.690 
now I hope you can see that I put a
little<00:01:22.049> art<00:01:22.439> there's<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:23.520> sure

little art there's just to make sure

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.399 
little art there's just to make sure

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
equal to the length from A to B why

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.199 
equal to the length from A to B why
because<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:18.329> opening<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.140> compass<00:02:20.209> at

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
because the opening of the compass at

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.949 
because the opening of the compass at
the<00:02:21.360> same<00:02:22.280> okay<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.730> notice<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.120> we<00:02:24.660> do<00:02:24.810> this

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
the same okay so notice that we do this

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.569 
the same okay so notice that we do this
first<00:02:25.290> construction<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:27.230> we<00:02:28.230> copy<00:02:28.560> segment<00:02:29.400> a

in<00:02:35.760> fact<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.329> use<00:02:37.010> just<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.280> straight<00:02:38.579> edge

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
in fact I use just the straight edge

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.729 
in fact I use just the straight edge
here<00:02:38.819> even<00:02:39.600> though<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.750> have<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.200> measurement

here even though I have the measurement

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.849 
here even though I have the measurement
there<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.489> use<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.910> stretch<00:02:42.180> edge

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859

now<00:02:56.489> we<00:02:56.549> can<00:02:56.819> try<00:02:57.060> again<00:02:57.359> this<00:02:57.569> time<00:02:58.069> let's

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
now we can try again this time let's

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.080 
now we can try again this time let's
start<00:02:59.370> from<00:03:00.079> very<00:03:01.079> very<00:03:01.489> beginning<00:03:02.489> suppose<00:03:03.060> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
start from very very beginning suppose I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.940 
start from very very beginning suppose I
have<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.810> line<00:03:04.139> segment<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.100> randomly<00:03:05.850> do

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
have a line segment that I randomly do

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.099 
have a line segment that I randomly do
let's<00:03:07.950> say<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.160> do<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.459> segment<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.930> hope

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
let's say I do this segment here I hope

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.319 
let's say I do this segment here I hope
you<00:03:10.260> all<00:03:10.380> consider<00:03:10.880> let's<00:03:11.880> say<00:03:12.000> that's<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
you all consider let's say that's the

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.059 
you all consider let's say that's the
second<00:03:12.690> okay<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.760> let's<00:03:14.760> call<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.889> point<00:03:16.889> C

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
second okay and let's call this point C

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.880 
second okay and let's call this point C
and<00:03:17.819> this<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.299> point<00:03:18.630> B

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.890 

now<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:22.160> now<00:03:22.940> want<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.270> construct<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.990> segment

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
now I now want to construct a segment

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.810 
now I now want to construct a segment
congruent<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.080> segment<00:03:27.380> CD<00:03:27.650> now<00:03:28.340> how<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.610> do

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
congruent to segment CD now how to do

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.520 
congruent to segment CD now how to do
that<00:03:29.000> first<00:03:29.420> thing<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:29.690> will<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:30.020> I<00:03:30.170> will<00:03:30.200> draw<00:03:30.500> a

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
that first thing I will do I will draw a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.140 
that first thing I will do I will draw a
line<00:03:31.000> long<00:03:32.000> enough<00:03:36.400> longer<00:03:37.400> than<00:03:37.580> CD<00:03:38.030> of

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
line long enough longer than CD of

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.840 
line long enough longer than CD of
course<00:03:38.450> okay<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.410> then<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:39.980> pick<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> point<00:03:40.610> on

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
course okay and then I pick a point on

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.140 
course okay and then I pick a point on
this<00:03:41.060> line<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:42.530> at<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.800> end<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:43.220> course<00:03:43.550> let's

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
this line to at the end of course let's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.450 
this line to at the end of course let's
call<00:03:44.360> this<00:03:44.480> e<00:03:44.690> prime<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.650> point

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
call this e prime this is the point

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.990 
call this e prime this is the point
correspond<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.090> my<00:03:47.300> C<00:03:47.570> now<00:03:48.260> then<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.890> will<00:03:49.760> use

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
correspond to my C now then I will use

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.300 
correspond to my C now then I will use
my<00:03:50.530> bullet<00:03:51.530> up<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.740> bit

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
my bullet up a bit

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.020 
my bullet up a bit
now<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.030> will<00:03:53.270> use<00:03:53.300> my<00:03:53.660> opener<00:03:54.500> my<00:03:54.740> compass<00:03:55.340> the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
now I will use my opener my compass the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.940 
now I will use my opener my compass the
fifty<00:03:56.390> pivot<00:03:56.780> point<00:03:57.110> will<00:03:57.440> be<00:03:57.620> at<00:03:57.920> sea<00:03:58.460> and<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
fifty pivot point will be at sea and the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.060 
fifty pivot point will be at sea and the
opening<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.910> other<00:04:02.000> leg<00:04:02.300> will<00:04:02.570> go<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.840> D<00:04:03.170> now<00:04:03.860> I

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
opening the other leg will go to D now I

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.740 
opening the other leg will go to D now I
need<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.400> for<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:04.820> tool<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.300> make<00:04:05.330> sure<00:04:05.630> that

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
need to for this tool to make sure that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.590 
need to for this tool to make sure that
it<00:04:05.900> does<00:04:06.110> pass<00:04:06.440> through<00:04:06.680> pass<00:04:07.490> that<00:04:07.820> point<00:04:08.180> B

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
it does pass through pass that point B

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.160 
it does pass through pass that point B
right<00:04:09.490> okay<00:04:11.860> now<00:04:12.860> then<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.580> will<00:04:14.450> use<00:04:14.690> this

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
right okay now then I will use this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.130 
right okay now then I will use this
compact<00:04:15.950> opening<00:04:16.519> now<00:04:17.680> here<00:04:19.720> cut<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.870> there

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
compact opening now here cut it there

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.910 
compact opening now here cut it there
voila

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
voila

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:31.110 
voila
we<00:04:22.490> get<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.980> copy<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:26.080> point<00:04:27.080> D

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.960 

this<00:04:31.780> new<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:34.300> C<00:04:35.110> prime<00:04:35.139> to<00:04:35.650> D<00:04:35.770> prime<00:04:36.130> here<00:04:36.520> will

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
this new so C prime to D prime here will

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.000 
this new so C prime to D prime here will
have<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.389> same<00:04:37.630> length<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:39.100> original<00:04:39.580> CD

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
have the same length to the original CD

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.070 
have the same length to the original CD
the<00:04:42.010> length<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.310> CD<00:04:42.490> because<00:04:43.180> they<00:04:43.510> have<00:04:43.720> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
the length of CD because they have the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.340 
the length of CD because they have the
same<00:04:44.290> complex<00:04:44.740> opening<00:04:45.220> okay<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.810> for

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
same complex opening okay this is for

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.010 
same complex opening okay this is for
construction<00:04:47.979> one<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.449> construct<00:04:49.870> a

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
construction one it is to construct a

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.720 
construction one it is to construct a
segment<00:04:50.610> congruent<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:52.090> given<00:04:52.419> segment
