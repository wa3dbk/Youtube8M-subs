00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
um the way it works is I get on some

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
um the way it works is I get on some
black<00:00:47.399> criteria<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.930> then<00:00:51.930> it

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
black criteria and then I go and then it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.189 
black criteria and then I go and then it
goes<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.520> just<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.059> party<00:00:57.390> guys<00:00:57.600> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
really work very well so you know it's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.920 
really work very well so you know it's
all<00:01:17.340> part<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> fun<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.299> part<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
all part of the fun it's part of the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.730 
all part of the fun it's part of the
mystery<00:01:19.369> but<00:01:20.369> oh<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:21.360> gosh<00:01:21.570> guys<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.140> fantastic

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
mystery but oh my gosh guys is fantastic

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.730 
mystery but oh my gosh guys is fantastic
um<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.150> basic<00:01:24.509> idea<00:01:24.659> behind<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.530> whole

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
um so the basic idea behind this whole

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.819 
um so the basic idea behind this whole
system<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.659> you've<00:01:27.659> got<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.960> pulse<00:01:28.320> that's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
system is you've got this pulse that's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.440 
system is you've got this pulse that's
going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.189> sent<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.210> every<00:01:30.420> time

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
going to be sent up here so every time

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.840 
going to be sent up here so every time
that<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.720> jump<00:01:31.110> ideally<00:01:32.100> it'll<00:01:32.460> trigger<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that you jump ideally it'll trigger this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.600 
that you jump ideally it'll trigger this
redstone<00:01:33.500> or<00:01:34.500> when<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> press<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> button

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
redstone or when you press this button

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.700 
redstone or when you press this button
when<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> trigger<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> redstone<00:01:36.930> it'll<00:01:37.500> send

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
when you trigger the redstone it'll send

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
when you trigger the redstone it'll send
a<00:01:37.860> delayed<00:01:38.159> pulse<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.150> way<00:01:39.270> down<00:01:39.509> here

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
a delayed pulse all the way down here

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.289 
a delayed pulse all the way down here
and<00:01:39.869> through<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.049> these<00:01:40.140> repeaters<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
and through all these repeaters and

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.609 
and through all these repeaters and
finally<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.720> once<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.960> gets<00:01:43.110> down<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.439> it'll

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
finally but once it gets down here it'll

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.649 
finally but once it gets down here it'll
turn<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.220> off<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:45.149> will<00:01:45.329> turn<00:01:45.450> this

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
turn this off which will turn this

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
turn this off which will turn this
pissed<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.170> off<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.070> pistols<00:01:47.430> piston<00:01:48.060> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
pissed it off so this pistols piston is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.289 
pissed it off so this pistols piston is
by<00:01:48.420> default<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:49.490> pushing<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> slime<00:01:51.030> block

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
by default on pushing up the slime block

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.760 
by default on pushing up the slime block
into<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> maksimova<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.579> oh<00:01:53.610> ma<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.200> one

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
into a maksimova you oh ma and then one

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
into a maksimova you oh ma and then one
that<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.250> thing<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.759> you're<00:01:57.149> obviously

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that the thing is up you're obviously

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330 
that the thing is up you're obviously
you're<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:57.960> gonna<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:59.040> when<00:01:59.159> it's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you're not gonna do much but when it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
you're not gonna do much but when it's
down<00:01:59.670> when<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.360> thing<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.600> active<00:02:01.079> when

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
down when this thing is active when

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.540 
down when this thing is active when
you're<00:02:01.350> jumping

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
you're jumping

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.460 
you're jumping
to<00:02:02.700> send<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.180> thing<00:02:03.450> down<00:02:04.050> to<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.320> ground

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
to send this thing down to the ground

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.710 
to send this thing down to the ground
and<00:02:04.800> then<00:02:05.280> after<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> brief<00:02:05.880> delay<00:02:06.090> it'll<00:02:06.600> push

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
and then after a brief delay it'll push

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.230 
and then after a brief delay it'll push
back<00:02:06.990> up<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.680> ideally<00:02:08.040> whenever<00:02:08.760> you're<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
back up so ideally whenever you're on it

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.060 
back up so ideally whenever you're on it
you're<00:02:09.420> gonna<00:02:10.080> you're<00:02:10.350> gonna<00:02:10.440> press<00:02:10.710> that<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
you're gonna you're gonna press that and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.800 
you're gonna you're gonna press that and
it's<00:02:11.190> gonna<00:02:11.280> push<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:11.970> down<00:02:12.150> cuz<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.600> Glade

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
it's gonna push it down cuz that Glade

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.330 
it's gonna push it down cuz that Glade
pulse<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.320> it's<00:02:13.740> going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> push<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.160> right

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
pulse and it's going to push you right

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.250 
pulse and it's going to push you right
up<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.820> then<00:02:15.270> after<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.660> little<00:02:15.780> while<00:02:15.960> that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
up and then after a little while that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.530 
up and then after a little while that
down<00:02:16.740> pulse<00:02:17.010> gets<00:02:17.220> down<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.210> land<00:02:18.450> at

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
down pulse gets down and if you land at

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.820 
down pulse gets down and if you land at
the<00:02:18.570> right<00:02:18.720> time<00:02:18.960> like<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.320> just<00:02:19.380> did<00:02:19.530> there

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
the right time like I just did there

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.320 
the right time like I just did there
then<00:02:20.460> you're<00:02:20.580> gonna<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.850> pushed<00:02:21.060> right<00:02:21.150> back

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
then you're gonna be pushed right back

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.420 
then you're gonna be pushed right back
up<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.960> see<00:02:22.170> right<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.440> there<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.070> go<00:02:23.160> pushed

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
up so see right here there we go pushed

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.490 
up so see right here there we go pushed
up<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:24.300> it's<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:24.810> kind<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.020> depends<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.410> your

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
up so it's all kind of depends on your

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.660 
up so it's all kind of depends on your
rhythm<00:02:25.800> whether<00:02:26.040> or<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.220> you're<00:02:26.370> gonna<00:02:26.460> land

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
rhythm whether or not you're gonna land

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.210 
rhythm whether or not you're gonna land
or<00:02:26.880> not<00:02:27.000> let's<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.840> right<00:02:28.020> there<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.470> came<00:02:29.010> up

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
or not let's see right there I came up

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.370 
or not let's see right there I came up
just<00:02:29.250> as<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.850> came<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.210> under<00:02:30.360> me<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.230> really

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
just as it came up under me so it really

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.480 
just as it came up under me so it really
just<00:02:31.440> depends<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.420> luck<00:02:33.420> but<00:02:34.380> yeah<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.620> mean<00:02:35.040> to

just depends on luck but yeah I mean to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.160 
just depends on luck but yeah I mean to
trampoline<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.240> can<00:02:36.390> actually<00:02:36.660> build<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.020> in

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
trampoline you can actually build it in

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.110 
trampoline you can actually build it in
default<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.800> vanilla<00:02:38.250> plain<00:02:38.520> old<00:02:38.670> minecraft

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
default like vanilla plain old minecraft

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.090 
default like vanilla plain old minecraft

the base then you're gonna put a slime

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.740 
the base then you're gonna put a slime
block<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:08.430> there<00:03:08.459> real<00:03:08.940> real<00:03:09.180> easy<00:03:09.209> I'll

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
vanilla you're not gonna be using

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.600 
vanilla you're not gonna be using
obsidian<00:03:16.650> because<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:17.010> expensive<00:03:17.130> and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
obsidian because it's expensive and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.310 
obsidian because it's expensive and
whatnot<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.510> that's<00:03:18.780> not<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.989> problem<00:03:19.230> for

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
whatnot but that's not a problem for

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.930 
whatnot but that's not a problem for
right<00:03:19.530> now<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.250> then<00:03:20.489> you're<00:03:20.580> just<00:03:20.640> going<00:03:20.850> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
right now so then you're just going to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.190 
right now so then you're just going to
think<00:03:21.090> about<00:03:21.150> putting<00:03:21.510> these<00:03:21.750> repeaters<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
think about putting these repeaters and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.340 
think about putting these repeaters and
the<00:03:22.470> best<00:03:22.680> way<00:03:22.800> possible<00:03:22.860> actually<00:03:23.730> does<00:03:24.350> yeah

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
the best way possible actually does yeah

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
the best way possible actually does yeah
I'm<00:03:25.410> pretty<00:03:25.530> sure<00:03:25.709> red<00:03:25.830> Sun<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.160> travel

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
I'm pretty sure red Sun can travel

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.470 
I'm pretty sure red Sun can travel
through<00:03:26.610> obsidian<00:03:26.940> i'm<00:03:27.060> not<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.300> rebuy

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
through obsidian i'm not going to rebuy

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.150 
through obsidian i'm not going to rebuy
that<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.290> then<00:03:28.680> you're<00:03:28.770> just<00:03:28.800> going<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.070> put

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
that so then you're just going to put

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.800 
that so then you're just going to put
that<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:29.489> there<00:03:29.520> see<00:03:30.330> because<00:03:30.570> you're

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
that right there see because you're

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.060 
that right there see because you're
putting<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.140> into<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.530> block<00:03:31.800> because

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
putting that into that block because

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.910 
putting that into that block because
your<00:03:32.760> redstone<00:03:33.000> torches<00:03:33.330> right<00:03:33.450> here<00:03:33.920> so

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
your redstone torches right here so

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.800 
your redstone torches right here so
putting<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.520> repeater<00:03:35.880> right<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.150> right

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
putting that repeater right there right

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.420 
putting that repeater right there right
into<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.050> block<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.500> then<00:03:38.010> you're<00:03:38.190> going<00:03:38.310> to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
into a block and then you're going to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.430 
into a block and then you're going to
build<00:03:38.850> up<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.390> you're<00:03:40.080> going<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.230> put<00:03:40.410> one

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
build up and you're going to put one

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880 
build up and you're going to put one
redstone<00:03:40.860> right<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.080> then<00:03:43.080> two<00:03:43.440> more<00:03:43.709> of

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
redstone right here and then two more of

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.680 
redstone right here and then two more of
whatever<00:03:44.070> block<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.670> choose<00:03:44.910> right<00:03:45.239> here<00:03:45.510> and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
whatever block you choose right here and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.690 
whatever block you choose right here and
right<00:03:45.720> here<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.590> then<00:03:47.310> you're<00:03:47.400> just<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.610> to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
right here and then you're just going to

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.680 
right here and then you're just going to
go<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:49.160> delete<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.310> block<00:03:50.580> I'm<00:03:51.510> going<00:03:51.630> to

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
go and delete that block I'm going to

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.850 
go and delete that block I'm going to
put<00:03:51.930> your<00:03:52.400> repeater<00:03:53.540> facing<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:55.080> way<00:03:55.140> oh<00:03:55.500> by

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
put your repeater facing this way oh by

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.100 
put your repeater facing this way oh by
the<00:03:55.890> way<00:03:56.010> by<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.280> keep<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.670> mind<00:03:56.850> these<00:03:57.000> tix<00:03:57.360> so

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
the way by to keep in mind these tix so

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.750 
the way by to keep in mind these tix so
you're<00:03:58.739> going<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.890> have<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.190> repeater<00:03:59.580> I

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
you're going to have this repeater I

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.490 
you're going to have this repeater I
think<00:04:00.090> actually<00:04:00.239> place<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.840> wrong<00:04:01.050> no

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
think actually place that the wrong no

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.020 
think actually place that the wrong no
place<00:04:01.769> at<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.010> right<00:04:02.100> direction<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:02.670> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
place at the right direction but that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.880 
place at the right direction but that
one's<00:04:03.150> going<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.330> be<00:04:03.450> four<00:04:03.810> tix<00:04:04.230> instead<00:04:04.800> of

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
one's going to be four tix instead of

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.199 
one's going to be four tix instead of
one<00:04:05.070> so<00:04:05.550> going<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.790> right<00:04:05.880> click<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.090> that

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
one so going to right click on that

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.699 
one so going to right click on that
three<00:04:06.480> times<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.230> it's<00:04:07.350> going<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.560> wait<00:04:07.680> for

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
three times so it's going to wait for

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.430 
three times so it's going to wait for
tix<00:04:08.190> four<00:04:08.459> passes<00:04:08.790> on<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.090> signal<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.600> then

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
tix four passes on that signal and then

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.710 
tix four passes on that signal and then
we're<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.710> to<00:04:10.770> go<00:04:10.830> ahead

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
we're going to go ahead

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.630 
we're going to go ahead
put<00:04:11.930> one<00:04:12.110> redstone<00:04:12.290> down<00:04:12.620> right<00:04:12.800> here<00:04:13.040> I'll

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.580 
put one redstone down right here I'll
place<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:13.970> block<00:04:14.240> on<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.540> side<00:04:15.050> right<00:04:15.350> there

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
place a block on the side right there

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.970 
place a block on the side right there
and<00:04:16.480> put<00:04:17.480> another<00:04:17.600> red<00:04:18.019> soon<00:04:18.230> right<00:04:18.350> here<00:04:18.560> all

that out too for I believe let me just
double<00:04:34.160> check<00:04:34.310> yep<00:04:34.790> down<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.300> four<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.750> need<00:04:36.470> a

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
double check yep down to four I need a

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.520 
double check yep down to four I need a
block<00:04:37.100> right<00:04:37.490> side<00:04:37.880> on<00:04:37.910> either<00:04:38.360> side<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:38.930> how

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
block right side on either side so how

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.320 
block right side on either side so how
you<00:04:39.590> get<00:04:39.770> blocks<00:04:40.130> because<00:04:40.400> if<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:41.000> just<00:04:41.180> start

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
you get blocks because if you just start

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.820 
you get blocks because if you just start
right<00:04:41.540> quickly<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.230> trying<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.590> put<00:04:42.710> on

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
right quickly and trying to put on

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.110 
right quickly and trying to put on
blocks<00:04:43.130> obviously<00:04:43.550> you're<00:04:43.640> just<00:04:43.760> gonna<00:04:43.880> start

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
blocks obviously you're just gonna start

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.610 
blocks obviously you're just gonna start
messing<00:04:44.360> around<00:04:44.420> with<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.750> so<00:04:45.290> if<00:04:45.530> you

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
messing around with that so if you

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.370 
messing around with that so if you
didn't<00:04:45.830> know<00:04:45.950> you<00:04:46.580> are<00:04:46.730> shift-click<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.810> then

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
didn't know you are shift-click and then

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.260 
didn't know you are shift-click and then
you<00:04:48.650> right<00:04:48.800> click<00:04:48.830> on<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:49.610> shift<00:04:49.970> plus

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
you right click on it so shift plus

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.610 
you right click on it so shift plus
right<00:04:50.360> click<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:50.840> then<00:04:51.230> I'm<00:04:51.320> going<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.500> go
