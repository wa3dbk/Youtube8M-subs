00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.819
 finish 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.340
 dear frame 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.390
 wounded this morning to see my doctor hermógenes 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.730
 who just returned to the villa after a long trip through asia 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.000
 the test had to be done on an empty stomach 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.340
 we had agreed to find them in the early hours of the next day 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.740
 I pretended about a fact then stripping it of the blanket and the tunic 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.460
 avoided more details 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.740
 what would they lose 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.420
 as unpleasant as myself 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.770
 and the description of the body of an aging man 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.770
 and prepares to die of dropsy of the heart 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.940
 let's just say that toshiba 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.170
 breathe 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 and held his breath according to the indications of hermógenes 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 alarmed in spite of himself for the rapid progress of the disease 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.920
 and soon 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.230
 to unburden the weight of guilt 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.590
 in the young man and fences 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 who attended during his absence 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.420
 it is difficult to remain emperor before a bundy doctor is also difficult 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.930
 save the quality of man but the eye of the master genes lobelle in minutes 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.060
 a bag of humors 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 a sad amalgam of l'infant and of san héroe 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.029
 this morning I thought for the first time that my body 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:19.559
 that faithful companion of that friend detroit safer and better known than my soul 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:27.360
 it is nothing more than a sneaky monster of end up devouring his master d there 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.409
 happen 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.949
 I love my body 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.579
 it has served me well 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.299
 And anyway 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.299
 He spared no care 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.699
 but I do not count anymore 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.309
 as hermogenes 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.199
 pretend to count 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.979
 with the wonderful virtues of plants 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.149
 and the exact dosage of the mineral salts 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:52.819
 that has gone east 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.949
 this man so subtle however 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.199
 abounded in bullets formulas of breath 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.199
 too trivial is to fool anyone 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.369
 you know very well how much I detest this kind of imposture 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.669
 but not in vain has medicine exerted 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.669
 for more than 30 years 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:16.869
 he forgave this good server 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.869
 his effort to disguise me death 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.939
 Hermogenes is wise 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.939
 and has also the wisdom of prudence 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.669
 d 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.819
 its probity that far exceeds 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.819
 to that of a vulgar palace doctor 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.549
 I will have the luck is the best attended to the sick 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.449
 but nothing can exceed the prescribed limits 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.589
 my swollen legs 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:54.589
 no longer hold me during long Roman ceremony plan 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.899
 of suffocation 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.899
 and I'm only 60 years old 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.059
 do not call you however cheating 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.999
 I'm still so weak as to be to select the imaginations of fear 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.819
 almost as absurd as those of hope 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.129
 and certainly much more painful 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.239
 to cheat me 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 I would prefer the path of trust 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.840
 I would not lose more for it 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.969
 I suffered less 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.520
 this term so close 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.409
 it is not necessarily immediate 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.409
 I still pick up after night with hope and get to the morning 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:39.300
 within the insurmountable limits 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.939
 what to talk about 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.580
 I can defend my position span by span 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.889
 and still recover some traces of lost ground 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.719
 but anyway 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.419
 ll gadol age without life 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.930
 for any man 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.930
 it is wrong to accept 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.069
 say that my days 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.219
 they are numbered 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.490
 Has no sense 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.259
 it was like that always 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.599
 this is for all 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.900
 but I have the uncertainty of the place of the hour and the moduc of the first without 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:17.599
 distinguish clearly from the end of which we advance indre out to decrease 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.599
 for me as the deadly disease progresses 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.770
 any man can die suddenly 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.879
 but the patient knows that between ten years they will no longer live 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.199
 no margin of doubt does not cover the years but the months 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.669
 my chances already barak to end up 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.139
 work and a stab in the heart 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.139
 a horse fall pañis mine and watching more and more 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.969
 the plague seems unlikely 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.969
 it would seem that leprosy or cancer have been left behind 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.740
 I no longer run the risk of falling into borders 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.849
 struck by the Caledonian ax crossed by the date parta 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.080
 the storms did not know how to take advantage of the opportunities that were offered 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.080
 and the sorcerer who predicted that he would not yet die drowned 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.279
 seems to have been right 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.669
 i will die in tibú restan roma 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.119
 or at most in Naples 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:17.119
 and a choking crisis will take over the task 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:25.160
 which of them drag me the law but the hundredth of all this is a 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.789
 one month old 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:31.369
 like in the money they move in the corner of the archipelago in jail 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:35.750
 to many errors the luminous mist and discovered little by little the second line 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:41.289
 from the coast García begins to perceive the profile of my death uu
