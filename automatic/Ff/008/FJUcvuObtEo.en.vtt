 which is used to connect the monitor 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.889
 followed we have another with mector hector but this has a different date 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.999
 not to be confused with the previous one and for which the appropriate cable is included 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.729
 this collector is gea input and serves to connect the computer finally 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.759
 we have the connector for cable television as we see we can have up 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.689
 four devices connected simultaneously the computer the 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.180
 cable television sky devices more thanks to the connector 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.189
 such as a dvd player or blu-ray player and a 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.410
 game console 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.280
 and with a single button on the remote control we can change the image of some to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.919
 others 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.779
 and even thanks to the pitching function in pitching rock we can for example 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.540
 be working with the computer and watching television 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.120
 at the same time thanks to the public function in this way our monitor 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.480
 of the computer that previously only served to connect the PC becomes 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.930
 in an entertainment center and we can address both space and 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.140
 money that it is not necessary to buy an additional television and also 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.550
 today we have an image quality superior to televisions 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.579
 conventional 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.989
 and even some lcd TVs resolution lower than 1920 by 1080 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.660
 pixels the inverter bought signature hector of 700 has several advantages 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.680
 For example, the optimal function beat allows you to configure the 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.639
 aspect ratio depending on the video signal and the size of its 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.849
 monitor which allows the user to adjust the image to their liking and 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:36.660
 preference 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.810
 either eliminate the black girls cut out in the movies or adjust 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.839
 the image of the cable TV so that it does not look like the full screen 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.959
 another function is of importance that are generally not available 

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:52.559
 common TV or not being able to watch up to nine channels of tevé in form 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:56.649
 simultaneous ceiling function in prison select your channel list 

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:00.360
 favorites and you can adjust the resolution and image quality to your 

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:04.029
 preference the only relatively negative aspect to the speakers 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.699
 too much guys included in the unit 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.340
 so it is advisable to use speakers we are for a better sound 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.229
 in conclusion the television bought bought requested measure of 700 is one of the 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.110
 better options when choosing an external TV tuner since it does not 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.719
 it only allows you to watch TV channels on your computer if what 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.539
 allows you to do it without having to have it turned on and have to 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.919
 install programs on it in addition 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.370
 I let you be other devices like a blu-ray player a console 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.810
 games and be able to enjoy these devices on a high lcd monitor 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.330
 definition because it surely has higher quality than any television 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.329
 conventional that is not lcd 

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:47.189
 The main advantage of this particular model is that it has support for a 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:52.779
 wide number of resolutions and even 1920 by 1080 and 1900 by 1200 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.490
 despite the resolutions found 23-inch monitors 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:01.549
 ensuring the best image quality these resolutions something that not all 

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:05.559
 índoles now also has another feature option ratio is truly 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:10.669
