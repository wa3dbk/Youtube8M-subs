00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello friends today tuesday a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.460
 that means it's time to first 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.410
 this week's release of 3d news sharing with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.969
 a selection of news from the world of high-tech 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.130
 screen resolution of smartphones has long been 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 measured in thousands of pixels a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.859
 instagram still stores and displays 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.019
 photos in archaic 640 by 640 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 however, the time to move forward has come 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.769
 attentive service users 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 discovered that more recently 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.980
 fill her images are saved in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.170
 1080 resolution at 1080 pixels yes yes how 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 iphone 6 horizontal class 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.489
 official comments on this subject 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.469
 no yet and see pictures in such 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.190
 size can only dig in the code 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.530
 pages 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.670
 but the transition will probably take place very much 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.370
 Swiss cannot be called soon 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.829
 space country but all she 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.890
 does in this direction she does 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.320
 in detail so in 2009 the federal 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.870
 polytechnic school of lausanne launched 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 into orbit miniature satellite suisse cue 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 intended for photographing 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 sky glow program was supposed to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.750
 last from three months to a year but in 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.710
 as a result, the cube functioned properly 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.229
 over 5 years 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 now it's time to remove it from orbit and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.000
 deliver to the atmosphere so it burns out and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.950
 do not litter near-earth space with 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 the apparatus must cope with this task 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 clean space one programs 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.439
 over the past three years developers 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.110
 reviewed and dropped many 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 options for the design of such 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.220
 waste collector and eventually settled on 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.200
 conical grid pattern 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 it may seem that develop 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 separate disposable apparatus in order 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.320
 to remove from cube size 10 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 10 centimeters to say the least 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.119
 unreasonably however if you remember 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.799
 all those tons of garbage that left 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.140
 and continue to leave behind 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.270
 space programs of Russia and the United States 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.030
 other countries but this is only a sample of the pen 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.009
 If successful, clean space one can 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.200
 become the beginning of the era of clearing 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.200
 near-earth space which with 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.100
 every launch is getting more 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.720
 cluttered up 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.420
 on lego cubes more than one has grown 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.310
 a generation of children and hardly anyone from 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.950
 they thought about what the details 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.380
 Designer made of ABS plastic 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.390
 however the bosses of the Danish company are fine 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.390
 know that on the production of one 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.910
 kilogram abs is spent equivalent 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.730
 two kilograms of oil in the form of materials and 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.710
 energy producing 60 billion parts 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.810
 in the year of the factory lego is thrown into 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.030
 atmosphere a significant amount 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.370
 carbon dioxide so the company 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.800
 allocated 150 million dollars for 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.960
 creating a center that will search 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.270
 alternative material for example 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.100
 secondary plastic 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.970
 recycling league plans completely 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.370
 abandon a ps by 2030 but not 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.500
 worry look cubes will be exactly 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.920
 also step on them barefoot 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.470
 it will still hurt more news 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.300
