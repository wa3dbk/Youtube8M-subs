00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.740 

you<00:02:04.550> could<00:02:04.730> actually<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:05.090> think<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.480> can<00:02:05.630> pick

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
you could actually I think you can pick

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.340 
you could actually I think you can pick
them<00:02:05.930> off<00:02:07.060> yeah<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.780> can<00:02:08.929> also<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.259> it

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350

them off yeah you can also do it
probably<00:02:09.710> from<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.009> side<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.270> pick<00:02:11.270> them<00:02:11.420> off

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
probably from this side to pick them off

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.020 
probably from this side to pick them off
in<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.780> windows<00:02:12.170> um<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.270> also<00:02:16.030> wallbang

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030
