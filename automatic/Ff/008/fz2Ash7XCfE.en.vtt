this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.099> Infiniti<00:00:14.790> emergy<00:00:15.800> yeah<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
this is the Infiniti emergy yeah and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.400 
this is the Infiniti emergy yeah and
it's<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.270> new<00:00:18.600> hybrid<00:00:19.260> concept<00:00:20.189> car<00:00:20.990> and<00:00:21.990> we

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
it's the new hybrid concept car and we

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.620 
it's the new hybrid concept car and we
spoke<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.980> last<00:00:23.340> year<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.119> s<00:00:24.300> flow

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
spoke to you last year about the s flow

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.580 
spoke to you last year about the s flow
and<00:00:25.039> please<00:00:26.039> again<00:00:26.519> another<00:00:27.060> concept<00:00:27.539> yes<00:00:27.900> but

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and please again another concept yes but

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.299 
and please again another concept yes but
this<00:00:28.680> time<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:29.130> infinity<00:00:29.609> yes<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
this time for infinity yes this is a

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.709 
this time for infinity yes this is a
kindness<00:00:32.309> symbolic<00:00:32.790> model<00:00:33.120> over<00:00:33.329> infinity

blonde the inspired performance it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.530 
blonde the inspired performance it
showed<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.649> infinity<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:39.120> one<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
showed what infinity is and this one is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.240 
showed what infinity is and this one is
a<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.840> simple<00:00:40.260> model<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.890> infinities

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
a very simple model for the infinities

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
a very simple model for the infinities
especially<00:00:41.760> performance<00:00:42.210> area<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
especially performance area and this and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590 
especially performance area and this and
we<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:43.980> calling<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.399> lens<00:00:44.579> extended<00:00:45.270> evey

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
we are calling the lens extended evey

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.709 
we are calling the lens extended evey
technology<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.100> completely<00:00:47.579> drive<00:00:47.850> by<00:00:48.180> EB

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
technology so the completely drive by EB

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
technology so the completely drive by EB
BB<00:00:48.780> by<00:00:49.460> epic<00:00:50.460> motor<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:52.440> did<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.039> has<00:00:53.280> some

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
BB by epic motor but we did it has some

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.229 
BB by epic motor but we did it has some
cosmic<00:00:53.850> engine<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.660> us<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> generator

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
cosmic engine for us just as a generator

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.709 
cosmic engine for us just as a generator
so<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> gasoline<00:00:57.989> engine<00:00:58.730> grease<00:00:59.730> bri<00:01:00.210> news

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so the gasoline engine grease bri news

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.900 
so the gasoline engine grease bri news
the<00:01:01.230> electrical<00:01:01.920> power<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.430> doesn't<00:01:02.609> drive

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the electrical power it doesn't drive

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.690 
the electrical power it doesn't drive
the<00:01:03.120> wheel<00:01:03.270> yes<00:01:03.860> yeah<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.189> we're<00:01:05.369> seeing<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the wheel yes yeah so we're seeing that

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.130 
the wheel yes yeah so we're seeing that
becoming<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.420> real<00:01:07.700> sort<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.869> it's<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> real

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
becoming a real sort of it's a real

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
becoming a real sort of it's a real
repeat<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.130> thing<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:11.820> seeing

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
repeat so this thing that we're seeing

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510 
repeat so this thing that we're seeing
throughout<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.479> show<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.159> something

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
throughout the show is that something

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010 
throughout the show is that something
that<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:15.119> come<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.509> market<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
that you think will come to market is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.240 
that you think will come to market is
that<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> most<00:01:16.439> efficient<00:01:16.890> way<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> use

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that the most efficient way to use

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.760 
that the most efficient way to use
electrics<00:01:19.250> no<00:01:20.250> difficult<00:01:20.700> person<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.119> yeah

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
electrics no difficult person but yeah

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
electrics no difficult person but yeah
it's<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.850> hundred<00:01:24.180> person<00:01:24.450> EB<00:01:24.810> but

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
it's not just a hundred person EB but

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.969 
it's not just a hundred person EB but
which<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:26.340> should<00:01:26.759> provide<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.540> various

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
which we should provide the various

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.760 
which we should provide the various
solution<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.770> performance

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
solution we are about the performance

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.899 
solution we are about the performance
plus<00:01:32.659> fuel<00:01:33.659> efficiency<00:01:34.229> low<00:01:34.470> emission<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
plus fuel efficiency low emission so the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.929 
plus fuel efficiency low emission so the
of<00:01:36.570> course<00:01:36.840> Infiniti<00:01:37.290> has<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.920> pink<00:01:38.579> diesel

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of course Infiniti has a bit pink diesel

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.749 
of course Infiniti has a bit pink diesel
and<00:01:39.119> electric<00:01:39.979> vehicle<00:01:40.979> will<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.189> coming<00:01:41.520> soon

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and electric vehicle will be coming soon

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
and electric vehicle will be coming soon
and<00:01:41.939> then<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.750> will<00:01:42.899> ang<00:01:43.200> excellent<00:01:43.619> EB<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.250> we

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
and then it will ang excellent EB so we

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.020 
and then it will ang excellent EB so we
have<00:01:44.490> various<00:01:45.060> solution<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> infinity<00:01:47.700> again

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
have various solution and infinity again

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.289 
have various solution and infinity again
is<00:01:48.240> luxury<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.500> luxury<00:01:49.890> brand<00:01:50.299> twinned

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
is luxury is the luxury brand twinned

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.899 
is luxury is the luxury brand twinned
witness<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.710> again<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.430> expect<00:01:53.790> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
witness and so again we can expect this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
witness and so again we can expect this
technology<00:01:54.509> across<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> whole<00:01:55.470> range

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
technology across the whole range

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.080 
technology across the whole range
eventually<00:01:57.590> at<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.829> moment<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.430> still<00:01:59.790> it's

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
eventually at this moment it still it's

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270 
eventually at this moment it still it's
just<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.509> concept<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.200> explore<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.979> various

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
just a concept we explore the various

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
just a concept we explore the various
solution<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.390> explore<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> biggest<00:02:04.140> deal

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
solution and we explore the biggest deal

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.209 
solution and we explore the biggest deal
the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.010 
the
so<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.850> moment<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.359> has<00:02:06.539> a<00:02:06.570> purely

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so at this moment it has a purely

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.800 
so at this moment it has a purely
concept<00:02:07.469> car<00:02:07.679> but<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.399> not<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.179> cost<00:02:09.360> model

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
concept car but it not just a cost model

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.660 
concept car but it not just a cost model
we<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.349> show<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.220> landing

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
we can show you the landing
