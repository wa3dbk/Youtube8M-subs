00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
is not my favorite to think it's very

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.610 
is not my favorite to think it's very
sloppy<00:02:46.519> but<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:47.180> was<00:02:47.299> really<00:02:47.840> really<00:02:48.170> hard<00:02:48.410> to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
sloppy but it was really really hard to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.780 
sloppy but it was really really hard to
make<00:02:48.830> because<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.989> red<00:02:50.989> part<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.739> hollow<00:02:52.280> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
make because the red part is hollow and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.819 
make because the red part is hollow and
