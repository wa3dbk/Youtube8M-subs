Dalek art and in this episode I'm going

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.410 
Dalek art and in this episode I'm going
to<00:00:03.780> show<00:00:03.959> you<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.410> draw<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.370> horse<00:00:05.850> body

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
to show you how to draw a horse body

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.660 
to show you how to draw a horse body
normally<00:00:07.259> when<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.470> draw<00:00:07.740> horses<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.309> draw

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
normally when I draw horses I draw

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.299 
normally when I draw horses I draw
really<00:00:09.030> fast<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.570> loose<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.710> style<00:00:10.980> called

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
really fast and loose in a style called

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.339 
really fast and loose in a style called
gesture<00:00:11.730> drawing<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.509> really<00:00:12.809> allows<00:00:13.019> me<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
gesture drawing this really allows me to

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.860 
gesture drawing this really allows me to
capture<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> lot<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.370> motion<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.480> picture

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
capture a lot of motion in the picture

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.029 
capture a lot of motion in the picture
and<00:00:16.430> helps<00:00:17.430> me<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.789> make<00:00:18.210> sure<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:19.380> sizing

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and helps me to make sure that my sizing

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.400 
and helps me to make sure that my sizing
proportions<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.850> correct<00:00:21.109> just<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> drawing

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
proportions are correct just a drawing

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
proportions are correct just a drawing
is<00:00:22.560> focusing<00:00:23.039> more<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.250> drop<00:00:23.640> drawing<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
is focusing more on drop drawing the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.480 
is focusing more on drop drawing the
shape<00:00:24.779> rather<00:00:25.170> than<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> line<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.340> one

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
shape rather than the line for this one

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.710 
shape rather than the line for this one
I'm<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.789> really<00:00:26.970> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.330> give<00:00:27.510> you

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
I'm going to really kind of give you

I'm going to really kind of give you
more<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.170> blocked<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.119> horse<00:00:30.119> shape<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
more of a blocked in horse shape so that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.620 
more of a blocked in horse shape so that
you<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:32.009> see<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.730> proportions<00:00:33.390> just

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you really can see that proportions just

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.110 
you really can see that proportions just
really<00:00:34.050> nice<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.230> slowly<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> sure<00:00:36.000> I'm

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
really nice and slowly for this sure I'm

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
really nice and slowly for this sure I'm
going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.870> regular<00:00:37.100> B<00:00:38.100> pencil<00:00:38.460> but

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
going to use just a regular B pencil but

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.010 
going to use just a regular B pencil but
you<00:00:38.610> could<00:00:38.850> use<00:00:38.969> any<00:00:39.090> Canton's<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> want

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
you could use any Canton's that you want

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.959 
you could use any Canton's that you want
and<00:00:40.410> what<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create<00:00:42.239> my<00:00:42.420> horse<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.899> using<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.410> basic

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
create my horse just using some basic

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.410 
create my horse just using some basic
shapes<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.340> first<00:00:44.579> shape<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.270> use

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
shapes the first shape I'm going to use

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.160 
shapes the first shape I'm going to use
is<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.989> nice<00:00:46.260> circle<00:00:46.800> shape<00:00:47.039> for<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.120> chest<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
is a nice circle shape for the chest of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
is a nice circle shape for the chest of
the<00:00:49.289> horse<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.730> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> bring<00:00:51.149> in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the horse and then I'm going to bring in

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
the horse and then I'm going to bring in
along<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.899> backbone<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.160> where

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
along the backbone so up here is where

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279 
along the backbone so up here is where
the<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.969> neck<00:00:54.210> connects<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.989> there's<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the the neck connects and there's the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
the the neck connects and there's the
withers<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> back<00:00:56.850> bone<00:00:57.120> which

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
withers so you have the back bone which

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
withers so you have the back bone which
count<00:00:57.629> does<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.079> nice<00:00:58.350> swoop<00:00:59.100> curve

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
count does this really nice swoop curve

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.069 
count does this really nice swoop curve
you<00:00:59.879> don't<00:01:00.030> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> swoop<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> too<00:01:00.899> much

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you don't want to swoop it too much

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.630 
you don't want to swoop it too much
because<00:01:01.590> it'll<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.070> kind<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> swayback

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
because it'll be kind of a swayback

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.200 
because it'll be kind of a swayback
worse<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.899> nice<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.290> swooping<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
worse but nice little swooping up and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
worse but nice little swooping up and
all<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.420> way<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> back<00:01:07.229> part<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> horse

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
all the way to the back part the horse

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.859 
all the way to the back part the horse
which<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.520> another<00:01:08.869> circle

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
which is going to be another circle

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
which is going to be another circle
which<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.049> gonna<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.409> nice<00:01:10.560> rump<00:01:10.950> shape<00:01:11.369> again

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
which is gonna be nice rump shape again

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
which is gonna be nice rump shape again
I'm<00:01:12.360> drawing<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.930> loosely<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> can

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
I'm drawing really loosely so that I can

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.070 
I'm drawing really loosely so that I can
change<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> move<00:01:15.060> things<00:01:15.240> around<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.900> need

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
change and move things around if I need

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.920 
change and move things around if I need
to<00:01:16.520> now<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> distance<00:01:18.060> between<00:01:18.299> these<00:01:18.659> two

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to now the distance between these two

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
to now the distance between these two
circles<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.759> roughly<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:22.020> half<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
circles is roughly a little over half so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.010 
circles is roughly a little over half so
independent<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.240> also<00:01:24.330> depends<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> horse

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
independent it also depends on the horse

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.850 
independent it also depends on the horse
some<00:01:25.229> horses<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.189> bit<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.600> narrow

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
some horses are a little bit more narrow

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.350 
some horses are a little bit more narrow
through<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:30.090> long

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
through here some are really really long

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
through here some are really really long
just<00:01:30.780> depends<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> breed<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.890> mean<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
just depends on the breed I mean the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.980 
just depends on the breed I mean the
more<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> draw<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> more<00:01:33.420> you'll<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> kind

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
more you draw the more you'll just kind

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.359 
more you draw the more you'll just kind
of<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> comfortable<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:35.130> able<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
of be comfortable with this be able to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.450 
of be comfortable with this be able to
see<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.030> difference<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.470> how<00:01:37.530> much<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.280> want

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
see the difference and how much you want

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
see the difference and how much you want
so<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.820> already<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.450> another<00:01:39.600> circle<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.110> there

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so I already put another circle in there

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960 
so I already put another circle in there
you'd<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.770> overlap<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.670> bit<00:01:41.820> in

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you'd see would overlap a little bit in

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.840 
you'd see would overlap a little bit in
here<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:43.170> part<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
here and this part right here is the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.240 
here and this part right here is the
chest<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> rib<00:01:45.509> cage<00:01:45.780> which<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.860> also<00:01:47.009> called

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
chest the rib cage which we also called

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.250 
chest the rib cage which we also called
the<00:01:47.369> barrel<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> horse

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
the barrel of the horse

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.590 
the barrel of the horse
this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.500> where<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.730> rib<00:01:50.910> bones<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.450> up

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
this is where all the rib bones are up

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.110 
this is where all the rib bones are up
through<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.430> it's<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:53.670> great<00:01:53.940> when

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
through here it's really great when

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.390 
through here it's really great when
you're<00:01:54.240> learning<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.600> draw<00:01:54.780> animals<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.310> you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
you're learning to draw animals that you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.160 
you're learning to draw animals that you
really<00:01:56.670> understand<00:01:57.150> how<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.390> bone<00:01:57.630> structure

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
really understand how the bone structure

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.570 
really understand how the bone structure
and<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> muscle<00:01:58.740> structure<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.310> called

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
and the muscle structure is called

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.700 
and the muscle structure is called
drawing<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> anatomy<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:01.230> it<00:02:01.440> helps<00:02:01.620> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
drawing the anatomy because it helps you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.170 
drawing the anatomy because it helps you
understand<00:02:02.010> what's<00:02:02.160> going<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.520> underneath

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
understand what's going on underneath

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240 
understand what's going on underneath
the<00:02:03.660> skin<00:02:03.900> under<00:02:04.230> what<00:02:04.410> anyth<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.100> can

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
the skin under what anyth what you can

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.830 
the skin under what anyth what you can
see<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> helps<00:02:05.970> you<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.240> understand<00:02:06.600> how

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
see and helps you to understand how

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.620 
see and helps you to understand how
things<00:02:07.590> work<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.160> move<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> why<00:02:08.940> things<00:02:09.240> you

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
things work and move and why things you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.240 
things work and move and why things you
know<00:02:09.780> there's<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:10.050> bump<00:02:10.290> here<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> divot

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
know there's a bump here and a divot

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.850 
know there's a bump here and a divot
there<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:12.930> those<00:02:13.170> things<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:13.650> I

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
there and kind of see those things so I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.470 
there and kind of see those things so I
would<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.580> recommend<00:02:14.790> getting<00:02:15.240> some

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
would really recommend getting some

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.930 
would really recommend getting some
really<00:02:15.660> good<00:02:15.810> reference<00:02:16.350> photos<00:02:16.950> some

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
really good reference photos some

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.090 
really good reference photos some
Anatomy<00:02:18.150> pictures<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.110> taking<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.860> look<00:02:19.950> at

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
Anatomy pictures and taking a look at

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.490 
Anatomy pictures and taking a look at
those<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.940> here's<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.390> main<00:02:21.690> body<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
those so here's the main body of the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.620 
those so here's the main body of the
horse<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.280> basically<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:23.940> three<00:02:24.300> large

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
horse so basically it's just three large

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.180 
horse so basically it's just three large
circles<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.590> what<00:02:25.710> I'm<00:02:25.770> going<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.040> is

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
circles here so what I'm going to do is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
circles here so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.490> go<00:02:26.610> ahead<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.820> create<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.330> now

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
I'm going to go ahead and create in now

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.030 
I'm going to go ahead and create in now
the<00:02:28.920> legs<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> horse<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.860> way<00:02:31.980> to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the legs of the horse and a good way to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.820 
the legs of the horse and a good way to
judge<00:02:32.340> how<00:02:32.610> long<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.420> make<00:02:33.450> your<00:02:33.690> legs<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
judge how long to make your legs is this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.070 
judge how long to make your legs is this
is<00:02:34.980> almost<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> square<00:02:36.240> so<00:02:36.510> from

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
is almost going to be a square so from

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.410 
is almost going to be a square so from
here<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.620> should<00:02:38.580> be<00:02:38.700> roughly<00:02:39.270> around

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
here to here should be roughly around

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.940 
here to here should be roughly around
the<00:02:39.660> same<00:02:39.750> distance<00:02:40.320> from<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.770> here<00:02:40.920> so

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
the same distance from here to here so

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.920 
the same distance from here to here so
I'm<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.490> draw<00:02:41.610> some<00:02:41.930> invisible

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
I'm just going to draw some invisible

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.270 
I'm just going to draw some invisible
lines<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.320> how<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:43.590> are<00:02:43.710> not<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.040> legs

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
lines on how these are not the legs

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.980 
lines on how these are not the legs
obviously<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.180> legs<00:02:45.330> don't<00:02:45.480> come<00:02:45.690> out<00:02:45.780> way

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
obviously the legs don't come out way

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.960 
obviously the legs don't come out way
out<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.460> just<00:02:47.520> gonna<00:02:47.700> let<00:02:47.880> me

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
out here but this is just gonna let me

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.690 
out here but this is just gonna let me
know<00:02:48.120> how<00:02:48.360> long<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.720> make<00:02:48.990> this<00:02:49.410> worse<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.580> what

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
know how long to make this worse so what

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.680 
know how long to make this worse so what
I'm<00:02:50.760> gonna<00:02:50.850> do<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.090> I'm<00:02:51.210> gonna<00:02:51.270> go<00:02:51.450> ahead<00:02:51.510> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.660 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and
put<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.080> my<00:02:52.290> horse's<00:02:52.890> legs<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.370> actually

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
put in my horse's legs and this actually

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.740 
put in my horse's legs and this actually
starts<00:02:54.000> all<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.120> way<00:02:54.270> up<00:02:54.330> here<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.570> the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
starts all the way up here in the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.690 
starts all the way up here in the
shoulders<00:02:55.170> here's<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.010> shoulder<00:02:56.370> blade<00:02:56.550> of

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
shoulders here's the shoulder blade of

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
shoulders here's the shoulder blade of
the<00:02:56.790> horse<00:02:57.000> here<00:02:57.330> comes<00:02:57.990> back<00:02:58.380> down<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.740> here

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the horse here comes back down to here

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.630 
the horse here comes back down to here
to<00:03:00.720> kind<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:00.959> book<00:03:01.140> their<00:03:01.350> elbow<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:01.770> then

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
to kind of book their elbow and then

down to their first knee and then their

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.050 
down to their first knee and then their
lower<00:03:06.209> part<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.600> their<00:03:06.720> leg<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.790> into<00:03:08.790> their

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:45.910 
gonna be set back just a little bit
further

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.160 

and<00:03:46.460> again<00:03:46.670> just<00:03:46.880> draw<00:03:47.150> really<00:03:47.569> loosely<00:03:47.990> so

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
and again just draw really loosely so

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.510 
and again just draw really loosely so
that<00:03:48.200> it's<00:03:48.470> easier<00:03:48.770> for<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.069> kind<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.400> a

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
that it's easier for you to kind of a

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.510 
that it's easier for you to kind of a
race<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:49.970> move<00:03:50.390> things<00:03:50.660> around<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:51.080> little<00:03:51.110> bit

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
race and move things around a little bit

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.830 
race and move things around a little bit
and<00:03:52.520> all<00:03:52.640> that<00:03:52.819> so<00:03:53.000> now<00:03:53.120> let's<00:03:53.270> get<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.540> back

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
and all that so now let's get the back

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.260 
and all that so now let's get the back
part<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.319> legs<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:55.430> back<00:03:55.670> legs<00:03:56.060> are

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
part of the legs and the back legs are

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
part of the legs and the back legs are
going<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.420> start<00:03:56.600> up<00:03:56.690> right<00:03:56.840> here<00:03:57.020> with<00:03:57.170> the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
going to start up right here with the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.530 
going to start up right here with the
hip<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.740> they're<00:03:57.860> gonna<00:03:57.980> go<00:03:58.250> down<00:03:58.760> kind<00:03:59.510> of

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
hip and they're gonna go down kind of

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.070 
hip and they're gonna go down kind of
did<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.780> first<00:04:00.520> kind<00:04:01.520> of<00:04:01.610> knee<00:04:02.030> muscle<00:04:02.780> here

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
did the first kind of knee muscle here

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.630 
did the first kind of knee muscle here
and<00:04:03.200> it's<00:04:03.350> going<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.560> go<00:04:03.680> back<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.250> back<00:04:04.430> of

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
and it's going to go back to the back of

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.610 
and it's going to go back to the back of
the<00:04:04.730> leg<00:04:07.630> there's<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.690> joint<00:04:09.050> there<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.500> it

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
the leg there's a joint there and it

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.930 
the leg there's a joint there and it
comes<00:04:09.830> down<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.920> back<00:04:13.070> goes<00:04:13.310> right<00:04:13.580> here

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.270 

and<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.630> there's<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.140> lot<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.590> muscle<00:04:18.130> right

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and so there's a lot of muscle right

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.699 
and so there's a lot of muscle right
here<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.910> in<00:04:19.060> this<00:04:19.330> part<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.870> rope

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
here so in this part of the rope

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.890 
here so in this part of the rope
kind<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.340> wraps<00:04:21.850> around<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.660> then<00:04:22.870> just

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
kind of wraps around and then just

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.260 
kind of wraps around and then just
tapers<00:04:23.710> alone<00:04:24.190> kind<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.550> follows<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:25.000> along

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
tapers alone kind of follows that along

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.080 
tapers alone kind of follows that along
there<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.710> muscle<00:04:27.400> just<00:04:27.640> goes<00:04:27.820> really

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
there and this muscle just goes really

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.990 
there and this muscle just goes really
nice<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.510> tight<00:04:29.070> once<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.190> gets<00:04:30.340> back<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.790> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
nice and tight once it gets back to the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.180 
nice and tight once it gets back to the
kind<00:04:31.420> of<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.570> back<00:04:31.750> part<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.230> leg<00:04:32.410> again

straight<00:05:11.130> line<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.490> want<00:05:11.669> it<00:05:11.759> to<00:05:11.850> kind<00:05:12.060> of

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
straight line you want it to kind of

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.300 
straight line you want it to kind of
swoop<00:05:12.539> down<00:05:12.570> just<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.259> little<00:05:13.289> bit<00:05:13.710> kind<00:05:14.250> of

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
swoop down just a little bit kind of

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.070 
swoop down just a little bit kind of
follow<00:05:14.520> this<00:05:14.729> contour<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.389> this<00:05:15.539> circle<00:05:15.930> here

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
follow this contour of this circle here

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.050 
follow this contour of this circle here
a<00:05:16.139> little<00:05:16.350> bit<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.979> it<00:05:17.370> just<00:05:17.550> wraps<00:05:17.850> around

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
a little bit and it just wraps around

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.420 
a little bit and it just wraps around
and<00:05:18.449> then<00:05:18.600> kind<00:05:18.900> of<00:05:18.960> heads<00:05:19.259> on<00:05:19.500> up<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:20.130> into

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
and then kind of heads on up and into

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.580 
and then kind of heads on up and into
the<00:05:20.550> flanks<00:05:20.990> now<00:05:21.990> we'll<00:05:22.139> go<00:05:22.199> ahead<00:05:22.259> and<00:05:22.380> put

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
the flanks now we'll go ahead and put

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.110 
the flanks now we'll go ahead and put
the<00:05:22.680> neck<00:05:22.949> in<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.370> neck<00:05:23.580> usually

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
the neck in and the neck usually

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.510 
the neck in and the neck usually
connects<00:05:24.479> about<00:05:24.870> if<00:05:25.320> you<00:05:25.470> got<00:05:26.039> this<00:05:26.160> little

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
connects about if you got this little

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.890 
connects about if you got this little
under<00:05:27.350> halfway<00:05:28.550> so<00:05:29.550> all<00:05:29.910> along<00:05:30.360> here<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:30.750> your

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
under halfway so all along here is your

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.659 
under halfway so all along here is your
backbone<00:05:31.289> and<00:05:31.470> your<00:05:31.560> backbone<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.070> runs<00:05:32.370> all

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
backbone and your backbone and runs all

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.820 
backbone and your backbone and runs all
the<00:05:32.729> way<00:05:33.060> up<00:05:33.270> through<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.539> neck<00:05:33.810> so<00:05:34.530> you<00:05:34.620> want

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
the way up through the neck so you want

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.719 
the way up through the neck so you want
a<00:05:34.889> nice<00:05:35.070> smooth<00:05:35.610> transition<00:05:36.120> there<00:05:37.729> and

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
a nice smooth transition there and

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.159 
a nice smooth transition there and
however<00:05:39.000> you<00:05:39.090> want<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.360> horse's<00:05:39.690> head<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:40.020> go

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
however you want the horse's head to go

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.230 
however you want the horse's head to go
it<00:05:40.380> could<00:05:40.470> be<00:05:40.620> straight<00:05:41.280> up<00:05:41.340> or<00:05:41.729> kind<00:05:42.180> of

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
it could be straight up or kind of

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.850 
it could be straight up or kind of
curved<00:05:42.419> down<00:05:42.660> or<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.080> could<00:05:43.199> have<00:05:43.320> it<00:05:43.440> bending

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
curved down or you could have it bending

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.770 
curved down or you could have it bending
down<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.160> graze<00:05:44.370> so<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:45.300> horse's<00:05:45.600> head<00:05:45.720> I

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
down to graze so the horse's head I

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.590 
down to graze so the horse's head I
achieved<00:05:46.740> by<00:05:46.919> drawing<00:05:47.280> two<00:05:47.430> circles<00:05:47.940> a<00:05:48.090> larger

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
achieved by drawing two circles a larger

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.659 
achieved by drawing two circles a larger
one<00:05:48.810> for<00:05:49.110> kind<00:05:49.350> of<00:05:49.410> the<00:05:49.560> cheek<00:05:49.889> of<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.430> horse

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
one for kind of the cheek of the horse

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.260 
one for kind of the cheek of the horse
and<00:05:50.940> then<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:52.169> smaller<00:05:52.889> one<00:05:53.250> for<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.729> muzzle<00:05:54.150> or

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
and then a smaller one for the muzzle or

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:02.510 
and then a smaller one for the muzzle or
mouth<00:05:54.449> of<00:05:54.690> horse

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.089 

so<00:06:03.060> now<00:06:03.180> we<00:06:03.240> have<00:06:03.479> kind<00:06:03.930> of<00:06:04.020> just<00:06:04.080> a<00:06:04.349> basic

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
so now we have kind of just a basic

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.350 
so now we have kind of just a basic
outline<00:06:05.729> of<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:06.030> horse<00:06:06.240> build<00:06:06.660> up<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.090> have
