00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.450 

little<00:01:36.840> guy<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.560> not<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.270> not

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and so so that's sort of where I went

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.590 
and so so that's sort of where I went
completely<00:01:52.820> completely<00:01:53.820> different<00:01:53.939> really

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
completely completely different really

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.149 
completely completely different really
from<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> original<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.829> there

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
from the original there was there

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.330

first in the original series to really
and<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> makeup<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.439> quite

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
and the makeup was really quite

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.190 
and the makeup was really quite
fundamental<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.179> first<00:02:09.420> one<00:02:09.599> they've

where<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.350> think<00:02:46.530> maybe<00:02:47.130> there<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:48.560> reaction

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
where I think maybe there is a reaction

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.660 
where I think maybe there is a reaction
or<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.720> change<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.900> mood<00:02:52.140> or<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> transition<00:02:53.340> or

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
or a change of mood or a transition or

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.850 
or a change of mood or a transition or
and<00:02:53.910> we've<00:02:54.570> actually<00:02:54.780> sort<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.380> worked<00:02:55.650> out<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
and we've actually sort of worked out a

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.440 
and we've actually sort of worked out a
little<00:02:56.070> map<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:58.400> what<00:02:59.400> forward<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.090> what<00:03:00.240> back

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
little map of what forward and what back

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.470 
little map of what forward and what back
and<00:03:00.900> what<00:03:01.200> together<00:03:01.590> means<00:03:01.980> with<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.940> antenna

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
and what together means with the antenna

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.050 
and what together means with the antenna
so<00:03:05.240> he's<00:03:06.240> he's<00:03:06.840> great<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:08.310> trust<00:03:08.820> him

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
so he's he's great and I trust him

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.350 
so he's he's great and I trust him
implicitly<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:10.400> most<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.700> time<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:11.970> have<00:03:12.330> no

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
because they're my antennae are doing it

for<00:03:56.850> me<00:03:57.260> forward<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:59.840> curious<00:04:00.840> or<00:04:03.560> trying<00:04:04.560> to

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
for me forward is curious or trying to

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.300 
for me forward is curious or trying to
detect<00:04:05.100> deception<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:06.590> we<00:04:07.590> kind<00:04:07.830> of<00:04:07.920> thought

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
detect deception I we kind of thought

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.430 
detect deception I we kind of thought
that<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.760> antenna<00:04:09.300> actually<00:04:09.900> since<00:04:10.230> we're

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
that the antenna actually since we're

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.610 
that the antenna actually since we're
very<00:04:11.210> distrustful<00:04:13.400> aliens<00:04:15.109> that<00:04:16.109> we<00:04:16.320> thought

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
very distrustful aliens that we thought

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.580 
very distrustful aliens that we thought
that<00:04:16.799> these<00:04:16.980> antennae<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.640> were<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:19.250> very

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
that these antennae I were a very

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.159 
that these antennae I were a very
physical<00:04:22.610> extension<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:23.940> distrust<00:04:24.510> so

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
physical extension of that distrust so

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.420 
physical extension of that distrust so
they<00:04:25.320> really<00:04:25.620> do<00:04:25.800> kind<00:04:26.190> of

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
they really do kind of

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.860 
they really do kind of
pick<00:04:26.550> up<00:04:26.759> on<00:04:27.110> one<00:04:28.370> on<00:04:30.860> what<00:04:31.860> people<00:04:32.400> are<00:04:32.870> saying

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
pick up on one on what people are saying

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.279 
pick up on one on what people are saying
and<00:04:34.050> what<00:04:34.229> they<00:04:34.350> really<00:04:34.620> mean<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.990> forward<00:04:36.990> is

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
and what they really mean so forward is

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.820 
and what they really mean so forward is
kind<00:04:37.919> of<00:04:38.100> maybe<00:04:38.789> I'm<00:04:39.090> fine<00:04:40.020> tuning<00:04:40.500> in<00:04:40.680> on

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
kind of maybe I'm fine tuning in on
