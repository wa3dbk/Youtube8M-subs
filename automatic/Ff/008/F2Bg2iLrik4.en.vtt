00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.259
 know the little one was traveling in the 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.919
 company that my dad had 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.919
 I had front 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.110
 in the grape do not say 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.930
 good as long as in Argentina 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.960
 presents the innovate awards for example 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.180
 prototypes of this kind arise for this 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.600
 case corresponds to four students of 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.700
 industrial design of the grape that makes 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.280
 one year they are developing the 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.930
 Argentine electric motorcycle was part of a 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.780
 practical work of the subject 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.730
 technology and decided to move forward 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.770
 with the design of this product what 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.460
 they carried out and gave light to this 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.190
 first prototype that we are seeing and it 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.339
 it's about an urban transport with place 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.260
 for one is an electric motorcycle that is 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.110
 not only use batteries in this case 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.479
 lead batteries the idea is that you have 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.580
 lithium batteries this has to do with 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.589
 the difficulty of getting certain things 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.479
 in Argentina but they say that 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.120
 this bike as we see it with batteries 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.640
 of lead and an engine that does not have 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.920
 transmission belt and that can 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.970
 operate autonomously 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.119
 at 30 km it takes only six hours 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.880
 idea in recharging tb is that the motorbike 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.700
 serve to be transported within the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.790
 city ​​for only one person not 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.710
 it has changes but it is acquiring its 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.200
 speed as you go forward 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.539
 like children's strollers up 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.020
 that is not up to 40 kilometers per hour 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.820
 this is what reaches the motorcycle sudaca is 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.490
 a man who was a bit controversial 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.580
 Maybe they say they want to dethrone 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.140
 the bad image they have of the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.420
 inventions and products 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.700
 South Americans as in the past 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.590
 the same thing happened for example with the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.569
 products made in china 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.959
 strasburg those four guys created 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:01.700
 this product that if the truth and they know to 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.830
 how much they want to sell they are looking for 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.450
 investors so you can find them 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.830
 for example on facebook they put their data 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.840
 they will find the supposed page 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.690
 cultural the stipulated price is a 16 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 thousand pesos it seems to me that it is not a very 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.620
 good price considering that a 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.440
 scooter 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.440
 the same thing comes out so if we can count 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.560
 what do you speak 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.560
 to the camera
