00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 I think we are less dangerous when we find ourselves explained 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.049
 citizents 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.389
 it's scary all of a sudden when I see it's a country so little 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.919
 of jean-françois copé 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.230
 arrived two weeks after the exit on sarkozy that is an exit from the plan of 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.949
 exit 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.030
 Giraudier 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.419
 on the distance of strauss-kahn assure 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.849
 good bah let's talk a lot about the players 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.449
 on purpose I am often 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.550
 on the site is sure about the fate of the room over two years according to ubifrance 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.719
 Sarkozy 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.500
 it rained a lot quickly 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.940
 % 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.140
 with their master 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 the beautiful luxury trips to the bar 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.889
 find here it's suddenly I get angry a little 

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:48.760
 against 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.760
 the kiki media that come out of the replica of its context and which make 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.010
 because I'm not really 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.400
 I am happy 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.450
 I am not a sarkozy worshiper 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.590
 but I do not want to sound sarko 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.760
 percent the main target the door to be them 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.890
 like any good 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.260
 both cases something back in antisarkozysm 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.340
 and not just a little 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.550
 which ends up being less harmful than it should be 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.940
 we are more dangerous when we do not know about the painful world 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.160
 but more than that for what 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.210
 but I do not understand 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.570
 with over 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170
 we are longer 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.960
 I am 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960
 I am more abusive parent 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.760
 because in the speech 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.150
 I believe 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.290
 I think of each close thinking buy 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.290
 during this time it happens I think of all the people who have 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.960
 champion 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 to transgress 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020
 for the mans this way a little 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.750
 I hope to be able to transmit 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.830
 only by the secondary that I listen to sometimes if you there and which I know 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.390
 almost absent 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.870
 what they hit me 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.930
 while he is I do not find myself enough points 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.770
 ideologically 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 the intellectual mans I do not find that I master enough 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.359
 new economic data 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.359
 social and political 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.609
 presented as a point as commentator 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.859
 fuchs 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.379
 the bias of the moment 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.309
 comac commentator 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:25.919
 sufficiently relevant 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.649
 and I like the relevance 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.959
 before for example to talk about this or that writer who are on the set of 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.899
 to say that there are sometimes two 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.489
 or can we get along 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.149
 extremely the table 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.349
 I read 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.830
 little by little the case I look at the procession part I try to talk about this 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.639
 I know a little bit 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.439
 I am much stronger with the left 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.519
 kaya 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.350
 % with its contradictions 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.549
 unless 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.949
 but sometimes 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:53.479
 these hypocrisies 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.939
 than with the right if we look closely 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.489
 all the chronicles 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.249
 they are more virulent with a compromise 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:02.239
 because I know him better 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.239
 kardec 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.569
 attendance was lucky me 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.089
 to attend I watch 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.009
 targeted sites to avoid all that 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.209
 attendance 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.949
 blue jays barrel 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.169
 with some nuances 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.069
 we can not today 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.569
 Paris 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.969
 from the left and the right we did it in the 70's or 80's 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:28.789
 because 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.109
 of the machine 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.229
 the appellation by the Europeans 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:34.879
 the show 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.730
 in matters 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.239
 it's less simple it's more 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.839
 I do not know anymore 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.199
 it's inevitably more 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.569
 % of the current 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.569
 it's important because the red carpet on the right 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.629
 it is by this review of the sky 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.979
 there is no yard the fields 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.869
 the political commentary 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:55.999
 If I want 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 so at sea it is that I find a hole 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.719
 him original time to time so 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.699
 I can promulgate 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.559
 just a little bit more 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:09.739
 I would say the same 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.389
 that that 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.579
 I would find it a shame to limit them 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.579
 ahahah the milk that breaks 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.219
 politika 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.779
 I find that today for 100 m 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:27.120
 most singular deceased 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.360
 to make you smile 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.740
 over a year the solar pib is 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.400
 the red in paris the clezio and also on the bias of minutes later 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 on his own life especially that I find the exercise 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.289
 a little less messy 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.599
 that is to say, when we criticize sarkozy 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.219
 she becomes 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:49.219
 a little 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.419
 maybe because 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.309
 he has something a little 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:57.840
 and suddenly she 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.110
 julia risk 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.009
 these commentators 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.789
 and it's true that suddenly he loses a good ball 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.270
 on sarkozy 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.520
 I have the feeling that I have already heard too much 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.199
 and I do not like to create something I've already heard 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.569
 for months that all of a sudden on Friday night so what do I 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.349
 go swing 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.279
 on the scale of the Parisian 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.889
 dominique strauss-kahn 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.889
 when I want to surprise you in this position 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.879
 the return to the theater 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:29.639
 it's a 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.150
 it's a little game 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.039
 who exciting little 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.120
 and that I do sometimes 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.120
 because that's the contradiction it's next I want to please 

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:40.409
 to what I think of you 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.369
 and at the same time I do not want them to tell me
