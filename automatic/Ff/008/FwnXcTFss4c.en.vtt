battery-powered hot light that I've ever

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
battery-powered hot light that I've ever
used<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.730> several<00:00:42.239> reasons<00:00:42.570> first

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
used and it's for several reasons first

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.740 
used and it's for several reasons first
we<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.859> a<00:00:44.039> focusable<00:00:44.670> beam<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.600> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
we have a focusable beam which is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.939 
we have a focusable beam which is
something<00:00:45.929> that<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.710> see

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
something that you really have to see

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.770 
something that you really have to see
and<00:00:47.190> try<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.730> believe<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> has<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and try out to believe but it has a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
and try out to believe but it has a
five-to-one<00:00:49.469> focus<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.429> can<00:00:50.609> basically

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
five-to-one focus that we can basically

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.990 
five-to-one focus that we can basically
tighten<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.750> widen<00:00:52.410> at<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> basically

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
tighten and widen at will and basically

helps us in putting the light exactly
where<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.989> aren't<00:00:58.199> want<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.800> taking<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
where we aren't want it and taking it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000 
where we aren't want it and taking it
off<00:00:59.429> areas<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.999> we<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:01.199> second<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
really not that much to criticize but

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.040 
really not that much to criticize but
from<00:02:11.400> an<00:02:11.490> aesthetic<00:02:11.880> standpoint<00:02:12.120> I'm<00:02:12.690> not<00:02:13.020> a

huge fan of the big yellow trigger and

leaves a little bit to be desired from

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.580 
leaves a little bit to be desired from

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
kind of a tactile touch point of view

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.690 
kind of a tactile touch point of view
but<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.790> more<00:02:24.000> than<00:02:24.150> nitpicky

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
but that is really more than nitpicky

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.550 
but that is really more than nitpicky
if<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.510> are<00:02:25.630> using<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.959> light<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.319> video

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
if you are using the light for video

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.870 
if you are using the light for video
than<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.950> worth<00:02:27.099> mentioning<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.700> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
than it is worth mentioning that the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.760 
than it is worth mentioning that the
light<00:02:28.060> does<00:02:28.360> have<00:02:28.599> an<00:02:28.810> eternal<00:02:29.260> fan<00:02:29.530> that

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
light does have an eternal fan that

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.470 
light does have an eternal fan that
turns<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.160> whenever<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.610> power<00:02:30.819> on<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.239> light

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
turns on whenever you power on the light

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.780 
turns on whenever you power on the light
now<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.170> fan<00:02:32.380> is<00:02:32.560> definitely<00:02:33.040> quiet<00:02:33.459> enough

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
now the fan is definitely quiet enough

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.640 
now the fan is definitely quiet enough
