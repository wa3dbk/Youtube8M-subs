00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
reality it isn't and it got me really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.040 
reality it isn't and it got me really
frustrated<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> while<00:00:57.149> until<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.660> figured

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
frustrated for a while until I figured

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.830 
frustrated for a while until I figured
out<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.469> could<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:58.949> fix<00:00:59.399> it<00:01:01.399> we<00:01:02.399> look

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
out that I could actually fix it we look

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.500 
out that I could actually fix it we look
insert<00:01:03.840> does<00:01:04.080> nothing<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.710> me<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
insert does nothing for me so what I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.260 
insert does nothing for me so what I
actually<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:11.570> once<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.780> closes<00:01:13.229> out

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
actually have to do once this closes out

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.910 
actually have to do once this closes out
what<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> found<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.900> need<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:18.920> open

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
what I found that I need to do is open

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.760 
what I found that I need to do is open
my<00:01:20.159> faith<00:01:20.490> injector<00:01:21.119> run<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.689> administrator

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.139 

and<00:01:25.299> I<00:01:26.299> need<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:28.119> not<00:01:29.119> set<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.539> to<00:01:29.659> auto<00:01:29.780> inject

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
and I need to not set it to auto inject

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.219 
and I need to not set it to auto inject
need<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.270> open<00:01:32.539> combat<00:01:32.780> arms<00:01:33.549> obviously<00:01:35.229> and

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
need to open combat arms obviously and

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.039 
need to open combat arms obviously and
basically<00:01:37.039> i'll<00:01:37.460> be<00:01:37.579> heading<00:01:37.789> inject<00:01:38.119> right

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
basically i'll be heading inject right

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.419 
basically i'll be heading inject right
once<00:01:39.259> i<00:01:39.439> see<00:01:39.679> that<00:01:39.950> game<00:01:40.159> guard<00:01:40.569> logo<00:01:41.569> pop<00:01:41.840> up

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
once i see that game guard logo pop up

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.700 
once i see that game guard logo pop up
game<00:01:43.429> start<00:01:44.860> inject

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
game start inject

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.430 
game start inject
and<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:48.430> it<00:01:48.580> should<00:01:48.760> work

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.250 

basically<00:01:53.400> what<00:01:53.550> I<00:01:53.580> found<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.930> keeps

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
basically what I found out is it keeps

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.310 
basically what I found out is it keeps
injecting<00:01:55.800> at<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.010> wrong<00:01:56.190> time<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.320> whatever

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
injecting at the wrong time and whatever

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.470 
injecting at the wrong time and whatever
it<00:01:58.560> injects<00:01:58.890> at<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.160> wrong<00:01:59.370> time<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.970> doesn't

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
it injects at the wrong time it doesn't

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.500 
it injects at the wrong time it doesn't
inject<00:02:00.900> right<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.950> process<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.640> wrong<00:02:02.910> this

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
inject right the process is wrong this

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.990 
inject right the process is wrong this
may<00:02:03.780> take<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.170> few<00:02:04.320> tries<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.100> for<00:02:05.820> me<00:02:05.910> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
may take a few tries but for me it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.460 
may take a few tries but for me it
worked<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.330> my<00:02:06.420> first<00:02:06.600> try<00:02:06.900> as<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.310> see

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
worked on my first try as you can see

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.510 
worked on my first try as you can see
sometimes<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.619> takes<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.950> few<00:02:11.100> more<00:02:11.280> tries

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
sometimes it takes a few more tries

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.500 
sometimes it takes a few more tries
sometimes<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.210> takes<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.480> few<00:02:12.630> less<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:15.240> just

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
sometimes it takes a few less it just

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.780 
sometimes it takes a few less it just

depends on how fast your computers and
things<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:19.170> keep<00:02:19.380> trying<00:02:19.710> I

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
things like that so just keep trying I

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.370 
things like that so just keep trying I
know<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.670> some<00:02:20.910> time<00:02:21.150> before<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.570> game

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380
