00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
four and a half ounces maybe get another

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:30.110 
four and a half ounces maybe get another
bun<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.600> we'll<00:04:17.019> get<00:04:17.139> these<00:04:17.320> horse<00:04:17.919> stuff

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.350 
here fired up got a little Weber starter
cube<00:04:33.750> in<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:34.699> give<00:04:35.699> us<00:04:35.729> about<00:04:35.910> 10<00:04:36.150> minutes

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
cube in there give us about 10 minutes

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.590 
cube in there give us about 10 minutes
to<00:04:36.540> heat<00:04:36.690> up<00:04:37.070> my<00:04:38.070> goal<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.460> get<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:38.699> to<00:04:38.880> 400

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
to heat up my goal is to get this to 400

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.600 
to heat up my goal is to get this to 400
degrees<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.530> we<00:04:40.680> can<00:04:40.830> get<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.070> dough<00:04:41.220> on<00:04:41.430> and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
degrees so we can get the dough on and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.700 
degrees so we can get the dough on and
bake<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:42.150> bake<00:04:42.330> them<00:04:42.510> so<00:04:43.169> we'll<00:04:43.410> see<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.650> a

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
bake to bake them so we'll see in a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.780 
bake to bake them so we'll see in a
little<00:04:43.740> bit<00:04:43.919> right<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.220> here's<00:04:44.400> our<00:04:44.550> buns
