00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.700
 A big throw of the Qashqai is for 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.330
 nissan a huge success the second 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.889
 generation enters a huge heritage 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.780
 the successful qashqai strategy 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.609
 the new one stays faithful, too 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.380
 compact class customers and suv 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.380
 serving equally to interested people 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.009
 this is very important overall 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.630
 wins the sales figures all the stones 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.079
 up is due to the many customer 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.460
 among other things the seat comfort 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.980
 entry position the roads outline 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 that you have with a big one is everything 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.270
 factors for a crossover instead of the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.190
 previous rather good and roundish 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 Optics are now used by Nissan 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.719
 beefy sharper design with grim ones 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.210
 Led headlamps luscious curves and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.140
 stretched silhouette of the new qashqai 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.090
 is both longer and lower 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.210
 We have three things that matter to us 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.350
 that was the technology on the one hand 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.659
 very efficient engines 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.180
 we have the lowest co2 value in the world 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.520
 segment with our 1.5 dci engine 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.500
 we have innovative technology in it 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.450
 with a passenger in the package that was great 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.090
 supported with knives safety shield 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.909
 then technologies all things which the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.390
 relieve driver and drive them in 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.920
 help 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.170
 Of course we also have a lot 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.340
 attractive price and performance level 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.920
 the whole very interesting growing 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.750
 segment nissan shows up quite well 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.789
 generous already the basic equipment 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.600
 is with all sorts of amenities 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.700

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 in the top variant teschner there are 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.860
 then, among other navigation system 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:02:12.739
 leather chair and a 360 degree all-round view 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:02:14.720
 system unusual for this class 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.320
 Qashqai is a rolling technique 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.230
 machine 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.650

 traffic sign recognition and and and 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.850
 more technology is hardly a variant already 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.430
 to offer 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.290
 the autonomous emergency brake assistant doing this 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:39.890
 means the vehicle heads in the worst 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:42.380
 case if the vehicle owner is not as 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.030
 also for as very helpful 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.980
 besides, we have 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.540
 other great features such as 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.060

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.050
 Parking assistants are all very helpful 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.020
 the next to the driver 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.819
 layoffs at the daily rides 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.980
 There are two diesel and at the market launch 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.380
 a petrol station a self-igniting 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.600

 just 1.2 liters displacement 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.640
 the entry-level diesel is 115 ps 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.640
 tdi with 1 5 liter volume 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.090
 the prices are especially in 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.030
 comparison with the competitors quite 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.770
 fair from less than 20,000 euros it starts 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.380
 only a bit of vermouth one 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:44.320
 all-wheel drive is there despite suv optik 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.320
 only in the 1.6 dci motorization 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.330
 The new qashqai brings under the line 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.400
 excellent conditions with around 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.530
 to fill the shoes of his predecessor 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.310
 a successful future is well 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.310
 nothing in the way
