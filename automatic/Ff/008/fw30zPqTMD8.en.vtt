they're monochrome which is really

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.179 
they're monochrome which is really
typical<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.619> Madison's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
really striking minimalist tuck the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.370 
really striking minimalist tuck the
really<00:02:33.480> great<00:02:33.600> thing<00:02:33.810> about<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.080> back<00:02:34.200> design

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
really great thing about the back design

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.100 
really great thing about the back design
is<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:35.130> deck<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.820> appeal<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.660> both

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
is this deck is going to appeal to both

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.730 
is this deck is going to appeal to both
of<00:02:37.490> Daniels<00:02:38.490> sides<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.480> his<00:02:39.930> alter<00:02:40.410> egos<00:02:40.710> of

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
of Daniels sides and his alter egos of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.950 
of Daniels sides and his alter egos of
being<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.340> both<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.760> gambler<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.660> magician

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
being a both a gambler and a magician

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.980 
being a both a gambler and a magician
and<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.680> think<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.600> do<00:02:45.600> gambling

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
and so I think if you do gambling

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.230 
and so I think if you do gambling
routines<00:02:46.320> or<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> magic<00:02:47.310> these<00:02:47.730> decks

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
routines or if you magic these decks

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.570 
routines or if you magic these decks
work<00:02:48.540> great<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:49.020> both<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.580> because

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
work great for both of that because

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.970 
work great for both of that because
really<00:02:51.300> built<00:02:51.630> into<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.020> deck<00:02:52.260> you've<00:02:52.770> got<00:02:52.950> a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
really built into this deck you've got a

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.180 
really built into this deck you've got a
couple<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.520> really<00:02:53.910> neat<00:02:54.060> features<00:02:55.010> first<00:02:56.010> of

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
all the decks are a one-way back design

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.670 
all the decks are a one-way back design
this<00:02:59.370> top<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.910> bottom<00:03:00.210> if<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.050> look<00:03:01.440> closely

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
this top and bottom if you look closely

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.820 
this top and bottom if you look closely
at<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.130> top<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:03.020> artwork<00:03:04.020> there<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.800> a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
at the top of the artwork there is a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.920 
at the top of the artwork there is a
little<00:03:05.190> tail<00:03:05.490> coming<00:03:05.970> down<00:03:06.650> from<00:03:07.650> one<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
little tail coming down from one of the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.830 
little tail coming down from one of the
curlicues<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.200> they're<00:03:11.160> longer<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:12.090> one<00:03:12.660> end

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
curlicues and they're longer on one end

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.150 
curlicues and they're longer on one end
than<00:03:13.140> they<00:03:13.260> are<00:03:13.410> on<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.590> other<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.010> if<00:03:14.070> you

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
than they are on the other and if you

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.030 
than they are on the other and if you
get<00:03:14.310> good<00:03:14.520> at<00:03:14.550> spotting<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.770> you'll<00:03:16.770> see

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
get good at spotting that you'll see

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160 
get good at spotting that you'll see
that<00:03:17.160> they're<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> one-way<00:03:17.850> back<00:03:18.030> design<00:03:18.210> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that they're a one-way back design the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.720 
that they're a one-way back design the
other<00:03:19.290> thing<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.710> they're<00:03:20.010> also<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.280> one-way

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
other thing is they're also a one-way

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.470 
other thing is they're also a one-way
back<00:03:21.180> design<00:03:21.420> from<00:03:21.750> side<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.050> side<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:24.060> white

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
back design from side to side the white

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.200 
back design from side to side the white
borders<00:03:24.990> on<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.230> edges<00:03:25.890> are<00:03:26.810> offset<00:03:27.810> by<00:03:28.140> one

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
borders on the edges are offset by one

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.630 
borders on the edges are offset by one
millimeter<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.650> by<00:03:31.770> putting<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.220> off<00:03:32.310> one

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
millimeter so just by putting it off one

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.930 
millimeter so just by putting it off one
millimeter<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.750> look<00:03:34.050> down<00:03:34.230> at<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.530> spread

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
millimeter if you look down at a spread

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.200 
millimeter if you look down at a spread
you<00:03:35.940> would<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.690> also<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.730> car<00:03:38.970> that's

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
you would see also the the car that's

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.080 
you would see also the the car that's
out<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.360> place<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:40.650> back<00:03:40.800> design<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.340> simply

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
out of place the back design is simply

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.940 
out of place the back design is simply
again<00:03:42.390> like<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.720> back<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.050> tec<00:03:43.230> case<00:03:43.440> it's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
again like the back of the tec case it's

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
again like the back of the tec case it's
the<00:03:44.070> M<00:03:44.190> logo<00:03:44.430> four<00:03:44.730> times<00:03:44.970> but<00:03:45.270> not<00:03:45.420> repeated

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
the M logo four times but not repeated

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.050 
the M logo four times but not repeated
but<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.350> do<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.710> diamonds<00:03:47.280> all<00:03:47.730> lined

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
but you do have the diamonds all lined

this is the familiar side that you and I

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.820 
this is the familiar side that you and I
would<00:04:35.759> see<00:04:35.939> if<00:04:36.120> we<00:04:36.150> had<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.479> border<00:04:37.110> deck<00:04:37.319> which

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
would see if we had a border deck which

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.379 
would see if we had a border deck which
means<00:04:38.069> when<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:38.280> have<00:04:38.520> your<00:04:38.759> cards<00:04:39.120> going

this way you get a completely different

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.670 
this way you get a completely different
pattern<00:04:41.729> so<00:04:42.120> again<00:04:42.539> I<00:04:42.780> think<00:04:43.050> this<00:04:43.289> is<00:04:43.409> a<00:04:43.439> great
