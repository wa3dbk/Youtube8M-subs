collector<00:00:18.930> would<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.289> collect<00:00:19.619> these

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
collector would not collect these

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.279 
collector would not collect these
I<00:00:20.039> even<00:00:20.759> myself<00:00:21.240> don't<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.630> them<00:00:21.839> because<00:00:22.259> I

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
I even myself don't have them because I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
I even myself don't have them because I
don't<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> space<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:24.210> also<00:00:24.240> I

think<00:00:24.839> they're<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.169> little<00:00:25.230> bit<00:00:25.410> limited<00:00:25.800> in

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
think they're a little bit limited in

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.890 
think they're a little bit limited in
terms<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.490> display<00:00:27.179> options<00:00:27.599> because<00:00:27.869> they

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
terms of display options because they

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.310 
terms of display options because they
just<00:00:28.230> sit<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.800> light<00:00:29.009> up<00:00:29.220> however<00:00:29.699> a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.410 
attention when I saw this at secret base
was<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.530> paint<00:01:40.800> app<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.420> phenomenal

was that the paint app is phenomenal
when<00:01:42.690> I<00:01:42.810> mean<00:01:43.020> phenomenal<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.800> probably

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
when I mean phenomenal it probably

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.010

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.310 
I saw this compared to the the 2.0 war
machine<00:02:02.820> whereas<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> dark<00:02:03.960> gray

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320

the<00:02:07.260> paint<00:02:07.590> app<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.220> contrast<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.119> see

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the paint app is so contrast you can see

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.490 
the paint app is so contrast you can see
it<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> drew

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it and it drew

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.890 
it and it drew
mean<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:11.550> much<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> saw<00:02:12.600> this<00:02:12.720> I'm

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
mean so much more when I saw this I'm

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.740 
mean so much more when I saw this I'm
thinking<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:14.100> will<00:02:14.550> be<00:02:14.700> an<00:02:14.790> amazing<00:02:15.180> paint

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750

app on a war machine which leads me on

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.860 
app on a war machine which leads me on
to<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> next<00:02:18.420> thing<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:20.210> think<00:02:21.210> this<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to the next thing I think this is a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.600 
to the next thing I think this is a
teaser<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.770> when<00:02:22.950> they<00:02:23.100> release<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
teaser for when they release the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.180 
teaser for when they release the
one-in-six<00:02:24.180> scale<00:02:24.570> war<00:02:25.110> machine<00:02:25.440> age<00:02:25.920> of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
one-in-six scale war machine age of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.850 
one-in-six scale war machine age of
Ultron<00:02:26.520> version<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.900> reason<00:02:28.290> why<00:02:28.440> I'm<00:02:28.590> saying

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
Ultron version the reason why I'm saying

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.890 
Ultron version the reason why I'm saying
that<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.910> look<00:02:30.120> at<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> markings

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that is that if you look at the markings

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.050 
that is that if you look at the markings
and<00:02:31.320> I'm<00:02:31.740> sure<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.220> will<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.490> revealed<00:02:32.910> in

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
and I'm sure this will be revealed in

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.380 
and I'm sure this will be revealed in
the<00:02:33.209> film<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:34.020> markings<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.740> shoulder<00:02:35.220> is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
the film the markings on the shoulder is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.300 
the film the markings on the shoulder is
identical<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.810> original<00:02:36.959> war<00:02:37.890> machine

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
identical to the original war machine

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.780 
identical to the original war machine
1.0<00:02:39.300> from<00:02:39.600> Iron<00:02:39.900> Man<00:02:40.080> 2<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.490> see<00:02:41.670> that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
1.0 from Iron Man 2 and you see that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.210 
1.0 from Iron Man 2 and you see that
later<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.600> slides<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:43.980> very

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
later on in the slides so it's very

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.000 
later on in the slides so it's very
likely<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:45.060> hot<00:02:45.600> toys<00:02:45.840> will<00:02:46.080> announce<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.800> 1

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
likely that hot toys will announce the 1

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.660 
likely that hot toys will announce the 1

think<00:02:54.810> you'll<00:02:54.959> be<00:02:55.110> diecast

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
think you'll be diecast

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.560 
think you'll be diecast
I'm<00:02:55.890> pretty<00:02:56.520> sure<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.820> will<00:02:56.940> be<00:02:57.120> diecast

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
I'm pretty sure it will be diecast

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.180 
I'm pretty sure it will be diecast
because<00:02:57.930> they<00:02:58.080> have<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.410> same<00:02:58.590> molds<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
because they have the same molds and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.530 
because they have the same molds and
they've<00:02:59.310> got<00:02:59.489> all<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> technology<00:02:59.940> already

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
they've got all the technology already

they've got all the technology already
pre-done<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.560> previous<00:03:02.040> war<00:03:02.280> machine

took<00:03:02.730> or<00:03:02.910> no<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.020> see<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> different

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
took or no you can see the different

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.590 
took or no you can see the different
color<00:03:05.280> contrast<00:03:05.820> now<00:03:06.000> if<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.180> put<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.390> side<00:03:06.570> to

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
color contrast now if you put it side to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.350 
color contrast now if you put it side to
side<00:03:06.959> with<00:03:07.350> there<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.730> other<00:03:08.850> war<00:03:09.120> machine

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
side with there the other war machine

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.979 
side with there the other war machine
you<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.720> see<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.050> very<00:03:10.290> clearly<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.989> it

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
you can see it very clearly there so it

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.350 
you can see it very clearly there so it
may<00:03:13.230> become<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.650> as<00:03:13.770> exclusive<00:03:14.580> over<00:03:14.940> one<00:03:15.239> of

Kong or it may even come out just as a
standard<00:03:20.430> release<00:03:20.880> but<00:03:21.209> look<00:03:21.480> out<00:03:21.630> for<00:03:21.780> it

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
standard release but look out for it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.210 
standard release but look out for it
because<00:03:21.900> I'm<00:03:22.140> pretty<00:03:22.170> confident<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.010> will

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
because I'm pretty confident it will

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.640 
because I'm pretty confident it will
come<00:03:23.519> out<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:24.450> you'll<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.840> here<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.170> markings

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
come out so you'll see here the markings

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.170 
come out so you'll see here the markings
were<00:03:25.980> on<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> shoulder<00:03:26.670> which<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.910> little<00:03:27.090> bit

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
were on the shoulder which a little bit

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.360 
were on the shoulder which a little bit
different<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.170> actually<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.950> same

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
different and it's actually the same

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.789 
different and it's actually the same
marking<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.950> war<00:03:32.370> machine<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.790> 1.0<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.500> why

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
marking as the war machine of 1.0 so why

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.949 
marking as the war machine of 1.0 so why
am<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.220> confident<00:03:35.730> they'll<00:03:36.030> release<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
am I so confident they'll release the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.900 
am I so confident they'll release the
one-in-six<00:03:37.530> girl<00:03:37.830> it's<00:03:38.160> because<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:38.790> a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
one-in-six girl it's because it's a

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.830 
one-in-six girl it's because it's a
one-in-four<00:03:39.780> bus<00:03:40.470> every<00:03:41.400> single<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.060> meant<00:03:42.570> bus

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
one-in-four bus every single I meant bus

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.900 
one-in-four bus every single I meant bus
that<00:03:43.200> they've<00:03:43.380> made<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.890> one<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.250> sick<00:03:44.549> one

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
that they've made that one in sick one

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.720 
that they've made that one in sick one
in<00:03:45.000> fourth<00:03:45.299> scale<00:03:45.660> has<00:03:46.380> been<00:03:46.410> made<00:03:46.890> into<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.549> one

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
in fourth scale has been made into a one

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.750
