00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.830
 yes, dear people and therefore cordially 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.529
 welcome to another video too 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.110
 assassin's creed unity and before we 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.670
 now about the themes illies templar and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.170
 of course I want to talk like that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.730
 As always, first of all thank you for 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.590
 your feedback also at the last episode 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.230
 and in general your interest in the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.369
 play and the videos of me to the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.170
 really play as I said 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.210
 thank you to you I hope it works 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.130
 of course immediately until the release 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 october and i can not slow it down 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.650
 I hardly expect it to be extreme 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.199
 on this game 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.410
 so we start to see in the background 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.120
 the trendy last and right on the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.579
 the beginning is a very interesting thing 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 pay attention to this pocket watch like her 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.370
 last twice he has ticks me 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.950
 just seen and this engraving below 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.469
 or the two letters a 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.629
 and e could be natural 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.129
 what could that mean exactly poor and it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.949
 could be who knows 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.840
 this pocket watch is also like from 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.190
 ubisoft already confirms a larger one 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 he is clear 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.059
 in the first part is now see now 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.979
 to see her again so she will 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.930
 any case in any way in the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.330
 role-play 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.159
 I am very curious yes in this video 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.720
 Like I said, we want to leave 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.460
 and relation to anno renault and that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.560
 templating generally what you climb on 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.509
 Now more of the focus is on us often 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.950
 when you finally finally got the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.659
 Announcement from Assassin's creed 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 where can i already have a two videos 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.380
 made if there anybody 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 interested or 1 made up for 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.820
 no matter and apparently device templating 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.049
 I really focus more on what I do 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.619
 personally good 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.720
 because even with unity to pull the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.090
 temple thing completely by the story which 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.380
 you already know small spoiler 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.500
 or simply that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.180
 Information you already have 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.549
 He is killed by Anna's father 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.770
 when he was eight years old he becomes then 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.060
 adopted by another man 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.950
 Grand Master of the Templars is and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.450
 this before a trend interesting 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.479
 thing or one 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.310
 interesting parallel to hot to edward 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.380
 died too and either 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.759
 haysom adopted by a templar and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.030
 because landed at the Templars on 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.560
 the end we all know and that only 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.670
 thus takes on a small 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.750
 interesting parallel and yes as I said 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.450
 elies apparently the woman dreaming going on 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:33.739
 Amos dreaming is also a boy 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:35.720
 Dancer and of course the question is how 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.630
 So the whole thing ends as I said 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.489
 so it is presented and you 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.200
 It looks like it in the trainers that he 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.650
 already has great interest in him 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.560
 and it is also said that it is fine 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.390
 rather a one is a dear 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.700
 Interest is not that she maybe 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.900
 no idea his stepsister is 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.599
 really a grandmaster maybe 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.080
 daughter or what am I going to 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.660
 At first not really out of it will be 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.040
 play a big role in the game one 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.609
 play a role and something else 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.450
 actually 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.250
 you can or just key in the fight 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.989
 Of course it will be seen as a figure 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.530
 Yes, you can buy them directly 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:19.100
 next to diana figure can make 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.750
 typically ubisoft right back to what 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.600
 Sell ​​pension and realize that he 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.370
 meanwhile also very interesting 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.310
 That's what I read that is 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.040
 there is a spin-off book to unity 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.109
 what again of oliver ground if he is so 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.970
 is being shouted is the 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.120
 is also the assassin's creed books 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.130
 I wrote one who read one of them 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.970
 think it's good I have only one so far 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.250
 a bit read are very good 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.069
 written and there are, as I said 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.780
 the unity of a spin-off book 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.790
 alice is what they write 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.160
 What matters to the Templars 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.549
 is your relationship to know and so 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.139
 continue because that is of course the question 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.240
 create the create it 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:05.570
 to work together 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.140
 and maybe common goals like that 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.180
 I reach the liberation of the people 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.370
 my biggest motivation is to know 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.810
 of course, to enlighten why his two 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.350
 fathers have been killed because of this 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.000
 he first joins assassin and 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.260
 it will probably be their own as well 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.660
 have goals 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.510
 But the question is, you can do it yourself 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.460
 who do it together and do it 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.840
 maybe not just one 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.510
 it becomes similar to a purpose community 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.340
 first but maybe that's how it is 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.620
 It does not end like Donna and I do 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.690
 are there only for a short time 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.980
 with community is because because 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.670
 who work together for a short time and am 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.990
 In the end , we know what happened 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.600
 Of course, this could also be the case here 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.010
 that in the end arm has to fight against lyss 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.700
 to put an end to that remains 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.470
 but apparently she will 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.260
 play a good role 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.810
 So I say yes I'm very curious 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.550
 what the relationship between them 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.830
 it's little like that and so on 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.020
 And of course I would be very happy too 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.010
 interest or I would have 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.960
 very much that you like it 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.000
 84 dollars becomes a playable character 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.280
 in a bad lord even in 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.480
 bigger dsi i mean if that's up 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.700
 already present as 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.580
 second most important character so far in 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.070
 unity next door and of course because so far 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.030
 nobody else was presented without 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.650
 that they sometimes can and 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.280
 So I recommend personally 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:41.120
 bock on it again a woman too 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.740
 playing with a woman in between 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.770
 adelina or apple I still remember 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.540
 not like the name 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.370
 it was a templar but like this time 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.890
 said the whole device is now more in 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.690
 Focus is also seen on bread and me 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.660
 am very curious what it than I 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.170
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.170
 gets 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.420
 that's my points as I over now 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.800
 I could say that thing 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.210
 Of course it will be natural 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.190
 Are you interested in what you are saying 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.250
 say you find that interesting 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.410
 this starting point that now this 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.840
 Templer more in the team back in the 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.580
 center because yes as I said for me 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.770
 Templars are just as much a part of it as they are 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.140
 the assassins too is a script 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.060
 and of course that is very 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:29.950
 interesting to learn more 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.480
 And this is just this point as 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.520
 the Nazis templin 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.060
 you could do that a lot 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.130
 make interesting as said in ac3 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.260
 when i see the moment where the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.570
 I also thought I had joined together 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.250
 pretty cool and thought cool too 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.210
 Maybe it works but I mean 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.560
 there something else 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.310
 father and son here it is 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.860
 probably apparently girlfriend 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.210
 happy if it ends there it stays 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.380
 Of course, wait and see if they are 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.970
 can pull together if that 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.430
 breaks up a certain point 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:05.110
 because they have different goals 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:07.060
 keep track of whether they end up boxing 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.770
 must or remains to be seen 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.900
 There is also a little interesting 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.610
 picture together card game unity so 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.650
 normal card game where he is the 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.750
 king is and she is queen and such 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.270
 are these are all small small 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.160
 nice things and decency will be a big one 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.600
 play role 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.770
 otherwise that would not be so central 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.600
 moved because unless the thought as 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.910
 clear white white baumann a woman one 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.740
 against not bad looks and then 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.540
 sell extra book what you have 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.190
 or it is of course puts it all 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.570
 with it is my stuff and that's me 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.010
 I have to say as I said 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.060
 Just wanted to do that on this topic now 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.580
 to go in a bit 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.470
 and as I said write your likes 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:51.010
 opinion in the comments me a lot 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.630
 care what you think about it and 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.130
 Otherwise, of course, I want to be like 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.870
 always look forward to a like 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.910
 maybe we can make the 1000 again 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.170
 in this video, but each of you 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.570
 has would be very happy 

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.070
 otherwise thanks for susi we listen 

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.120
 then at another video there is 

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.130
 Of course, very many 

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.650
 information you get in other videos
