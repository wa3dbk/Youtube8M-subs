00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.870
 my name is bruno teledisco rosa I am a dentist and I am part of the department 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.729
 scientist of the angels 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.159
 I'll introduce you to some of our products. 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.320
 the current fiber political system 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.019
 is composed of prefabricated parts in fiberglass in epoxy resin 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.769
 the purpose of these parts is to provide extremely high 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.669
 resistance and consequently strengthen the structure of processes that 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.669
 these 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.560
 the one indicated for the production of fixed and permanent fixed prostheses 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.200
 in composite resin 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.660
 and provisional fixed prostheses in limeira composed the ricci in the clinic 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 made in the laboratory the patient's mind director 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.360
 the making of this type of work is easier if executed in a model of 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.850
 management 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.290
 in the lab 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.400
 the work done in the management model 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.060
 allows for more attention to detail as well as being more comfortable 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.060
 for the patient 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.120
 in the plaster model are hall mark on the banks of the preparations 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.310
 dental 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 certain limits of restoration 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.680
 the point completed ricardo 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.540
 it is presented in two forms 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.720
 one anterior wall in another apparent posterior 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.829
 each of the models in three sizes the small medium grant 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.300
 you must select more appropriate according to the region and the space 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.760
 prosthetic 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.470
 the bar can be adjusted with drills in high with low voting 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.430
 according to the form 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.430
 and the desired size 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.530
 then 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 vaccine should be given 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:43.049
 the policy must be announced carefully 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.199
 always with very clean light the clinical coup 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.889
 applies on the podium with a thin brush a layer of resins and retail 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.169
 and for that decision to be properly polymerized 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.839
 each side should receive at least 20 seconds of use of the fotorio they pain 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:10.059
 the working model as well as 60 municipalities of bite registration 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.259
 can be obtained by means of a single procedure of changing 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.839
 it is sufficient to use in the period in which commercial 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.689
 the silicone molds and adhesion with condensation these two arcades 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.249
 molded partially and simultaneously 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:29.299
 can be passed mounted on simple articulator of the bib type 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.989
 the team is bitten as theirs this membership icon 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.379
 and these are two shaped partial arches already mounted on the articulator 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.109
 the prosthetic space has gotten so that this cut and the correct fulfillment of the 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.689
 fibria impregnated to intervene 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.319
 the queue is protected by an approved package after the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.319
 guy said 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.409
 the court can be done with anyone 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.709
 special people are needed to cut the tape delivered 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.779
 the political must be kept in the prosthetic space with a little disillusioned 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.719
 for a smooth operation of the fiber 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.839
 a layer of resin of 100% of the preparations is applied and in the portico 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.899
 the inter-ikea fiber positioned in the boxes of the preparation of the 

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.300
 inspectors 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.469
 and in the channel 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.889
 and then understood 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.819
 this can be done with insert spatulas 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.580
 or 2 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.270
 each segment of the pudding set fiber 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.059
 privately light-curing 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:50.519
 apply another layer of tar was born to increase the volume of the structure of the 

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.469
 prosthesis 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.680
 that the structure of the model 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.210
 to evaluate the following dimensions 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.229
 humiliated in the preparation post box 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.229
 three millimeters in the hands are holders of power 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.389
 both in the mean sense says 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.389
 as in the civil code 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.349
 one should check with the structure again in morumbi 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.539
 a 10 year old boy 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.539
 What is this corresponding to the girl 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.960
 one millimeter of rest 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.909
 on warmer days 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.909
 so there is room for it not to occur 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.039
 after the structure is cleaned with alcohol 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.039
 it should be signaled 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.860
 then receive a layer of resin visit f 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.689
 the leader chile photo polymerized as it has already been registered 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.159
 after the relocation of the government's decision 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:09.749
 this says that the application of composite resin by this time debt 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.749
 concluded 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.779
 with resin finish 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.490
 was performed in a conventional manner 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.939
 with a speech that polishing points 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.020
 one can then depart 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.030
 for mouth-to-mouth procedures 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.539
 final submission of the proposal 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:33.479
 for this 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.770
 regional cements indicated 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.719
 with an important segment 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:41.439
 which provides excellent fixation and high aesthetic quality
