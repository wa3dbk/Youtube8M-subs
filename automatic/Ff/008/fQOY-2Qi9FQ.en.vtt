00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.049
 I believe that in the first one 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.850
 half before we 60 before the first 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.340
 big chance we have to lead 3 0 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.099
 300 then, of course, much easier 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.840
 and then you do not need the help 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.689
 others to get the class 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.400
 I think we really have 45 100 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.590
 percent also gave just in first 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.240
 Accents me and we have there 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.910
 Of course, get involved 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.120
 it also plays very different 860 must 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.070
 We also do but we have 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.390
 Already admitted so to speak and 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.790
 they did that too 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.500
 and of course that's a pity 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.820
 The guys on one thing have been doing me 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.680
 side your light that you are looking for 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.280
 These do not operate themselves 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.320
 rewarded 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.260
 that's that's bitter when you're outside 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.120
 sitting sees that we are really dangerous 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.410
 play forwards dangerously forward 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.820
 stand out of the account we have completely 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.920
 Neatly standing funding has little 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.900
 admitted and if we then three 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.690
 have chances and you do not reward them 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.250
 and the first dangerous attack of 60 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.650
 tor is a course that is bitter is 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.310
 very clear if you go abroad so many 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.240
 high profile chances then gets 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.790
 that sure so but nevertheless 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.460
 not the problem in today's game 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.970
 but in the last few months where we are 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.070
 simply played too badly too often 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.380
 and the points did not hit because of it 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.670
 important that we reach our minimum goal 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.350
 have managed to keep the class 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.240
 Of course, we want next one 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.460
 week against karlsruhe win us 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.070
 to say goodbye to fans as well 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.929
 best with a victory and us 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.770
 of course also try fsv frankfurt 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.300
 still to overtake 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.030
 they still have a tough game against 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.820
 fc cologne and there we have three now 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.270
 Of course you want to get points 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.920
 always with a positive experience 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.830
 also say goodbye at home 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.330
 one or two players will too 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.310
 goodbye that is always such a 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.479
 a little emotional as well and when 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.520
 then you make a good game the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.420
 points reserves then that is a 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.830
 reasonable conclusion 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.090
 of course we have the season 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.340
 differently presented stands for me except 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.750
 ask everyone if they are shooting games 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.850
 or me and the responsible ones 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.990
 of course, we too 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.660
 would have liked to have a little rest 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.340
 without always a bit down 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.270
 to have to look like that according to the motto 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.550
 can still go wrong 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.980
 On the other hand, I also know that 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.630
 Of course, this team in the last 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.040
 year had a huge bloodletting that 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.420
 also the financial possibilities 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.520
 this club is not like that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.490
 maybe those from 1860 or others 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.310
 club and for the reason 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.600
 You have to do that in peace and above all 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.090
 to sleep over it in the night 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.080
 I already said I analyze 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.170
 have my opinion 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.790
 We will be one more week now 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.710
 then we stay for a few more 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.360
 days with the team there if you 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.830
 speak a hammer about the things and 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.340
 hopefully we would be the right ones 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.340
 draw conclusions
