hey<00:00:05.140> gank<00:00:05.410> I<00:00:05.650> hear<00:00:06.040> from<00:00:06.310> ex<00:00:06.580> bed<00:00:06.850> and<00:00:07.120> the<00:00:07.210> ex

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
hey gank I hear from ex bed and the ex

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.030 
hey gank I hear from ex bed and the ex
bed<00:00:07.810> vertigo

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
bed vertigo

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.759 
bed vertigo
now<00:00:09.670> the<00:00:09.730> vertigo<00:00:10.300> is<00:00:10.690> a<00:00:10.750> pack<00:00:11.260> that's

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
now the vertigo is a pack that's

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.610 
now the vertigo is a pack that's
designed<00:00:12.219> with<00:00:12.820> a<00:00:13.200> specific<00:00:14.200> kind<00:00:14.469> of

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
designed with a specific kind of

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.000 
designed with a specific kind of
mountaineering<00:00:15.009> in<00:00:15.309> mind<00:00:15.549> and<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:17.080> is<00:00:17.260> heavy

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
mountaineering in mind and that is heavy

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.599 
mountaineering in mind and that is heavy
loads<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:19.289> high-volume<00:00:20.289> loads<00:00:20.830> that<00:00:21.310> then

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
loads and high-volume loads that then

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.929 
loads and high-volume loads that then
when<00:00:22.029> you<00:00:22.150> get<00:00:22.449> to<00:00:22.630> your<00:00:22.750> climb<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.670> pack

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
when you get to your climb the pack

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.290 
when you get to your climb the pack
needs<00:00:25.180> to<00:00:25.800> compress<00:00:26.800> around<00:00:27.220> a<00:00:27.460> smaller<00:00:27.910> load

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
needs to compress around a smaller load

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.810 
needs to compress around a smaller load
so<00:00:29.170> there<00:00:29.679> are<00:00:29.769> two<00:00:30.009> things<00:00:30.279> that<00:00:30.519> set<00:00:30.699> this

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
so there are two things that set this

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.690 
so there are two things that set this
pack<00:00:31.090> aside<00:00:31.449> fact<00:00:32.140> that<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.560> top<00:00:33.010> pocket<00:00:33.340> is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
pack aside fact that the top pocket is

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.740 
pack aside fact that the top pocket is
floating<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.630> extendable<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:35.670> also<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:37.000> stout

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
floating and extendable and also a stout

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.720 
floating and extendable and also a stout
suspension<00:00:38.680> system<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.129> can<00:00:39.430> deal<00:00:39.700> with

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
suspension system that can deal with

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.029 
suspension system that can deal with
those<00:00:40.210> heavy<00:00:40.600> loads<00:00:40.870> with<00:00:41.170> a<00:00:41.260> rope<00:00:41.559> and<00:00:41.800> a

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
those heavy loads with a rope and a

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.990 
those heavy loads with a rope and a
bunch<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.460> hardware<00:00:42.760> harness<00:00:43.750> and<00:00:43.960> so<00:00:44.590> on<00:00:45.000> ice

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
bunch of hardware harness and so on ice

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.340 
bunch of hardware harness and so on ice
access<00:00:46.600> etc<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:48.190> there's<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.120> lot<00:00:49.480> to<00:00:49.510> this<00:00:50.020> pack

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
access etc so there's a lot to this pack

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.729 
access etc so there's a lot to this pack
so<00:00:51.030> bear<00:00:52.030> with<00:00:52.059> me<00:00:52.300> let's<00:00:52.840> jump<00:00:53.140> right<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.590> and

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
so bear with me let's jump right in and

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.549 
so bear with me let's jump right in and
talk<00:00:54.399> about<00:00:54.460> those<00:00:54.850> things<00:00:54.910> let's<00:00:55.809> start<00:00:56.260> with

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
talk about those things let's start with

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.520 
talk about those things let's start with
the<00:00:57.070> suspension<00:00:57.640> system<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.329> as<00:00:59.050> I<00:00:59.199> said<00:00:59.260> it's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
the suspension system and as I said it's

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.209 
the suspension system and as I said it's
a<00:00:59.620> very<00:00:59.649> stout<00:01:00.539> suspension<00:01:01.539> system<00:01:02.219> working

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
a very stout suspension system working

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.480 
a very stout suspension system working
from<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.699> ground<00:01:03.969> up<00:01:04.269> dual<00:01:04.720> density<00:01:05.110> foam<00:01:05.650> hip

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
from the ground up dual density foam hip

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.870 
from the ground up dual density foam hip
belt<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:07.510> wraps<00:01:08.140> very<00:01:08.830> nicely<00:01:09.160> around<00:01:09.670> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
belt that wraps very nicely around the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.930 
belt that wraps very nicely around the
hips<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.780> lumbar<00:01:11.170> back<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:11.980> it's<00:01:12.670> at

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
hips and the lumbar back and it's at

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.240 
hips and the lumbar back and it's at
dual<00:01:13.360> density<00:01:13.690> so<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.230> on<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.590> outside<00:01:15.070> you

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
dual density so that on the outside you

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.100 
dual density so that on the outside you
have<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.430> stout<00:01:15.850> foam<00:01:16.240> on<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> inside<00:01:16.930> you<00:01:17.080> have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
have a stout foam on the inside you have

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.880 
have a stout foam on the inside you have
a<00:01:17.230> moldable<00:01:17.710> foam<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.390> can<00:01:19.870> both<00:01:20.110> contour

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
a moldable foam so it can both contour

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.580 
a moldable foam so it can both contour
to<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.070> body<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.720> transfer<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.870> load<00:01:23.080> very

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
to the body and transfer the load very

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.120 
to the body and transfer the load very
effectively<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:25.210> one<00:01:25.690> wing<00:01:26.440> there's<00:01:26.980> a

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
effectively on one wing there's a

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.510 
effectively on one wing there's a
stretch<00:01:28.000> pocket<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:29.380> other<00:01:29.410> wing<00:01:29.800> you'll

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
stretch pocket on the other wing you'll

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.990 
stretch pocket on the other wing you'll
see<00:01:30.820> there's<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.630> loop<00:01:32.050> for<00:01:32.500> hanging<00:01:32.530> all<00:01:33.520> sorts

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
see there's a loop for hanging all sorts

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.720 
see there's a loop for hanging all sorts
of<00:01:34.120> gear<00:01:35.550> moving<00:01:36.550> up<00:01:36.910> there's<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.810> back<00:01:38.200> panel

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
of gear moving up there's a back panel

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.920 
of gear moving up there's a back panel
that<00:01:39.730> uses<00:01:40.330> foam<00:01:41.670> sections<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:43.330> it's<00:01:43.510> well

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
that uses foam sections so it's well

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.960 
that uses foam sections so it's well
ventilated<00:01:44.260> but<00:01:45.010> also<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.400> have<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.640> lot<00:01:45.700> of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
ventilated but also you have a lot of

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.060 
ventilated but also you have a lot of
protection<00:01:46.120> from<00:01:46.870> all<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.440> gear<00:01:47.800> that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
protection from all that gear that

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.190 
protection from all that gear that
you're<00:01:48.190> carrying<00:01:48.520> also<00:01:49.210> internally<00:01:49.990> there's

straps at the top so that you can

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.720 
straps at the top so that you can
stabilize<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.400> load<00:02:15.640> especially<00:02:15.940> when<00:02:16.390> you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
stabilize that load especially when you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.149 
stabilize that load especially when you
extended<00:02:18.550> there's<00:02:19.569> hydration<00:02:20.569> ports<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:22.040> on

up and grabbing on things and flapping
in<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.510> wind<00:05:21.400> so<00:05:22.900> that's<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.170> bag<00:05:24.440> now<00:05:25.480> let's

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
in the wind so that's the bag now let's

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.930 
in the wind so that's the bag now let's
talk<00:05:26.750> a<00:05:26.810> little<00:05:27.080> bit<00:05:27.230> about<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:28.130> floating<00:05:28.490> lid

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
talk a little bit about the floating lid

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.970 
talk a little bit about the floating lid
and<00:05:29.270> I'm<00:05:29.720> going<00:05:29.870> to<00:05:29.900> ask<00:05:30.020> Ted<00:05:30.470> to<00:05:30.650> bring<00:05:30.860> the

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
and I'm going to ask Ted to bring the

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.790 
and I'm going to ask Ted to bring the
camera<00:05:31.250> in<00:05:31.400> here<00:05:31.670> as<00:05:31.850> I<00:05:31.880> work<00:05:32.470> because<00:05:33.470> this<00:05:33.650> is

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
camera in here as I work because this is

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.740 
camera in here as I work because this is
an<00:05:33.920> important<00:05:34.430> part<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.820> pack<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:35.330> we

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
an important part of the pack and we

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.450 
an important part of the pack and we
want<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:35.990> take<00:05:36.140> a<00:05:36.170> pretty<00:05:36.530> close<00:05:36.830> look<00:05:37.130> at<00:05:37.310> it

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
want to take a pretty close look at it

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.440 
want to take a pretty close look at it
so<00:05:38.030> if<00:05:38.120> you're<00:05:38.210> going<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.690> extend<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.350> top

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
so if you're going to extend the top

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.630 
so if you're going to extend the top
here's<00:05:41.450> how<00:05:41.570> you<00:05:41.630> do<00:05:41.900> it

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
here's how you do it

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.200 
here's how you do it
there<00:05:43.640> are<00:05:44.260> should<00:05:45.260> go<00:05:45.410> back<00:05:45.590> there<00:05:46.580> are<00:05:46.820> one

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
there are should go back there are one

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:55.210 
there are should go back there are one
two<00:05:47.680> three<00:05:49.690> four<00:05:51.460> five<00:05:52.780> straps<00:05:53.780> that<00:05:54.380> manage

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
two three four five straps that manage

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.800 
two three four five straps that manage
that<00:05:55.580> floating<00:05:56.240> lid<00:05:57.910> the<00:05:58.910> center<00:05:59.270> one<00:05:59.540> is

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
that floating lid the center one is

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.350 
that floating lid the center one is
probably<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.890> most<00:06:01.040> important<00:06:01.730> one<00:06:01.790> the<00:06:02.240> one

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
probably the most important one the one

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.420 
probably the most important one the one
you<00:06:02.450> don't<00:06:02.660> see<00:06:02.840> on<00:06:03.200> a<00:06:03.230> lot<00:06:03.440> of<00:06:03.470> packs<00:06:03.770> but<00:06:04.040> with

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
you don't see on a lot of packs but with

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
you don't see on a lot of packs but with
floating<00:06:05.090> lids<00:06:05.620> so<00:06:06.880> one<00:06:07.880> of<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.030> problems

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
floating lids so one of the problems

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.710 
floating lids so one of the problems
when<00:06:08.630> you<00:06:08.750> extend<00:06:09.320> a<00:06:09.680> lid<00:06:10.010> real<00:06:10.640> high<00:06:10.910> is<00:06:11.330> that

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
when you extend a lid real high is that

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.710 
when you extend a lid real high is that
it<00:06:11.870> sort<00:06:12.680> of<00:06:12.770> wants<00:06:13.040> to<00:06:13.190> fall<00:06:13.490> off<00:06:13.700> to<00:06:14.240> one<00:06:14.420> side

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
it sort of wants to fall off to one side

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.890 
it sort of wants to fall off to one side
or<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:14.990> other<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:16.010> central<00:06:16.900> compression

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
or the other the central compression

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.570 
or the other the central compression
strap<00:06:18.230> here<00:06:19.150> is<00:06:20.380> integrated<00:06:21.380> with<00:06:22.010> this<00:06:22.250> top

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
strap here is integrated with this top

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.110 
strap here is integrated with this top
pocket<00:06:22.910> so<00:06:23.840> that<00:06:23.870> it<00:06:24.170> it<00:06:24.530> cannot<00:06:25.370> slide<00:06:25.850> back

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
pocket so that it it cannot slide back

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.790 
pocket so that it it cannot slide back
and<00:06:26.300> forth<00:06:26.390> let's<00:06:26.810> extend<00:06:27.260> it<00:06:27.410> in<00:06:27.530> the<00:06:27.620> way

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
and forth let's extend it in the way

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.030 
and forth let's extend it in the way
that<00:06:27.830> works<00:06:28.460> it'll<00:06:29.450> just<00:06:29.780> bring<00:06:30.080> that<00:06:30.110> in<00:06:30.530> when

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
that works it'll just bring that in when

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.950 
that works it'll just bring that in when
I<00:06:31.070> want<00:06:31.340> to<00:06:31.400> extend<00:06:32.060> that<00:06:32.420> there's<00:06:32.720> a<00:06:32.780> little

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
I want to extend that there's a little

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.780 
I want to extend that there's a little
slider<00:06:33.380> right<00:06:33.740> here<00:06:33.800> and<00:06:34.510> I<00:06:35.510> can<00:06:36.500> slide<00:06:37.280> I'll

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
slider right here and I can slide I'll

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.830 
slider right here and I can slide I'll
take<00:06:38.090> this<00:06:38.450> guy<00:06:38.510> loose<00:06:39.320> and<00:06:40.070> I<00:06:40.820> can<00:06:41.060> slide<00:06:41.540> that

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
take this guy loose and I can slide that

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.490 
take this guy loose and I can slide that
guy<00:06:42.140> like<00:06:42.380> so<00:06:44.110> extend<00:06:46.450> the<00:06:47.450> outer<00:06:47.600> straps<00:06:48.170> and

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
guy like so extend the outer straps and

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.360 
guy like so extend the outer straps and
you<00:06:48.950> can<00:06:49.130> see<00:06:49.520> that<00:06:50.510> we<00:06:50.930> now<00:06:51.080> have<00:06:51.110> these<00:06:51.860> three

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
you can see that we now have these three

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.060 
you can see that we now have these three
and<00:06:52.640> the<00:06:53.800> two<00:06:54.800> front<00:06:55.490> ones<00:06:55.820> that<00:06:56.630> loop<00:06:57.260> in<00:06:57.500> like

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
and the two front ones that loop in like

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.000 
and the two front ones that loop in like
so<00:06:58.430> and<00:06:58.700> you<00:06:59.330> can<00:06:59.480> extend<00:06:59.960> that<00:07:00.110> top<00:07:00.470> pocket

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
so and you can extend that top pocket

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
so and you can extend that top pocket
but<00:07:01.910> it's<00:07:02.510> controlled<00:07:03.050> by<00:07:03.170> that<00:07:03.700> Center<00:07:04.700> strap

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
but it's controlled by that Center strap

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.960 
but it's controlled by that Center strap
so<00:07:05.860> when<00:07:06.860> you've<00:07:07.010> got<00:07:07.040> those<00:07:07.340> big<00:07:07.610> loads

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:07.970 
so when you've got those big loads

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.090 
so when you've got those big loads
they're<00:07:08.480> not<00:07:08.870> going<00:07:09.140> to<00:07:09.200> be<00:07:09.290> unruly<00:07:09.920> and

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
they're not going to be unruly and

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.870 
they're not going to be unruly and
they're<00:07:10.880> going<00:07:11.030> to<00:07:11.120> be<00:07:11.210> very<00:07:11.510> well<00:07:11.870> stabilized

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
they're going to be very well stabilized

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.530 
they're going to be very well stabilized
so<00:07:13.880> that's<00:07:14.870> the<00:07:15.400> extense<00:07:16.400> extension<00:07:17.270> of<00:07:17.390> the

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
so that's the extense extension of the

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.820 
so that's the extense extension of the
top<00:07:17.810> flap<00:07:18.400> now<00:07:19.900> the<00:07:20.900> last<00:07:21.170> thing<00:07:21.500> I<00:07:21.590> want<00:07:21.800> to

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
top flap now the last thing I want to

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.530 
top flap now the last thing I want to
show<00:07:22.070> you<00:07:22.130> is<00:07:22.660> the<00:07:23.660> inside<00:07:24.200> of<00:07:24.350> the<00:07:24.410> pack<00:07:25.540> we'll

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
show you is the inside of the pack we'll

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.030 
show you is the inside of the pack we'll
open<00:07:26.720> up<00:07:27.020> the

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.040 
open up the

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.550 
open up the
extension<00:07:28.970> shroud<00:07:29.420> here<00:07:29.840> which<00:07:30.080> is<00:07:30.260> coated

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 
extension shroud here which is coated

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.400 
extension shroud here which is coated
nylon<00:07:30.950> so<00:07:31.700> it<00:07:32.120> will<00:07:32.390> be<00:07:32.570> highly

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.410 
nylon so it will be highly

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.040 
nylon so it will be highly
water-resistant<00:07:34.310> and<00:07:34.600> I'm<00:07:35.600> going<00:07:35.750> to<00:07:35.810> pull

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.050 
water-resistant and I'm going to pull

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.090 
water-resistant and I'm going to pull
out<00:07:36.080> the<00:07:36.440> stuffing<00:07:38.440> so<00:07:39.440> you<00:07:39.500> can<00:07:39.680> see<00:07:39.890> what's

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:40.100 
out the stuffing so you can see what's

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:47.830

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.850 
happening inside there is an inner
pocket<00:07:48.140> so<00:07:49.070> your<00:07:49.760> hydration<00:07:50.570> bag<00:07:51.020> would<00:07:51.500> go<00:07:51.680> in
