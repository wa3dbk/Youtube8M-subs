00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.010
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:13.730
 another letscho around simon today with the 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:18.050
 mercedes-benz 234 5 1 across the country 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:24.860
 I would say that it can not 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.660
 made so is not a real bus line 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.440
 but as for overland routes or 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.129
 longer distances simply yes the bus 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.359
 had the dividing wall rings for the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.370
 passenger in the bus driver a second 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:41.510
 staircase doors I guess one 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.670
 this typical I still know that from 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.999
 earlier from my time is still catching up 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.050
 every day by bus to the school that is 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.539
 cockpit looks very good games 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.870
 made 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.739
 the radio meanwhile also if I the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.739
 find right buttons 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:14.880
 yes I think it's done beautifully windecks 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 stirs 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:33.270
 These gaps can open side windows 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.270
 also 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.970
 that's this 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.570
 it would not be bad 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.290
 ultimately best 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.849
 gives worse 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.230
 it does have all occupied me pretty 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.230
 go out here 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.770
 so far not exactly lived whole 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.770
 b 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.430
 cannabis 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.400
 but I should be able to bring myself one 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.819
 but it must halt the menu bar 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.439
 make sure it's not tested for it 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:48.689
 the fans view papers but for that 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.689
 I came up with something 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.790
 works Council 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.840
 image 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.240
 to each other 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.620
 a little round 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.820
 it is a bit 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.590
 Not 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.000
 get over the euro 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.840
 this is how the book can be arranged 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.840
 am a great fan 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.130
 times 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:36.290
 good putties from the stretch 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:43.480
 Being experienced like this is also an electrician 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:49.820
 drive a little bit in there now 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:54.380
 A small camera does not rearrange the house 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.090
 also shows the front phase of the rother 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.220
 conceited mirror probable case before 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:05.020
 The cas is turned off as a rear camera 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.020
 of course a great thing 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.680
 I do not even know if I had to 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.090
 completely finished is definitely 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.800
 worth a download if that die 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.120
 wrong is fun aside so the rum 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.800
 Bus is definitely worth downloading 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:30.740
 Sounds like always under the video 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:33.100
 description in the music forum so we 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.100
 get by 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.950
 then I thank you for watching 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.950
 See you next time
