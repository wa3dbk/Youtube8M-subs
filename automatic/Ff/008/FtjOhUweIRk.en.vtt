00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
time is just a cool package but then the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.900 
time is just a cool package but then the
inside<00:00:45.510> candy<00:00:46.080> is<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.130> standard<00:00:47.370> candy

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
they cut this with a shape on the top so

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.630 
they cut this with a shape on the top so
here<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.890> three<00:01:01.890> cool<00:01:02.100> designs<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.430> wonder

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
here we have three cool designs I wonder

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.780 
here we have three cool designs I wonder
if<00:01:02.700> it's<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.920> pack<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> packs

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
if it's all in one pack so all the packs

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.960 
if it's all in one pack so all the packs
on<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.570> outside<00:01:07.079> look<00:01:07.770> exactly<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.399> same<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
on the outside look exactly the same so

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.360 
on the outside look exactly the same so
we're<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.890> jump<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.130> and

cut<00:03:18.980> all<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.340> way<00:03:19.459> through<00:03:19.670> also<00:03:20.239> sort<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.780> to

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
cut all the way through also sort of to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.819 
cut all the way through also sort of to
make<00:03:21.709> these<00:03:21.980> they<00:03:22.459> have<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.760> stop<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.239> notch

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829

from going all the way through and I

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.330 
from going all the way through and I
guess<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.630> bonus<00:03:27.049> about<00:03:27.320> that<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.739> you're<00:03:28.250> going

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
guess a bonus about that is you're going

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.590 
guess a bonus about that is you're going
to<00:03:28.400> have<00:03:28.640> more<00:03:29.299> chocolate<00:03:31.030> let<00:03:32.030> me<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:32.299> cut

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
because normally it's all the way

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.039 
because normally it's all the way
through<00:03:35.329> this<00:03:35.540> way<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:38.570> can<00:03:38.750> break<00:03:38.930> your

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049
