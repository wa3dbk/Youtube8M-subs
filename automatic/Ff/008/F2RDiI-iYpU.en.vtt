00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.660
 tells crowd bruninho sassetti back 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.610
 all beauty Bomclube see the path 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.100
 for you a take - out match in the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.230
 map villa and yes I am playing of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.330
 crossbow this is one of those things 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.189
 ridiculous that you just released the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.250
 item and think I think it's going to be fun. 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.240
 play with this and yes I tried exploded 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.340
 Stupidly, you can not 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.719
 In that moment, I ended up giving in to the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.420
 pressure from the guys who were charging me 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.280
 because I only play pharmacy and yes I 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.250
 I talk more if it bothers you 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.570
 overcome because I say the mass can 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.739
 isolate comments if you have 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.329
 will too 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.129
 but because of this galera that lives me 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.950
 charging that your game in a way more I 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.629
 said of playing the fall o ff which if not 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.210
 I'm wrong because it's a single shot gun. 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 That gives me a lot of trouble so I 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 I'm starting to adapt with her and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.230
 if there was difficulty going sometimes 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.699
 and sometimes over shooting and throwing 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.350
 A little later I realized that I 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.189
 shooting with a cadence a little bit 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.530
 best 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.060
 She works best gun you have less. 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.640
 of col then you kill more 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.409
 ease and 2 take you killed face alone 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.939
 that you taking too fast you run out 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.040
 losing this need then it becomes a 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.680
 tip for anyone wanting to play foul 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.000
 that 's what I started to adapt to it and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.369
 this match and I also are 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.979
 starting to use the ppi again 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 control freak in control of the ps3 tone that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.210
 You'll see the sights half off and for good. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.570
 to time but not last longer 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.040
 a good match again and I 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.770
 I swear to you dear 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 I tried, right, this Chilean goal was going to pass. 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 will have to go in that window and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 never and I think this was a great 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.899
 example I said in the sights but anyway 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.030
 Let's stop cutting the subject by coming back 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.030
 Speaking, I swear I tried to play. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.710
 pockets with the release of vls I played 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.299
 some matches but I must have played 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.759
 in total an hour and a half two hours 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.240
 maybe a little less and I 'm 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.820
 Too optimistic but I played a little 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.829
 I tried and I can not confess my 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.079
 take any of the maps so you think 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.920
 were actually map if you were to save the 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.410
 game 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.360
 the map there that is the crepe ruse forgot the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.580
 name 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.100
 I swallowed it, it's a cool pine cone. 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.860
 gameplay is very different from that of mw2 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.720
 This disappointed me a lot, not because 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.210
 they made some minor changes 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.310
 on the map that changed some angles of 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.710
 view that to me really changed 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.810
 gameplay on the map and beyond course to be 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.970
 a different game and by itself with weapons 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.820
 different and a bit of a control 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.980
 different would also already give it the map 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.420
 It was a little disappointing but it's an aunt. 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.180
 that people finally end up recognizing 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.010
 and ends up having fun on a map that has 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.320
 a cable car that runs around the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.209
 map I do not remember the name I'm sorry I 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.700
 I said I played so little that not even the name 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.280
 of the maps I remember is this map I guess 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.290
 which is a cool brand if it were a game 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.480
 with good but he was in the middle 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.310
 It was all right. I was going to enjoy it. 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.920
 damn it and love to vote for him until 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.280
 play but that's not the case and waiting 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.330
 that it will appear will not save 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.610
 mainly because they know that 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.050
 it 's not everyone who buys dlc and it ends 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.810
 a little more difficult to find the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.610
 room with must be so have a little 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.799
 more difficult because of a map 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.590
 It's still not worth it to me. 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.900
 It's true , dude, if you like it 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.060
 Holy shit and see my channel and I wanted to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.459
 to enjoy a little taste here was bad 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.010
 its disappointing because it really does not 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.420
 You do not like the game, I will not try. 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.090
 I will not mind playing 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.280
 and besides all the black ops zonta one 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.320
 The joy of playing face is not just because the 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.760
 people only find in the be not because until 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.920
 This is a bad example. 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.930
 find a guy I played bad not to 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.030
 call noby find the galley 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.430
 playing bad but I have found good ones 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.080
 players there and usually a galley 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.489
 Good people there at dawn always have 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.049
 a gal that exchanges a legal idea 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.549
 usually an armor 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.220
 This is cool, so I 'm loving it. 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.190
 player is that abuse and I will continue in 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.350
 mw3 season I tried to do this I tried 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.730
 back with Roberto for the black swan 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.640
 but I was left without the backoffice one of 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.459
 xbox for a long time and I on account 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.920
 I ended up, thanks, sorry 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.680
 if tight good was barely needed to take 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.470
 this wave but it is because of this I 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.900
 I ended up being forced to play the mw 3 and 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.910
 no and at the end i got the blackpool the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.099
 My friend saved me and then we 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.169
 assembled them for the old galley in the 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.590
 channel will remember that it was museum van der 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.290
 pi 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.210
 she will omega played a lot with 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.470
 also some people and the village too 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.240
 was playing with us despite 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.430
 to detest the helicopter he played for good 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.620
 in when then was I always tried 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.479
 go back to playing black ops or I have to 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.400
 confess this and it's being a moment 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.790
 great for the goal, it sucks 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.400
 sorry again it offends uol that the 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.400
 zinho crossbow brought the actor and looks 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.490
 now is the plan kill three bullets formal 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.680
 the idea of new crisis in the plant more 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.900
 Sorry you disappoint me, the moment is 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.729
 great I can not bear goals and oblicore 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.600
 together with a delight to play is easy to 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.900
 the room 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.020
 If you have difficulty, disable is the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.780
 of luciano your ps3 and delete your xbox 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.669
 or goes through a pen drive or xbox 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.650
 I then went looking for youtube on you 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.840
 will find out how you disable 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.789
 no ps3 saved made a video of leaving 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.550
 asked on twitter this bag of him there 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.320
 That he helps you in that, then man. 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.600
 The invitation is for you, you do not like goals. 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.789
 will play the world cup until it is a 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.550
 I played live here on live 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.830
 There's a lot of hackers there but I'm going 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.600
 Experiment also spoke of everything I 'm 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.500
 here in psn challenge then I will stay for 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.630
 on here 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.090
 so this is dear to my impression 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.880
 on the plc is that there were two maps 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.590
 fun but do not compensate 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.630
 They'll save the game, I did not even 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.460
 there play what is the full link and not your 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.200
 name is the one because the black album 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.860
 really called me to play a little 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.900
 more 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.370
 good is this match ended in 32 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.139
 neighborhoods 4 an excellent start for a 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.720
 gun that I find difficult to play 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.610
 for who was charging me there because 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.710
 excess pharmacies have a line 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.880
 different and nice to play and good is this 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.580
 People will close the video here. 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.320
 I'll ask you to rate the video and 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.940
 Leave a comment and sign up 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.250
 channel if you have not yet registered 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.250
 I see you in the next video a hug
