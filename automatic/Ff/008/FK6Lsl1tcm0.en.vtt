00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
accomplishments of past research you can

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.390 
accomplishments of past research you can
say<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.080> 1960s<00:04:40.949> there<00:04:41.100> was<00:04:41.220> this

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
say in the 1960s there was this

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.640 
say in the 1960s there was this
breakthrough<00:04:41.729> and<00:04:42.240> give<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.990> sources<00:04:43.440> that

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
breakthrough and give the sources that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.770 
breakthrough and give the sources that
had<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:43.889> breakthrough<00:04:44.340> then<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:44.759> say<00:04:44.940> 1970

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
had to breakthrough then you say 1970

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.360 
had to breakthrough then you say 1970
there<00:04:45.930> was<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.350> breakthrough<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:47.070> give<00:04:47.220> the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
there was this breakthrough and give the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.370 
there was this breakthrough and give the
sources<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.570> can<00:04:48.660> highlight<00:04:48.930> past

sources you can highlight past

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.230 
sources you can highlight past
accomplishment<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.460> can<00:04:50.610> also<00:04:50.850> evaluate

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
accomplishment you can also evaluate

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.689 
accomplishment you can also evaluate
weaknesses<00:04:52.199> you<00:04:52.740> can<00:04:52.860> say<00:04:53.010> this<00:04:53.250> group<00:04:53.550> of

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
weaknesses you can say this group of

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.820 
weaknesses you can say this group of
sources<00:04:54.150> whenever<00:04:54.900> they<00:04:55.020> evaluated<00:04:55.560> those

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
sources whenever they evaluated those

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.310 
sources whenever they evaluated those
those<00:04:56.610> techniques<00:04:57.530> they<00:04:58.530> left<00:04:59.430> out<00:04:59.760> the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
those techniques they left out the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.700 
those techniques they left out the
such-and-such

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
such-and-such

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.670 
such-and-such
effect<00:05:02.220> there's<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:03.000> group<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.300> source<00:05:03.590> it's<00:05:04.590> a

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
effect there's a group of source it's a

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.189 
effect there's a group of source it's a
fact<00:05:04.919> this<00:05:05.130> group<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.430> sources<00:05:05.639> did<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.240> see

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
fact this group of sources did that see

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.350 
fact this group of sources did that see
what<00:05:07.320> I'm<00:05:07.440> saying<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:08.490> then<00:05:08.880> of<00:05:08.970> course<00:05:09.000> you

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
what I'm saying and then of course you

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.180 
what I'm saying and then of course you
can<00:05:09.510> also<00:05:09.660> group<00:05:10.050> them<00:05:10.260> together<00:05:10.410> on<00:05:10.740> approach

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
can also group them together on approach

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.730 
can also group them together on approach
this<00:05:11.729> group<00:05:11.970> of<00:05:12.120> sources<00:05:12.330> approached<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.560> from

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
this group of sources approached it from

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.040 
this group of sources approached it from

sources approached it from a civil
liberty<00:05:19.169> standpoint<00:05:19.770> this<00:05:20.160> group<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.520> sources

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
liberty standpoint this group of sources

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.689 
liberty standpoint this group of sources
approached<00:05:21.599> it<00:05:21.840> from<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:22.139> combine<00:05:22.919> standpoint

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
approached it from a combine standpoint

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.230 
approached it from a combine standpoint
and<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.900> can<00:05:25.050> also<00:05:25.229> talk<00:05:25.979> about<00:05:26.310> their<00:05:26.639> talk

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
and you can also talk about their talk

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.710 
and you can also talk about their talk
about<00:05:27.510> their<00:05:27.690> conclusion<00:05:28.669> you<00:05:29.669> can<00:05:29.849> say<00:05:30.120> this

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
about their conclusion you can say this

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.189 
about their conclusion you can say this
group<00:05:31.080> of<00:05:31.370> sources<00:05:32.930> concluded<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
group of sources concluded that the

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.469 
group of sources concluded that the
techniques<00:05:34.620> were<00:05:34.849> effective<00:05:35.849> this<00:05:36.120> group<00:05:36.330> of

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
techniques were effective this group of

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.300 
techniques were effective this group of
sources<00:05:36.690> concluded<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.740> techniques<00:05:38.159> were

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
sources concluded the techniques were

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.879 
sources concluded the techniques were
not<00:05:38.370> affected<00:05:39.030> this<00:05:39.449> group<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.840> sources<00:05:40.320> said

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
not affected this group of sources said

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.140 
not affected this group of sources said
they<00:05:41.070> were<00:05:41.130> neutral<00:05:42.260> so<00:05:43.260> it<00:05:43.710> all<00:05:43.979> you<00:05:44.729> have<00:05:44.940> to

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
they were neutral so it all you have to

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.739 
they were neutral so it all you have to
find<00:05:45.419> a<00:05:45.599> way<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:46.710> have<00:05:46.979> to<00:05:47.190> find<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.610> way

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:50.749 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:54.579 

and<00:05:51.619> then<00:05:51.919> just<00:05:52.729> find<00:05:53.059> a<00:05:53.269> way<00:05:53.509> to<00:05:53.569> group<00:05:54.229> those

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:54.589 
and then just find a way to group those

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.319 
and then just find a way to group those
sources<00:05:55.219> together<00:05:55.429> and<00:05:55.939> discuss<00:05:56.809> the<00:05:57.379> sources

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:58.329 
sources together and discuss the sources

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:01.539 
sources together and discuss the sources
discuss<00:05:59.329> what<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.259> authors<00:06:00.649> did<00:06:00.919> and<00:06:01.159> didn't

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:01.549 
discuss what the authors did and didn't

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:05.679 
discuss what the authors did and didn't
do<00:06:01.759> you're<00:06:02.089> not<00:06:02.389> writing<00:06:02.869> your<00:06:03.079> paper<00:06:03.349> yet
