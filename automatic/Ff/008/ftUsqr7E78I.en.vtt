00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.520
 Thank you very much. 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.150
 As a result, it became a point in the form of three consecutive wins , but it is good 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.040
 Thank you for your feelings 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.310
 That's right Anu 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.450
 7 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.450
 Last year of the tour 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:26.440
 Is the over taking the title that this place 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.850
 Over a period of 1 year to Fu called Do It to love the next target 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.430
 Because we decided in 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.430
 Well that last year is 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.380
 I would like you to look back on this song that became the last third pole 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.130
 Jojo is 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.260
 How was that 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.969
 Well that's the beginning of that 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.440
 I was thinking that it might be possible to have a grill white that I thought of each school . 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.339
 but 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 The say Jan good bear flow to the badger is not a moment to assume 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.360
 Also from the beginning 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.890
 I have to think 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.890
 Though it became a battle 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.280
 I'm also painful somewhere 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.509
 To the Fu that Tsuta Shima kana 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.100
 Was 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.950
 I would like you to look back until the end of the semester until the end of the semester 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 Is not it 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.490
 Well that's a lot more difficult thinking and saying oh 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.090
 Applied to asked if a number compared to the second station th 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.659
 Than also it was less of Tteyuu allotted time 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.659
 Although the Tteyuu what happens is Tan did not know at all in my 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.360
 What kind of 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.990
 68 people shoes and hell safe 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.770
 Where 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.510
 at last 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 It seems like the victory has been seen 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.600
 Today is the prime minister's one-stop long shot 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 Tokyo University enthusiasts also came for support today 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.120
 Hmm 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.640
 How is it backs 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.619
 That's right 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.439
 Since decided that say Property Office here's Jinya 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.349
 Ummm 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.349
 I was listening to things that would come 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.100
 everyone 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.030
 Always say thank you for your support 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.360
 I know that 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:34.110
 You have a little peace of mind to Fu says Do good to not lose where you can listen 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.470
 But I want you to look back the seeds from here eh 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.810
 Impression that say that at times Hasegawa's two hesitation officer before was painful you I am 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.150
 How is it ? 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.870
 A building 2 with that investment after all 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.630
 After all, I am not always in the early stages 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.940
 Ann or rather a challenge 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.570
 I think that I have to grow 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.570
 Though 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.220
 Before starting, Mr. Hasegawa 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.319
 Wow N 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.010
 Enforced from such a reputation 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.660
 I did not have much impression of coming 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.780
 a little 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.260
 I was puzzled about my first house 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.760
 Become the third pole 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.700
 I also expect to some extent 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.600
 As if it could be done 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.050
 No. 10 and later Marly 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.890
 From the song year I waited, I will make a polite turn 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.670
 Would you I'm left to my impression there was a place that was conscious invite you 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.930
 that person 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.080
 It's a breeze . 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.890
 Will do and say, What 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:52.210
 Because I like pointing to move forward step by step 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.340
 Mind the thickness 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.310
 Maybe because I like processing and 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.310
 I think I would say in my own way 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.790
 With Mr. Segawa 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:10.349
 The left song name is good 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.349
 I bought today with the song title today before the season 3 in the form of a match of the song title 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:19.639
 Well and time eventually, but I do a thing called woman who first fought 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:22.749
 Would deprive also changed considerably is because the impression from the start of the national series 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.749
 That's right ãƒ¼ 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.710
 barbie 2 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.760

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.540

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.070
 Well first 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:43.190
 It was so from this big talk, but very much 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:48.700
 I am so calm that I do not think I want Para 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.700
 My roar 3 is a distinguished service I Do's composure did not have the time 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.360
 2 points 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.849
 Follow 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.889
 Authentication is that unusual or Ya, but it is telling me the bruises on the wind say Datte weak in early 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.240
 of 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.900
 Say trying to overcome Re in his 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.000
 The east is 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.470
 Appearing in the score of 3 stations 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.790
 Tanja no kana 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:18.510
 By the way, it is the first issue that we aimed at a while ago The goal achievement The next goal is 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.510
 Look like 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.350
 I agree 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.350
 I have not decided yet 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.309
 Excuse me 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:39.749
 not really 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:42.499
 I have never had a strong goal, so this is the first time 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.499
 Like close 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.490
 To achieve it 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.430
 I'm relieved at least for a while 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.969
 Well, 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:00.400
 It says to have a title 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:04.060
 There will also be more opportunities for button regular students to get out 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.690
 It was piled up even more effort 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.690
 It should not be 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.470
 Lastly, please give a message to everyone who is viewing the Internet 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.180

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.620

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:42.919

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.919
 The Fu that Do not have let me valuable experience 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:50.360
 Its grown 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:52.550
 Do you call it a figure or say it's a yearly compilation 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.790
 That kind of thing this time 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.870
