and<00:00:15.909> to<00:00:16.090> the<00:00:16.240> chemistry<00:00:16.750> what<00:00:17.349> it<00:00:17.529> is<00:00:17.710> about

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
and to the chemistry what it is about

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.650 
and to the chemistry what it is about
the<00:00:18.340> biology<00:00:18.490> what<00:00:19.000> it<00:00:19.090> is<00:00:19.210> about<00:00:19.390> the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
the biology what it is about the

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.960 
the biology what it is about the
chemistry<00:00:19.929> but<00:00:20.619> not<00:00:20.830> just<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.400> basics<00:00:21.820> of<00:00:21.880> the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
chemistry but not just the basics of the

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.519 
chemistry but not just the basics of the
science<00:00:22.269> you<00:00:22.359> understand<00:00:22.839> how<00:00:23.050> it<00:00:23.259> applies<00:00:23.500> to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
science you understand how it applies to

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.499 
science you understand how it applies to
food<00:00:23.920> so<00:00:24.189> in<00:00:24.339> the<00:00:24.429> food<00:00:24.580> industry<00:00:24.699> you're<00:00:25.119> much

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
food so in the food industry you're much

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.329 
food so in the food industry you're much
more<00:00:25.660> valuable<00:00:26.019> I<00:00:26.349> mean<00:00:26.769> you're<00:00:26.859> figuring<00:00:27.220> out

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
more valuable I mean you're figuring out

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:29.040 
more valuable I mean you're figuring out
how<00:00:27.519> they<00:00:27.699> figure<00:00:27.939> out<00:00:28.060> your<00:00:28.210> protein<00:00:28.599> content

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
how they figure out your protein content

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.050 
how they figure out your protein content
your<00:00:29.169> food<00:00:29.380> or<00:00:29.710> your<00:00:30.130> fat<00:00:30.339> content<00:00:30.910> or

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
your food or your fat content or

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.859 
your food or your fat content or
something<00:00:31.269> like<00:00:31.390> that<00:00:31.480> like<00:00:31.599> we're<00:00:31.810> actually

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
something like that like we're actually

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.690 
something like that like we're actually
figuring<00:00:32.320> out<00:00:32.469> where<00:00:32.860> the<00:00:33.010> nutrition<00:00:33.399> labels

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
figuring out where the nutrition labels

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.279 
figuring out where the nutrition labels
come<00:00:33.910> from<00:00:34.149> and<00:00:34.360> how<00:00:34.420> they<00:00:34.600> do<00:00:34.660> that<00:00:34.960> that<00:00:35.260> I

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
come from and how they do that that I

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.369 
come from and how they do that that I
get<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:35.530> use<00:00:36.280> nutrition<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.149> viola<00:00:37.660> biology

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
get to use nutrition and viola biology

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.700 
get to use nutrition and viola biology
chemistry<00:00:39.510> everything<00:00:40.510> put<00:00:41.020> together<00:00:41.140> and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
chemistry everything put together and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.709 
chemistry everything put together and
then<00:00:42.309> apply<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:42.820> which<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.420> one<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.660> my

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
then apply it which is one of my

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.049 
then apply it which is one of my
favorite<00:00:43.989> cars<00:00:44.140> so<00:00:44.710> it's<00:00:44.890> that<00:00:45.100> application

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
favorite cars so it's that application

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.880 
favorite cars so it's that application
it's<00:00:46.210> being<00:00:46.539> able<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:46.930> reinforce<00:00:47.260> what<00:00:47.739> you're

it's being able to reinforce what you're

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.069 
it's being able to reinforce what you're
learning<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.460> apply<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.059> what<00:00:49.570> you're

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
learning and apply it to what you're

manufacturing your product it's a pretty

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.760 
manufacturing your product it's a pretty
complex<00:01:33.310> process<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.540> have<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.990> like

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
complex process and you have to like

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.800 
complex process and you have to like
talking<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.460> people<00:01:36.490> about<00:01:36.939> what<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.509> did

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
talking to people about what you did

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.359 
talking to people about what you did
there's<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.380> lot<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.619> products<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.159> would

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
there's a lot of products that I would

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.679 
there's a lot of products that I would
like<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.549> make<00:01:39.850> definitely<00:01:40.509> like

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
like to make definitely like

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.429 
like to make definitely like
confectionery<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:42.520> candies<00:01:43.000> or<00:01:43.390> ice<00:01:43.719> cream<00:01:44.110> I

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
confectionery the candies or ice cream I

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.260 
confectionery the candies or ice cream I
have<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.950> develop<00:01:45.250> something<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.820> guess<00:01:46.000> kind

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270
