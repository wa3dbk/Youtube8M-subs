color number two so as you can see they

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.050 
color number two so as you can see they
are<00:00:48.890> very<00:00:48.920> similar<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:51.670> originally<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:52.700> have

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
are very similar and originally I have

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.630 
are very similar and originally I have
bought<00:00:53.270> Eve<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:54.050> have<00:00:54.800> bought<00:00:54.980> this<00:00:55.130> one<00:00:55.370> first

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
bought Eve I have bought this one first

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.800 
bought Eve I have bought this one first
and<00:00:57.190> they<00:00:58.190> are<00:00:58.220> very<00:00:58.640> very<00:00:58.790> very<00:00:59.330> very<00:00:59.540> very

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
and they are very very very very very

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.290 
and they are very very very very very
very<00:01:00.350> similar<00:01:00.740> the<00:01:01.370> only<00:01:01.400> difference<00:01:01.580> is<00:01:02.120> this

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
very similar the only difference is this

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.020 
very similar the only difference is this
one<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.720> just<00:01:02.960> ever<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.070> slightly<00:01:04.100> more<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.909> an

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
one is just ever so slightly more of an

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.840 
one is just ever so slightly more of an
angled<00:01:05.509> cut<00:01:05.780> then<00:01:06.439> this<00:01:06.740> one<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:10.190> this<00:01:10.610> one

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
angled cut then this one is and this one

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.570 
angled cut then this one is and this one
kind<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.120> has<00:01:11.300> longer<00:01:11.960> little<00:01:12.560> thingies<00:01:13.130> here

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
kind of has longer little thingies here

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.350 
kind of has longer little thingies here
then<00:01:14.330> Eve<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.530> they<00:01:16.370> are<00:01:16.430> pretty<00:01:16.700> pretty

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
then Eve but they are pretty pretty

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.850 
then Eve but they are pretty pretty
synonymous<00:01:18.020> but<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.260> did<00:01:18.470> notice<00:01:18.650> some

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
synonymous but I did notice some

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.920 
synonymous but I did notice some
difference<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:19.490> if<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:20.150> like<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:20.630> style

to<00:01:24.170> kind<00:01:24.350> of<00:01:24.380> go<00:01:24.530> over<00:01:24.770> some<00:01:24.800> things<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.580> are

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
to kind of go over some things that are

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.000 
to kind of go over some things that are

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
similar and what I think of both of them

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
first things first with Eve I think

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.719 
first things first with Eve I think
overall<00:01:32.150> in<00:01:32.540> general<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.200> like<00:01:33.229> Eve<00:01:34.040> better

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
overall in general I like Eve better

overall in general I like Eve better
than<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:35.210> do<00:01:35.300> cosmos<00:01:36.190> but<00:01:37.190> there<00:01:37.400> are<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.490> few

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
than I do cosmos but there are a few

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.110 
than I do cosmos but there are a few
caveats<00:01:37.850> Eve<00:01:38.630> is<00:01:39.020> more<00:01:39.350> fuller<00:01:39.770> than<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:40.850> one

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
I can't handle this so I mean itit -

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.320 
I can't handle this so I mean itit -
like<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.160> said<00:03:20.340> they're<00:03:20.520> very<00:03:20.550> similar<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.150> I

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
like I said they're very similar but I

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.030 
like I said they're very similar but I
prefer<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.900> cut<00:03:22.140> on<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.620> with<00:03:22.800> just<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
prefer the cut on this with just a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.830 
prefer the cut on this with just a
little<00:03:23.160> bit<00:03:23.280> better<00:03:23.520> but<00:03:23.820> since<00:03:24.450> it's<00:03:24.630> summer

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
little bit better but since it's summer

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.210 
little bit better but since it's summer
time<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.140> since<00:03:25.470> my<00:03:25.560> hair<00:03:25.710> is<00:03:25.740> red<00:03:26.010> right<00:03:26.160> now

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
time and since my hair is red right now

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.040 
time and since my hair is red right now
I<00:03:26.340> figured<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:26.940> would<00:03:27.150> just<00:03:27.300> be<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.720> little

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
I figured this would just be a little

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.280 
I figured this would just be a little
bit<00:03:28.230> less<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.940> dramatic<00:03:29.940> change<00:03:30.290> then

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
bit less of a dramatic change then

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.620 
bit less of a dramatic change then
trying<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.130> put<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.400> Eve<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.300> her<00:03:33.420> from

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
trying to put on Eve so this her from

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.350 
trying to put on Eve so this her from
the<00:03:33.690> front<00:03:33.990> and<00:03:34.640> one<00:03:35.640> thing<00:03:35.790> about<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.180> one

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
the front and one thing about this one

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.750 
the front and one thing about this one
their<00:03:36.570> bangs<00:03:36.810> are<00:03:37.110> they're<00:03:38.010> both<00:03:38.190> full<00:03:38.460> bangs

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
their bangs are they're both full bangs

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.820 
their bangs are they're both full bangs
but<00:03:39.030> Eve<00:03:39.240> has<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.480> fuller<00:03:39.810> bang<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.680> just

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
but Eve has a fuller bang so I just

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.680 
but Eve has a fuller bang so I just
think<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.130> just<00:03:41.190> more<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.670> cure<00:03:41.940> Tudor

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
think it's just more of a cure Tudor

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
it's really really cute this is the back

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.449 
it's really really cute this is the back
so<00:03:52.980> playing<00:03:53.959> playing<00:03:54.959> back<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.680> would<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.340> it

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
so playing playing back I would like it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.370 
so playing playing back I would like it
to<00:03:56.490> be<00:03:56.580> like<00:03:56.670> more<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.209> more<00:03:57.270> angle<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.020> it's

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
to be like more and more angle but it's

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.250 
to be like more and more angle but it's
fine<00:03:58.650> even<00:03:59.580> just<00:04:00.270> slightly<00:04:00.540> more<00:04:00.810> angled

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
fine even just slightly more angled

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.870 
fine even just slightly more angled
which<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.650> why<00:04:01.770> I<00:04:01.800> think<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.730> little

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
which is why I think I like it a little

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.800 
which is why I think I like it a little
bit<00:04:03.030> better<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.920> yeah<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.490> mean<00:04:05.760> she<00:04:06.030> sheds<00:04:06.330> they

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
bit better so yeah I mean she sheds they

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.390

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
both shed but this one sheds just a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.610 
both shed but this one sheds just a
little<00:04:08.610> bit<00:04:08.730> more<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.240> think<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.380> really
