00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.670
 hi to all guys and welcome back a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
 another video of your raccoon on 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.840
 raccoon here on jinba network and I give you 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.580
 also welcome this second 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.740
 episode of my new column on 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 call of duty black ops 2 where we will go 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.580
 to do the map tutorial admire 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.449
 one of the new maps anyway 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.670
 installed thanks to the new dlc in short 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.039
 new is to say little time left 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 makes black ops two the first clips that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.460
 we are going to see are these 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.770
 tail ballistic knife clip of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.620
 ballistic knife possible on the two 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.840
 flags respectively aec 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.809
 this network looks at you right now at 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.700
 precise head in which the faina gem is 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.710
 but it is that note on the flag in which 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 you will have to go right to the base of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 that palm you saw raising the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.770
 aim for maximum and shoot clearly in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.539
 direction of the flag this other 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.309
 instead it's a bit more complicated because 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.930
 you will have to hit exactly with the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.600
 palm leaf on the ground 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 clearly on the other side of the spot 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.359
 however, the fact remains the same 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 to aim at the maximum because 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.010
 however we are talking about knives 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.909
 ballistic so it is normal that it should 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.040
 very 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.479
 in short, a very high height for 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.970
 being able to make him do some work 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.920
 parable, however, should succeed 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.409
 pretty good except for the fact 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.240
 that this time the aim 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 now you will have to take very precise on the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 flag but you could also pull 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 slightly to the right you should 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.750
 being able to catch him anyway 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.729
 this instead is a possible clip 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.890
 thanks to the tom okker no longer with the knife 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.680
 ballistic on the search and destroy e 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450
 could also come to me a great one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.700
 great kirkham really this is me here 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.439
 liked me right in the first person 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
 when, in short, when it succeeded 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.119
 you will need to be able to place the bomb 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.890
 on the other side of the objective or 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.119
 between the goal is the wall of the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.549
 construction behind it 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.990
 then come over to the other side 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.759
 in short, because the map is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.920
 right across the map e 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.710
 you will have to position yourself clearly in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.079
 feet at the foot of that pole it should 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.909
 be exactly on the opposite side 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.610
 of the side of the car there 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.140
 you will find yourself clearly up front 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.569
 aims at the maximum bet towards 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.080
 the goal but the tome you will have to do 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.950
 not 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.960
 a rebound but well 2 rebounds 1 on the 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.640
 on the roof on the roof rule of 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.340
 that building is one too 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.680
 on the lens if it could also succeed 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.240
 without bounces good for you anyway for 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.640
 how my experience has been 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.310
 managed to almost only thanks to those 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.960
 bounces lee that look like they seem 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.850
 are essential 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.700
 this is another tone clip e 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.010
 possible by say part a part of 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.260
 spot especially should come there well 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.390
 right at the beginning of the round 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.880
 when you are still capturing the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.350
 flags because if you look closely I am 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.870
 managed to admire exactly the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.450
 flag, however, due to a small glik 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.790
 that there is still in the game the tomo will go 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.950
 slightly shifted to the right or to 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.600
 left now I that fox precisely that 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.730
 he was my mannequin, let's call him that 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.560
 I caught him thanks to the bounce anyway 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.000
 both the tome could center anyway 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.640
 the flag capture area then 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.410
 someone they'll catch for here 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.940
 instead you will have to rely on the shadows 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.950
 projected from the roof tiles 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.350
 of the building in the background of the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.330
 flag you will always aim at 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.320
 maximum clearly pointing towards the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.989
 flag c 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.790
 and if you are lucky you could do the 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.250
 first blood exactly as in the other 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.560
 this time, however, the volume will go 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.540
 really really accurate on 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.010
 flag look at you the accuracy of 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.050
 this toma certain there will be a small one 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.300
 rebound though maybe yours 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.580
 opponent is in a bit more ahead 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.910
 you should be able to catch him even without it 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.800
 need to make that clip the bounce of 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.390
 toma or that of ballistic on this map 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.100
 they end up here and now clearly 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.170
 shooting lines will begin 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.480
 one thing to say about shooting lines 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.810
 of this map are all of them 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.459
 in other words, all of them outdoors 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.690
 outdoors there is some of one 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.280
 inside the building however it is 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.190
 so trivial it is so predictable 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.630
 that I preferred not to record sails 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.340
 in fact all the lines of fire that 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.580
 you will see shown in this small clip 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.150
 they are all outside and if you notice 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.970
 they are all equally positioned 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.919
 relatively high taxes for example 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.450
 this wii is the shooting line that you can 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.030
 make from the spot he has to defend himself 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.090
 perhaps from the invasion of fired enemies 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.500
 su bing on cd excuse me clearly 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.450
 keeping an eye on them from the roof 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.580
 or even from here that you are anyway 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.900
 on that bow ok and you can keep 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.240
 always look at the enemies that maybe 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.370
 they will want to make you an invasion of the spot 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.260
 immediately at the beginning of the round or even 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.570
 first maybe when you saw that I am 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.640
 got into the truck there was the place 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.670
 ideal to be able to do the first one 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.980
 memo sniper blood from the sponge 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.860
 towards the flag spawn 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.520
 these two we say are points from 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.310
 camper 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.350
 ok on those tables there or even 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.180
 staying here above the difference is that 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.810
 standing here above you will have the view 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.310
 360 degrees made one part and the other 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.800
 in front and keep an eye on them too 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.110
 behind the steps you can also note 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.120
 let's do some nice trick shots let's say jump 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.450
 from there with a little bit of luck or rather not 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.320
 a little bit we say that a lot of luck 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.560
 just jumping off that trampoline 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.440
 or you can always make them though by standing 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.080
 on this gazebo from which it is precisely there 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.880
 comes to jumping from the bar counter there 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.580
 I just showed you you can very well 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.710
 skip 360 a purpose and make it clip that 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.780
 you still do if the kids do this 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.070
 episode for today ends here and there 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.270
 let's see to the next I hope you are there 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.270
 liked it is similar
