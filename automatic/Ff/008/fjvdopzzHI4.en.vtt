pull the bench away from the wall so

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.700 
pull the bench away from the wall so
that<00:01:53.480> you<00:01:53.570> can<00:01:53.750> really<00:01:53.990> sit<00:01:54.230> back<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.590> relax

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
I recommend the built-in bench because

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.610 
I recommend the built-in bench because
you<00:01:58.190> can<00:01:58.340> put<00:01:58.520> your<00:01:58.640> feet<00:01:58.909> up<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.990> even<00:02:00.320> lay

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
down on it and if it's deep enough

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.290 
down on it and if it's deep enough
you'll<00:02:03.500> still<00:02:03.770> be<00:02:03.890> able<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.280> like<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.729> said<00:02:04.790> lean
