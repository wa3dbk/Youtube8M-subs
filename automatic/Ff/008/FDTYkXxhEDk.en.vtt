00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.680
 Emmental cheese 150 g Swiss cheese 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.450
 and 150 g of vachon there will also be the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.689
 cornstarch butter and milk 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.580
 as well as kirsch and white wine 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.350
 it's good for just about people 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.670
 must calculate about 200 g of cheese 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 per person did that I made a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.610
 small a little tasting pharma 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.110
 as in Peru 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.110
 and here we are going to start 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.470
 c 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.570
 I 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.640
 so the first step and rub a 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.800
 fondue pot with help so 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.010
 rub well everywhere even squeeze him a 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.710
 unclear the flavor of the ice is in 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.150
 well everywhere so you can go there 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.230
 generously is also strongly 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.360
 we can leave the clove of garlic to 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.010
 inside what will give a beautiful 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.580
 battle at the end of the meal to find out 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.140
 who will sell or garlic clove so 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.000
 now we will put the wine 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.070
 the equivalent of half a cup maybe 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.680
 and we will bring it close to the point 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.270
 boiling 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.270
 so we are ready to put the vacherin 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.220
 so the important thing is always 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:55.520
 brew and mix never stop 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.670
 brew everything we go now 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.560
 emmental anyway you can there 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.040
 to go in any is its done 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.040
 no real difference 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:15.740
 we now add the fence I'm going 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.570

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.910
 with the kirsch we will add in 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.110
 a few moments about a spoonful 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.080
 cornstarch table with about 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.520
 an increase of kirsch remember 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:36.320
 two continue brewing to not 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.090
 that it burns then corn starch cac 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.770
 lafarge who will come linked wine the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:52.340
 cheese and give a beautiful texture 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:54.550
 creamy to the formula so we add the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.550
 all 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.939
 we continue to brew then to the mix 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.670
 until we get something 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:09.959
 which you will add the equivalent of a 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.819
 half spoon and butter table 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.010

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.379

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.629
 about 15 minutes to go and we 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:28.019
 add a touch of walnut 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:29.129
 nutmeg and now we're ready to say bah
