00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.200 
went to another walgreens and they had
it<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:41.860> still<00:02:42.220> didn't<00:02:42.520> like<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.790> undertone

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
that this foundation applied girls and

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.890 
that this foundation applied girls and
again<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.370> my<00:03:00.490> first<00:03:00.760> time<00:03:00.940> trying<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.570> so

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
again this is my first time trying it so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.740 
again this is my first time trying it so
I<00:03:02.170> was<00:03:02.560> very<00:03:02.620> hesitant<00:03:03.040> at<00:03:03.640> first<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:04.300> try<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
I was very hesitant at first to try this

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.100 
I was very hesitant at first to try this
but<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.490> try<00:03:06.790> new<00:03:06.820> things<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.660> camera

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
but I like to try new things on camera

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.270 
but I like to try new things on camera
so<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.290> can<00:03:08.320> give<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.650> girls<00:03:08.800> my<00:03:08.980> honest

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
opinion but I do like the coverage I

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.730 
opinion but I do like the coverage I
like<00:03:12.970> how<00:03:13.000> my<00:03:13.300> skin<00:03:13.600> looks<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.110> can<00:03:14.140> still<00:03:14.500> see

like how my skin looks you can still see

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.110 
like how my skin looks you can still see
a<00:03:14.770> little<00:03:14.920> bit<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.130> my<00:03:15.400> skin<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.090> a

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
a little bit of my skin but it is a

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.440 
a little bit of my skin but it is a
matte<00:03:16.450> finish<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:18.010> light<00:03:18.400> foundation<00:03:19.180> but

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
matte finish it's a light foundation but

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.290 
matte finish it's a light foundation but
it's<00:03:19.690> buildable<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.680> me<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.459> once<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.120> build

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
it's buildable to me so once you build

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.870 
it's buildable to me so once you build
it<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.570> can<00:03:22.870> get<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.440> full<00:03:23.680> coverage<00:03:24.130> so

it you can get the full coverage so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.120 
it you can get the full coverage so

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130

foundation is going to be my favorite so
far<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.350> think<00:03:56.560> I'm<00:03:56.650> going<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.800> go<00:03:56.860> ahead<00:03:57.010> and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
far I think I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.310 
far I think I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.519> on<00:03:57.760> top<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.360> true<00:03:58.600> match<00:03:58.780> only

put this on top of the true match only

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.979 
put this on top of the true match only
because<00:03:59.620> the<00:04:00.220> true<00:04:00.519> match<00:04:00.790> wasn't<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.720> matte

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
because the true match wasn't a matte
