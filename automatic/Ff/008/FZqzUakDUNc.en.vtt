hey guys so today I want to do the
amazing<00:00:03.000> spider-man<00:00:03.330> test<00:00:03.629> here<00:00:03.990> on<00:00:04.440> the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
amazing spider-man test here on the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.720 
amazing spider-man test here on the
galaxy<00:00:05.700> s<00:00:05.879> 2<00:00:06.410> because<00:00:07.410> people<00:00:07.950> always<00:00:08.040> seem<00:00:08.550> to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
galaxy s 2 because people always seem to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.369 
galaxy s 2 because people always seem to
enjoy<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:14.540> being<00:00:15.540> chickened<00:00:15.900> out<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.080> other

enjoy this being chickened out on other
phones<00:00:16.590> as<00:00:16.740> well<00:00:16.770> because<00:00:17.490> people<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.910> been

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
phones as well because people have been

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.400 
phones as well because people have been
wanting<00:00:18.420> me<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:20.869> but<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.930> also<00:00:22.140> got<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
wanting me to do that but I also got a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.750 
wanting me to do that but I also got a
request<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> galaxy<00:00:23.550> s2<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.340> want<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
request on the galaxy s2 so I want to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:40.689 
request on the galaxy s2 so I want to
check<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> out

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.910 

and<00:00:41.329> this<00:00:41.899> device<00:00:42.199> has<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.589> my<00:00:43.100> life<00:00:43.339> 400<00:00:44.120> GPU

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
and this device has the my life 400 GPU

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.479 
and this device has the my life 400 GPU
which<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.070> pretty<00:00:46.339> good<00:00:46.519> GP<00:00:46.940> actually<00:00:48.489> the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
which is pretty good GP actually the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.029 
which is pretty good GP actually the
graphic<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.899> one<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.260> handling<00:00:51.920> the

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
graphic the one the handling the

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:03.099 
graphic the one the handling the
graphics<00:00:59.140> sometimes<00:01:00.140> they<00:01:00.379> wanted<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:01.839> ask<00:01:02.839> me

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
graphics sometimes they wanted to ask me

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.880 
graphics sometimes they wanted to ask me
the<00:01:03.289> language<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.070> she<00:01:04.250> use<00:01:04.460> her<00:01:04.489> stuff<00:01:04.879> but

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
the language and she use her stuff but

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.120 
the language and she use her stuff but
on<00:01:06.890> some<00:01:07.340> phones<00:01:07.580> just<00:01:07.909> doesn't<00:01:08.360> want<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.950> give

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
on some phones just doesn't want to give

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.840 
on some phones just doesn't want to give
you<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.369> option

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
you that option

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:33.130 
you that option
not<00:01:11.210> sure<00:01:11.390> why

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.130 

well<00:01:33.830> oh<00:01:34.100> my<00:01:34.640> god<00:01:39.460> okay<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:40.690> perhaps<00:01:41.690> not<00:01:41.960> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
well oh my god okay so perhaps not the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.160 
well oh my god okay so perhaps not the
best<00:01:42.170> performance<00:01:42.890> here<00:01:43.720> we're<00:01:44.720> not<00:01:44.900> even

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
best performance here we're not even

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.460 
best performance here we're not even
close

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
close

00:01:45.470 --> 00:02:02.590 
close
I<00:01:45.710> mean<00:01:55.330> it's<00:01:56.330> pretty<00:01:56.420> quick<00:01:59.170> here<00:02:01.240> we<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.420> try

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
I mean it's pretty quick here we can try

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.480 
I mean it's pretty quick here we can try
to<00:02:02.630> spin<00:02:03.320> around<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:03.979> definitely<00:02:04.340> play

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
to spin around you can definitely play

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.120 
to spin around you can definitely play
the<00:02:04.640> game<00:02:05.740> but<00:02:08.649> sometimes<00:02:09.649> actually<00:02:09.979> here

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
the game but sometimes actually here

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.610 
the game but sometimes actually here
really<00:02:10.580> good<00:02:10.700> performance<00:02:11.120> overall

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.080 

I'm<00:02:19.160> pretty<00:02:19.370> satisfied<00:02:19.580> with<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
I'm pretty satisfied with the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.150 
I'm pretty satisfied with the
performance<00:02:20.209> here<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:20.989> galaxies<00:02:21.950> -

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
performance here on this galaxies -

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.540 
performance here on this galaxies -
maybe<00:02:22.819> not<00:02:22.970> there<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:24.200> tell<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.430> was

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
maybe not there I can tell that it was

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.630 
maybe not there I can tell that it was
definitely<00:02:25.880> bad<00:02:26.360> almost<00:02:26.840> there

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.830 

yeah<00:02:31.640> sometimes<00:02:32.150> when<00:02:32.330> you're<00:02:32.450> moving<00:02:32.569> around

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
yeah sometimes when you're moving around

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.470 
yeah sometimes when you're moving around
 are<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:33.980> doing<00:02:37.060> you're<00:02:38.060> standing<00:02:38.480> there

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
 are you doing you're standing there

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.740 
 are you doing you're standing there
why<00:02:41.480> don't<00:02:41.540> they<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:41.870> weapons

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
why don't they have weapons

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.030 
why don't they have weapons
well<00:02:46.870> yeah<00:02:47.870> sometimes<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.560> performance

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
well yeah sometimes the performance

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.680 
well yeah sometimes the performance
is<00:02:49.160> extremely<00:02:49.760> bad<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:52.299> so<00:02:53.299> we'll<00:02:53.510> probably

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
is extremely bad here so we'll probably

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.710 
is extremely bad here so we'll probably
chill<00:02:54.200> before<00:02:54.650> picking<00:02:55.040> up<00:02:55.190> this<00:02:55.400> games<00:02:58.720> it's

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
chill before picking up this games it's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:27.770 
chill before picking up this games it's
not<00:02:59.840> like<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.170> mosque<00:03:00.470> tab

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.740 

I<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.680> spin<00:03:28.950> around<00:03:29.069> here<00:03:29.610> around<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
I like to spin around here around the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:52.550 
I like to spin around here around the
houses<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.230> stuff<00:03:31.410> it's<00:03:31.770> pretty<00:03:31.950> fun

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:16.349 

oh<00:03:54.080> course<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.170> can<00:03:55.200> run<00:03:55.470> up<00:03:55.530> oh<00:03:58.820> yeah

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.300 

love<00:04:17.359> this<00:04:20.889> but<00:04:21.889> yeah

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
love this but yeah

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.330 
love this but yeah
quickly<00:04:22.699> look<00:04:22.880> here<00:04:23.120> on<00:04:23.690> ds2<00:04:24.139> you<00:04:25.130> can<00:04:25.250> have

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
quickly look here on ds2 you can have

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.380 
quickly look here on ds2 you can have
the<00:04:25.520> plate<00:04:25.699> so<00:04:26.199> that's<00:04:27.199> cool
