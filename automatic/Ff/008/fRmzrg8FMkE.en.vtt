00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820

alright<00:00:12.750> guys<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.679> traction

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
alright guys so here is the traction

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.310 
alright guys so here is the traction
it's<00:00:14.610> kind<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.969> similar<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> herringbone<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
it's kind of similar to herringbone in a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.320 
it's kind of similar to herringbone in a
sense<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.859> does<00:00:17.010> cover<00:00:17.250> multiple<00:00:18.060> directions

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
sense it does cover multiple directions

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.359 
sense it does cover multiple directions
so<00:00:18.630> both<00:00:18.810> linear<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.380> lateral<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.100> really

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
so both linear and lateral and I really

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.040 
so both linear and lateral and I really
enjoyed<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> setup<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.270> no<00:00:21.570> complaints

last year's version wasn't as durable as
it<00:01:21.689> could<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.869> been<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:22.259> maybe<00:01:22.439> even<00:01:22.530> should

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
it could have been or maybe even should

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.649 
it could have been or maybe even should
have<00:01:23.070> been<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.610> screen<00:01:23.970> mesh<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
have been but this screen mesh here is a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.420 
have been but this screen mesh here is a
lot<00:01:24.930> stronger<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.220> retain

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
lot stronger and it's going to retain

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.679 
lot stronger and it's going to retain
its<00:01:26.610> shape<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.000> better<00:01:27.240> then<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.570> also

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
its shape a lot better then you also

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.060 
its shape a lot better then you also
have<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:27.960> fuse<00:01:28.290> overlays<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:28.890> are<00:01:28.979> going

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
have these fuse overlays which are going

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.530 
have these fuse overlays which are going
to<00:01:29.159> protect<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.549> from<00:01:29.610> things<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.030> toe<00:01:30.299> drag

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to protect it from things like toe drag

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.359 
to protect it from things like toe drag
and<00:01:30.780> even<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.470> getting<00:01:31.770> stepped<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and even like getting stepped on and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.770 
and even like getting stepped on and
things<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.119> guys<00:01:33.329> fit<00:01:33.600> true<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
things like that these guys fit true to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.539 
things like that these guys fit true to
size<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.380> whatever<00:01:34.680> size<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.070> normally<00:01:35.400> wear

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
size so whatever size you normally wear

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
size so whatever size you normally wear
that's<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.540> lockdown<00:01:37.049> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's what I would go with lockdown is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
that's what I would go with lockdown is
something<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.189> you're<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
something that you're going to have to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
something that you're going to have to
adjust<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.420> tweak<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.439> bit<00:01:40.590> like

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
adjust and tweak just a little bit like

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
adjust and tweak just a little bit like
I<00:01:41.280> said<00:01:41.460> earlier<00:01:41.820> once<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> tighten<00:01:42.600> these

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
I said earlier once you tighten these

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.330 
I said earlier once you tighten these
things<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.530> feel<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> fly

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
things up you can actually feel the fly

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
things up you can actually feel the fly
or<00:01:44.579> doing<00:01:44.970> its<00:01:45.090> job<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.689> something<00:01:46.020> where

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
or doing its job this is something where

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.960 
or doing its job this is something where
I<00:01:46.409> felt<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> original<00:01:47.369> hyper<00:01:47.729> Rev

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I felt this in the original hyper Rev

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.399 
I felt this in the original hyper Rev
but<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.299> don't<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.659> feel<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.110> any

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
but you don't really feel it in any

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.740 
but you don't really feel it in any
other<00:01:49.619> shoe<00:01:50.009> featuring<00:01:50.820> dynamic<00:01:51.299> fly<00:01:51.509> wire

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
other shoe featuring dynamic fly wire

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.359 
other shoe featuring dynamic fly wire
and<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.110> because<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> upper<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.040> minimal

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and it's because the upper is so minimal

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.710 
and it's because the upper is so minimal
that<00:01:53.670> once<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.970> lace<00:01:54.149> these<00:01:54.329> things<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that once you lace these things up

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.149 
that once you lace these things up
tightly<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.259> literally<00:01:55.560> feel<00:01:55.920> these

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
tightly you can literally feel these

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.620 
tightly you can literally feel these
things<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.579> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> clenching<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
things just kind of clenching and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.090 
things just kind of clenching and
wrapping<00:01:57.960> around<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.290> foot<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.890> pretty

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
wrapping around your foot it's pretty

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.160 
wrapping around your foot it's pretty
cool<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.670> shows<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> dynamic<00:02:00.450> fly<00:02:00.630> wire<00:02:00.840> does

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
cool it shows the dynamic fly wire does

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.870 
cool it shows the dynamic fly wire does
actually<00:02:01.409> work<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:02.009> certain<00:02:02.280> settings<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
actually work in certain settings and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.280 
actually work in certain settings and
this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.240> definitely<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> them<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.110> even

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
this is definitely one of them and even

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.630 
this is definitely one of them and even

the<00:02:28.230> fly<00:02:28.410> wire<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:28.920> doing<00:02:29.250> its<00:02:29.370> job<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.730> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the fly wire really doing its job it is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.340 
the fly wire really doing its job it is
taking<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.240> brunt<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> load<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.020> expect

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
taking a brunt of the load so expect

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.840 
taking a brunt of the load so expect
these<00:02:31.470> things<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.860> not<00:02:31.950> last<00:02:32.190> too<00:02:32.430> long<00:02:32.460> but

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
these things to not last too long but

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.000 
these things to not last too long but
luckily<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> screen<00:02:33.960> mesh<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.440> fuse<00:02:34.740> is

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
luckily that screen mesh and the fuse is

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.440 
luckily that screen mesh and the fuse is
a<00:02:35.040> secondary<00:02:35.610> layer<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.180> won't

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
a secondary layer so you won't

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.630 
a secondary layer so you won't
necessarily<00:02:36.930> need<00:02:37.530> these<00:02:37.740> full<00:02:37.980> time<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.460> do

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
necessarily need these full time you do

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.250 
necessarily need these full time you do
have<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.850> secondary<00:02:39.360> system<00:02:39.750> in<00:02:39.840> place<00:02:40.050> and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
have a secondary system in place and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.170 
have a secondary system in place and
then<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.650> TPU<00:02:41.010> or<00:02:41.370> rubberized<00:02:41.790> heel<00:02:42.000> counter

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
then that TPU or rubberized heel counter

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120 
then that TPU or rubberized heel counter
works<00:02:42.540> awesome<00:02:43.020> no<00:02:43.380> complaints<00:02:43.890> keeps

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
shoes I thought that these were much

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.870 
shoes I thought that these were much
better<00:03:04.170> as<00:03:04.470> far<00:03:04.740> as<00:03:04.800> traction<00:03:05.130> goes<00:03:05.400> compared

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
better as far as traction goes compared

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.760 
better as far as traction goes compared
to<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.060> original<00:03:06.180> cushion<00:03:07.020> was<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.350> little<00:03:07.680> bit

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
to the original cushion was a little bit

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.740 
to the original cushion was a little bit
of<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.920> letdown<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.520> comparison<00:03:09.090> nothing

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
of a letdown in comparison nothing

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.030 
of a letdown in comparison nothing
really<00:03:09.900> compares<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.470> full-lengths<00:03:10.830> zoom

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
really compares to full-lengths zoom

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.230 
really compares to full-lengths zoom
especially<00:03:11.520> when<00:03:11.670> you're<00:03:11.790> starting<00:03:12.000> to

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
especially when you're starting to

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.699 
especially when you're starting to
segregate<00:03:13.050> it<00:03:13.170> between<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.530> heel<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
segregate it between the heel and

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.500 
segregate it between the heel and
forefoot<00:03:13.980> still<00:03:14.490> gets<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> job<00:03:14.940> done<00:03:15.000> but

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
forefoot still gets the job done but

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.420 
forefoot still gets the job done but
again<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.350> not<00:03:16.560> quite<00:03:16.709> as<00:03:16.920> good<00:03:17.070> as<00:03:17.280> I

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
again it's just not quite as good as I

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.070 
again it's just not quite as good as I
thought<00:03:17.610> last<00:03:17.940> year's<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.330> materials<00:03:18.989> are

thought last year's was materials are

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.479 
thought last year's was materials are
solid<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.470> really<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.830> no<00:03:19.980> complaints<00:03:20.130> with
