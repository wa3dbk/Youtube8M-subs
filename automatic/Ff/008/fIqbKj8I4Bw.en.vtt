00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.500
 If you are interested in the learning process, 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.440
 you now have the opportunity to learn this method, 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.460
 because at present FlorianÃ³polis is a researcher from Poland, an expert in the subject. 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.260
 More information is available from our reporter Mayar Vieira. 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.700
 Mayara, tell us because we are curious and would like to understand - how the technique works 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.780
 compilation of what we think with what we say? 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.560
 Good morning! 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.940
 Good morning, Adriana and Faraco, good morning to you. 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.360
 In fact, it is a cognitive system, 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.580
 known as a powerful tool for leaders, 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.580
 serving personal and professional development. 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.880
 It is not easy to define it, so I will take the opportunity 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.680
 and a Polish specialist, Mateusz Grzesiak, who is standing next to me, asking for an explanation. 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.280
 Good day. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.260
 Good morning, thank you for the invitation. 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.620
 Imagine this situation: 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.700
 we are going to the company and we have one of the best sellers in Brazil. 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 Nobody knows how he does it, but he achieves the results. 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.540
 This seller is not aware, he does not know what is the structure of his thoughts and behaviors. 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.120
 If we know how to recreate someone's behavior, 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.880
 we can practically build any success model there, 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.420
 where we want to achieve good results. 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.440
 We can be better parents and know how to better communicate with children. 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.100
 We can also understand how to be better, more effective managers in companies. 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.720
 So it is a form of effective communication. 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.840
 The point is for us to achieve our goals, right? 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.040
 Yes, exactly like that. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.660
 And about how to shape people's behavior, 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.140
 which are supposed to achieve good results. 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.500
 Who can interest it? 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.440
 Students, or maybe just working people? 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.740
 I would share this topic in two worlds: 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.380
 professional world and the world of personal development. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.880
 In the professional world, all sellers, managers, managers, 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.560
 bosses who want to achieve better results can use these tools. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880
 And in the world of personal development, for example, a wife, 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.960
 who want to know how to effectively influence their husbands, 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.500
 they can also reach for these tools. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.160
 For example: if I want to build trust of a person, 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.600
 I have to do something called a report. 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.280
 It means that I accept the same attitude as a given person, 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.980
 I use the same gestures, 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.920
 the same intonation of the voice - thanks to which the interlocutor's brain gives me confidence. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.560
 Thank you very much for the information.
