00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.649
 hi then tomorrow is officially 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.269
 spring on the calendar also of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.639
 beautiful days confirm it hoping 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.889
 do not return other strange perturbations 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.660
 which unfortunately I believe will happen 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.520
 because I don't believe that already now 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.150
 we will truly have the true remain as 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.130
 once 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.230
 let's talk about what trends are 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.140
 spring summer of this year 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.510
 obviously I inaugurate spring with 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.550
 spring summer trends but there is the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.210
 life is always going to repeat that the real 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.800
 trend 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 the real fashion what will really go 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.079
 more in the current year it shows 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790
 and street you see around here until you do 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.010
 there will truly be true spring 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.140
 summer and people will not dress so 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 before you had a holiday we will not see 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.370
 really what will go the most because 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.870
 I repeat it is in the street that you notice the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.940
 trends that you see what will go 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.219
 I also really always stress with the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.199
 red that everyone does as he wants 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.690
 one does not necessarily have to for fashion 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.850
 indeed the bomb must be adapted 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.460
 own needs is a portfolio 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.019
 especially that style because style 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 personal you must never ever 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.340
 underestimate never set aside and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.990
 especially also for how they fit 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.460
 things because it looks like what's not right 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.500
 but we must put it for perhaps because 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.580
 fashion if we don't like it but we have to put 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.330
 of course if we can't 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.040
 to allow 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.520
 we have to make debts because fashion 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.439
 changes but not us that she was not us 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.330
 to the ended this dutiful speech 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.100
 let's start to see what at least 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.740
 from the catwalks also a bit around 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.630
 also in the various collections of the various 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.189
 beige cinema brands and I watched 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.150
 especially the low cost because anyway 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.030
 that's where 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.950
 the population normal people go 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.630
 to spend their money so that's it 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.190
 that we will see above all salerno 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.920
 let's start with the color because you know 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.930
 to know that every year is established 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.790
 precisely from a very famous company 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.810
 US graphic designer 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.270
 etc 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.090
 the color of the year and this year has been 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.160
 chose the radian orchid that it would be 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.680
 this orchid is not an orchid 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.210
 radiant light that would have a color 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.390
 like this respect will offer some 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.560
 then part in lilac pink wisteria a 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.500
 very particular thing 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.510
 if I don't like it and can't find it 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.060
 right for you you don't have to put it not 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.010
 obviously the stable sand will be missing 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.220
 all kinds of color prints 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.020
 parents to anything if you think 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.750
 a friend a samp sampled with the sandwich 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.910
 so drawn the la sandwich print 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.040
 print with the venus of botticelli the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.370
 Printing with morra in licola monnalisa 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.850
 everything is floral fantasy 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.080
 as someone would say in a famous movie 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.470
 avant-garde too are going a lot 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.890
 on its real so maybe yes you can for it 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.890
 spring 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.840
 obviously though it is if the returns that of 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.820
 first and we will see a flower in its own right 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.750
 those very large that personally a 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.910
 I don't like them 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.170
 I don't see them I know myself obviously 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.910
 both much more floral prints with 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.650
 little flowers maybe smaller on 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.209
 any background with black background flowers 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.580
 black background at light background background 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.410
 castle really of all the iron who 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.730
 we are talking about flounces 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.230
 flank level has already been seen 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.720
 last year I say nothing new but 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.030
 this year we will be back more than before 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.280
 life just middle high because life 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.920
 low is not very fashionable to me me 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.160
 give a damn about it because I love and life 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.769
 not too low, but I don't love the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.560
 things besides not coaching me and I can't 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.780
 I don't like myself but we use a lot 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.910
 mellitus is sovereign life that he 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.820
 shorts that in the urns anything 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.160
 is just below the navel 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.340
 however the fabric is medium-high life 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.650
 that runs and the g6 you know that I don't 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.760
 I could be happier jeans but 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.859
 especially deteriorated ripped jeans 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.560
 exploited stressed then 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.359
 jeans back this theme a lot in 90 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.150
 Also outfits then jeans with 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.430
 denim shirt and jeans or jacket by 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.660
 jeans and gesa can be written but 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.310
 can also be cigarette 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.540
 slightly softer can be 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.370
 of the boyfriend we have already seen 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.650
 last year, therefore, 16 for men 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.680
 a little loose eni for nothing at all 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.600
 tight-fitting here are jeans shorts like 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.090
 if there were no tomorrow with the 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.579
 studs then rip with ephes 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.680
 precisely drawn at the end as if 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.290
 had they been cut it passed to you 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.010
 the good the clothes will be light 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.400
 floral to the degree of Petrarch e 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.260
 Beatrice of giving something very 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.480
 this is the cake from the countryside 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.030
 the hour is filled with a lesson 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.840
 literature in the classroom and therefore will be 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.650
 of those fluttering chiffon 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.510
 very light with maybe this is 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.520
 pastel floral note 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.720
 brought to high life perhaps over one 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.060
 tank top or heel because we 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.830
 a little bit on account also 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.390
 can obviously be adapted to 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.670
 style because they can become even more 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.610
 from betplus combined with a jacket 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.010
 of leather or similar leather and above all the 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.180
 skater tires that these tires would be 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.520
 always in flounces however the different fabrics the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.530
 mid-high life that ends 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.390
 we say so with these wheel base 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.790
 the shoulder is back because it has a single shoulder 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.300
 it will be a great maran prize that is missing 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:18.380
 for years the weight the lace is to die for 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.450
 more evening dresses in things 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.460
 from every day the lace comes 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.290
 reused in many things too 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.870
 the example in the shoes of the collection 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.630
 are wrong bershka there are these 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.140
 tennis shoes all the la 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.330
 plant in b ring keep talking to you 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.240
 of shoes because here too 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.610
 let's review all the types the lawn continues 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.890
 the tip is basically there 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.790
 still pro tonda tamasy we begin a 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.590
 see the tips more and more again 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.990
 straight pins killer tips like them 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.350
 I'll call them the classic ones too 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.020
 sneakers with the pro con with the z then 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.450
 made to the 90s trend that returns 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.060
 as if there were no tomorrow and then there 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.410
 small woods and small studs 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.220
 on shoes everywhere 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.979
 the classic summer sandro remains that 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.350
 it is a classic, that is, it remains the 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.840
 trend for too was that of 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.440
 ankle straps for example all 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.169
 ati brno with the passing strap 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.850
 from the said foot vertically to 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.669
 all then the shoe a very state 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.250
 particularly the open therefore the part 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.590
 of the thumb out everything else covered 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.479
 also present the classic wedges 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.220
 wedge shoes this is what 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:37.160
 for the moment in terms of clothing 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.880
 you see more I have not seen so much 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.440
 fluo even if it is not a gravity of 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.140
 use it because I know last year 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.240
 he carried very much if only one 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.680
 general framework that obviously I repeat 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.360
 things could change anyway 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.280
 new trends could be added in 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.660
 course of work then you have to know which is the 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.090
 trend that you like best 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.070
 among these the one you like least 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.539
 the one you may be looking forward to 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.979
 exploit that arrives and point 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.660
 overwhelmingly this spring summer 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.390
 as fast as possible and that 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.370
 that I miss if they paid me 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:11.020
 you would wear a greater hand of the members 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.020
 soon for success
