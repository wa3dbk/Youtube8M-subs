the infrared colorway although the color

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.040 
the infrared colorway although the color

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.750 
technically isn't infrared and the upper
is<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> bit<00:03:34.440> weird<00:03:34.740> to<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.010> used<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.280> I'm<00:03:35.460> a<00:03:35.550> huge

is a bit weird to get used to I'm a huge

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.880 
is a bit weird to get used to I'm a huge
fan<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.600> infrared<00:03:36.870> Air<00:03:37.080> Max<00:03:37.290> 90<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.770> this

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
fan of the infrared Air Max 90 so this

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.400 
fan of the infrared Air Max 90 so this
was<00:03:38.070> still<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> great<00:03:38.670> pickup<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.270> my<00:03:39.510> eyes<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
was still a great pickup in my eyes the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.140 
was still a great pickup in my eyes the
upper<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.740> thin<00:03:41.010> yet<00:03:41.340> stiff<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.910> toe<00:03:42.120> box

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
upper is thin yet stiff in the toe box

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.970 
upper is thin yet stiff in the toe box
which<00:03:42.720> creates<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.170> weird<00:03:43.470> feeling<00:03:43.740> and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
which creates a weird feeling and

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.100 
which creates a weird feeling and
sometimes<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.460> popping<00:03:44.910> sound<00:03:44.940> when<00:03:45.750> walking

sometimes a popping sound when walking

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.150 
sometimes a popping sound when walking
that<00:03:46.230> takes<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.500> bit<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.680> time<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.070> get

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
that takes a bit of time to get
