00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.460

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.290
 nokia france with flu camera 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.220
 so that was pretty cool it was not 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.160
 planned roles with so we like this test 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.590
 is filmed for the first time with the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.570
 nokia lumia 925 we usually do it 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.220
 with the 920 or with him on the pure you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.740
 this time I want to test the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 925 with the pro camera so we go on 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.619
 will see we will see with saad 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.610
 so let's go through the most 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.960
 interesting the nokia lumia thousand I the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 remember this video it's just the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.829
 unpacking and presentation 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 for the test all this we will see 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.780
 later after our our week of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.110
 test obviously so I guess that's 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.480
 phone is yellow carl lang is the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 language and john so here is for a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.960
 time it's a first it's tidy on 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.039
 the belly I think it's because of 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.270
 the beauce camera 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.510
 usually the phones are in this 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.370
 sense at nokia is there with the balm 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 camera I think it's tidy in 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.489
 wizard on purpose so here it is in this 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.650
 beautiful yellow 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.280
 matt here glossy because there is the movie 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.950
 plastic on top but it is matte 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.130
 so the device always with its 4.2 a 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.650
 4.5 inch screen amoled like the 925 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.479
 a facade design that would celebrate n9 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.500
 hen c with 900 there is a little bit of new 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.790
 in I find 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.810
 tac tac tac on the back the collector of 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.700
 charge the huge sensor of 41 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.650
 megapixel 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.570
 that's very very good thing the flash 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.660
 xenon the led flash for videos 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.270
 the mechanical shutter obviously button 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.560
 photo lock button volume + 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.380
 volume - and then and then here are the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.340
 windows front and top 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.350
 speaker underneath than on one side 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.810
 now because on the other side we 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.330
 to the small the small catch by so 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.899
 for the strap and with the micro port 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.240
 usb there we have a rather fine device 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.430
 relatively fine for what it is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.890
 supposed to notice that it is rather not 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.920
 badly as usual the little tab for 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.800
 remove the asim that is housed the microphone 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.540
 sim pardon which is lodged right where I 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.290
 do not know if we'll see if 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.350
 I'll get to a point 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.040
 above 925 may not be as 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.720
 so this on video by the little simone 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:36.040
 stay up there we open we have a 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.700
 little flyer that audi pretty 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.410
 things on a camera you have 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.920
 maybe when we shake the device 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:50.280
 there is no blur a description of the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:56.170
 pure view capabilities that's cool 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:00.010
 a book is as usual of notices 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.230
 and everything that goes with the usb cable 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.530
 micro usb for charging the exchange of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.380
 data 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.850
 the charger that he is not handsome the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.880
 charger and headphones as usual 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.170
 the color of the phone so with the 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.600
 white you will have it white and with them 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.989
 blacks you the high rhinois so here 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.880
 for the phone we will remove it from his 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.880
 little cache 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.389
 there then we realize it is matte 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.999
 he shines not been there it is key 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.069
 so sweet it's never been 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.299
 done again I think it was touching the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.319
 even on the 800 liter peer review and 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.609
 even on on the how the lumia 901 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.750
 blacks who were max and emme in touch 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.340
 like that we really touched very 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.810
 very nice as a rigid eraser 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.810
 it's really really impressive 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:58.540
 here is to put it back pretty much 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:07.930
 properly here I take off the little 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:09.400
 protection for and here this time is the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.790
 galp camera 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.260
 the flu camera that provides besides 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.989
 that's what I just saw I did not 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.440
 no thongs in the phone in 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.180
 the box 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.270
 delivered with the 1020 I do not have any 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.610
 thongs to use as a weapon 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.370
 fatal and dragons so I do not know if 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.110
 she is an assemblage and something 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.520
 so that's contrary to the 800 reading 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.159
 view the light will not be with the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.210
 phone in any case the g1 it seems to me 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:47.139
 I was looking at the box the code 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:48.190
 product g1 and no I do not have I did not 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.960
 not a 1000 wines liquor products 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.740
 french j 1 1020 european it's 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.570
 maybe that's why I do not have the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.800
 woolen in it changes the countries a 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.470
 team not the same each time their 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.330
 their box I know that with the pure 810 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.340
 French duo we had a strap 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.870
 in and it seems to me to have seen in a 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.990
 unpacking 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.200
 how to haiti haiti in the states 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.090
 United 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.620
 there was a strap in it is 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.410
 possible only in the twentieth 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.210
 French editions one is the world and 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.250
 here I have a European product code it's 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.250
 maybe for that so we have a strap 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.850
 the strap with marc and nokia some 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.090
 not a banal strap that 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.160
 so attach here obvious the little 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.870
 hole we pass on one side we stand out 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.530
 the other I 'll do that a little bit more 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.910
 late and here we have the cam and 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.500
 agricultural that we had a whole box 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.680
 just below for the samia thong the 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:46.540
 packaging at mcafee at 1022 more 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.730
 it's not a gift it's real size an 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.410
 earlier 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.380
 no it's just in my opinion here is the logo 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:57.550
 and the booklet of the otice in case we do not 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:01.450
 did not understand how it works and that 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.670
 so we can see the pitch for the 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.170
 connect to the tripod the grids for 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.510
 hold on the photo the button 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:11.910
 photo press it's right there 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:15.580
 the USB port that is there to recharge 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.440
 reload the the flu camera is there one 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.880
 has the level of batteries that is displayed in 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:31.390
 pressing the battery here it is 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:31.810
 sincerely that's how it is there it is 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.000
 plugged 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.270
 I felt the room vibration lit 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 So as they charge and therefore a 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.710
 pretty big balÃ¨ze camera I have to you 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.450
 to confess that to walk like that with with 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.900
 it's a little too big a little bit too much 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.970
 much 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.110
 on the other hand for taking photos that's 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.640
 true that I was downright something else 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.440
 may well hold one takes the 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.320
 thumb with the fingers we get closer 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.370
 really something very of 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.930
 very very very very practical and we have 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.070
 still the level of charge here so that 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.530
 turn it on play the little windows logo 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.620
 phone necessarily and signing because he 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:10.090
 is not there if I'll do that later 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.969
 for unpacking the nokia line 1020 and 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.479
 the flu camera we will come back soon 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:18.610
 maybe this weekend or the weekend 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.379
 next we'll see for you 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.679
 to reach the test on nokia 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:25.899
 points like nokia lumia 1020 our 

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:27.789
 notice and we promise like every time 

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:31.619
 his bias when we love it says it 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:31.619
 when we do not like we also say it
