00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.020
 Hello the bridge I am not so 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.530
 the soup fan but this one is here 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.599
 hammer 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.550
 that if I have understood it correctly 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.009
 self-created recipe I via 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.630
 facebook sent by nora ringeisen 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.699
 she got raving about it 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.850
 I have tested it and I am completely 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.460
 Thanks a lot, thank you, dear new and we 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.400
 need cocktail or 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.150
 cherry tomatoes carrots a red paprika 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.090
 garlic count sweet potatoes and whole 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.440
 normal potatoes are best small 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.840
 Herbs are also best 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.460
 lemon thyme and basil 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.350
 maybe even in a combination 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.730
 of red and green basil 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.710
 but of course you can too 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.809
 be flexible we need vegetables from 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.239
 if necessary, also vegetable broth 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.730
 We could replace lemon juice 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.610
 need olive oil cayenne or 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.910
 chilli pepper salt and something 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.640
 first we halve the sugar 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.700
 washed cocktail tomatoes and give 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.410
 you then in a casserole also the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.600
 Paprika is washed after we have washed it 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.369
 and freed from the kernels have small 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.290
 cut on these pieces come in 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.750
 the casserole dish we halve the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.760
 shallots add to the red vegetables 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.220
 collection as well as the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.119
 cloves of garlic now we cut the 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.960
 peeled potatoes in pieces and 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.409
 then proceed with the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.299
 sweet potato as well after both of us 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.640
 Potatoes with in the casserole dish 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.619
 we season with one 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.119
 half teaspoon sugar depending on 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.670
 desired degree of sharpness with 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.829
 Give cayenne pepper or snowflakes 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.439
 a heaped teaspoon of salt and that 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.110
 can be quiet good season over 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.420
 also with freshly ground pepper and 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.990
 then supplement with two teaspoons of 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.110
 lemon juice as well as three tablespoons 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.110
 olive oil 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.340
 now the herbs come to me 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.710
 So drew the leaflets of basil for that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.330
 By the way, I use bubikopf 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.490
 basilica and then the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.350
 lemon thyme also here of the 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.780
 Just play the tiles strip 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.730
 and now we mix this illustrious one 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.270
 mix with two spoons makes that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.280
 pretty good 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.500
 So far, it's been nice and colorful 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.440
 and appetizing and everything is coming 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.819
 now in the oven at 190 degrees 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.800
 circulated 170 degrees for about 40 minutes and 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.930
 hence the name of the soup for that 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.000
 vegetables are now prepared in principle 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.690
 and should get ready then about like that 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.320
 appearance 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.950
 We now put it in a big pot 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.440
 fill with the vegetables from the pick us up 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.900
 a blender and complete with it 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.239
 our work we work with him so that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.640
 vegetables until we are of consistency 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.519
 have received a rather creamy soups 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.459
 and these believed we tasted extreme 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.530
 Tasty garnish perhaps still with a 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.690
 few leaflets of basil or enough 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.220
 also parsley still to that I wish 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.670
 you have fun in the preparation 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.130
 this great soup and then quite good 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.079
 appetite 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.820
 if he does, however, prepare something else 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.519
 For example, I want a delicious one 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.440
 pumpkin soup with coconut milk or one 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.329
 American sweet potato a pot 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.110
 then just have a look 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.000
 videos into it 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.769
 I still have to say until the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.769
 next time must be at
