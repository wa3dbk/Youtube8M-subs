31<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.459> think<00:03:41.640> it's<00:03:41.730> going<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.880> be<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> good<00:03:42.180> test

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
31 I think it's going to be a good test

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.750 
31 I think it's going to be a good test
for<00:03:42.540> Ireland<00:03:43.049> against<00:03:43.350> Croatia<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.950> it's

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
for Ireland against Croatia and it's

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.640 
for Ireland against Croatia and it's
their<00:03:44.970> first<00:03:45.180> game<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.720> group<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.560> be

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650

fair<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.860> think<00:03:46.980> they'll<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.370> well<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.730> don't

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
fair I think they'll do well I don't

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.120 
fair I think they'll do well I don't
