00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:04.470
 today I decided to show you new hiding places on 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.140
 battlefield bad company 2 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.140
 this hiding place is on the comet 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.119
 montpellier with me I took you 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.099
 3 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.619
 3-1 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 I do not have more than two and a half months of absence 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.570
 I feel like I'm flying 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.160
 so you actually explain that I could have stayed on rock all ugly and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.580
 wider side 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.760
 what a lot of people do 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.690
 but for the jury to actually decide to jump on the warehouse 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.340
 because I can I'm dressed with leaves and create flaws a 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.090
 on the tree and that so and there like that I am camouflage jérôme see me and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.090
 it's better that's where he can not 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.260
 gold is really a hiding place for factors but then 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.910
 name of a wooden pipe what argos his shawl from here they hide 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.780
 the southern enemies it is unbearable especially that more in this map the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.450
 enemies tend to divide said so it's hard to reach them then 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.960
 me what I advise you is 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 before you start killing people 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.140
 all already have everything 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.900
 mow the lawn we fuck the protected species for whom these trees 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.049
 his habitat 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.489
 first of all, what more is she gratuitous she stings they are wicked it's 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.200
 very good to kill them golan me I say alive apart from the virgin forests on 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 should overtake in napalm that's how we could leave quietly 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.980
 finally sea so we can even further than quietly today 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.709
 it really is 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.709
 I worry about the future of the society really 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.540
 so it's a lot better like that when you're at 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.189
 more to wear in the facts and more seriously you would have never had the 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.269
 time to do stuff like that 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.279
 it was really a plus to say it 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.959
 so we have what to do is obviously to break the broken trees 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.099
 the coming hours the most tonic it befits to look good on the ground 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.159
 donkalor here it is there I went on a server so already I want to 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.499
 make a joke against the people who m 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.449
 in their brains hours because their course and in fact their servers 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:54.889
 being understood all 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.859
 and percent I find that these people the American mortal clearly 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.999
 frankly we're really fed up with falling on crappy servers like 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.359
 that with them 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.719
 she was with that calmed 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.849
 in europe 600 supporters so be wary of people who hold a brain 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.299
 kisi slope then there 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.349
 we realize then that the match was not bad when mom because he 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.079
 are five or six people in the middle of the point to a person saw me 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.969
 on the other hand you also find was very very bad because you did 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.969
 many diseases still made some armed frags 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.659
 you'll be better than me, that's for sure, will you use my hiding place 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.079
 from this point tears as we see a little bit the whole map and that this tablecloth is more 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.749
 great that the mud does not alter in my previous video 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.769
 the fees of very very pretty and jump distance you know this charter 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.639
 which gives a lot of weight 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.430
 that's why it's great to see the point in the little eclipse we know 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:48.509
 it's not bad 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.309
 and then then marc boyer see there the kind of barrier barriers 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:53.719
 metal 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.890
 the active and the pragiest prague of all the party poutine good there it is the 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.239
 the most gay frac here 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.659
 I'm sorry I'm not proud here 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.159
 CCTC 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.459
 it is the most beautiful frac of the party to watch 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.449
 here he is just a little head over he is perfect 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.899
 in Toulouse the points I had to be very proud of and I believe that 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:17.449
 you can congratulate me in the comments 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.660
 so unfortunately all the good things when I did a dozen 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.080
 prague and that's my last 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.659
 to afp because why because just after I stood 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.189
 Sadly 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.580
 because this failure is not perfect it is very good but not perfect 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.469
 can hope 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:32.520
 not all in May once
