00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
and it's a one of the longest certainly

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.960 
and it's a one of the longest certainly
could<00:01:00.630> be<00:01:00.720> a<00:01:00.750> challenge

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
could be a challenge

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.430 
could be a challenge
well<00:01:02.970> this<00:01:03.120> race<00:01:03.330> is<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.930> call<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.290> long

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
distance 1820 days for a boat like this

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.190 
distance 1820 days for a boat like this
and<00:01:08.000> it's<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.150> around<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> world<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and it's not around the world but it's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140 
and it's not around the world but it's
far<00:01:10.440> beyond<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> normal<00:01:10.950> per<00:01:11.340> meter<00:01:11.610> race<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
far beyond the normal per meter race so

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.900 
far beyond the normal per meter race so
you<00:01:12.210> settle<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.870> routine<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:14.310> mom<00:01:14.640> kind

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
you settle into a routine and mom kind

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.400 
you settle into a routine and mom kind
of<00:01:14.940> goes<00:01:15.120> by<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.690> after<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> while<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> stop

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410

well<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.840> Atlantic's<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:20.540> one<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.720> if

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
well the Atlantic's I think one of if

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.980 
well the Atlantic's I think one of if
not<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.440> one<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> toughest<00:01:24.150> ocean<00:01:24.630> races

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
not the one of the toughest ocean races

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.890 
not the one of the toughest ocean races
in<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> world<00:01:25.580> what's<00:01:26.580> important<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> us<00:01:27.450> with

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
in the world what's important to us with

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.630 
in the world what's important to us with
DeRay<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:30.479> mix<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.990> Atlantic<00:01:31.380> race<00:01:32.070> special

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
DeRay and mix the Atlantic race special

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630 
DeRay and mix the Atlantic race special
is<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> we're<00:01:33.660> repeating<00:01:34.160> all<00:01:35.160> to<00:01:35.550> raise

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
is that we're repeating all to raise

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.320 
is that we're repeating all to raise
early<00:01:36.410> ocean<00:01:37.410> races<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.729> transatlantic

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
early ocean races and the transatlantic

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.029

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
and fast neither wants to I think even

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.669 
and fast neither wants to I think even
with<00:01:44.250> its<00:01:44.399> experience<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.350> always
