him<00:00:05.670> explaining<00:00:06.150> why<00:00:06.330> his<00:00:06.540> bench<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> bit

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
him explaining why his bench is a bit

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.799 
him explaining why his bench is a bit
weaker<00:00:07.490> then<00:00:08.490> he's<00:00:08.670> caught<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.090> left<00:00:09.300> and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
weaker then he's caught in the left and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.660 
weaker then he's caught in the left and
so<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:09.990> thought<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.469> would<00:00:10.710> do<00:00:11.130> video<00:00:11.370> as<00:00:11.490> well

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so I thought I would do video as well

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.280 
so I thought I would do video as well
other<00:00:11.880> minded<00:00:12.269> my<00:00:12.480> reasons<00:00:12.840> are<00:00:12.929> totally

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
different because the guys just asked me

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.340 
different because the guys just asked me

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
why is my bench so weak and I've been

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.439 
why is my bench so weak and I've been

getting this question a fuckload since I

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
getting this question a fuckload since I
have<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> youtube<00:00:22.020> channel<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> I'm<00:00:23.400> gonna

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
have a youtube channel so I'm gonna

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.900 
have a youtube channel so I'm gonna
explain<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.810> first<00:00:24.840> reason<00:00:25.380> is

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
explain it to you the first reason is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.400 
explain it to you the first reason is
simply<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.060> when<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> started<00:00:27.900> lifting

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
simply because when I started lifting

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250 
simply because when I started lifting
I<00:00:28.439> followed<00:00:29.310> kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> 5x5<00:00:30.480> thing<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I followed kind of a 5x5 thing with a a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.139 
I followed kind of a 5x5 thing with a a
workouts<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> B<00:00:32.070> workouts<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.000> had

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
workouts and the B workouts and I had

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.900 
workouts and the B workouts and I had
overhead<00:00:33.510> press<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.079> bench<00:00:34.410> press<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.790> was

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
overhead press and bench press and I was

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.780 
overhead press and bench press and I was
out<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.840> gym<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.170> had<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> time<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.640> had

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
out the gym I had at a time when we had

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.420 
out the gym I had at a time when we had
one<00:00:39.030> bench<00:00:39.239> press<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.870> squat<00:00:40.140> rack

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
one bench press and one squat rack

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
one bench press and one squat rack
however<00:00:41.430> obviously<00:00:42.180> almost<00:00:42.719> no<00:00:43.050> one<00:00:43.170> squats

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
however obviously almost no one squats

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
however obviously almost no one squats
so<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> squat<00:00:44.340> rack<00:00:44.370> was<00:00:44.730> always<00:00:44.969> free<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
so the squat rack was always free so I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.729 
so the squat rack was always free so I
would<00:00:46.170> squat

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
would squat

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
would squat
no<00:00:46.920> problems<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:47.760> when<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> came<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
no problems and then when it came to the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.170 
no problems and then when it came to the
second<00:00:48.989> movement<00:00:49.140> which<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:49.829> either<00:00:50.219> over<00:00:50.760> up

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
second movement which was either over up

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.740 
second movement which was either over up
overhead<00:00:51.480> press<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.350> bench<00:00:53.309> press<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.879> could

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
overhead press or bench press I could

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.600 
overhead press or bench press I could
always<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> overhead<00:00:55.860> press<00:00:56.129> because<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
always do the overhead press because I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
always do the overhead press because I
can<00:00:56.789> overhead<00:00:57.270> press

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
can overhead press

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.290 
can overhead press
in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> squat<00:00:58.770> rack<00:00:59.010> however<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.059> bench

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
in the squat rack however the bench

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
in the squat rack however the bench
sometimes<00:01:00.840> was<00:01:01.350> being<00:01:01.649> used<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.129> couldn't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
sometimes was being used I couldn't

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
sometimes was being used I couldn't
bench<00:01:02.670> press<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.480> sometimes<00:01:03.870> when<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
bench press so sometimes when it was the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.859 
bench press so sometimes when it was the
day<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.030> supposed<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.360> bench<00:01:06.540> press<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
day that I was supposed to bench press I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
day that I was supposed to bench press I
would<00:01:06.990> overhead<00:01:07.380> press<00:01:07.650> instead<00:01:08.250> because

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
would overhead press instead because

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
would overhead press instead because
that<00:01:09.540> was<00:01:09.750> kinda<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> only<00:01:10.560> option

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that was kinda like the only option

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.960 
that was kinda like the only option
and<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.960> bench<00:01:13.290> frequency<00:01:14.010> normally<00:01:14.670> was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and so my bench frequency normally was

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.100 
and so my bench frequency normally was
sheilo<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.869> ended<00:01:16.590> up<00:01:16.770> only<00:01:17.100> benching<00:01:17.869> once<00:01:18.869> per

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
sheilo I ended up only benching once per

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
sheilo I ended up only benching once per
week<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.150> sure<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:22.080> was

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
week and I'm not sure but there was

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.440 
week and I'm not sure but there was
probably<00:01:22.590> times<00:01:23.070> where<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> didn't<00:01:23.880> even<00:01:24.090> bench

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
probably times where I didn't even bench

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.010 
probably times where I didn't even bench
once<00:01:24.780> per<00:01:24.960> week<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.130> bad<00:01:26.369> luck<00:01:26.400> of

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
once per week if I had the bad luck of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.590 
once per week if I had the bad luck of
never<00:01:28.020> having<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.009> bench<00:01:29.369> free<00:01:29.729> three<00:01:30.390> times

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
never having the bench free three times

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
never having the bench free three times
in<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.869> row<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.320> would<00:01:31.829> probably<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.850> wait<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
in a row I would probably not wait and

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.760 
in a row I would probably not wait and
so<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.590> made<00:01:35.100> me<00:01:35.509> prioritize<00:01:36.770> my

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so that that made me prioritize my

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.249 
so that that made me prioritize my
overhead<00:01:38.159> press<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> lot<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> quite

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
overhead press a lot which is quite

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.569 
overhead press a lot which is quite
cutter<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.740> funny<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.189> overhead

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
cutter it's funny because my overhead

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.149 
cutter it's funny because my overhead
press<00:01:41.820> isn't<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> strong<00:01:42.689> either<00:01:43.159> although

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
press isn't that strong either although

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.929 
press isn't that strong either although
my<00:01:44.310> adults<00:01:44.729> are<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:46.070> bigger<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.369> comparison

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
my adults are a bit bigger in comparison

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.810 
my adults are a bit bigger in comparison
to<00:01:48.060> other<00:01:48.180> body<00:01:48.420> parts<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.380> she's<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.549> weird

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
to other body parts so she's a bit weird

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.030 
to other body parts so she's a bit weird
but<00:01:51.030> whatever<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.200> was<00:01:52.470> reason<00:01:52.890> number

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
but whatever so that was reason number

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
but whatever so that was reason number
one<00:01:53.369> okay<00:01:55.219> just<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> frequency<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> lack

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
one okay just like a frequency of lack

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.670 
one okay just like a frequency of lack

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
of practice reason number two is just I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
of practice reason number two is just I
never<00:02:02.340> figured<00:02:03.149> out<00:02:03.299> too<00:02:03.990> much<00:02:04.200> defy

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
never figured out too much defy

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.240 
never figured out too much defy

mechanics not bad not not in terms of

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.080 
mechanics not bad not not in terms of
theory<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.360> never

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
theory it's just I never

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.210

never<00:02:11.090> feel<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.510> never<00:02:12.170> felt<00:02:12.590> sand<00:02:12.950> still

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
never feel that never felt sand still

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.130 
never feel that never felt sand still
feel<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.819> bench<00:02:14.090> best<00:02:14.420> clicks<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.020> know

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
feel that the bench best clicks you know

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.199 
feel that the bench best clicks you know
sometimes<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.770> squats<00:02:16.130> everything<00:02:17.060> just

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
sometimes on the squats everything just

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.600 
sometimes on the squats everything just
feels<00:02:17.450> perfect<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.560> everything<00:02:19.520> is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
feels perfect it's just everything is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.410 
feels perfect it's just everything is
just<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.900> perfect<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.040> looks<00:02:22.819> like<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
just just perfect and it looks like the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.020 
just just perfect and it looks like the
lift<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:23.900> made<00:02:24.140> for<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.500> okay<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.190> have<00:02:25.819> that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
lift was made for you okay I have that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.790 
lift was made for you okay I have that
on<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.360> squat<00:02:26.660> or<00:02:26.840> once<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.440> bench<00:02:27.590> press

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
on the squat or once on the bench press

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.040 
on the squat or once on the bench press
it<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.130> everything<00:02:28.400> feels<00:02:28.730> awkward<00:02:29.050> it's

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
it just everything feels awkward it's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.960 
it just everything feels awkward it's
just<00:02:30.260> everything<00:02:30.980> feels<00:02:31.220> awkward<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.730> bad

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
just everything feels awkward and bad

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.520 
just everything feels awkward and bad
and<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.080> just<00:02:33.170> about

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
and so it's just it's just about

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.310 
and so it's just it's just about
figuring<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.340> left<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.630> taking<00:02:35.959> me<00:02:36.080> a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
figuring the left and it's taking me a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.990 
figuring the left and it's taking me a
lot<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.770> time<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.130> figure<00:02:37.310> out<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.580> bed<00:02:37.700> rest

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
lot of time to figure out the bed rest

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.309 
lot of time to figure out the bed rest
it's<00:02:38.120> obviously<00:02:38.480> now<00:02:38.720> it's<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.989> lot<00:02:39.110> better

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
it's obviously now it's a lot better

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.370 
it's obviously now it's a lot better
than<00:02:39.620> then<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> year<00:02:41.180> ago<00:02:41.420> but<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.170> still

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
than then a year ago but it's it's still

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.040 
than then a year ago but it's it's still
not<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.220> still<00:02:43.459> months<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:44.810> still

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
not there it's still months it's still

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.840 
not there it's still months it's still
not<00:02:45.200> at<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.530> point<00:02:45.860> where<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.160> know<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
not at that point where I I know the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.680 
not at that point where I I know the
left<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.330> figured<00:02:48.110> out<00:02:48.200> my<00:02:48.830> mechanics<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.760> so

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
left I figured out my mechanics on it so

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.690 
left I figured out my mechanics on it so
that's<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.080> number<00:02:51.260> then<00:02:51.860> number<00:02:52.070> two<00:02:52.459> it's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
that's the number then number two it's

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.310 
that's the number then number two it's
just<00:02:52.730> my<00:02:53.000> technique<00:02:53.600> ease<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:53.989> dial

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
just my technique ease and dial

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.979 
just my technique ease and dial
vignettes<00:02:55.060> although<00:02:56.060> obviously<00:02:56.300> much<00:02:56.750> better

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
vignettes although obviously much better

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.290 
vignettes although obviously much better
than<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.260> was<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.739> number<00:02:58.250> three<00:02:58.519> it's<00:02:58.850> just

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
than it was and number three it's just

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.670 
than it was and number three it's just
genetics<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.260> mean<00:03:01.150> even<00:03:02.150> even<00:03:02.450> now<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.500> I'm

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
genetics I mean even even now that I'm

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.560 
genetics I mean even even now that I'm
branching<00:03:04.190> more<00:03:04.370> frequently<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.090> doing<00:03:05.420> more

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
branching more frequently and doing more

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.080 
branching more frequently and doing more
volume<00:03:05.989> even<00:03:06.680> when<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.250> dialed<00:03:07.580> in<00:03:07.820> my

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
volume even when I dialed in my

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.199 
volume even when I dialed in my
technique<00:03:08.570> I'll<00:03:09.230> probably<00:03:09.650> never<00:03:09.980> be<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.670> good

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
technique I'll probably never be a good

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.490 
technique I'll probably never be a good
bench<00:03:11.450> pressing<00:03:11.870> okay

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
bench pressing okay

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.680 
bench pressing okay
now<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.250> mean<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.670> Don<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.239> would<00:03:14.480> give

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
now this is mean that Don I would give

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.150 
now this is mean that Don I would give
up<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.170> bench<00:03:15.290> press<00:03:15.500> doesn't<00:03:15.950> mean<00:03:16.070> I

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
up on the bench press doesn't mean I

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.220 
up on the bench press doesn't mean I
can't<00:03:16.430> progress<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.060> bench<00:03:17.209> press<00:03:17.390> but

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
can't progress on the bench press but

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.289 
can't progress on the bench press but
it's<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:18.980> probably<00:03:19.190> always<00:03:19.610> gonna<00:03:20.000> fall

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
it's it's probably always gonna fall

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.180 
it's it's probably always gonna fall
behind<00:03:20.510> okay<00:03:20.989> now<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.230> plan<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.560> bench<00:03:21.920> press<00:03:22.010> a

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
behind okay now I plan to bench press a

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.210 
behind okay now I plan to bench press a
fuckload<00:03:22.549> ow<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:23.769> will<00:03:24.769> expect<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.340> bench<00:03:25.579> press

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
fuckload ow I will expect to bench press

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.000 
fuckload ow I will expect to bench press
200<00:03:28.220> pounds<00:03:28.700> in<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.030> next<00:03:29.120> year<00:03:29.540> at<00:03:29.720> least<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
200 pounds in the next year at least and

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.400 
200 pounds in the next year at least and
I<00:03:31.190> end<00:03:31.519> up<00:03:31.690> okay<00:03:32.690> I'm<00:03:32.840> not<00:03:32.959> gonna<00:03:33.140> tell<00:03:33.380> my

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
I end up okay I'm not gonna tell my

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.400 
I end up okay I'm not gonna tell my
girls<00:03:33.739> all<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.610> this<00:03:34.790> video<00:03:35.090> because<00:03:35.360> it's<00:03:36.320> not

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
girls all in this video because it's not

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.110 
girls all in this video because it's not
really<00:03:36.680> worth<00:03:36.799> it<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.370> will<00:03:37.790> work<00:03:37.940> on

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
really worth it but I will work on

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.580 
really worth it but I will work on
adventures<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.690> am<00:03:38.870> working<00:03:39.110> on<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.290> bench<00:03:39.440> press

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
adventures I am working on a bench press

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.050 
adventures I am working on a bench press
so<00:03:39.829> that's<00:03:40.040> not<00:03:40.220> that's<00:03:40.430> not<00:03:40.640> really<00:03:40.970> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
so that's not that's not really the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.020 
so that's not that's not really the
point<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:41.780> those<00:03:42.290> are<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.530> three<00:03:42.799> reasons<00:03:43.030> and

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
point so those are the three reasons and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.930
