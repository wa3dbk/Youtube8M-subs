00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.009
 good 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.500
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.719
 Welcome to point 5 x 1 and welcome 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.700
 eaten fast where I'll give you maybe 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.550
 the news of the day and the news of the 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.680
 week and even the news of the month 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.020
 because Paul does scarcely 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.210
 minutes has finally made official that the 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.520
 March 9 will introduce us to all the 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.869
 world the apple watch web has not said that 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.770
 will teach us a few but all 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.540
 we know what he will teach us 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.460
 he has simply summoned the press to 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.829
 an event on March 9 in our 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.960
 web page we have taught you all the 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.570
 details that we know at this time of 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.129
 this event we have placed the invitation 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.600
 what is this that you are seeing here now 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.609
 I would put it without a full part for 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.410
 that you see it better the text of the 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.809
 invitation comes to say how it starts 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.640
 the spring good if I have not had 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.350
 almost time not to stop reading it 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.320
 but the first thing that has come to me 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.719
 head is a bit that's also true 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.280
 there's no denying it then that's what 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.280
 first and the only thing we know only 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.350
 watching the invitation 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.180
 as I say we're going to make the apple 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.540
 watch and surely the new versions 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.360
 of them specifically and I 8.2 that already 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.670
 we know that it will be completely 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.440
 focused on connectivity with support 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.390
 that's what the event will be about 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.920
 mainly there will surely be a lot 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.840
 rumorology now in the coming days 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.000
 about what else we could see in that 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.470
 event but I 'm already old dog already 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.149
 I 've swallowed a few events of 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.090
 apple and I also swallow rumology 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.040
 prior to these events and do not leave 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.170
 take over the blogosphere because 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.840
 I honestly think we 're going to see 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.220
 a monothematic event is to say centered 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.649
 in the clock he also contributed 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.619
 deserves eye I think it's a device 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.690
 that will have many functions and that in 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.429
 that keynote are going to have to show us 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.720
 everything they did not show us the year 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.670
 passed in the iphone's keynote where 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.000
 they presented this watch and 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.560
 especially how it works how it works 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.940
 synchronizing it with the iphone with 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.860
 any device and I is in 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.210
 definitive and of course also 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.800
 they will have to talk to the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.539
 developers will have to encourage them to 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.909
 develop applications for this watch 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.280
 anyway I want you to go here I do not know yes 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.860
 excessively long but neither does he 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.630
 that the center in this single product the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.160
 will make short remember that for 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.709
 town of short well it gives a little 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.420
 same as the keynote that is memory that was 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.760
 super short recently was the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.520
 iphone 5 is the iphone 5 ce presented 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.130
 two phones and lasted barely 50 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.930
 minutes therefore I do not think that Paul 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.069
 worry the duration will present what 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.560
 have to present what I think is going to 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.480
 be the watch support and the rumors like 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.060
 for example the ipad end of the year the 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.250
 iphone end of the year and that man booker 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.750
 that it sounded like that that's what I 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.519
 I have and doubt but I doubt we'll see 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.660
 in this keynote I think we'll see 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.570
 more for the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.370
 for the cool web of los pÃ©rez conference 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.410
 not because it does not hit in the event that 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.470
 let's see this March 9 but for the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.180
 fact that in the end how much 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.610
 Less time is in the market too 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.870
 will last and more in approaching do the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.700
 launch of the new version of the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.970
 operating system that will come out this year in 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.740
 finish 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.870
 those are paranoia mine and it's nothing 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 official so nothing that's a little bit my 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.170
 foresight in order to paul is going to 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.610
 retransmit the event that will also be 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.010
