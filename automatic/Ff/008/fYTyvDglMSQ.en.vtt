00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
Gibson Flying V so I set up the axe a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.720 
Gibson Flying V so I set up the axe a
little<00:03:17.050> bit<00:03:17.170> I'm<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.350> played<00:03:18.130> just<00:03:18.280> fine<00:03:18.520> but

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
little bit I'm it played just fine but

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.720 
little bit I'm it played just fine but
god<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.209> actually<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.600> little<00:03:19.810> low<00:03:20.580> for<00:03:21.580> my

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
god it's actually a little low for my

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.790 
god it's actually a little low for my
preference<00:03:22.239> if<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.840> were<00:03:22.930> shredder<00:03:23.260> man<00:03:23.620> this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
preference if you were shredder man this

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.170 
preference if you were shredder man this
thing<00:03:23.950> was<00:03:24.069> beautiful<00:03:24.459> when<00:03:24.550> I<00:03:24.610> first<00:03:24.850> got<00:03:24.970> it

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
thing was beautiful when I first got it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.520 
thing was beautiful when I first got it
the<00:03:25.300> strings<00:03:25.810> are<00:03:25.930> actually<00:03:25.989> lower<00:03:26.290> than<00:03:26.410> they

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
the strings are actually lower than they

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.820 
the strings are actually lower than they
are<00:03:26.560> now<00:03:26.860> so<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.760> could<00:03:27.880> really<00:03:28.090> play<00:03:28.300> fast

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
are now so you could really play fast

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.500 
are now so you could really play fast
the<00:03:29.830> other<00:03:29.950> thing<00:03:30.220> that's<00:03:30.430> kind<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.420> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the other thing that's kind of a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.720 
the other thing that's kind of a
disadvantage<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.320> thing<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.709> where<00:03:33.580> the

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
disadvantage on this thing is where the

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.810 
disadvantage on this thing is where the
strap<00:03:34.420> pegs<00:03:35.320> are<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:35.950> one<00:03:36.400> right<00:03:36.580> here<00:03:36.730> is

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
strap pegs are so one right here is

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.259 
strap pegs are so one right here is
pretty<00:03:36.970> common<00:03:37.269> no<00:03:37.989> big<00:03:38.140> deal<00:03:38.290> here<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:40.030> one

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
pretty common no big deal here this one

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.640 
pretty common no big deal here this one
let's<00:03:40.900> get<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.050> little<00:03:41.200> closer<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.620> camera

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
let's get a little closer to the camera

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.080 
let's get a little closer to the camera
so<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.130> get<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.280> little<00:03:42.489> good<00:03:42.610> look<00:03:42.790> at<00:03:42.940> what's

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
so you get a little good look at what's

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.890 
so you get a little good look at what's
going<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:43.420> here

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
going on here

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.870 
going on here
so<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:45.700> on<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.600> neck<00:03:46.780> plate<00:03:47.370> let's<00:03:48.370> see<00:03:48.580> move

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
so it's on the neck plate let's see move

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.780 
so it's on the neck plate let's see move
it<00:03:48.970> around<00:03:49.030> here<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.069> got<00:03:51.220> four<00:03:51.430> screws

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
it around here so so you got four screws

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.550 
it around here so so you got four screws
guess<00:03:52.269> what<00:03:52.510> when<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.780> screws<00:03:53.080> holding<00:03:53.440> up

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
guess what when you screws holding up

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.970 
guess what when you screws holding up
you<00:03:53.680> strap<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:55.050> not<00:03:56.050> my<00:03:56.290> preference<00:03:56.620> so<00:03:56.890> I'm

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
you strap so not my preference so I'm

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.170 
you strap so not my preference so I'm
going<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.160> be<00:03:57.220> changing<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.700> on<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:57.970> thing

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
going to be changing that on this thing

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.660 
going to be changing that on this thing
since<00:03:58.450> I<00:03:58.769> find<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.860> right<00:04:00.010> size<00:04:00.220> screw<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:00.610> I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
since I find the right size screw so I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.590 
since I find the right size screw so I
can<00:04:00.760> get<00:04:00.850> rid<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.030> this<00:04:01.150> thing

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
can get rid of this thing

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.150 
can get rid of this thing
and<00:04:01.720> I'm<00:04:01.870> going<00:04:02.110> to<00:04:02.140> be<00:04:02.260> poking<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.650> hole<00:04:02.799> in<00:04:03.010> it

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
and I'm going to be poking a hole in it

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.949 
and I'm going to be poking a hole in it
about<00:04:04.000> right<00:04:04.239> here<00:04:04.450> that's<00:04:04.690> where<00:04:04.780> I'm<00:04:04.840> going

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959
