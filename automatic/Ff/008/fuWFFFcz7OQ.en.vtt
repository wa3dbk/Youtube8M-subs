00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello there is no pikachu with you today 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.080
 would like to show you how to weave out 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.500
 beads 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.170
 I think you all saw beautiful baubles 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.320
 made by bead technique they are all 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.779
 shimmer and quite easily done 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.119
 can i tell you this lesson and dedicates 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.609
 my two favorite groups of baubles 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.939
 weaving lessons 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.909
 abbreviated soup as they call themselves like this 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.179
 group called members and 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:36.000
 baubles and boring or firms as they call 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:38.820
 themselves they are baubles and borings on this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.679
 moment is the most popular band i and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.420
 I really, really love me too 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.449
 sat down we will do this here 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.079
 heart i already started as you see i 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.100
 I will quickly explain how to do what 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.260
 so we need 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 11 warp threads thick sewing threads 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 any machine personally ivy serb 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 rolled me personally this is a cardboard box 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:10.229
 Here is such a thread I did with the tension 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.450
 snake schemes that is like this 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.829
 we will need a very, very long 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.700
 thread and very very thin needle well, 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.070
 respectively moon beads that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.850
 we do we recruit according to the scheme 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.850
 number of beads 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.899
 now i need seven red 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.509
 beads 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:39.869
 here and three white over there from me 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.469
 lying all the beads from thousands of some such 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:52.219
 gave me a bunch of spotted more on my bauble not 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:55.969
 I hide so well then we collect the evening 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.969
 no one burns 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:18.190
 so there are seven red beads and 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:21.970
 only three white needles left can 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 be very very thin can even be 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.620
 very very thick but the main thing that 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.000
 School was not thin that go over there 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.340
 beads that is, see what we do 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.390
 why do we need it we recruit on 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.130
 needle we need the number of beads and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.310
 now what we do we take like this 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.560
 here we drag from needle to thread on 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:50.820
 our long string must be somewhere 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:55.900
 meter meter length in twenty can be 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.510
 beads with a cat to the very bottom here it is 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.090
 further we bring a needle under all 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.310
 main threads and together with threads 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.910
 stretch to the left side to beads 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.910
 looked for 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:19.720
 collect all this is our happiness like this 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:21.459
 Here we are distributed in rows in order 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.090
 had the right number of rows need to take 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.769
 one thread more than indicated in the scheme 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.660
 so on the most important step that we 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.150
 do we take a needle 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:40.200
 take here our beads and pass 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:43.420
 needle in the beads without touching the warp threads 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.340
 on top of the warp threads 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.980
 so that the beads are fixed on the track and everything 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.120
 it could be carried as a bracelet 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.190
 that is, it turns out to be close 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.190
 secured on both sides top bottom 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.620
 the main thing is not to miss the mark and not to miss two 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.950
 times the bottom of the track because without because 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.930
 that the bead can just jump out 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:10.319
 and will be one point less in your 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:14.980
 the bracelet here it is I shoved the whole thing 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.690
 take out needle and thread 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.459
 do not tighten to the end and not much 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.160
 I tell a special secret which is 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.750
 I do not understand any people well, either 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.200
 they themselves did not think of anything else 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.560
 In short, you know that the edges of all 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.530
 baubles can be crooked it guys 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.950
 very very bad how to avoid it 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.320
 in this technique you just need to first very much 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.280
 much to tighten that turned out such 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.130
 skimpy edges and then on the right 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.850
 straighten so that both edges we went 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:56.860
 exactly you see both edges of me 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:59.950
 remain absolutely even heh and all with 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.229
 you were pikachu the main meaning of weaving 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.820
 beaded and he explained well everything else you 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.740
 understand it yourself because everything is done 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.740
 all the same for now
