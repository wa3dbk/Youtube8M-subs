than<00:01:00.129> usual<00:01:00.460> in<00:01:00.789> jensen<00:01:01.300> yeah<00:01:02.199> but<00:01:02.469> he's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
than usual in jensen yeah but he's

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.070 
than usual in jensen yeah but he's
training<00:01:03.039> smart<00:01:03.460> he's<00:01:04.180> not<00:01:04.449> killing<00:01:04.750> himself

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
training smart he's not killing himself

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.530 
training smart he's not killing himself
in<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.650> trainer<00:01:06.010> see<00:01:06.640> if<00:01:06.760> he<00:01:06.880> kills<00:01:07.300> himself

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
in the trainer see if he kills himself

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.810 
in the trainer see if he kills himself
in<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.080> training<00:01:08.409> then<00:01:09.100> he's<00:01:09.220> going<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.520> over

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
in the training then he's going to over

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.290 
in the training then he's going to over
true<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:11.020> he's<00:01:11.140> going<00:01:11.590> slowly<00:01:11.980> step<00:01:12.670> by<00:01:12.700> step

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
true but he's going slowly step by step

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.970 
true but he's going slowly step by step
so<00:01:14.050> he<00:01:14.650> will<00:01:14.980> not<00:01:15.850> be<00:01:16.120> over<00:01:16.510> train<00:01:16.840> and<00:01:17.620> i<00:01:17.740> think

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
so he will not be over train and i think

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.270 
so he will not be over train and i think
you<00:01:18.040> can<00:01:18.220> see<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.430> great<00:01:18.730> performance<00:01:20.280> marquez

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
once the same thing so that's going to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.000 
once the same thing so that's going to
mean<00:01:24.400> that

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
mean that

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.130 
mean that
they<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.820> those<00:01:27.090> two<00:01:27.420> guys<00:01:27.630> are<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.050> to

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
they got those two guys are going to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.680

throw<00:01:28.350> caution<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> wind<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.730> go<00:01:30.270> after

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
throw caution to the wind and go after

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.470 
throw caution to the wind and go after
each<00:01:30.720> other<00:01:31.080> I<00:01:31.410> mean<00:01:32.010> not<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.550> know<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
each other I mean not you know the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.510 
each other I mean not you know the
reason<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.800> fights<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.370> been

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
reason that the fights have been

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.880 
reason that the fights have been
relatively<00:01:36.440> inconclusive<00:01:37.440> is<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.880> Manny

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
relatively inconclusive is because Manny

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.580 
relatively inconclusive is because Manny
you<00:01:40.890> know<00:01:40.920> goes<00:01:41.760> attacks<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.750> pulls<00:01:43.260> out

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you know goes attacks and pulls out

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.340 
you know goes attacks and pulls out
because<00:01:44.250> mark<00:01:45.150> has<00:01:45.360> such<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.660> good<00:01:45.930> counter

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
because mark has such a good counter

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
because mark has such a good counter
punch<00:01:46.590> he<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:47.040> get<00:01:47.190> many<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:48.030> nailed<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.960> he

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
punch he can get many get nailed if he

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.830 
punch he can get many get nailed if he
stays<00:01:49.500> in<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.400> long<00:01:50.570> but<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.780> time
