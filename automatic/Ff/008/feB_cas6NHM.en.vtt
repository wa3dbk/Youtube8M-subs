00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.250
 ah 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.730
 hello spartans I'm disco this is a 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.810
 gameplay of the game mode user me 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.080
 he liked quite a lot he made 22 kills you will see 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.689
 how I was playing at that time 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.050
 very good but enough is enough to 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.650
 to be able to win well that we will talk about 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.910
 this video, more specifically on 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:43.350
 two news your news more than xbox 1 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 on this occasion 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.879
 this 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.450
 that we will be able to improve our 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.690
 games with which I refer to this 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.960
 that we can buy a version of a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.910
 game that I'm going to go out for xbox 360 that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 later it will come out for xbox 1 it is not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.690
 the case of all but there are some that are 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.710
 confirmed as would be the case of nick 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:18.300
 for speed rivals bhakti field 4 call of 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.160
 duty wars until it is written 414 between 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.130
 much others 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.430
 as well 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.130
 Microsoft can win in exchange 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.310
 you have dollars 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.720
 and how we can do this through 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.990
 from the microsoft tub 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.240
 is going to be in two modalities if you 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.840
 shopping is the game physically in a 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.070
 microsoft store then since turning 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.310
 the game and they beat the game is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.370
 say dollars and they will give you another 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.150
 game in physical format for xbox 1 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.560
 be the same game but it already keeps 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.100
 you so that they can choose it in 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.650
 xbox 1 on the other hand if they bought it in 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.640
 digital format 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.640
 they pay 10 dollars they are going to 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:18.180
 remove the access to play it in 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:24.190
 xbox 360 but they will get it for xbox 1 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:28.870
 this is very useful for example for 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:32.860
 who want to play before fifa 14 that comes out 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.690
 first on xbox 360 and then it will not come back 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.740
 to have to buy the same game to 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.070
 xbox 1 but they simply pay 10 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.170
 dollars and they will be able to enjoy it 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.170
 also in your xbox 1 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:55.150
 well the next news that I believe 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.220
 that will cheer up enough 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.880
 enough subscribers is about that the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:08.350
 reader does not rule out supporting the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.870
 retrocompatibility in the future but it 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.300
 they will ask as if they had told us 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.360
 until the fatigue that can not give the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:21.370
 backward compatibility of xbox games 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.760
 360 with xbox 1 because the architecture and 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.980
 all you have to see is totally 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.890
 different well 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.220
 this is where the cloud comes in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.970
 servers is in the cloud 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
 it's very very important since so 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.140
 they tell us 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.200
 Alberto tells us what 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.200
 who is the senior director of microsoft 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.269
 yes absolutely that is one of the things 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.760
 that makes the cloud so interesting 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.900
 and at the same time so difficult to explain to the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.220
 people are what they have declared when they 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.799
 tell the consumer 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.200
 we want xbox or not to be connected 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.689
 we want the developers to know 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.680
 that the cloud is there we are not trying 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:16.320
 of inventing false things there are many 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.000
 things that servers can do to 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.910
 times things like improve the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.180
 voice processing or they could be more 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.479
 complicated things like reusing things 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.810
 complete as the gateway does and 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.820
 take them directly to x1 simply 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.400
 we have to find out how to do it 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.669
 how long it would take us how much 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.340
 It would cost to offer the service or how to 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.280
 good in the experience 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.610
 so that would have to see first that 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:52.150
 value it with 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:54.900
 those variables see how viable it would be 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.020
 how expensive it would be and how much 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.919
 important what the experience would be like 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.630
 example would have to do with how much 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.389
 minimum servanda would need to do it 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.290
 so that it would have flowed and not all and 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.870
 all have damaged well that would be 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.060
 the most important news until the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.340
 moment about cox 1 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.919
 I hope that subscribe to the channel for 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.169
 that they fear they have not done that they leave their 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.240
 like on my facebook page which 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.210
 you will find in the extension of the video my 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.220
 twitter can also follow and up to 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.220
