good time to do it so I came up with 10

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.749 
good time to do it so I came up with 10
ideas<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.619> would<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.740> suitable<00:00:32.160> for

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
ideas that I think would be suitable for

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
ideas that I think would be suitable for
anyone<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.270> life<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.870> gamer<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
anyone in your life that is a gamer and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.290 
anyone in your life that is a gamer and
that<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.620> need<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> get<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> present<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.750 
that you need to get a present for the
first<00:00:36.600> idea<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.110> had<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.680> gift<00:00:38.010> cards<00:00:38.370> now

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
first idea that I had is gift cards now

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
first idea that I had is gift cards now
gift<00:00:39.030> cards<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.960> safe<00:00:40.260> option

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
gift cards are a really safe option

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.500 
gift cards are a really safe option
because<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.610> may<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.149> person

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
because you may know that the person

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
because you may know that the person
likes<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> shop<00:00:43.260> at<00:00:43.440> eb<00:00:43.829> games<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.879> like

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
cards but you don't know specifically
what<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.190> when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> gift

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
what they want so when you get a gift

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
what they want so when you get a gift
card<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.480> buy<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.690> whatever<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.320> want

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
much money spent on them and that's not

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.479
