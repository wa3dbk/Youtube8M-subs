00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
only because I started trying to think

beer plus non alcoholic beverage and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.260 
beer plus non alcoholic beverage and
then<00:02:58.260> realize<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:59.160> horrifying<00:02:59.790> number<00:03:00.150> of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
then realize that a horrifying number of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.700 
then realize that a horrifying number of
them<00:03:00.390> have<00:03:00.570> already<00:03:00.780> been<00:03:00.900> tried<00:03:01.290> from<00:03:01.500> Mitch

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
them have already been tried from Mitch

so<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.670> think<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.540> more

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
so I really think that this is more

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.110 
so I really think that this is more
remarkable<00:03:07.590> than<00:03:07.740> we<00:03:07.860> think<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.910> is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
remarkable than we think in that this is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.110 
remarkable than we think in that this is
the<00:03:09.630> last<00:03:09.900> frontier<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:11.120> cross-sectional

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
that they're only rolling it out in

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.170 
that they're only rolling it out in
Canada<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.680> start<00:03:16.920> when<00:03:17.340> they're<00:03:17.820> clearly
