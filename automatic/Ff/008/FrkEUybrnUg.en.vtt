00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.719 
had watched to look for this or to look
for<00:01:44.970> why<00:01:45.360> Forge<00:01:45.899> wasn't<00:01:46.200> working<00:01:46.549> they'd<00:01:47.549> go

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
for why Forge wasn't working they'd go

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.429 
for why Forge wasn't working they'd go
to<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.000> installation<00:01:48.600> installation<00:01:48.960> but

now I've been having problems with this
for<00:04:07.490> a<00:04:07.520> while<00:04:07.790> until<00:04:07.910> I<00:04:08.060> realized<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.690> was<00:04:08.810> just

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
for a while until I realized I was just

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.540 
for a while until I realized I was just
like<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.890> know<00:04:09.980> I'm<00:04:10.160> going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.340> find<00:04:10.490> out

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
like you know I'm going to find out

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.950 
like you know I'm going to find out
which<00:04:10.700> model<00:04:10.730> it<00:04:11.450> was<00:04:11.740> I<00:04:13.600> think<00:04:14.600> was<00:04:14.720> most

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
which model it was I think was most

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.080 
which model it was I think was most
swords<00:04:15.970> or<00:04:16.970> most<00:04:17.570> creatures<00:04:18.040> so<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.310> removed

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
swords or most creatures so I removed

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.340 
swords or most creatures so I removed
that<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.480> I<00:04:20.510> figured<00:04:20.780> out<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.930> was<00:04:21.019> happening

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
that and I figured out it was happening

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.600 
that and I figured out it was happening
again<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.709> put<00:04:21.859> them<00:04:21.950> all<00:04:22.040> in<00:04:22.280> one<00:04:22.310> by<00:04:22.580> one

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
again so I put them all in one by one

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.640 
again so I put them all in one by one
and<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:23.450> little<00:04:23.690> did<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.840> know<00:04:23.930> they<00:04:24.230> all<00:04:24.350> worked

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
and a little did I know they all worked

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.830 
and a little did I know they all worked
except<00:04:25.580> useful<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:25.970> me<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.150> one<00:04:26.300> by<00:04:26.450> one<00:04:26.480> so

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
except useful to me and one by one so

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.950 
except useful to me and one by one so
