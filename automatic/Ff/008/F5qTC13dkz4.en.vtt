a reef crest mode as you can see it

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.490 
a reef crest mode as you can see it
gives<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.189> excellent<00:00:23.960> current<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> top

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
gives some excellent current on the top

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.800 
gives some excellent current on the top
of<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> water<00:00:26.840> which<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.170> nice<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:29.810> fact

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
of the water which is very nice in fact

some of the sometimes you'll actually
see<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:34.160> whirlpool<00:00:35.160> created<00:00:36.980> along<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> top<00:00:39.260> as

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
see a whirlpool created along the top as

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.380 
see a whirlpool created along the top as
the<00:00:40.890> vortex<00:00:41.460> speeds<00:00:41.730> up

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:56.690 

see<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> Whirlpool<00:00:46.500> form

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.910 

it's<00:00:57.210> pretty<00:00:57.420> cool<00:00:57.600> very<00:00:58.170> nice<00:00:58.350> water<00:00:58.620> action

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it's pretty cool very nice water action

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.920 
it's pretty cool very nice water action
I<00:00:59.630> have<00:01:00.630> a<00:01:00.690> pointed<00:01:00.990> directly<00:01:01.080> at<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.560> SPS

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
I have a pointed directly at the SPS

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.820 
I have a pointed directly at the SPS
maximum<00:01:03.930> flow<00:01:07.430> here<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.760> some

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
maximum flow here you can see some

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.080 
maximum flow here you can see some
polyps

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.410 

they<00:01:17.659> seem<00:01:17.899> to<00:01:17.960> really<00:01:18.140> love<00:01:18.380> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.880 

so<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> way<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> water<00:01:22.409> flows<00:01:24.560> directly<00:01:25.560> out

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so the way the water flows directly out

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.520 
so the way the water flows directly out
of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> MP<00:01:26.400> 20<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.450> directs<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.350> there's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of the MP 20 it directs but then there's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.219 
of the MP 20 it directs but then there's
an<00:01:28.650> undertow<00:01:29.130> which<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.700> amazing<00:01:32.960> which<00:01:33.960> goes

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
an undertow which is amazing which goes

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
an undertow which is amazing which goes
from<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.799> over<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.580> top<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.060> under<00:01:38.390> it's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
from the over the top and under it's

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.460 
from the over the top and under it's
much<00:01:39.659> slower<00:01:39.840> than<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.289> direct<00:01:40.799> flow<00:01:41.250> rate<00:01:42.470> as

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
much slower than the direct flow rate as

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.490 
much slower than the direct flow rate as
you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.670> some<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> polyps<00:01:45.899> blowing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you can see some of the polyps blowing

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.029 
you can see some of the polyps blowing
on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.520> lower<00:01:47.700> portion<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.330> tank

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
on the lower portion of the tank

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.130 
on the lower portion of the tank
actually<00:01:50.039> blow<00:01:50.729> towards<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> np20<00:01:52.049> as

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
actually blow towards the np20 as

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.570 
actually blow towards the np20 as
opposed<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> away<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.070> its<00:01:53.189> showing<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
opposed to away from its showing the

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:03.330 
opposed to away from its showing the
undertow

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.959 

the<00:02:03.880> LPS<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.490> softies<00:02:06.490> don't<00:02:06.700> seem<00:02:06.850> to

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
the LPS and the softies don't seem to

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.880 
the LPS and the softies don't seem to
mind<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.299> flow<00:02:07.509> at<00:02:07.630> all<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.530> not<00:02:08.739> very

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
mind the flow at all it's not very

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.050 
mind the flow at all it's not very
strong<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:09.580> can<00:02:09.729> adjust<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.970> need<00:02:13.840> be
