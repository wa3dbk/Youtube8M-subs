about the the height from the blue the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.199 
about the the height from the blue the
blue<00:02:43.080> shirt<00:02:43.350> had<00:02:43.680> angry<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
blue shirt had angry I think that's the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.110 
blue shirt had angry I think that's the
his<00:02:46.110> left<00:02:46.350> eye<00:02:46.530> everyone<00:02:47.280> seems<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.030> be

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
his left eye everyone seems to be

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.680 
his left eye everyone seems to be
focused<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.080> up<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.410> glar<00:02:49.560> area

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
focused on that that up to glar area

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.760 
focused on that that up to glar area
that<00:02:51.690> gets<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.050> indication<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:52.680> it's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
that gets the indication I think it's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.680 
that gets the indication I think it's
left<00:02:54.050> yeah<00:02:55.430> have<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.520> got<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.850> right<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.569> the
