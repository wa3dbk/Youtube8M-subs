everything<00:03:29.019> covered<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.370> last<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.909> the

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
everything covered and the last is the

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.699 
everything covered and the last is the
pasta<00:03:31.480> everything<00:03:31.989> goes<00:03:32.200> in

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
pasta everything goes in

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.140 
pasta everything goes in
looks<00:03:33.040> like<00:03:33.219> our<00:03:33.510> oil<00:03:34.510> is<00:03:35.459> nice<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.519> hot<00:03:36.730> we

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
looks like our oil is nice and hot we

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.220 
looks like our oil is nice and hot we
just<00:03:37.329> want<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.510> make<00:03:37.629> sure<00:03:37.659> that<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.079> is

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
just want to make sure that this is

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.319 
just want to make sure that this is
evenly<00:03:38.769> distributed<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.760> even<00:03:40.060> as<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.239> can

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
evenly distributed and even as you can

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.630 
evenly distributed and even as you can
make<00:03:40.629> it<00:03:40.780> right<00:03:41.049> but<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.439> main<00:03:41.620> point<00:03:41.950> is<00:03:42.250> that

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
make it right but the main point is that

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.089 
make it right but the main point is that
all<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.569> pasta<00:03:43.810> has<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.290> egg<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.920> then

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
all the pasta has the egg and then

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.720 
all the pasta has the egg and then
cheese<00:03:45.340> mixture<00:03:48.659> good<00:03:49.659> sound<00:03:50.400> that's<00:03:51.400> all<00:03:51.579> the

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
cheese mixture good sound that's all the

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.220 
cheese mixture good sound that's all the
same<00:03:53.400> what<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:54.519> want<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.790> do<00:03:54.909> here<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.480> make

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
same what we want to do here is make

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.190 
same what we want to do here is make
sure<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.859> is<00:03:57.040> flattened<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:59.079> we

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
sure that this is flattened and that we

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.890 
sure that this is flattened and that we
get<00:03:59.349> an<00:03:59.470> even<00:04:00.040> transfer<00:04:00.819> of<00:04:00.939> heat<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.659> comes

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
get an even transfer of heat that comes

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.339 
get an even transfer of heat that comes
up<00:04:02.169> and<00:04:02.530> we'll<00:04:03.159> use<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.370> plate<00:04:03.819> basically<00:04:04.810> put

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
up and we'll use a plate basically put

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.740 
up and we'll use a plate basically put
this<00:04:05.500> down<00:04:05.739> here<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:06.280> push<00:04:06.549> it<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:07.419> to<00:04:07.569> get<00:04:07.689> a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
this down here and push it just to get a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.149 
this down here and push it just to get a
lot<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.079> air<00:04:08.260> out<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.769> they<00:04:08.829> get<00:04:09.010> it

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
lot of the air out and they get it

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.039 
lot of the air out and they get it
condensed<00:04:09.579> so<00:04:09.790> when<00:04:09.939> we<00:04:10.060> slice<00:04:10.359> into<00:04:10.629> it<00:04:10.780> we

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
condensed so when we slice into it we

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.449 
condensed so when we slice into it we
don't<00:04:11.200> have<00:04:11.290> any<00:04:11.470> hair<00:04:11.650> crackers

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
don't have any hair crackers

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.349 
don't have any hair crackers
and<00:04:12.909> so<00:04:13.120> then<00:04:13.269> how<00:04:13.480> long<00:04:13.840> do<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:14.970> have<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.150> wait

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
and so then how long do you have to wait

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.969 
and so then how long do you have to wait
about<00:04:16.449> six<00:04:16.570> minutes<00:04:17.169> on<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.380> other<00:04:17.410> side<00:04:17.709> so

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
about six minutes on the other side so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.319 
about six minutes on the other side so
we're<00:04:18.190> gonna<00:04:18.280> let<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:18.549> go<00:04:18.729> for<00:04:18.759> about<00:04:19.060> six

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
we're gonna let it go for about six

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.189 
we're gonna let it go for about six
minutes<00:04:19.449> it's<00:04:20.199> browning<00:04:20.699> on<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:22.599> other<00:04:22.870> side

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
minutes it's browning on the other side

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.899 
minutes it's browning on the other side
and<00:04:23.500> then<00:04:23.860> we're<00:04:24.010> gonna<00:04:24.130> flip<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.760> that's

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
and then we're gonna flip it and that's

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.029 
and then we're gonna flip it and that's
the<00:04:25.030> hard<00:04:25.240> part<00:04:25.270> once<00:04:26.260> you<00:04:26.380> flip<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.740> put<00:04:26.770> it

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
the hard part once you flip it put it

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.469 
the hard part once you flip it put it
back<00:04:27.159> in<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.550> wait<00:04:27.699> another<00:04:27.880> six<00:04:28.180> minutes

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
back in you wait another six minutes

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.750 
back in you wait another six minutes
it's<00:04:28.690> ready<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:29.409> feel<00:04:29.620> like<00:04:30.070> that's<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.430> part

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760
