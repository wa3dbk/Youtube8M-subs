00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.110
 blurred with the angular brush 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.320
 you know that the angular brush brings 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.510
 bring as 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.630
 one side is attracted shorter than the other 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.729
 then on one side of a tip 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.420
 we take the color and from the other we take the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.700
 we run tests in a report or 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.790
 on a paper and then very carefully 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.790
 we are doing here over the eye what 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.470
 we are doing this side towards the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.810
 black side 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.500
 here how can you see good with the line 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.100
 air we made the lashes to make the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.090
 eyebrows first we put the part d 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.090
 above 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.170
 we place it like this with care 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.440
 and then with a pencil 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:15.170
 with a pencil what I did was to place 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.340
 12 points and then I do waveform 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:24.060
 I have it because I have done 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.060
 with the pint, we'll take it 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.060
 we do the little dots 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.060
 and then with the brush liner 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.060
 we wet it a little 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.270
 we wet it we unload it a little and in 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.940
 the paint we are rotating the brush until 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.510
 so it is about to ink 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.510
 and later 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.660
 we start making our waves and we see 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.170
 that we run out of paint we go back and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.170
 we take 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.360
 and that's how our brows are for the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.000
 What we are going to do is what 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.740
 next we can also take the pint 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.830
 points or the back of our 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.850
 brush or a skewer stick we take the 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.510
 red color we encourage you a little bit 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.360
 we put a red dot and then with the 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.720
 They always have to have rags 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.210
 of flannel what we do is make this 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.340
 movement 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.700
 we do it like that and we have left if our 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.620
 red cheeks as I said the first 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.360
 What are we going to do with the suitcase? 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.310
 the doll that we want to put 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.400
 in this case, the ladybird in the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.740
 molds that I give them are going to be 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.630
 the eye holes to be for 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.260
 they know where to locate them and they will be 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.940
 also the mark of this part so that 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.690
 know how to place it 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.340
 here to paste it here I'll hope that 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.269
 Dry your eyes a little bit still not 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.269
 they have dried completely
