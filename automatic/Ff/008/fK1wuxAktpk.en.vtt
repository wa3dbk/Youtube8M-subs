but the conditions yes as I told the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.740 
but the conditions yes as I told the
wind<00:01:38.610> especially<00:01:39.530> made<00:01:41.119> running<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.240> race<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
wind especially made running my race a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.639 
wind especially made running my race a
bit<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:43.590> harder<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:45.420> didn't<00:01:46.020> work<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.320> as

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bit bit harder so I didn't work out as

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.670 
bit bit harder so I didn't work out as
it<00:01:46.799> did<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> semi-final<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:48.680> that's

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
it did in in the semi-final but that's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
it did in in the semi-final but that's
that's<00:01:50.009> how<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.659> point<00:01:51.689> did<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
that's how it is at what point did it

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.740 
that's how it is at what point did it
get<00:01:52.500> tough<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.040> was<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:53.579> at<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.329> point<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
get tough or was there at one point a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
get tough or was there at one point a
hurdle<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> where<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.649> make<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.040> most

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
hurdle you where you make is most

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.530 
hurdle you where you make is most
mistake<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
mistake or what was it

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.930 
mistake or what was it
I<00:01:58.660> think<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.560> was<00:01:59.680> from<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.130> beginning<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
I think it was from the beginning the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.680 
I think it was from the beginning the
the<00:02:01.710> wind<00:02:02.710> was<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.850> was<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> headwind<00:02:04.360> in<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
the wind was it was a headwind in the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.300 
the wind was it was a headwind in the
back<00:02:04.810> straight<00:02:05.080> so<00:02:05.290> that's<00:02:05.770> what<00:02:06.040> made<00:02:06.280> it

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
back straight so that's what made it

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.419 
back straight so that's what made it
hard<00:02:06.510> from<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.660> beginning<00:02:08.070> in<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.220> end<00:02:09.250> I

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
hard from the beginning in the end I

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.130 
hard from the beginning in the end I
tried<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.910> fight<00:02:10.090> as<00:02:10.210> much<00:02:10.390> as<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.600> could<00:02:10.660> but

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
tried to fight as much as I could but

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.650 
tried to fight as much as I could but
the<00:02:11.800> last<00:02:11.920> two<00:02:12.190> hurdles<00:02:12.630> came<00:02:14.160> came<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.450> far

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
the last two hurdles came came so far

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.850 
the last two hurdles came came so far
from<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.130> expected<00:02:18.490> so<00:02:19.380> yeah<00:02:20.380> after<00:02:20.710> the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
from what I expected so yeah after the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.540 
from what I expected so yeah after the
final<00:02:21.370> hurdle<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.760> tried<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.240> do<00:02:23.170> everything

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
final hurdle I tried to do everything
