and<00:00:51.280> yeah<00:00:52.150> not<00:00:52.720> quite<00:00:52.989> done<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.259> correctly<00:00:53.379> so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
and yeah not quite done it correctly so

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.719 
and yeah not quite done it correctly so
I<00:00:54.070> learnt<00:00:54.309> my<00:00:54.400> lesson

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
I learnt my lesson

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.660 
I learnt my lesson
all<00:00:54.939> right<00:00:55.059> boys<00:00:55.659> it's<00:00:55.720> about<00:00:55.960> either<00:00:56.799> either

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
all right boys it's about either either

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.160 
all right boys it's about either either
match<00:00:57.909> it<00:00:58.119> or<00:00:58.150> you<00:00:58.330> go<00:00:58.420> for<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.629> contrast<00:00:59.049> and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
match it or you go for a contrast and

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.749 
match it or you go for a contrast and
color<00:00:59.320> so<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.589> don't<00:00:59.769> want<00:00:59.890> to<00:00:59.949> you<00:01:00.549> know<00:01:00.580> it's

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:00.759 
color so you don't want to you know it's

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:02.340 
color so you don't want to you know it's
less<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.180> more<00:01:01.360> I<00:01:01.390> think<00:01:01.509> you<00:01:01.839> know<00:01:02.049> not<00:01:02.199> going

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
less is more I think you know not going

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.869 
less is more I think you know not going
for<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.559> necessarily<00:01:02.860> shiny<00:01:03.129> components<00:01:03.699> but

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
for a necessarily shiny components but

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.550 
for a necessarily shiny components but
the<00:01:03.939> kinda<00:01:04.360> more<00:01:04.509> muted<00:01:04.839> ones<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.199> black<00:01:05.379> ones

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
the kinda more muted ones the black ones

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.380 
the kinda more muted ones the black ones
look<00:01:05.740> quite<00:01:05.920> cool<00:01:06.159> this<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:06.729> is<00:01:07.060> this<00:01:07.240> is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
look quite cool this this is this is

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.580 
look quite cool this this is this is
just<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.570> one-off<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.140> just<00:01:08.350> for<00:01:08.560> a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
just a one-off this is just for a

just a one-off this is just for a
special<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.869> competition<00:01:10.869> it's<00:01:11.079> like<00:01:11.170> an

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
special and competition it's like an

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.530 
special and competition it's like an
autumn<00:01:11.610> bear<00:01:12.610> should<00:01:12.759> either<00:01:12.970> be<00:01:13.119> unique<00:01:13.360> when

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
autumn bear should either be unique when

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.020 
autumn bear should either be unique when
they're<00:01:13.720> all<00:01:13.900> individuals<00:01:14.619> so<00:01:14.860> each<00:01:15.729> one<00:01:15.909> is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
they're all individuals so each one is

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.240 
they're all individuals so each one is
different<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:17.530> look<00:01:17.710> different<00:01:18.070> can<00:01:18.220> I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
different they look different can I

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.649 
different they look different can I
distinctive<00:01:18.729> feature<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.090> high<00:01:19.180> bikes<00:01:19.420> or

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
distinctive feature the high bikes or

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.360 
distinctive feature the high bikes or
the<00:01:19.840> track<00:01:20.229> bands<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.860> know<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.220> three

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
the track bands you know that the three

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.450 
the track bands you know that the three
times<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.590> blue<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.040> black<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.400> the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
times that the blue the black and the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.890 
times that the blue the black and the
red<00:01:24.490> band<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.000> when<00:01:25.120> that<00:01:25.180> goes<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.540> it'll<00:01:25.750> be<00:01:25.780> a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
red band so when that goes on it'll be a

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.070 
red band so when that goes on it'll be a
bit<00:01:26.080> hopefully<00:01:26.890> look<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.070> bit<00:01:27.220> more<00:01:27.370> like<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
bit hopefully look a bit more like the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.110 
bit hopefully look a bit more like the
Cobra<00:01:29.080> sack<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.590> liberal<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:29.979> we<00:01:30.040> know<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
Cobra sack a liberal that we know the

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.960 
Cobra sack a liberal that we know the
bikes<00:01:31.330> are<00:01:31.540> understated<00:01:32.530> but<00:01:33.520> they<00:01:33.640> perform

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
bikes are understated but they perform

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.430 
bikes are understated but they perform
very<00:01:34.000> well<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.360> think<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.630> biggest<00:01:34.810> thing<00:01:35.080> we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
very well I think the biggest thing we

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.510 
very well I think the biggest thing we
want<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:35.680> see<00:01:35.830> is<00:01:35.890> when<00:01:35.979> people<00:01:36.070> get<00:01:36.280> on<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
want to see is when people get on the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.820 
want to see is when people get on the
bikes<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.540> they<00:01:37.720> test<00:01:37.960> ride<00:01:38.140> them<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.770> they

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
bikes and they test ride them that they

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.020 
bikes and they test ride them that they
actually<00:01:38.979> come<00:01:39.370> off<00:01:39.400> with<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.700> smile<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:39.940> their

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
actually come off with a smile on their

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.940

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.490 
some of this and on the bike itself so
we<00:01:49.210> could<00:01:49.330> go<00:01:49.420> for<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.630> career<00:01:49.869> twigs<00:01:50.170> you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
we could go for the career twigs you

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.600 
we could go for the career twigs you
know<00:01:50.710> potentially<00:01:51.130> coming<00:01:51.369> up<00:01:51.430> from<00:01:51.549> the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
know potentially coming up from the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.090 
know potentially coming up from the
bottom<00:01:51.760> bracket<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.420> seat<00:01:52.600> tube<00:01:52.840> or<00:01:53.799> some

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
bottom bracket and the seat tube or some

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.359 
bottom bracket and the seat tube or some
leaves<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.900> birds<00:01:56.110> obviously<00:01:56.680> migrating

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
leaves and the birds obviously migrating

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.039 
leaves and the birds obviously migrating
which<00:01:58.000> would<00:01:58.150> look<00:01:58.210> quite<00:01:58.450> cool<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.690> think<00:01:58.810> and

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
which would look quite cool I think and

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.500 
which would look quite cool I think and
this<00:01:59.140> one<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.560> quite<00:02:00.400> fancy<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.939> twigs

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
this one I quite fancy the twigs

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.340 
this one I quite fancy the twigs
