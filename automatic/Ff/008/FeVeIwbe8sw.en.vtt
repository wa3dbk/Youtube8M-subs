00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
we're sitting here now with a laptop

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.010 
we're sitting here now with a laptop
this<00:01:26.009> will<00:01:26.219> now<00:01:26.399> enable<00:01:26.820> our<00:01:27.119> laptop<00:01:27.630> bajada

the symbol up on top that means we have

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.679 
the symbol up on top that means we have

reading<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.380> actually<00:01:37.500> start

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
reading here we can actually start

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.930 
reading here we can actually start
uploading<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.310> computer

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
uploading a computer

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.540 
uploading a computer
so<00:01:40.540> we<00:01:40.690> will<00:01:40.840> just<00:01:40.900> have<00:01:41.170> created<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.980> new<00:01:42.190> hot

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
so we will just have created a new hot

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.290 
so we will just have created a new hot
hot<00:01:43.000> spot<00:01:43.330> for<00:01:43.630> our<00:01:43.830> wireless<00:01:44.830> infinitely<00:01:45.550> you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
hot spot for our wireless infinitely you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.320 
hot spot for our wireless infinitely you
can<00:01:46.420> give<00:01:46.540> multiple<00:01:46.690> computer<00:01:47.290> 1<00:01:47.410> on<00:01:47.560> 1<00:01:48.330> Sigma

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
can give multiple computer 1 on 1 Sigma

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.330 
can give multiple computer 1 on 1 Sigma
we<00:01:49.390> have<00:01:49.570> 20<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.930> 40<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.500> these<00:01:50.590> way<00:01:51.100> we<00:01:51.160> have

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
we have 20 of 40 of these way we have

00:01:51.340 --> 00:02:01.149 
we have 20 of 40 of these way we have
one<00:01:51.730> of<00:01:52.030> them<00:01:52.180> one<00:01:52.300> prone<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.690> be
