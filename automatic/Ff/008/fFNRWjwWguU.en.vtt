I<00:00:22.259> comb<00:00:23.259> my<00:00:23.289> hair<00:00:23.410> with<00:00:23.769> a<00:00:23.800> flat<00:00:23.980> iron<00:00:24.130> so<00:00:24.789> I

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
I comb my hair with a flat iron so I

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.439 
I comb my hair with a flat iron so I
wanted<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.449> just<00:00:25.599> show<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.050> how<00:00:26.560> I<00:00:26.980> did<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.669> and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
wanted to just show you how I did it and

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.810

how<00:00:29.380> it<00:00:29.470> came<00:00:29.589> out<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:30.039> I<00:00:30.369> just<00:00:30.400> think<00:00:30.699> it's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
how it came out and I just think it's

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.590 
how it came out and I just think it's
really<00:00:30.970> pretty<00:00:31.829> really<00:00:32.829> easy<00:00:33.160> and<00:00:33.579> I<00:00:34.300> really

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
really pretty really easy and I really

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.090 
really pretty really easy and I really
didn't<00:00:34.809> even<00:00:34.870> realize<00:00:35.260> how<00:00:35.500> easy<00:00:35.530> it<00:00:35.980> was

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
didn't even realize how easy it was

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.610 
didn't even realize how easy it was
until<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.730> started<00:00:37.059> doing<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:37.480> again<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:37.989> I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
until I started doing it again and I

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.930 
until I started doing it again and I
like<00:00:38.829> it<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:38.980> lot<00:00:39.010> better<00:00:39.219> than<00:00:39.520> curling<00:00:39.699> with<00:00:39.910> a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
like it a lot better than curling with a

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.970 
like it a lot better than curling with a
curling<00:00:40.300> iron<00:00:40.420> it<00:00:41.230> just<00:00:41.379> curls<00:00:41.590> a<00:00:41.680> little<00:00:41.710> bit

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
curling iron it just curls a little bit

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.150 
curling iron it just curls a little bit
faster<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.449> like<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.870> way<00:00:43.989> I<00:00:44.260> like<00:00:45.039> the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
faster and I like the way I like the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.770 
faster and I like the way I like the
look<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:45.609> gives<00:00:45.760> me<00:00:45.940> you<00:00:46.359> can<00:00:46.570> do<00:00:46.750> a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
look that it gives me you can do a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.510 
look that it gives me you can do a
little<00:00:46.960> bit<00:00:47.199> like<00:00:47.350> tighter<00:00:47.620> curls<00:00:48.039> or<00:00:48.399> you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.090 
and then it's kind of hard to pull it so
you<00:02:10.390> can<00:02:10.600> just<00:02:10.630> pull<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.290> lightly<00:02:11.530> or<00:02:11.680> have

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
you can just pull it lightly or have

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.840 
you can just pull it lightly or have
this<00:02:12.370> end<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.880> help<00:02:13.270> guide<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.900> down<00:02:16.709> and

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
this end and help guide you down and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.460 
this end and help guide you down and
there's<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.120> girl<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.560> nice<00:02:20.709> bouncy<00:02:21.450> curl

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
there's the girl it's a nice bouncy curl

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.060 
there's the girl it's a nice bouncy curl
you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.650> also<00:02:24.480> flip<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.660> in<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> middle<00:02:26.170> but<00:02:26.770> I

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
you can also flip it in the middle but I

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.780 
you can also flip it in the middle but I
just<00:02:27.489> find<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.940> works<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:29.470> good

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
just find that it works just as good

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.699 
just find that it works just as good
slipping<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.840> top<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.290> then<00:02:32.530> slowly

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
slipping it the top and then slowly

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.740 
slipping it the top and then slowly
going<00:02:33.010> down<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.580> then<00:02:33.700> once<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.060> get<00:02:34.239> I'm<00:02:34.690> a

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
going down and then once you get I'm a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.490 
going down and then once you get I'm a
little<00:02:34.930> bit<00:02:35.520> pair<00:02:36.520> left<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.030> flip<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.870> end<00:02:38.280> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.820 

once<00:02:44.500> again<00:02:44.680> I'm<00:02:45.430> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:46.230> fold<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.530> down

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
once again I'm going to fold it down

00:02:47.830 --> 00:03:13.340 
once again I'm going to fold it down
roll<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.970> down<00:02:49.180> whatever<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.799> then<00:02:51.640> go<00:02:52.540> slow

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.160 

and<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:14.070> once<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.550> get<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.850> end<00:03:15.020> I'm<00:03:16.020> going

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
and then once I get to the end I'm going

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.940 
and then once I get to the end I'm going
to<00:03:16.320> flip<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.620> again<00:03:17.870> then<00:03:21.260> help<00:03:22.260> guide<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.680> a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
to flip it again then help guide it a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.809 
to flip it again then help guide it a
little

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.110 

step

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
step

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.640 
step
you<00:03:34.629> can<00:03:34.780> probably<00:03:35.019> get<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.230> tighter<00:03:35.470> than

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
you can probably get it tighter than

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.259 
you can probably get it tighter than
that<00:03:35.799> I<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.129> don't<00:03:36.310> really<00:03:36.730> want<00:03:36.879> it<00:03:37.120> too

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
that I just don't really want it too

00:03:37.269 --> 00:05:49.080 
that I just don't really want it too
tight<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.870> I'm<00:03:38.799> going<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.159> finish

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.280 

so<00:05:50.090> that's<00:05:50.360> basically<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:50.840> hope<00:05:51.110> you<00:05:51.199> guys

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
so that's basically I hope you guys
