other hand as we age we lose muscle

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.320 
other hand as we age we lose muscle
tissue<00:01:15.780> every<00:01:16.350> year<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> age<00:01:18.299> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
tissue every year so from the age of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.480 
tissue every year so from the age of
around<00:01:18.810> 30<00:01:19.170> years<00:01:19.439> old<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.220> lose<00:01:20.460> a

around 30 years old you lose a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.990 
around 30 years old you lose a
significant<00:01:21.390> amount<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:22.790> muscle<00:01:23.790> tissue

significant amount of muscle tissue

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.950 
significant amount of muscle tissue
every<00:01:24.630> year<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.320> by<00:01:25.710> eating<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:27.570> doesn't

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
high intensity muscle training in order

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.590 
high intensity muscle training in order
to<00:01:36.600> reverse<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.200> process<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.420> can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to reverse that process so we can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.450 
to reverse that process so we can
actually<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.380> muscle<00:01:40.770> tissue<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.280> your

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
actually put more muscle tissue on your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.370 
actually put more muscle tissue on your
body<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.329> good<00:01:42.540> thing<00:01:42.570> about<00:01:42.780> muscle

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
body and the good thing about muscle

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.889 
body and the good thing about muscle
tissue<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.130> burns<00:01:44.369> calories<00:01:44.899> 24

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
tissue is that it burns calories 24

tissue is that it burns calories 24
hours<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> day<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:47.070> burns<00:01:47.460> calories<00:01:47.820> while

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
hours a day it burns calories while

to the calories you burn when you
exercise<00:01:57.590> which<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.770> practically<00:01:59.369> nothing

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
exercise which is practically nothing

job for two or three hours and all they

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.850 
job for two or three hours and all they
would<00:02:05.009> lose<00:02:05.810> calorie-wise<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
would lose calorie-wise would be the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.010 
would lose calorie-wise would be the
of<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.399> bite<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.149> chocolate<00:02:09.509> bar<00:02:09.690> it's

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
of a bite of a chocolate bar it's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.110 
of a bite of a chocolate bar it's
nothing<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.039> want<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.370> lose<00:02:11.550> excess

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
nothing so if you want to lose excess

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.320 
nothing so if you want to lose excess
fat<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:15.320> but<00:02:16.320> excess<00:02:16.890> five<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:18.150> by

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
fat really but excess five just by

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330 
fat really but excess five just by
working<00:02:18.600> out<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.770> will<00:02:19.980> kill<00:02:20.160> yourself

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
working out you will kill yourself

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.910 
working out you will kill yourself
before<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.090> read<00:02:21.270> any<00:02:21.560> significant<00:02:22.560> result

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
before you read any significant result

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.760 
before you read any significant result
so<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.520> key<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.090> lean<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.960> be<00:02:25.110> slim<00:02:25.440> is

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
so the key to lean this to be slim is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.520 
so the key to lean this to be slim is
actually<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.150> put<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.600> muscle<00:02:28.020> tissue<00:02:28.260> on

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
actually to put more muscle tissue on

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.310 
actually to put more muscle tissue on
your<00:02:28.680> body<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.130> then<00:02:29.820> cut<00:02:30.150> down<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.750> your

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
your body and then cut down on your

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.230 
your body and then cut down on your
reading<00:02:31.530> maybe<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:32.160> eat<00:02:32.400> whatever<00:02:32.820> you'll

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
reading maybe just eat whatever you'll

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.570 
reading maybe just eat whatever you'll
be<00:02:33.390> needing<00:02:33.750> until<00:02:34.080> now<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.800> cut<00:02:35.190> everything

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
be needing until now but cut everything

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.730 
be needing until now but cut everything
down<00:02:35.790> by<00:02:36.300> ten<00:02:36.600> percent<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.440> will<00:02:37.590> see

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
down by ten percent you will see

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.180 
down by ten percent you will see
significant<00:02:38.580> results<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.600> short<00:02:39.900> time<00:02:40.830> a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
significant results in a short time a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.090 
significant results in a short time a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
short period of time also we have

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.310 
short period of time also we have
members<00:02:44.340> coming<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.940> us<00:02:45.060> after<00:02:45.480> working<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:45.989> a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
few months some men for example coming

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.110 
few months some men for example coming
and<00:02:48.750> telling<00:02:48.900> us<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.410> it's<00:02:49.980> funny<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.910> now

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
and telling us that it's funny I can now

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.080 
and telling us that it's funny I can now
tighten<00:02:51.930> my<00:02:52.230> belt<00:02:52.260> one<00:02:52.980> or<00:02:53.130> two<00:02:53.280> nurses<00:02:53.730> more

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
tighten my belt one or two nurses more

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.840 
tighten my belt one or two nurses more
but<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> weigh<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> same<00:02:55.650> what<00:02:56.280> has<00:02:56.520> happened

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
but I weigh the same what has happened

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.870 
but I weigh the same what has happened
and<00:02:57.180> we<00:02:57.930> explained<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.410> them<00:02:58.560> probably<00:02:59.160> you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
and we explained to them probably you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.410 
and we explained to them probably you
have<00:03:00.090> lost<00:03:00.420> two<00:03:00.959> kilos<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.890> fat<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.300> have

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
have lost two kilos of fat and you have

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.330 
have lost two kilos of fat and you have
gained<00:03:03.690> two<00:03:03.900> kilos<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.290> muscles<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.010> weigh

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
gained two kilos of muscles so you weigh

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.100 
gained two kilos of muscles so you weigh
the<00:03:05.520> same<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.450> you're<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.690> different<00:03:06.900> person

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the same but you're a different person

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.760 
the same but you're a different person
because<00:03:07.830> fat<00:03:08.640> two<00:03:09.360> kilos<00:03:09.720> affair<00:03:10.050> takes<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.560> so

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
because fat two kilos affair takes up so

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.270 
because fat two kilos affair takes up so
much<00:03:10.800> more<00:03:11.130> space<00:03:11.400> than<00:03:11.850> two<00:03:12.209> kilos<00:03:12.660> of

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
much more space than two kilos of

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.400 
much more space than two kilos of
licenses<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.269> it's<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.660> matter<00:03:16.049> of

licenses you so it's not the matter of
how<00:03:16.860> much<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.250> weigh<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:18.209> distribution

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
how much you weigh is the distribution

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.020 
how much you weigh is the distribution
