thing I'm less excited about
a little<00:02:14.100> bit<00:02:14.190> worried<00:02:14.550> about<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.970> well<00:02:15.210> is

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240

a little bit worried about as well is
well<00:02:16.020> II<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.530> cute<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.010> murder<00:02:17.340> robot

well II that cute little murder robot

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.550 
well II that cute little murder robot
with<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> grenade<00:02:18.210> launcher<00:02:18.750> attached<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.380> I

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
with a grenade launcher attached to it I

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.140 
with a grenade launcher attached to it I
can<00:02:20.010> already<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.520> see<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.880> amount<00:02:21.090> of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
can already just see the amount of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.910 
can already just see the amount of
screen<00:02:21.480> shake<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.990> suppression<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.680> little

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
screen shake and suppression that little

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.560 
screen shake and suppression that little
thing<00:02:23.070> will<00:02:23.250> cause<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.270> would<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.480> been

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
thing will cause and it would have been

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.210 
thing will cause and it would have been
just<00:02:24.630> fine<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.170> me<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.320> only<00:02:25.470> had<00:02:25.740> machine<00:02:26.190> guns

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
just fine to me it only had machine guns

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.550 
just fine to me it only had machine guns
but<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.850> grenade<00:02:27.120> launcher<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.570> don't<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.290> it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
but the grenade launcher I don't know it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.080 
but the grenade launcher I don't know it
seems<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.950> bit<00:02:29.100> overkill<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.550> me<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.910> don't

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
seems like a bit overkill to me I don't

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.820 
seems like a bit overkill to me I don't
know<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.450> my<00:02:30.570> opinion<00:02:31.050> what<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> will

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
know it's just my opinion what I will

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.320 
know it's just my opinion what I will
say<00:02:31.860> though<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.790> does<00:02:32.970> look<00:02:33.180> like

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
say though is that it does look like

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.820 
say though is that it does look like
it's<00:02:33.540> gonna<00:02:33.630> be<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> fun<00:02:34.050> little<00:02:34.170> gadget<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.710> use

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
it's gonna be a fun little gadget to use

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.590 
it's gonna be a fun little gadget to use
I<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.160> already<00:02:35.280> see<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.820> being<00:02:36.030> really<00:02:36.450> useful

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
I can already see it being really useful

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.690 
I can already see it being really useful
as<00:02:36.930> well<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.320> maps<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.710> operation<00:02:38.280> metro

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
as well and maps like operation metro

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.370 
as well and maps like operation metro
and<00:02:38.880> Locker<00:02:39.600> where<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.140> all<00:02:40.170> these

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
and Locker where you have all these

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.530 
and Locker where you have all these
chokepoints<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:41.310> corridors<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.420> would

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
chokepoints and corridors and it would

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.150 
chokepoints and corridors and it would
be<00:02:42.690> really<00:02:42.870> effective<00:02:43.260> at<00:02:43.530> clearing<00:02:43.860> at<00:02:43.950> those

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
be really effective at clearing at those

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.040 
be really effective at clearing at those
enemies<00:02:44.520> before<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.090> poke<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.480> your<00:02:45.510> face<00:02:45.840> in

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
enemies before you poke out your face in

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.870 
enemies before you poke out your face in
the<00:02:46.140> corridors<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.130> then<00:02:47.340> again<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:47.850> could

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
the corridors but then again it could

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.790 
the corridors but then again it could
also<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.450> add<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> clusterfuck<00:02:49.410> that

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
also just add to the clusterfuck that

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.470 
also just add to the clusterfuck that
often<00:02:50.070> occurs<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.580> these<00:02:50.730> chokepoints<00:02:51.000> we'll

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
often occurs at these chokepoints we'll

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.450 
often occurs at these chokepoints we'll
just<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.960> wait<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.590> see<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.070> just<00:02:53.310> see

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
just have to wait and see and just see

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.130 
just have to wait and see and just see
how<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.610> all<00:02:53.760> plays<00:02:53.820> out<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.510> that's<00:02:54.930> about

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
how it all plays out and that's about

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.200 
how it all plays out and that's about
all<00:02:55.290> you'll<00:02:55.740> hear<00:02:55.950> for<00:02:56.160> me<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.610> BLC<00:02:57.000> for

now not exactly the biggest fan of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.490 
now not exactly the biggest fan of
speculation<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.060> honest<00:03:00.540> I'm<00:03:01.200> quite

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
speculation and to be honest I'm quite

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.980 
speculation and to be honest I'm quite
bad<00:03:01.800> at<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.340> well<00:03:02.580> now<00:03:03.210> let's<00:03:03.570> talk<00:03:03.780> about

something that I'm not really supposed
to<00:03:06.300> talk<00:03:06.420> about<00:03:06.780> but<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:07.170> gonna<00:03:07.290> talk<00:03:07.500> about

all-new<00:03:11.970> community<00:03:12.810> test<00:03:13.140> environment<00:03:13.350> it's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
all-new community test environment it's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.070 
all-new community test environment it's
like<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> new<00:03:14.520> battlefield<00:03:15.120> beta<00:03:15.390> except<00:03:15.960> no
