the flat cork cord now let's start by

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.529 
the flat cork cord now let's start by
doing<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.530> rubber<00:00:24.920> cord<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:25.940> is<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.150> magnetic

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
doing the rubber cord this is a magnetic

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.870 
doing the rubber cord this is a magnetic
clasp<00:00:27.050> now<00:00:27.830> I'd<00:00:27.980> like<00:00:28.100> to<00:00:28.160> show<00:00:28.430> you<00:00:28.460> that<00:00:28.699> this

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
clasp now I'd like to show you that this

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.540 
clasp now I'd like to show you that this
clasp<00:00:29.330> is<00:00:29.690> very<00:00:30.020> strong<00:00:30.440> so<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:31.130> should<00:00:31.369> just

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
clasp is very strong so it should just

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.000 
clasp is very strong so it should just
click<00:00:31.850> right<00:00:32.270> into<00:00:32.449> place<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.530> when<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:33.829> are

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
click right into place so when you are

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.010 
click right into place so when you are
doing<00:00:34.219> your<00:00:34.460> glue<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.969> is<00:00:35.210> best<00:00:35.449> to<00:00:35.600> separate

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
doing your glue it is best to separate

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.930 
doing your glue it is best to separate
them<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:36.829> you<00:00:36.890> don't<00:00:37.070> bend<00:00:37.340> your<00:00:37.489> cork<00:00:37.760> out<00:00:37.879> of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
them so you don't bend your cork out of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.020 
them so you don't bend your cork out of
the<00:00:38.120> glue<00:00:39.249> so<00:00:40.249> what<00:00:40.370> you're<00:00:40.489> going<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.640> do<00:00:40.850> is

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
the glue so what you're going to do is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.549 
the glue so what you're going to do is
you're<00:00:41.120> going<00:00:41.210> to<00:00:41.269> take<00:00:41.510> your<00:00:41.690> glue<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.379> it

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
you're going to take your glue and it

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.349 
you're going to take your glue and it
just<00:00:42.739> screws<00:00:43.670> right<00:00:43.760> off<00:00:44.030> there<00:00:44.239> for<00:00:44.449> you<00:00:44.569> and

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
just screws right off there for you and

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.700 
just screws right off there for you and
just<00:00:47.359> place<00:00:47.659> a<00:00:47.899> small<00:00:48.319> dab<00:00:48.850> inside<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.559> as<00:00:51.559> you

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
just place a small dab inside and as you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.700 
just place a small dab inside and as you
can<00:00:51.859> see<00:00:52.159> it<00:00:52.460> has<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.969> really<00:00:53.420> low<00:00:53.629> viscosity<00:00:53.899> so

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
can see it has a really low viscosity so

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.289 
can see it has a really low viscosity so
you<00:00:54.829> can<00:00:54.979> kind<00:00:55.219> of<00:00:55.339> tip<00:00:55.549> it<00:00:55.699> around<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:56.179> little

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
you can kind of tip it around a little

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.479 
you can kind of tip it around a little
bit<00:00:56.799> get<00:00:57.799> your<00:00:57.949> glue<00:00:58.159> coated<00:00:58.549> on<00:00:58.670> all<00:00:58.940> sides

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
bit get your glue coated on all sides

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.390 
bit get your glue coated on all sides
and<00:01:01.870> then<00:01:02.870> what<00:01:02.989> you're<00:01:03.109> gonna<00:01:03.199> do<00:01:03.499> is<00:01:04.220> you're

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
and then what you're gonna do is you're

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.719 
and then what you're gonna do is you're
just<00:01:04.519> going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.790> place<00:01:05.200> your<00:01:06.200> cord<00:01:06.549> right<00:01:07.549> in

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
just going to place your cord right in

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.960 
just going to place your cord right in
there<00:01:08.140> and<00:01:09.140> just<00:01:09.350> hold<00:01:09.620> it<00:01:09.740> for<00:01:09.790> maybe<00:01:10.790> a

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
there and just hold it for maybe a

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.660 
there and just hold it for maybe a
minute<00:01:11.240> or<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:12.290> has<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.740> pretty<00:01:12.980> good<00:01:13.340> seal

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
minute or so it has a pretty good seal

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.900 
minute or so it has a pretty good seal
right<00:01:13.970> away<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.890> then<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:15.920> can<00:01:16.190> simply<00:01:16.610> move

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
right away and then you can simply move

to the other side of your cord and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.450 
to the other side of your cord and
repeat<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.880> same<00:01:20.090> process<00:01:20.300> with<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:21.080> piece
