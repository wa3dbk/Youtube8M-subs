sometimes<00:00:45.820> are<00:00:45.910> just<00:00:46.060> born<00:00:46.240> this<00:00:46.360> area's<00:00:46.660> for

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
sometimes are just born this area's for

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.450

coins<00:00:47.020> basically<00:00:47.650> that<00:00:48.040> one<00:00:48.190> there's<00:00:48.340> the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
coins basically that one there's the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.700 
coins basically that one there's the
first<00:00:48.610> one<00:00:48.790> go<00:00:49.000> down<00:00:49.240> and<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.810> just<00:00:49.990> as<00:00:50.680> a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
first one go down and it just as a

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.960 
first one go down and it just as a
seeing<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:51.160> just<00:00:51.340> literally<00:00:51.550> call<00:00:51.790> there

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
seeing you just literally call there

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.640 
seeing you just literally call there
collect<00:00:52.270> coins<00:00:52.480> then<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.900> walks<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.470> back

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
collect coins then it walks you back

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.440 
collect coins then it walks you back
into<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.920> level<00:00:54.070> so<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.000> only<00:00:55.120> reason<00:00:55.270> I'm

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
into the level so the only reason I'm

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.940 
into the level so the only reason I'm
not<00:00:55.480> showing<00:00:55.810> a<00:00:55.960> door<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.410> quite<00:00:56.680> simply

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
not showing a door is quite simply

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.770 
not showing a door is quite simply
because<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.280> also<00:00:57.460> skips<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.150> lot<00:00:58.330> of<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.510> level

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
because it also skips a lot of the level

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.840 
because it also skips a lot of the level
and<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.530> don't<00:00:59.800> want<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.100> do<00:01:00.220> much<00:01:00.430> because<00:01:00.670> I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
and I don't want to do much because I

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.830 
and I don't want to do much because I
want<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.180> able<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.360> show<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.690> fire

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
want to be able to show you the fire

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
want to be able to show you the fire
floor<00:01:02.050> which<00:01:02.290> I've<00:01:02.440> got<00:01:02.590> here

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
floor which I've got here

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.789 
floor which I've got here
so<00:01:03.640> as<00:01:03.970> fire<00:01:04.329> Mario<00:01:04.689> it's<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.229> most<00:01:05.379> powerful

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
so as fire Mario it's the most powerful

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.109 
so as fire Mario it's the most powerful
you<00:01:05.829> can<00:01:05.979> get<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:06.340> can't<00:01:06.579> get<00:01:06.700> anything<00:01:06.909> else

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
you can get you can't get anything else

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.700 
you can get you can't get anything else
you<00:01:07.240> can't<00:01:07.480> go<00:01:07.690> under<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.960> fears<00:01:08.260> after<00:01:08.380> that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
you can't go under the fears after that

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.010 
you can't go under the fears after that
and<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.520> whole<00:01:09.670> point<00:01:09.820> is<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.060> can<00:01:10.360> just<00:01:10.570> hit

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
and the whole point is you can just hit

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.870 
and the whole point is you can just hit
the<00:01:11.080> one<00:01:11.320> button<00:01:11.650> which<00:01:11.830> is<00:01:11.890> also<00:01:12.130> your<00:01:12.400> unborn

the boss of every world leads it to like
I<00:01:25.510> think<00:01:25.630> 10<00:01:26.140> hits

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
I think 10 hits

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.820 
I think 10 hits
well<00:01:28.660> we<00:01:28.810> Randall<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.320> law<00:01:29.440> is<00:01:29.620> basically

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
well we Randall of the law is basically

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.500 
well we Randall of the law is basically
here<00:01:30.160> you've<00:01:30.460> earned<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.030> have<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.270> jump

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
here you've earned and you have to jump

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.240 
here you've earned and you have to jump
onto<00:01:31.810> this<00:01:31.990> flagpole<00:01:32.320> here<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:33.010> then<00:01:33.160> that's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
onto this flagpole here and then that's

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.890 
onto this flagpole here and then that's
the<00:01:33.400> end<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.640> level<00:01:33.790> unless<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.720> want

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
the end of a level unless you want

the end of a level unless you want
buzzers<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.530> then<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.250> basically<00:01:36.430> beat

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
buzzers and then you basically beat

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.320 
buzzers and then you basically beat
Bowser<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.400> manage<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.850> land<00:01:40.120> on<00:01:40.300> that

Bowser if you manage to land on that

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.240 
Bowser if you manage to land on that
flagpole<00:01:40.660> on<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.080> certain<00:01:41.470> number<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.010> like

flagpole on a certain number of the like

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.950 
flagpole on a certain number of the like
the<00:01:42.460> last<00:01:42.670> bit<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.120> timer<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:43.840> will

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
the last bit of the timer then you will

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.450 
the last bit of the timer then you will
actually<00:01:44.110> get<00:01:44.350> fireworks<00:01:44.830> which<00:01:45.130> aren't

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
actually get fireworks which aren't

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.950 
actually get fireworks which aren't
important<00:01:45.910> or<00:01:45.970> anything<00:01:46.150> they're<00:01:46.420> just<00:01:46.600> like

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
important or anything they're just like

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.540 
important or anything they're just like
a<00:01:47.140> little<00:01:47.290> extra<00:01:47.650> animation<00:01:48.190> that<00:01:48.340> give<00:01:48.460> you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
a little extra animation that give you

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.500 
a little extra animation that give you
points<00:01:48.910> so<00:01:49.120> that's<00:01:49.180> pretty<00:01:49.420> cool<00:01:51.510> gameplay

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
points so that's pretty cool gameplay

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.240 
points so that's pretty cool gameplay
pretty<00:01:52.840> much<00:01:52.960> there's<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.410> CM<00:01:53.680> sometimes<00:01:54.130> you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
pretty much there's the CM sometimes you

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.980 
pretty much there's the CM sometimes you
get<00:01:54.370> swimming<00:01:54.760> sections<00:01:55.270> where<00:01:55.540> even<00:01:55.870> then

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
get swimming sections where even then

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.270 
get swimming sections where even then
it's<00:01:56.140> pretty<00:01:56.410> much<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.710> same<00:01:56.740> you'll<00:01:57.100> just

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
it's pretty much the same you'll just

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.630 
it's pretty much the same you'll just
swim<00:01:57.490> left<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.820> right<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.060> go<00:01:58.180> at<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.300> end

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
swim left to right and go at the end

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.190 
swim left to right and go at the end
there's<00:02:00.640> also<00:02:00.760> like<00:02:01.090> severe<00:02:01.570> one<00:02:02.080> of

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
there's also like severe one of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.900 
there's also like severe one of
mushrooms<00:02:02.650> which<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.130> haven't<00:02:03.400> mentioned<00:02:03.580> yet

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
mushrooms which I haven't mentioned yet

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.940 
mushrooms which I haven't mentioned yet
it's<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.750> only<00:02:04.869> we<00:02:05.080> don't<00:02:05.290> do<00:02:05.440> anything<00:02:05.650> power

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
it's the only we don't do anything power

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.830 
it's the only we don't do anything power
wise<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.369> just<00:02:06.550> give<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.729> an<00:02:06.880> extra<00:02:07.060> life<00:02:07.300> you

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
wise to just give you an extra life you

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.449 
wise to just give you an extra life you
can<00:02:07.990> also<00:02:08.140> get<00:02:08.350> extra<00:02:08.500> lives<00:02:08.679> by<00:02:09.070> collecting

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
can also get extra lives by collecting

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.580 
can also get extra lives by collecting
100<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:09.970> coins<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.350> first

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
100 of the coins this is the first

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.080 
100 of the coins this is the first
invincibility<00:02:12.070> though<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.730> show<00:02:12.940> you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
invincibility though that can show you

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.520 
invincibility though that can show you
and<00:02:13.300> basically<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:13.870> allows<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.380> just

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and basically this allows you to just

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.320 
and basically this allows you to just
run<00:02:14.740> into<00:02:15.010> any<00:02:15.190> enemy<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.730> kill<00:02:15.910> them<00:02:16.150> one

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
run into any enemy and kill them one

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
run into any enemy and kill them one
which<00:02:16.570> is<00:02:16.720> pretty<00:02:16.930> cool

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
which is pretty cool

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.770 
which is pretty cool
you<00:02:18.340> don't<00:02:18.520> have<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.730> worry<00:02:18.970> about<00:02:19.090> jumping<00:02:19.690> on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you don't have to worry about jumping on

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.360 
you don't have to worry about jumping on
the<00:02:19.870> metonic<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.410> will<00:02:20.590> fire<00:02:20.770> flowers<00:02:21.190> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the metonic it will fire flowers you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.620 
the metonic it will fire flowers you
just<00:02:21.580> run<00:02:21.850> into<00:02:22.030> them<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.270> jump

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
just run into them and jump

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.710 
just run into them and jump
well<00:02:23.110> sorry<00:02:23.560> run<00:02:23.770> into<00:02:23.980> them<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.630> that's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
well sorry run into them so that's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.350 
well sorry run into them so that's
happening<00:02:26.140> there's<00:02:26.980> also<00:02:27.130> because<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.180> it

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
happening there's also because it's it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.850 
happening there's also because it's it
worlds<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.900> four<00:02:29.050> levels<00:02:29.290> on<00:02:29.380> each<00:02:29.470> world

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
worlds and four levels on each world

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.100 
worlds and four levels on each world
there's<00:02:30.100> also<00:02:30.250> warp<00:02:30.910> pipes<00:02:31.390> which<00:02:31.720> basically

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
there's also warp pipes which basically

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.170 
there's also warp pipes which basically
are<00:02:32.410> pipes<00:02:32.650> like<00:02:32.890> these<00:02:33.070> here<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.150> I

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
are pipes like these here just that I

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.090 
are pipes like these here just that I
mean<00:02:34.300> now<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.019> huapi<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.470> certain<00:02:35.769> worlds

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
mean now and the huapi to certain worlds

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.250 
mean now and the huapi to certain worlds
so<00:02:36.280> like<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.580> one<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.970> world<00:02:37.510> two<00:02:37.810> three

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so like this one for a world two three

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.880 
so like this one for a world two three
four<00:02:38.680> except<00:02:39.130> man<00:02:39.280> likes<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.709> all<00:02:41.709> there

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
four except man likes and all there

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.500 
four except man likes and all there
basically<00:02:42.160> go<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.519> like<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.820> light<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.239> skipped

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
basically go is like a light is skipped

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.940 
basically go is like a light is skipped
forward<00:02:43.720> for<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.080> world's<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.709> can

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
forward for the world's so you can

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.380 
forward for the world's so you can
actually<00:02:45.220> beat<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.519> game<00:02:45.700> without<00:02:45.910> beating

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
actually beat the game without beating

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.960 
actually beat the game without beating
every<00:02:46.720> single<00:02:47.019> level<00:02:47.140> but<00:02:48.070> I'm<00:02:48.580> not<00:02:48.790> showing

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
you them because it's the hidden areas

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.740 
you them because it's the hidden areas

but there's moving platforms that can
really<00:03:23.170> be<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.440> peon<00:03:23.860> later<00:03:24.160> on<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.700> there's<00:03:25.660> a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
really be a peon later on and there's a

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.500 
really be a peon later on and there's a
oh<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:27.430> got<00:03:27.520> there's<00:03:27.819> also<00:03:27.940> platforms

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.540 
oh now we got there's also platforms
that<00:03:28.569> actually<00:03:28.930> sink<00:03:29.230> down<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.770> actually<00:03:30.310> if

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
that actually sink down and actually if

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.949 
that actually sink down and actually if
you<00:03:30.580> stand<00:03:31.060> alone<00:03:31.180> for<00:03:31.330> too<00:03:31.420> long<00:03:31.630> then<00:03:31.840> you'll

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
you stand alone for too long then you'll

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.350 
you stand alone for too long then you'll
fall<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.230> your<00:03:32.319> death<00:03:33.120> getting<00:03:34.120> hits

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
fall to your death getting hits

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.820 
fall to your death getting hits
basically<00:03:35.020> when<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.260> get<00:03:35.380> hit<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.709> go

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
basically when you get hit you go

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.590 
basically when you get hit you go
straight<00:03:36.100> back<00:03:36.370> down<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.670> small<00:03:36.910> Marriott<00:03:37.300> so

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
straight back down to small Marriott so

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.390 
straight back down to small Marriott so
like<00:03:37.780> if<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.410> walk<00:03:38.620> into<00:03:38.830> an<00:03:38.980> enemy<00:03:39.220> and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
like if you walk into an enemy and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.740 
like if you walk into an enemy and
you're<00:03:39.520> not<00:03:39.610> invincible<00:03:39.880> or<00:03:40.240> if<00:03:40.330> you<00:03:40.420> jump<00:03:40.630> on

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
you're not invincible or if you jump on

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.000 
you're not invincible or if you jump on
one<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.020> piranha<00:03:41.350> plants<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.800> likes

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
one of the piranha plants and the likes

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.140 
one of the piranha plants and the likes
or<00:03:42.310> something<00:03:42.640> like<00:03:42.760> that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
or something like that

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.910 
or something like that
someone<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.780> can't<00:03:44.020> be<00:03:44.080> killed<00:03:44.350> by<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.590> jump

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
someone that can't be killed by a jump

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.770 
someone that can't be killed by a jump
then<00:03:45.340> you'll<00:03:45.670> immediately<00:03:45.880> go<00:03:46.240> straight<00:03:46.630> back

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
then you'll immediately go straight back

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.440 
then you'll immediately go straight back
down<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:47.140> wall<00:03:47.350> Marriott<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:49.270> is<00:03:49.390> the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
down this wall Marriott this is the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.880 
down this wall Marriott this is the
Bowser's<00:03:49.750> Castle<00:03:49.810> or<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.410> personally<00:03:50.800> think

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
Bowser's Castle or I personally think

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.290 
Bowser's Castle or I personally think
this<00:03:51.040> is<00:03:51.190> probably<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.550> best<00:03:51.700> music<00:03:52.090> on<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
this is probably the best music on the

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.790 
this is probably the best music on the
game<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.810> tie<00:03:53.020> between<00:03:53.080> this<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.739> the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
game it's a tie between this and the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.930 
game it's a tie between this and the
tunnel<00:03:54.100> so<00:03:54.280> I'm<00:03:54.400> gonna<00:03:54.550> should<00:03:54.700> have<00:03:54.790> known

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
tunnel so I'm gonna should have known

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:09.790 
tunnel so I'm gonna should have known
like<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.239> no<00:03:55.390> little<00:03:55.660> bit<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.870> music

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.170 

as<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.070> see<00:04:11.280> now<00:04:11.490> this<00:04:11.700> fireball

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
as you can see now this fireball

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.580 
as you can see now this fireball
starting<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.630> go<00:04:12.720> across<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.110> screen<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
starting to go across the screen and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
starting to go across the screen and
that<00:04:13.680> basically<00:04:13.980> means<00:04:14.070> nothing<00:04:14.400> close<00:04:14.580> to

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
that basically means nothing close to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.700 
that basically means nothing close to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
mention is continuing on this there

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.830 
mention is continuing on this there
aren't<00:04:47.520> actually<00:04:47.820> any<00:04:47.850> continues<00:04:48.480> on<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.690> Kin

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
aren't actually any continues on the Kin

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.780 
aren't actually any continues on the Kin
but<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.170> can<00:04:49.350> actually<00:04:49.500> continue<00:04:50.070> on<00:04:50.460> from<00:04:50.670> a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
but you can actually continue on from a

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.150 
but you can actually continue on from a
game<00:04:50.970> basically<00:04:51.780> when<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:52.350> go<00:04:52.710> back<00:04:52.920> when<00:04:53.130> you

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
game basically when you go back when you

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.650 
game basically when you go back when you
die<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.610> lose<00:04:53.700> all<00:04:53.880> your<00:04:53.970> lives<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.390> all<00:04:54.480> that

die and lose all your lives and all that

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.790 
die and lose all your lives and all that

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
so then you go back to the starting

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.010 
so then you go back to the starting
screen<00:04:56.010> and<00:04:56.310> by<00:04:56.790> holding<00:04:57.060> down<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.420> to<00:04:57.690> button

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
and pushing the start button at the same

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.580

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
time as you holdin to then it actually

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.840

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
want so not the level so like see if you

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.310 
want so not the level so like see if you
for<00:05:05.370> instance<00:05:05.610> if<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:05.820> died<00:05:06.060> on<00:05:06.420> world<00:05:06.960> 3

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
for instance if you died on world 3

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.710 
for instance if you died on world 3
level<00:05:07.740> 4<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.430> died<00:05:08.640> killing<00:05:09.090> Bowser<00:05:09.270> well

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
level 4 you you died killing Bowser well

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.150 
level 4 you you died killing Bowser well
obviously<00:05:09.930> not<00:05:10.260> killing<00:05:10.590> miles<00:05:10.740> about<00:05:10.890> trying

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
obviously not killing miles about trying

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.770 
obviously not killing miles about trying
to<00:05:11.190> kill<00:05:11.340> Bowser<00:05:11.580> then<00:05:12.180> it<00:05:12.270> wouldn't<00:05:12.540> take<00:05:12.750> you

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
to kill Bowser then it wouldn't take you

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.390 
to kill Bowser then it wouldn't take you
straight<00:05:13.110> about<00:05:13.290> this<00:05:13.530> castle<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:14.130> would<00:05:14.250> just

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
straight about this castle it would just

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.680 
straight about this castle it would just
take<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.700> to<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.940> first<00:05:15.180> level<00:05:15.420> of<00:05:15.540> that

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
take you to the first level of that

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.930 
take you to the first level of that
world<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.620> even<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:17.100> it's<00:05:17.430> still<00:05:17.490> pretty

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
world but even so it's still pretty

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.430 
world but even so it's still pretty
useful<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.480> something<00:05:18.750> really<00:05:19.020> good<00:05:19.290> about

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
useful and something really good about

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.830 
useful and something really good about
the<00:05:19.590> game<00:05:19.740> because<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.790> don't<00:05:21.360> actually<00:05:21.510> know

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
the game because I don't actually know

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.420 
the game because I don't actually know
anyone<00:05:22.260> who's<00:05:22.470> managed<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.890> beat<00:05:23.040> this<00:05:23.190> game

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
anyone who's managed to beat this game

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.550 
anyone who's managed to beat this game
in<00:05:23.670> won't<00:05:24.030> continue<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.990> has<00:05:25.170> been<00:05:25.380> done

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
in won't continue it has been done

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.020 
in won't continue it has been done
because<00:05:25.740> I'm<00:05:25.980> pretty<00:05:26.130> sure<00:05:26.250> someone<00:05:26.760> holds

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
because I'm pretty sure someone holds

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.880 
because I'm pretty sure someone holds
the<00:05:27.120> world<00:05:27.300> record<00:05:27.450> for<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.960> but<00:05:28.200> it's<00:05:28.770> not

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
the world record for it but it's not

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.620 
the world record for it but it's not
something<00:05:29.220> that<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:29.490> earn<00:05:29.610> or<00:05:29.820> anyone<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.270> doing

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
something that I earn or anyone of doing

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.930 
something that I earn or anyone of doing
the<00:05:31.620> only<00:05:31.800> other<00:05:31.980> item<00:05:32.010> on<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.400> game<00:05:32.580> is<00:05:32.820> a

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
the only other item on the game is a

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.580 
the only other item on the game is a
spring<00:05:33.330> sale<00:05:33.600> which<00:05:33.840> obviously<00:05:34.110> they<00:05:34.380> just

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
spring sale which obviously they just

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.650 
spring sale which obviously they just
spring<00:05:34.980> you<00:05:35.130> up<00:05:35.250> on<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.430> likes<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.390> that's

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
spring you up on the likes so that's

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.980 
spring you up on the likes so that's
ugly

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
ugly

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.660 
ugly
graphically<00:05:37.830> as<00:05:37.920> you<00:05:38.010> can<00:05:38.100> see<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.370> it's

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
graphically as you can see it it's

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.160 
graphically as you can see it it's
pretty<00:05:38.880> much<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.210> first<00:05:39.330> nurse<00:05:39.660> game<00:05:39.840> ever

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
pretty much the first nurse game ever

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.640 
pretty much the first nurse game ever
saw

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
it's nothing to be special but at the

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.550 
it's nothing to be special but at the
same<00:05:42.390> time<00:05:42.660> it<00:05:42.810> holds<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.080> nice<00:05:43.230> and<00:05:43.410> rent

I<00:05:51.480> don't<00:05:51.960> score<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.380> games<00:05:52.590> because<00:05:53.040> that's

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
I don't score the games because that's

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.250 
I don't score the games because that's
based<00:05:53.490> purely<00:05:53.760> on<00:05:53.910> opinion<00:05:54.390> so<00:05:54.660> instead<00:05:54.990> I'll

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
based purely on opinion so instead I'll
