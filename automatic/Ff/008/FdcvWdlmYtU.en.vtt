00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.850 
those things so it's a level playing
field<00:04:25.849> for<00:04:25.940> me<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.599> I<00:04:26.870> kind<00:04:27.169> of<00:04:27.200> sent<00:04:27.440> people

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
field for me and I kind of sent people

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.390 
field for me and I kind of sent people
you<00:04:28.279> know<00:04:28.400> if<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.789> walk

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
you know if you can walk

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.129 
you know if you can walk
maybe<00:04:29.760> this<00:04:30.120> thing<00:04:30.300> measures<00:04:30.630> how<00:04:30.750> many<00:04:30.810> steps

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
maybe this thing measures how many steps

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.260 
maybe this thing measures how many steps
you<00:04:31.290> do<00:04:31.440> maybe<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.040> could<00:04:32.370> walk<00:04:32.820> say<00:04:33.120> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
you do maybe you could walk say a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.930 
you do maybe you could walk say a
thousand<00:04:33.930> step<00:04:34.139> today<00:04:34.290> mm<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.550> see<00:04:35.790> that

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
thousand step today mm and see that

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.340 
thousand step today mm and see that
you've<00:04:36.060> done<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.330> then<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:36.870> feel<00:04:37.080> better

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
you've done that then you feel better

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.900 
you've done that then you feel better
about<00:04:37.590> yourself<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.370> that's<00:04:38.490> kind<00:04:38.729> of<00:04:38.760> how<00:04:38.880> I

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
about yourself so that's kind of how I

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.540 
about yourself so that's kind of how I
maybe<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.330> guys<00:04:39.479> come<00:04:39.810> back<00:04:40.320> come<00:04:41.070> back<00:04:41.100> and

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
maybe you guys come back come back and

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.189 
maybe you guys come back come back and
we<00:04:41.729> can<00:04:41.850> take<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.419> through<00:04:42.449> this<00:04:42.690> and<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:43.020> can

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
we can take you through this and you can

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.810 
we can take you through this and you can
come<00:04:43.380> back<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.620> course<00:04:43.860> perhaps<00:04:44.100> there<00:04:44.430> is

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
come back of course perhaps there is

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.189 
come back of course perhaps there is
something<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.120> have<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.449> want<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.840> do<00:04:46.050> it

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
countless people who've walked in

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.210 
countless people who've walked in

through those studio doors who've been
part<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.810> loads<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:52.199> no<00:04:52.620> we<00:04:52.949> want<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.220> lose

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.120 
weight together we want to do we're
running<00:04:54.780> another<00:04:54.960> one<00:04:55.139> at<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.350> moment<00:04:55.500> is

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
running another one at the moment is

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.530
