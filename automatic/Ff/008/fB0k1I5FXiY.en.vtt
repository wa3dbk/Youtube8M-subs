00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 this is the new cg 150 titan practically 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.420
 all renewed in its ninth generation 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.929
 the main highlight is the new engine 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 162 cc seven points and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.180
 every change of look we can highlight 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.029
 at first by the new fairing 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.090
 now composed of three parts 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.320
 the sides being painted a new 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 panel that now has account-turns 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.780
 here in the tank part a new tank 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.360
 with a filling nozzle of the type 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 one -piece sporting 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.640
 I need more time to hold the mouthpiece in the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.410
 hand 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.090
 just open this one piece here for 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.579
 power supply 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 these reflectors or 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.320
 tank fairing that has a drawing 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 surrounding the tank with dimensions 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.879
 larger and more sporty look 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.920
 mainly due to these exits 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.660
 of air here in front 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.780
 following the harmony of the set we have 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.690
 new side covers that accompany 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.299
 also a new tail now with straps 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.939
 of the aluminum croup and are of the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.490
 for easy maintenance 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.680
 until the installation of accessories also 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 we can highlight this part of the bottom that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.159
 usually we call it with a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.369
 mechanical part that transmits force to the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 set a new and more robust engine 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.640
 this new engine is one hundred and sixty 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.640
 cc it is 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 completely suited to the 4 phase promot 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.640
 2 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.650
 is a rule of law for the issue 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.590
 of polluting gases that will be more 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 strict from January 2016 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 that is to say from January of the year 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.299
 come into force 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 and this model already fully complies 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.829
 this standard both with a new catalyst 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 and taking advantage of what I'm talking about 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.700
 new catalytic converter motor for 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.829
 to harmonize the sporting 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.850
 together a new 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.030
 exhaust 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.060
 it has an output at an angle of 7 degrees 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.579
 more inclined to horizontal 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.490
 in relation to the previous model also 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.680
 we can give enough highlights to the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.310
 Exclusive design of alloy wheels 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.440
 so titan 160 in single version it comes 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.420
 only with alloy wheels with 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.830
 exclusive design are wheels that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.930
 harmonize the design 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.210
 of the set the items that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.360
 remain a prominent system of 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.680
 Electronic injection is flex can be 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 fueled with ethanol or gasoline 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.010
 either of them mixes the one that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.250
 the consumer understands and an exclusive 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.750
 brake system combined or cbs 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.390
 the first to be used in a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.910
 motorcycle is a system that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.340
 combines braking when I use the pedal 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.980
 it brakes rear wheel and distributes this 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.410
 Braking also for the front wheel is 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.910
 a system that brings a lot of security is 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.690
 this input model 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.810
 This is the new cg 150 titan 2016 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.860
 now in its ninth generation with almost 40 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.860
 years of history in brazil
