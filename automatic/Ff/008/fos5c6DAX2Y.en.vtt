00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.840
 well, salsa, we're still here 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 this conscious kitchen and today we are going to a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.550
 recipe from my first book to check 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.200
 do not lose anything that banana bread that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.510
 so many times they did today we are going to 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.710
 make a different version because 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.200
 because we're going to change a couple of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.239
 ingredients but already we already put ourselves to 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.850
 cooking we have first first tooth 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:36.239
 maybe weird for some whole grain sugar 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.820
 guy more out is not that brand anymore 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.090
 cause of the process is best for the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.199
 health does not fatigue us a bit of the stomach 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.989
 nor the organism why always 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.679
 I recommend whole grain type plus cape 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.859
 second and not so crazy wheat flour 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.809
 organic integral I do not do anything 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.570
 refined nothing white my favorite color 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.100
 from now more is the persimmon we have also 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.190
 baking powder after story 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 because and I have these pears the pears 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.880
 organic ripe so rich the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.050
 we have to cut 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.390
 there is a very small cut 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.640
 as small as I can and if they can not 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.650
 so small a cut because this more 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.600
 great here tranqui I did not really want 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.960
 of working I did this good outings 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.700
 marine sea salt enriched with seaweed 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.490
 and although this is sweet, so 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.980
 we use sea salt let's leave the salt 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.040
 refined table and we had a salt 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.710
 marina that is a lot better raisins than 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.110
 grape the other in eggs eggs 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.290
 organic eggs of happy hens not 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.620
 those industrialized eggs and a good 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.150
 olive oil 230 out there said the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.640
 recipe but do not worry about after 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.920
 we will be going to give full recipe 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.920
 vanilla essence vanilla extract 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.110
 natural that is always natural the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.470
 vanilla extract and I think I do not 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.330
 I forget more nothing we are going to process 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.330
 I put all the liquids first 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.570
 ready I have all the ingredients in the 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.170
 processor to see that I do not 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.100
 like to work a lot I put here and that 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.650
 be 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.830
 as Claudius says what that wants me 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.830
 give 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.970
 process I entered the process without work 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.000
 nothing clean hands of clean hands 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.000
 clean hands now we are going to put you 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.230
 our pears cut pears cut and 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.879
 I 'm staying with a little bit for the end 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.879
 we again process 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.300
 a little bit more always does not enter now what 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.700
 we will see 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.740
 all the flour 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.670
 raisins 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:24.120
 pinch of salt to enhance the flavors 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.120
 in the last process is coming to see 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.590
 I would say that we finished what would be the 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.590
 pear east bread 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.230

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.489
 we can a mold for pudding 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.489
 we throw the mixture 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.760
 and here we are taking advantage of all the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.870
 dough 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.239
 how hard our recipe is so hard 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.460
 up a little bit of pears so that 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.120
 we find them 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.280
 in this pear pudding bread we're going 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.220
 crush with the spoon 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.490
 little bit and now if I go to the oven 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.800
 moderate for 40 45 minutes when 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.560

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.820
 well we continue this orange cream 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.430
 we have here point organic soccer 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.680
 please always tell them when we go 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.790
 to consume a derivative of soy that 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.940
 be organic the dof that we always cut 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.940
 here 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.940
 squares 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.560
 I put 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.560
 everything in the glass 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.920
 vanilla essence my friend but 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.920

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.030
 Orange zest 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.750
 grater you have in your house 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.550
 but eye of the white part is not only 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.310

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.830
 organic thick always crushed with the 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:30.440
 theme of the organic little bit of water 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.630
 eye do not overdo it with water because this 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.430

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.310
 entry and exit this is the fundamental 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.680
 when we make these emulsions and in two 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.500
 seconds and we do not use any derivative 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.599
 of the cow then I do not go to the oven 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.870
