00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.820
 Thailand - March 2015 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.460
 I passed this plan. 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.600
 A long time to consider. 

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:31.294
 I want to present these fireflies 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.580
 I hope to use virtual light to affect their behavior, 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.960
 And the frequency at which they emit light. 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.434
 We have established a preliminary relationship with the researcher. 

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.474
 Especially in Thailand, 

00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:47.474
 Can see a large number 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 A firefly that consistently emits light. 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.640
 When you arrive in Bangkok, 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.740
 Anchana Thancharoen came over to meet us. 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.880
 She led us to a corner of the forest 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.160
 Let us be able 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.500
 I saw fireflies for the first time. 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.520
 We spent two weeks, 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.060
 First record the behavior of their common illuminating, 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.780
 Then start the experiment, 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.140
 Try to influence 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.960
 Synchronization of these fireflies. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.960
 Japan - April 2015 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.180
 We started in Tokyo, 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.120
 Launched a technical search activity, 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.620
 Go looking for measuring equipment, 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.700
 Scientific tools, 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.360
 Then bring them back to Basel. 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.600
 Then we went to Yokohama near Dr Ohba. 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.520
 Firefly Academy, visit him. 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.360
 Dr Ohba has helped me a lot, 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.120
 He gave me a lot about 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.280
 Breeding, 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.720
 Ship, present these creatures, 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.180
 And how to process their information. 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.560
 I am very happy with Audemars 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.500
 Give me this opportunity to present my work, 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.660
 Interested in what I did 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.300
 And see the close relationship between the two sides in practice. 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.140
 This will definitely be a unique experience.
