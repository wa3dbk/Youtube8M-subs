that's<00:05:00.580> what<00:05:00.729> this<00:05:00.849> is<00:05:00.909> this<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.419> all<00:05:01.569> about

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
that's what this is this is all about

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.189 
that's what this is this is all about
summarizing<00:05:02.229> but<00:05:03.159> I'm<00:05:03.539> not<00:05:04.539> too<00:05:04.780> bad<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.020> a

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
summarizing but I'm not too bad of a

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.379 
summarizing but I'm not too bad of a
robot<00:05:05.560> form<00:05:05.919> I<00:05:06.159> mean<00:05:06.220> he's<00:05:06.699> got<00:05:06.849> some<00:05:07.030> really

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
robot form I mean he's got some really

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.260 
robot form I mean he's got some really
nice<00:05:07.690> looking<00:05:08.430> you<00:05:09.430> know<00:05:09.520> chrome<00:05:09.880> going<00:05:10.180> on

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
nice looking you know chrome going on

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.640 
nice looking you know chrome going on
there<00:05:10.449> in<00:05:10.539> the<00:05:10.599> chest<00:05:10.900> piece

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
there in the chest piece

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.249 
there in the chest piece
he<00:05:11.830> got<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.009> nice<00:05:12.190> head<00:05:12.460> sculpt<00:05:12.840> he<00:05:13.840> does<00:05:14.020> have

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
he got a nice head sculpt he does have

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.649 
he got a nice head sculpt he does have
you<00:05:14.830> know<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:15.419> sufficient<00:05:16.419> amount<00:05:16.479> of

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
you know a sufficient amount of

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.210 
you know a sufficient amount of
articulation<00:05:17.349> I<00:05:17.409> mean<00:05:17.530> his<00:05:17.620> arms<00:05:17.889> can<00:05:18.190> rotate

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
articulation I mean his arms can rotate

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.360 
articulation I mean his arms can rotate
around<00:05:18.880> 360<00:05:19.720> degrees<00:05:20.220> unfortunately<00:05:21.220> is

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
around 360 degrees unfortunately is

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.939 
around 360 degrees unfortunately is
hindered<00:05:21.880> by<00:05:21.909> this<00:05:22.060> black<00:05:22.330> piece<00:05:22.990> so<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.800> have

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
hindered by this black piece so you have

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.499 
hindered by this black piece so you have
to<00:05:24.039> kind<00:05:24.220> of<00:05:24.250> move<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.490> out<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.639> the<00:05:24.729> way<00:05:24.880> you

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
to kind of move that out of the way you

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.040 
to kind of move that out of the way you
can't<00:05:25.750> go<00:05:25.870> in<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.110> out<00:05:26.550> have<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.669> shoulder

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
can't go in and out have the shoulder

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.620 
can't go in and out have the shoulder
head<00:05:29.050> can<00:05:29.320> move<00:05:29.530> side<00:05:30.009> to<00:05:30.039> side

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
head can move side to side

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.420 
head can move side to side
legs<00:05:31.630> really<00:05:32.139> don't<00:05:32.409> have<00:05:32.560> a<00:05:32.620> lot<00:05:32.830> of<00:05:32.889> movement

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
legs really don't have a lot of movement

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.399 
legs really don't have a lot of movement
except<00:05:33.880> for<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.570> know<00:05:34.599> you<00:05:34.780> can<00:05:34.930> rotate<00:05:35.080> out

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
except for you know you can rotate out

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.740 
except for you know you can rotate out
the<00:05:35.530> knee<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:36.639> can<00:05:36.669> go<00:05:37.030> in<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:37.360> out<00:05:37.419> at<00:05:37.719> the

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
the knee you can go in and out at the

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.930 
the knee you can go in and out at the
thigh<00:05:38.169> but<00:05:38.650> you<00:05:39.009> kinda<00:05:39.280> have<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.460> be<00:05:39.520> careful

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
thigh but you kinda have to be careful

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.159 
thigh but you kinda have to be careful
and<00:05:40.090> kind<00:05:40.330> of<00:05:40.389> hold<00:05:40.539> this<00:05:40.719> piece<00:05:40.960> together

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
and kind of hold this piece together

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.870 
and kind of hold this piece together
because<00:05:41.530> it<00:05:41.650> really<00:05:42.070> doesn't<00:05:42.280> lock<00:05:42.610> into

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
because it really doesn't lock into

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.700 
because it really doesn't lock into
place<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.419> that's<00:05:44.110> probably<00:05:44.440> my<00:05:44.680> biggest

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
place and that's probably my biggest

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.060 
place and that's probably my biggest
gripe<00:05:45.310> with<00:05:45.430> this<00:05:45.610> figure<00:05:45.909> as<00:05:46.560> far<00:05:47.560> as<00:05:47.680> being<00:05:47.949> a

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
gripe with this figure as far as being a

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.700 
gripe with this figure as far as being a
combiner<00:05:48.550> this<00:05:49.419> black<00:05:49.750> piece<00:05:50.020> really<00:05:50.289> doesn't

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
combiner this black piece really doesn't

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.450 
combiner this black piece really doesn't
like<00:05:50.919> latch<00:05:51.340> onto<00:05:51.699> anything<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.800> then<00:05:53.800> you

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
like latch onto anything and then you

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.740 
like latch onto anything and then you
know<00:05:54.550> this<00:05:54.759> piece<00:05:55.000> doesn't<00:05:55.240> latch<00:05:55.479> onto

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
know this piece doesn't latch onto

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.420 
know this piece doesn't latch onto
anything<00:05:56.020> or<00:05:56.440> plug<00:05:56.620> in<00:05:56.740> anything<00:05:57.009> this<00:05:57.669> pieces

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
anything or plug in anything this pieces

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.939 
anything or plug in anything this pieces
can<00:06:00.430> come<00:06:00.580> apart<00:06:00.669> fairly<00:06:01.210> easily<00:06:01.949> head

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
can come apart fairly easily head

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.140 
can come apart fairly easily head
doesn't<00:06:03.190> really<00:06:03.460> attached<00:06:03.789> to<00:06:04.000> anything

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
doesn't really attached to anything

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.270 
doesn't really attached to anything
either<00:06:04.419> so<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:04.840> kind<00:06:05.050> of<00:06:05.080> just<00:06:05.349> kind<00:06:06.190> of<00:06:06.219> just

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
either so it kind of just kind of just

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.120 
either so it kind of just kind of just
sits<00:06:06.580> there<00:06:07.349> wish<00:06:08.349> it<00:06:08.650> was<00:06:08.740> a<00:06:08.800> little<00:06:08.830> bit

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
sits there wish it was a little bit

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.749 
sits there wish it was a little bit
better<00:06:09.310> but<00:06:09.909> again<00:06:10.139> he<00:06:11.139> is<00:06:11.729> quote-unquote<00:06:12.729> a

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
better but again he is quote-unquote a

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.790 
better but again he is quote-unquote a
parts<00:06:13.180> former<00:06:13.630> he<00:06:13.810> will<00:06:14.020> combine<00:06:14.289> with<00:06:14.349> servo

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
parts former he will combine with servo

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.050 
parts former he will combine with servo
to<00:06:15.009> create<00:06:15.370> synchro<00:06:16.060> or<00:06:16.289> Thunder<00:06:17.289> Gryphon<00:06:17.620> so

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
to create synchro or Thunder Gryphon so

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.999 
to create synchro or Thunder Gryphon so
quick<00:06:19.060> comparisons<00:06:19.630> here<00:06:19.900> is<00:06:20.050> next<00:06:20.469> to<00:06:20.620> leader

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
quick comparisons here is next to leader

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.770 
quick comparisons here is next to leader

over<00:06:25.569> him<00:06:26.819> even<00:06:27.819> though<00:06:27.909> I<00:06:27.940> know<00:06:28.060> that<00:06:28.180> the<00:06:28.630> new

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
over him even though I know that the new

over him even though I know that the new
leader<00:06:29.319> class<00:06:29.560> figures<00:06:29.949> are<00:06:30.130> a<00:06:30.159> little<00:06:30.430> bit

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 
leader class figures are a little bit

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.089 
leader class figures are a little bit
smaller<00:06:30.940> but<00:06:31.330> still<00:06:31.569> he<00:06:31.960> is<00:06:31.990> quite<00:06:32.349> large<00:06:32.800> and

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
smaller but still he is quite large and

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:35.100 
smaller but still he is quite large and
here<00:06:33.610> is<00:06:33.699> next<00:06:34.029> to<00:06:34.089> King<00:06:34.270> Griezmann<00:06:34.599> or<00:06:34.750> form

Oh

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
Oh

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.660 
Oh
and<00:06:37.350> you<00:06:38.350> know<00:06:38.470> you<00:06:38.530> got<00:06:38.800> to<00:06:38.920> think<00:06:39.100> that<00:06:39.310> once

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
and you know you got to think that once

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.980 
and you know you got to think that once
he<00:06:39.820> combines<00:06:40.150> with<00:06:40.300> servo<00:06:40.660> you're<00:06:40.810> going<00:06:40.930> to

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
he combines with servo you're going to

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.950 
he combines with servo you're going to
get<00:06:41.140> a<00:06:41.170> lot<00:06:41.590> taller<00:06:42.190> of<00:06:42.730> a<00:06:42.850> figure<00:06:43.180> so<00:06:43.390> that

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
get a lot taller of a figure so that

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.420 
get a lot taller of a figure so that
will<00:06:44.110> be<00:06:44.200> my<00:06:44.380> next<00:06:44.440> review<00:06:44.740> guys<00:06:45.040> so<00:06:45.220> stay

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
will be my next review guys so stay

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.090 
will be my next review guys so stay
tuned<00:06:45.640> for<00:06:45.670> that<00:06:45.870> but<00:06:46.870> as<00:06:47.020> far<00:06:47.050> as<00:06:47.290> Zenon

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
tuned for that but as far as Zenon

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.230 
tuned for that but as far as Zenon

out<00:06:49.690> of<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.020> three<00:06:50.230> deluxe<00:06:50.740> sized<00:06:50.920> figures

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
out of the three deluxe sized figures

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.050 
out of the three deluxe sized figures
obviously<00:06:52.750> you<00:06:52.870> need<00:06:52.990> servo<00:06:53.440> and<00:06:54.220> so<00:06:54.850> he's

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
obviously you need servo and so he's

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.790 
obviously you need servo and so he's
probably<00:06:55.210> high<00:06:55.420> on<00:06:55.450> the<00:06:55.630> list<00:06:55.750> but<00:06:56.050> between

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
probably high on the list but between

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.590
