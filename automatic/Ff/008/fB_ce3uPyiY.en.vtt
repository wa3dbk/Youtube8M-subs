like<00:00:49.620> most<00:00:49.829> things<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.219> finance<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:50.879> no

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
like most things in finance there's no

like most things in finance there's no
definitive<00:00:51.390> answer<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> do

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
definitive answer so what you have to do

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.340 
definitive answer so what you have to do
is<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> determine<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.809> fits<00:00:55.140> your

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
is you have to determine what fits your

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
is you have to determine what fits your
situation<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.160> best<00:00:56.370> there<00:00:57.239> been<00:00:57.390> studies<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
situation the best there been studies in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
situation the best there been studies in
the<00:00:57.899> past<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.350> gone<00:00:58.559> over<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.039> would

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the past that have gone over which would

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.470 
the past that have gone over which would
have<00:00:59.280> done<00:00:59.430> better<00:00:59.579> most<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> time

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

years later in 1954 it closed it 383 so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.420 
years later in 1954 it closed it 383 so

point<00:01:40.530> seven<00:01:41.009> percent<00:01:41.430> return<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.509> the
