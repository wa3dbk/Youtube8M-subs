00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
so that's kind of interesting that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.809

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
the dungeons in pretty much any order

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.180 
the dungeons in pretty much any order
except<00:02:35.900> with<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.079> exclusion<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.769> some<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.099> the

last few dungeons links of the past was

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.800 
last few dungeons links of the past was
a<00:02:39.950> little<00:02:40.370> more<00:02:40.519> constraints<00:02:41.269> but<00:02:41.390> not<00:02:41.569> much

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
a little more constraints but not much

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.500 
a little more constraints but not much
you<00:02:42.079> really<00:02:42.260> could<00:02:42.620> beat<00:02:42.920> many<00:02:43.640> dungeons<00:02:43.970> in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
you really could beat many dungeons in

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.289 
you really could beat many dungeons in
many<00:02:44.750> different<00:02:44.989> orders<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.310> kind<00:02:47.209> of

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
many different orders so it's kind of

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.690 
many different orders so it's kind of
exciting<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:48.110> see<00:02:48.349> that<00:02:48.379> they<00:02:48.890> are<00:02:48.920> looking<00:02:49.430> at

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
exciting to see that they are looking at

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.119 
exciting to see that they are looking at
that<00:02:49.940> as<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> way<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.750> opening<00:02:51.410> up<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.859> world

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
that as a way of opening up the world

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.170 
that as a way of opening up the world
very<00:02:53.000> excited<00:02:53.660> about<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.430> but<00:02:55.430> as<00:02:55.549> far<00:02:55.849> as

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
very excited about that but as far as

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.660 
very excited about that but as far as
the<00:02:56.690> des<00:02:57.349> el<00:02:57.620> de<00:02:57.769> needs<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.160> be<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> single

the des el de needs to be a single
player<00:02:59.060> experience<00:02:59.170> I<00:03:00.170> really<00:03:01.040> don't<00:03:01.220> think

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
player experience I really don't think

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.789 
player experience I really don't think
that<00:03:01.579> what<00:03:01.940> they're<00:03:02.120> hinting<00:03:02.599> at<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.200> four

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
that what they're hinting at is a four

swords game I feel like probably it's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.199
