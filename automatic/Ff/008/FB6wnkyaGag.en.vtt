00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
little bit wrong in that department so

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.009 
little bit wrong in that department so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
this iPad air is excellent sure the ipad

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.470 
this iPad air is excellent sure the ipad
air<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> definitely<00:00:28.710> faster<00:00:29.250> than<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> ipad<00:00:30.240> 4

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
air is definitely faster than the ipad 4

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.209 
air is definitely faster than the ipad 4
but<00:00:30.750> there's<00:00:31.140> not<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> lot<00:00:31.679> out<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
but there's not a lot out there at the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.740 
but there's not a lot out there at the
moment<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:32.850> take<00:00:33.120> advantage<00:00:33.570> of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
moment that can really take advantage of

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.049 
moment that can really take advantage of
that<00:00:33.960> speed<00:00:34.410> you'll<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.160> quicker<00:00:35.460> load<00:00:35.760> times

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
that speed you'll see quicker load times

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.330 
that speed you'll see quicker load times
in<00:00:36.329> games<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.870> other<00:00:37.079> apps<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.040> alone

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
in games and other apps but that alone

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.069 
in games and other apps but that alone
shouldn't<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.969> your<00:00:39.210> deciding<00:00:39.540> factor<00:00:40.050> for

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
shouldn't be your deciding factor for

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.229 
shouldn't be your deciding factor for
upgrading<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.219> difference<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
upgrading the difference is in the

photos taken on the iPad air if you were

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.670 
photos taken on the iPad air if you were
wondering<00:03:27.150> about<00:03:27.450> battery<00:03:27.959> life<00:03:28.080> that's

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
wondering about battery life that's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.770 
wondering about battery life that's
definitely<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.820> vary<00:03:30.000> between<00:03:30.150> users

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
definitely going to vary between users

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.960 
definitely going to vary between users
but<00:03:31.050> in<00:03:31.260> my<00:03:31.650> testing<00:03:32.190> this<00:03:32.370> battery<00:03:32.760> was

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
but in my testing this battery was

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.390 
but in my testing this battery was
extremely<00:03:33.810> hard<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.140> drain<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:35.190> keeps

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
extremely hard to drain it just keeps

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.490 
extremely hard to drain it just keeps
going<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.090> going<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.720> standby<00:03:37.080> time<00:03:37.230> is

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
going and going and the standby time is

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.830 
going and going and the standby time is
absolutely<00:03:38.190> excellent<00:03:38.670> because<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.690> its

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
absolutely excellent because of its

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.810 
absolutely excellent because of its
standby<00:03:40.230> time<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.709> long<00:03:40.920> lasting<00:03:41.190> battery

will move them on future iOS devices
either<00:04:09.570> way<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.840> think<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.380> ipad<00:04:10.709> air<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.100> a
