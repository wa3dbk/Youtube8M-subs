 sifted through all the rotten 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.309
 with specks and be and which you do not 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:07.069
 like you throw away the rest 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:09.149
 you shift apples into a container 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.579
 add a little sheet of black 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.359
 currants can not add and just 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.950
 any impurities 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.509
 let's say a spring flooded put 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.109

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.420
