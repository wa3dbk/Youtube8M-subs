its<00:02:24.630> cooling<00:02:24.930> capacity<00:02:26.270> everybody<00:02:27.270> tells<00:02:27.480> me

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
its cooling capacity everybody tells me

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.270 
its cooling capacity everybody tells me
you<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.810> wow<00:02:27.959> this<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.470> thing<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.770> huge<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you know wow this this thing is huge and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.100 
you know wow this this thing is huge and
that<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.180> what<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.360> need<00:02:30.599> because<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.080> a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that is what you need because it is a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
that is what you need because it is a
passive<00:02:31.590> cooler<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.040> doesn't<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.430> any<00:02:32.610> air

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
passive cooler it doesn't have any air

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.339 
passive cooler it doesn't have any air
blowing<00:02:33.060> through<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.390> however<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.110> cooler

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
blowing through it however this cooler

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.380 
blowing through it however this cooler
is<00:02:34.470> incredibly<00:02:35.040> light<00:02:35.310> despite<00:02:35.940> its<00:02:36.150> size

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
is incredibly light despite its size

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.479 
is incredibly light despite its size
once<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.440> pick<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.739> up<00:02:37.830> you'd<00:02:38.010> be<00:02:38.130> surprised

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
once you pick it up you'd be surprised

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.210 
once you pick it up you'd be surprised
at<00:02:38.640> how<00:02:38.670> light<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:40.230> under<00:02:40.500> 500<00:02:41.040> grams

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
at how light it is it's under 500 grams

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.470 
at how light it is it's under 500 grams
so<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.269> would<00:02:42.420> be<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.569> comparable<00:02:43.790> non<00:02:44.790> passive

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
so but would be a comparable non passive

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
so but would be a comparable non passive
cooler<00:02:45.720> size<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.950> fx100<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:50.239> comparable

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
cooler size to the fx100 a comparable

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.990 
cooler size to the fx100 a comparable
active<00:02:52.500> cooler<00:02:52.860> would<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.280> probably<00:02:53.549> along

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
active cooler would be probably along

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.490 
active cooler would be probably along
the<00:02:54.150> lines<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.569> i'll<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.110> use<00:02:55.140> almond

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
the lines of i'll just use almond

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.320 
the lines of i'll just use almond
product<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.069> an<00:02:56.220> example<00:02:56.519> probably<00:02:57.239> around

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
product as an example probably around

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.199 
product as an example probably around
the<00:02:57.630> 9500<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.590> LED<00:02:59.160> something<00:02:59.790> along<00:03:00.030> those

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
the 9500 a LED something along those

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.870 
the 9500 a LED something along those
lines<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.890> particular<00:03:02.040> cooler<00:03:02.610> has<00:03:02.849> a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
lines so this particular cooler has a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.970 
lines so this particular cooler has a
cooling<00:03:03.209> capacity<00:03:03.360> without<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.170> fan<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:04.530> 75

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
cooling capacity without the fan of 75

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.490 
cooling capacity without the fan of 75
watts<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:06.000> perfectly<00:03:06.720> able<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.080> cool<00:03:07.319> all

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
watts so it's perfectly able to cool all

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.110 
watts so it's perfectly able to cool all

want to add any sort of our expansion
cards<00:05:15.840> you<00:05:16.170> would<00:05:16.260> basically<00:05:16.410> unscrew<00:05:17.130> this

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
cards you would basically unscrew this

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.490 
cards you would basically unscrew this
screw<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:18.060> plate<00:05:18.360> would<00:05:18.510> come<00:05:18.690> off<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.050> you

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
screw this plate would come off and you

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.320 
screw this plate would come off and you
can<00:05:19.530> do<00:05:19.770> what's<00:05:19.950> required<00:05:20.190> on<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.580> PCI<00:05:20.940> slots

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
can do what's required on the PCI slots

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.240 
can do what's required on the PCI slots
once<00:05:21.840> everything<00:05:22.260> is<00:05:22.320> done<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.950> put<00:05:23.130> this

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
once everything is done you put this

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.280 
once everything is done you put this
back<00:05:23.430> on<00:05:23.460> screw<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.390> in<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.780> it's<00:05:25.050> another

back on screw this in and it's another

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.990 
back on screw this in and it's another
layer<00:05:25.530> of<00:05:25.560> security<00:05:25.890> for<00:05:26.490> your<00:05:26.610> expansion
