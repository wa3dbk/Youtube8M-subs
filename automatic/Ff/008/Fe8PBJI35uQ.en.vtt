Farenheit presents

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.000
Blip Blup... on a real phone!

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.260
To select any tile of the phone, jump on it

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.480
Jump on any grey tile to start a pulse of color

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.220
Fill all grey tiles to solve puzzles

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.720
A pulse spreads out in all directions

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.880
Walls block pulses from spreading color

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.140
Arrows relect your pulse in the direction they point

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.900
These tiles alternate between a wall and a grey tile upon impact with a pulse

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.800
Death tiles cause death :D

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.740
Some tiles require multiple pulses to be colored

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.960
Don't forget that for each level you have a limited number of pulses!

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.320
Now you have learned enough to complete this minigame... but will you beat all 60 levels?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.720
You finished all the levels and you have nothing better to do?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.800
Try the level editor!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.340
(It should be pretty intuitive)

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.600
I almost forgot... you can also choose the number of pulses!

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:28.833
