00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:16.199
 men women and hello to all I want 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.910
 take advantage of again to connect up 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.010
 a video guide they made long ago 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.570
 on the dg indexing option 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 I still want to take advantage of it because of me 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.189
 I was forgotten on a small point where 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.660
 he wanted to go there and then I didn't go 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.160
 because I person away then there was the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.700
 car but they stole it etc. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.190
 etc 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 so let's go further now to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 change the option to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.890
 indexing on stragismo as yes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.140
 ago is very simple 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.770
 let's go to start this video lasts from 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.719
 don't worry we go to start 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 computer we select our hard 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.410
 disk where our system resides 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.390
 operative in this case I think in the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.150
 most people as I speak 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.700
 fast it will be 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.460
 c our usual operating system 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.480
 marked with we go up formed 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 joke 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.570
 let's go over property once 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.440
 we click on properties 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.000
 here is a small check allows 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.520
 the damaging indexing are alone 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 dyslexic but I don't care indie 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.480
 so there is also the margin that dominates me 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.360
 Fuck so little dyslexia so much 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.900
 allows indexing of contents 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.250
 of its own file properties and is of 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.170
 this unity for down from ignorance 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.060
 carries part of a blow however yes a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.630
 moped 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.300
 we trace and in this case check one 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.670
 once the bank has been pushed, we press up 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.830
 apply once this is done but you are 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 sure to do this you want all kyi e 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.610
 all the cocks that are inside you 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.680
 do you are all the files of the second 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.590
 option press ok 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.630
 once pressed on ok it says but you are 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 sure they are administrators yes 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.190
 sure if i head that you get on 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.670
 capocchiano no then you say yes I am the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.590
 boss that we press that continues once 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.690
 he did with dinho it's nice trouble but here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.010
 there are ongoing processes I was doing 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.750
 ignore all once all are ignored 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.330
 our computer 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.890
 depends on what computer we have and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.470
 from the hard disk that we have supplied 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.320
 if we have a hard drive when you do 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.959
 see says abba da badu on when 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.269
 April so in this case there 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.720
 will put a little bit will change a repeat from 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.930
 computer to computer anyway good or bad 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.390
 on medium-end computers will last between 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.760
 five minutes and six minutes fourth 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.830
 just pulling it dear dear 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.959
 so I stop recording for a moment 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.920
 and I'll show you what to do next 5 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.440
 minutes 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.140
 boys 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.030
 therefore he kept waiting so long in 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.430
 meanwhile of the thesis in this video vi 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.850
 immediately picked up I will immediately do one 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.880
 quick joke fast a rocket one 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.020
 supposed to meet the supposed says 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.220
 the rocket 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.990
 blessed are you who go to heaven here 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.200
 gentlemen, what appears one 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.880
 once our operation is over 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.740
 a blessed cippa lippa as the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.410
 our claudio di biagio 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.810
 nothing closes everything here once 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.250
 did this and we press ok close it is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.620
 for safety 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.680
 I always repeat for security we restart the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.390
 computer then everything is finished 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.340
 if you have arrived at the end of the video vi 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.210
 this video is interested in this 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.100
 I told you shitty joke 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.170
 put a comment on the video 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.060

 Russian not all asshole all in Italian 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.680
 because sometimes I don't get along 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.050
 with Italian it seems that this happens a 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.600
 bus home and then leave because he looks at me 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.600
