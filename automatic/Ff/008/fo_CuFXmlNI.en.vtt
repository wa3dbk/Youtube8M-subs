would break the ground they were

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.480 
would break the ground they were
standing<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> then<00:01:49.920> they'd<00:01:50.100> fall<00:01:50.310> down

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
standing on and then they'd fall down

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
were beneath me I would place the egg it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.929 
were beneath me I would place the egg it
would<00:01:55.380> open<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.979> hole<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.880> could
