have a fan and a ballast worth with them
but<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:24.180> ones<00:00:24.769> interestingly<00:00:26.240> don't<00:00:27.240> need

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
but these ones interestingly don't need

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:36.229 
but these ones interestingly don't need
a<00:00:28.410> fan<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> ballast<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.790> h4<00:00:35.790> kit

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a fan or a ballast this is an h4 kit

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.420 
a fan or a ballast this is an h4 kit
I've<00:00:36.300> got<00:00:36.660> does<00:00:37.620> high<00:00:38.070> beam<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.790> low<00:00:39.270> beam<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
I've got does high beam and low beam and

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.680 
I've got does high beam and low beam and
all<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.760> comes<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> bulbs<00:00:44.360> and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.970 

this<00:00:48.770> it<00:00:49.770> connects<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.140> factory<00:00:52.140> harness

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
this it connects to the factory harness

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900 
this it connects to the factory harness
and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.510> end<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:55.050> connect<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.910> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and then this end would connect to that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.560 
and then this end would connect to that
and<00:00:59.870> installing<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.980> don't<00:01:02.100> pop<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
and installing these you don't pop the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.130 
and installing these you don't pop the
whole<00:01:03.570> bulb<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.290> once<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.600> twist<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
whole bulb in at once you twist this

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.219 
whole bulb in at once you twist this
metal<00:01:07.680> part<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.420> install<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
metal part off and install it as you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.700 
metal part off and install it as you
would<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> normal<00:01:11.700> bolt<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.200> after

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
would with a normal bolt and then after

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.660 
would with a normal bolt and then after
you've<00:01:13.830> put<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> through<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:17.340> put

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you've put that through you then put

I'm<00:01:58.270> sure<00:01:58.690> how<00:01:59.050> do<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.979> rain<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:04.140> couldn't

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
I'm sure how do in the rain I couldn't

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.160 
I'm sure how do in the rain I couldn't
put<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:05.440> in<00:02:05.650> with<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.070> rubber<00:02:06.310> gasket<00:02:07.170> because

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
put it in with the rubber gasket because

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.729 
put it in with the rubber gasket because
it<00:02:08.320> wouldn't<00:02:08.590> fit<00:02:09.720> he<00:02:10.720> suppose<00:02:11.170> I'd<00:02:11.380> have<00:02:11.560> to

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
it wouldn't fit he suppose I'd have to

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.130 
it wouldn't fit he suppose I'd have to
take<00:02:11.950> out<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.840> housing<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.650> make<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.010> fit<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.870> fit

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
take out a housing to make it fit to fit

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.590 
take out a housing to make it fit to fit
it<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.380> properly<00:02:18.190> because<00:02:18.820> there's<00:02:19.239> not<00:02:19.390> much

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
it in properly because there's not much

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.970 
it in properly because there's not much
gap<00:02:19.930> here<00:02:22.680> hmm<00:02:24.420> definitely<00:02:25.420> look<00:02:25.769> white<00:02:27.450> but

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
gap here hmm definitely look white but

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.690 
gap here hmm definitely look white but
