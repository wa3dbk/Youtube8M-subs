fairly small design company even though

he sold all over the world and had quite
a<00:00:30.349> good<00:00:30.410> turnover<00:00:30.919> but<00:00:31.460> it<00:00:31.550> was<00:00:31.669> a<00:00:31.730> kind<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:32.000> a

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
a good turnover but it was a kind of a

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.639 
a good turnover but it was a kind of a
small<00:00:32.329> design<00:00:32.599> team<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:33.110> meant<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:33.410> was

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
small design team so it meant that I was

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.340 
small design team so it meant that I was
close<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.040> him<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:34.760> able<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.030> do<00:00:35.989> lots<00:00:36.230> of

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
close to him and able to do lots of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.710 
close to him and able to do lots of
different<00:00:36.710> things<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.420> sometimes<00:00:38.420> nights

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
different things and sometimes nights

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.360 
different things and sometimes nights
going<00:00:38.840> work<00:00:38.990> for<00:00:39.140> small<00:00:39.230> emerging<00:00:39.950> companies

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
going work for small emerging companies

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.980 
going work for small emerging companies
rather<00:00:40.760> than<00:00:40.850> being<00:00:41.270> huge<00:00:41.540> industries

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
rather than being huge industries

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.990 
rather than being huge industries
because<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.230> get<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.620> do<00:00:43.100> much<00:00:43.370> more<00:00:43.610> hands-on

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
because you get to do much more hands-on

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.360 
because you get to do much more hands-on
work<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:44.630> that's<00:00:45.470> how<00:00:45.560> I<00:00:45.650> kind<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.890> first<00:00:46.190> got

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
work so that's how I kind of first got

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.970 
work so that's how I kind of first got
into<00:00:46.610> it<00:00:46.700> I<00:00:46.790> worked<00:00:47.000> there<00:00:47.120> for<00:00:47.180> two<00:00:47.900> years

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
into it I worked there for two years

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.800 
into it I worked there for two years
eight<00:00:48.980> collections<00:00:49.580> we<00:00:49.700> worked<00:00:49.880> on<00:00:50.740> I<00:00:52.810> guess

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
eight collections we worked on I guess

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.120 
eight collections we worked on I guess
what<00:00:53.960> makes<00:00:54.079> me<00:00:54.320> stand<00:00:54.560> out<00:00:54.770> from<00:00:55.010> other

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
what makes me stand out from other

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.390 
what makes me stand out from other
designers<00:00:55.760> in<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.690> my<00:00:57.170> market<00:00:57.590> would<00:00:57.739> be<00:00:57.980> that

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
designers in in my market would be that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.470 
designers in in my market would be that
I<00:00:58.930> don't<00:00:59.930> just<00:00:59.989> produce<00:01:00.380> products<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.480> produce

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
I don't just produce products I produce

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.359 
I don't just produce products I produce
products<00:01:03.079> in<00:01:03.200> front<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.590> people<00:01:03.950> and<00:01:04.009> explain

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
products in front of people and explain

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.740 
products in front of people and explain
how<00:01:04.519> they're<00:01:04.670> done<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.119> what<00:01:05.360> I'm<00:01:05.449> doing<00:01:05.659> is

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
how they're done so what I'm doing is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.389 
how they're done so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:05.840> showing<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.290> inner<00:01:06.439> workings<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.070> I

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
I'm showing the inner workings of it I

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.840 
I'm showing the inner workings of it I
made<00:01:08.240> I'm<00:01:08.509> sort<00:01:08.689> of<00:01:08.720> teaching<00:01:09.020> as<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.439> go<00:01:09.850> not

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.110 
to expose the methods and techniques
that<00:01:21.470> go<00:01:21.560> on<00:01:21.650> behind<00:01:22.270> Gumm<00:01:23.270> making<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.760> also<00:01:25.760> I

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
that go on behind Gumm making and also I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.990 
that go on behind Gumm making and also I
also<00:01:26.510> like<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.890> know<00:01:28.010> work<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.490> lot<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:28.760> the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
also like to you know work a lot in the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.060 
also like to you know work a lot in the
promotional<00:01:29.720> video<00:01:29.900> fashion<00:01:30.470> too<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.890> in

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
promotional video fashion too and in

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.000

film and graphic work and website work
so<00:01:35.440> I'm<00:01:36.440> different<00:01:36.890> really<00:01:37.070> because<00:01:37.280> I<00:01:37.340> don't

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
so I'm different really because I don't

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.500 
so I'm different really because I don't
let<00:01:37.670> go<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:38.090> design<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.590> very<00:01:40.190> early<00:01:40.330> I'd<00:01:41.330> like

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
let go of design so very early I'd like

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.410 
let go of design so very early I'd like
to<00:01:41.630> follow<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.020> through<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.500> continue<00:01:43.420> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
to follow it through and continue the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.359 
to follow it through and continue the
forms<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.869> promotion<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.650> communication

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
forms of promotion and communication

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.109 
forms of promotion and communication
afterwards<00:01:46.820> too<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.670> think<00:01:49.760> I<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:49.909> have<00:01:50.090> a

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
afterwards too so I think I just have a

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.420 
afterwards too so I think I just have a
wider<00:01:50.420> view<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.260> what<00:01:51.439> fashion<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:51.950> than<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.280> lot

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
wider view of what fashion is than a lot

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.980 
wider view of what fashion is than a lot
of<00:01:52.549> designers<00:01:53.000> who<00:01:53.150> seem<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.450> have<00:01:53.630> quite<00:01:53.750> now

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
of designers who seem to have quite now

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.550 
of designers who seem to have quite now
of<00:01:54.140> use<00:01:55.119> quite<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.150> lot<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.450> people<00:01:56.840> are<00:01:57.170> bought

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
of use quite a lot of people are bought

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.670
