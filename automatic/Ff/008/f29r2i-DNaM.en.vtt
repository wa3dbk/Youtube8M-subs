heyi<00:00:05.390> fell<00:00:05.750> and<00:00:05.899> detoxes<00:00:06.529> so<00:00:06.890> today<00:00:07.340> we're

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 
heyi fell and detoxes so today we're

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.970 
heyi fell and detoxes so today we're
going<00:00:07.910> to<00:00:08.090> do<00:00:08.270> the<00:00:08.510> green<00:00:08.750> commuted<00:00:09.230> water<00:00:09.469> of

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
going to do the green commuted water of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.890 
going to do the green commuted water of
course<00:00:10.190> it's<00:00:10.459> another<00:00:10.730> form<00:00:11.120> of<00:00:11.270> chlorophyll

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
course it's another form of chlorophyll

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.650 
course it's another form of chlorophyll
and<00:00:12.139> we<00:00:12.260> should<00:00:12.469> be<00:00:12.559> taking<00:00:12.949> in<00:00:13.100> 50<00:00:13.940> 60<00:00:14.180> 70

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
and we should be taking in 50 60 70

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.779 
and we should be taking in 50 60 70
percent<00:00:15.049> chlorophyll<00:00:15.500> a<00:00:15.529> day<00:00:15.799> so<00:00:16.369> during<00:00:16.699> the

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
percent chlorophyll a day so during the

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.580 
percent chlorophyll a day so during the
detox<00:00:17.270> while<00:00:17.510> we're<00:00:17.690> a<00:00:17.720> bootcamp<00:00:18.170> we're<00:00:18.380> doing

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
detox while we're a bootcamp we're doing

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.320 
detox while we're a bootcamp we're doing
all<00:00:18.800> these<00:00:19.070> different<00:00:19.220> forms<00:00:19.759> of<00:00:19.880> chlorophyll

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
all these different forms of chlorophyll

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.419 
all these different forms of chlorophyll
then<00:00:20.810> when<00:00:21.169> you're<00:00:21.320> done<00:00:21.529> we'll<00:00:22.070> pick<00:00:22.279> and

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.429 
then when you're done we'll pick and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.159 
then when you're done we'll pick and
choose<00:00:22.609> which<00:00:22.880> ones<00:00:23.179> you<00:00:23.449> want<00:00:23.689> to<00:00:23.749> stay<00:00:23.960> with

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
choose which ones you want to stay with

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.230 
choose which ones you want to stay with
so<00:00:24.380> today<00:00:24.650> we're<00:00:24.859> doing<00:00:24.980> green<00:00:25.310> kamut<00:00:25.669> a<00:00:25.849> very

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
so today we're doing green kamut a very

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.029 
so today we're doing green kamut a very
easy<00:00:26.599> way<00:00:26.869> to<00:00:26.900> get<00:00:27.109> some<00:00:27.349> wheatgrass<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.769> I

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
easy way to get some wheatgrass and I

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.009 
easy way to get some wheatgrass and I
know<00:00:28.099> everybody<00:00:28.460> does<00:00:28.699> this<00:00:28.910> when<00:00:29.179> they<00:00:29.300> get

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
know everybody does this when they get

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.929 
know everybody does this when they get
to<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.230> wheatgrass<00:00:30.529> part<00:00:31.009> but<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:31.609> know<00:00:31.730> what

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
to the wheatgrass part but you know what

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.390 
to the wheatgrass part but you know what
it's<00:00:32.509> got<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.810> same<00:00:33.079> molecular<00:00:33.470> structure<00:00:34.250> is

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
it's got the same molecular structure is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400 
it's got the same molecular structure is
your<00:00:34.670> blood<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.329> you're<00:00:35.540> helping<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.990> build

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
your blood so you're helping to build

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.410 
your blood so you're helping to build
your<00:00:36.710> blood<00:00:36.980> up<00:00:37.220> you're<00:00:37.430> helping<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:38.030> pull<00:00:38.300> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
your blood up you're helping to pull the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.690 
your blood up you're helping to pull the
poisons<00:00:38.900> out<00:00:39.080> and<00:00:39.380> no<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:40.040> blood<00:00:40.250> up<00:00:40.400> at<00:00:40.550> the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
poisons out and no the blood up at the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.300 
poisons out and no the blood up at the
same<00:00:40.940> time<00:00:41.270> what<00:00:42.050> I<00:00:42.080> used<00:00:42.380> to<00:00:42.470> say<00:00:42.560> years<00:00:43.040> ago

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
same time what I used to say years ago

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.190 
same time what I used to say years ago
30<00:00:43.700> years<00:00:43.760> ago<00:00:43.970> when<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.240> started<00:00:44.330> doing<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:44.990> I

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
30 years ago when I started doing this I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.040 
30 years ago when I started doing this I
used<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:45.470> say<00:00:45.680> it's<00:00:46.460> liquid<00:00:46.820> sunshine<00:00:47.210> that's

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
used to say it's liquid sunshine that's

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.780 
used to say it's liquid sunshine that's
not<00:00:48.260> my<00:00:48.410> son<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.980> for<00:00:49.160> me<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.310> that's<00:00:49.580> what

not my son and for me that that's what
they<00:00:49.910> call<00:00:50.120> LSD<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:50.930> never<00:00:51.500> mind<00:00:51.770> them<00:00:51.890> look

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
they call LSD so never mind them look

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.250 
they call LSD so never mind them look
with<00:00:52.160> sunshine<00:00:52.370> but<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.510> really<00:00:53.750> isn't<00:00:53.990> we

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.750 
with sunshine but it really isn't we
want<00:00:54.470> to<00:00:54.530> put<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.770> right<00:00:54.860> connotation<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.580> it

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
want to put the right connotation to it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.330 
want to put the right connotation to it

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
here and it's great to make it ahead of

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.160 
here and it's great to make it ahead of
time<00:01:28.280> at<00:01:29.090> home<00:01:29.359> but<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.749> course<00:01:29.960> if<00:01:30.079> you're

gonna make it ahead of time you're gonna
put<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.729> glass<00:01:31.999> bottles<00:01:33.219> so<00:01:34.219> we're<00:01:34.399> just

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
put it in glass bottles so we're just

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.550 
put it in glass bottles so we're just
going<00:01:34.639> to<00:01:34.700> add<00:01:34.909> our<00:01:34.939> purified<00:01:35.689> water<00:01:35.960> here<00:01:36.380> and

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
going to add our purified water here and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.950 
going to add our purified water here and
the<00:01:36.679> way<00:01:36.799> I<00:01:36.829> do<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:37.219> I<00:01:37.639> just<00:01:37.939> fill<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.630> halfway

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
the way I do this I just fill it halfway

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.870 
the way I do this I just fill it halfway
to

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
to

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.999 
to
mixing<00:01:40.450> up<00:01:40.570> before<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.080> fill<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.590> rest<00:01:41.710> of

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
mixing up before I fill it the rest of

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.469 
mixing up before I fill it the rest of
the<00:01:42.070> way<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:42.280> we<00:01:42.430> didn't<00:01:42.700> have<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.970> have<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.240> run

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
the way so we didn't have to have to run

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.660 
the way so we didn't have to have to run
it<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.810> long<00:01:44.290> time<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.770> gets<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.979> lot<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.400> foam

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
it a long time it gets a lot of the foam

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.550 
it a long time it gets a lot of the foam
on<00:01:45.880> top<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.479> if<00:01:46.570> it<00:01:46.659> does<00:01:46.810> get<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.080> lot<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.350> bone

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
on top and if it does get a lot of bone

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.530
