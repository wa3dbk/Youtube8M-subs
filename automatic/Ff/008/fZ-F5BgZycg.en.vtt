we have pierre-emerick aubameyang

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.069 
we have pierre-emerick aubameyang
obviously<00:00:41.219> making<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> move<00:00:41.760> over<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:42.570> st.

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
obviously making the move over from st.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
obviously making the move over from st.
Etienne<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.500> believe<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.309> Borussia

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
Etienne I believe it to at Borussia

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.580 
Etienne I believe it to at Borussia
Dortmund<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.360> he<00:00:45.629> also<00:00:45.840> has<00:00:45.989> moved<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.559> from

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
Dortmund and he also has moved out from

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
Dortmund and he also has moved out from
striker<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> right<00:00:48.000> wing<00:00:48.210> row<00:00:48.420> which<00:00:48.629> is

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
striker to a right wing row which is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.209 
striker to a right wing row which is
definitely<00:00:49.200> more<00:00:49.320> suited<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.710> him<00:00:49.950> being

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
definitely more suited for him being

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.850 
definitely more suited for him being
quick<00:00:50.789> obviously<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.780> there<00:00:52.050> yeah<00:00:52.260> he<00:00:52.289> plays

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
quick obviously and there yeah he plays

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.529 
quick obviously and there yeah he plays
a<00:00:52.890> wider<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.699> Dortmund<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.180> he<00:00:54.239> did<00:00:54.420> play

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
a wider for Dortmund and he did play

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
a wider for Dortmund and he did play
relatively<00:00:55.079> wide<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.860> st.<00:00:56.219> Etienne<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.760> it's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
relatively wide for st. Etienne so it's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
relatively wide for st. Etienne so it's
very<00:00:57.000> suited<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.600> him<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.870> basically<00:00:58.649> he<00:00:58.920> has

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
very suited for him but basically he has

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.819 
very suited for him but basically he has
acceleration<00:00:59.910> quicker<00:01:00.210> over<00:01:00.570> 30<00:01:00.870> meters<00:01:01.440> than

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
acceleration quicker over 30 meters than

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
acceleration quicker over 30 meters than
Usain<00:01:02.250> Bolt<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.730> he<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.090> run<00:01:03.270> 30<00:01:03.600> meters

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
Usain Bolt so he can run 30 meters

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.429 
Usain Bolt so he can run 30 meters
quicken<00:01:04.500> quicker<00:01:05.189> than<00:01:05.400> bolted<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.060> his<00:01:06.840> 100

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
quicken quicker than bolted in his 100

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
quicken quicker than bolted in his 100
meter<00:01:07.650> world<00:01:08.040> record<00:01:08.520> sprint<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.180> that's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
meter world record sprint so that's

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.179 
meter world record sprint so that's
pretty<00:01:09.659> impressive<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.530> fact<00:01:10.770> he<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.040> run

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
pretty impressive the fact he can run

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
pretty impressive the fact he can run
fait<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> quicker<00:01:12.090> which<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
fait me is quicker which I think that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
fait me is quicker which I think that
definitely<00:01:12.990> deserves<00:01:13.310> 94<00:01:14.310> pace<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.760> also

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
definitely deserves 94 pace I've also

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.730 
definitely deserves 94 pace I've also
