can start getting all the other perks
and<00:01:16.430> then<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:17.210> hit<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.390> box<00:01:17.570> so<00:01:17.810> i<00:01:17.840> would

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
and then you can hit the box so i would

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.480 
and then you can hit the box so i would
really<00:01:18.259> just<00:01:18.380> stay<00:01:18.920> away<00:01:19.070> from<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.310> box

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
really just stay away from the box

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.910 
really just stay away from the box
really<00:01:19.850> up<00:01:19.939> until<00:01:20.060> i<00:01:20.270> drowned<00:01:20.509> 78<00:01:21.140> or<00:01:21.590> until

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
really up until i drowned 78 or until

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.200 
really up until i drowned 78 or until
you<00:01:22.009> have<00:01:22.100> enough<00:01:22.189> points<00:01:22.579> to<00:01:22.729> comfortably

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
you have enough points to comfortably

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.880 
you have enough points to comfortably
spend<00:01:23.600> because<00:01:24.140> if<00:01:24.439> you're<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:24.680> going

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
spend because if you're just going

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.200 
spend because if you're just going
straight<00:01:25.070> for<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.310> box<00:01:25.549> you're<00:01:26.030> probably

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
straight for the box you're probably

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.429 
straight for the box you're probably
going<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.450> end<00:01:26.509> up<00:01:26.659> dying<00:01:26.930> that's<00:01:27.140> probably

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
going to end up dying that's probably

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.020 
going to end up dying that's probably
what<00:01:27.560> killed<00:01:27.649> a<00:01:27.770> lot<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:27.979> people<00:01:28.070> on<00:01:28.430> round<00:01:28.640> 15

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
what killed a lot of people on round 15

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.060 
what killed a lot of people on round 15
and<00:01:29.180> 16<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.689> because<00:01:30.320> they<00:01:30.469> go<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.920> box

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
and 16 is because they go to the box

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.859 
and 16 is because they go to the box
like<00:01:31.310> around<00:01:31.520> five<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:31.789> six<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:32.359> then<00:01:32.719> just

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
like around five or six and then just

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.330 
like around five or six and then just
waste<00:01:33.109> all<00:01:33.350> their<00:01:33.680> points<00:01:33.859> they<00:01:34.100> don't<00:01:34.250> get

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
waste all their points they don't get

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.560 
waste all their points they don't get
anything<00:01:34.609> open<00:01:35.030> they<00:01:35.119> don't<00:01:35.270> get<00:01:35.390> all<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
anything open they don't get all the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.240 
anything open they don't get all the
perks<00:01:35.689> they<00:01:35.899> need<00:01:36.109> and<00:01:36.289> then<00:01:36.829> once<00:01:37.009> around

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
perks they need and then once around

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.980 
perks they need and then once around
15-16<00:01:37.729> comes<00:01:38.149> that's<00:01:38.630> when<00:01:38.750> all<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.840> zombies

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
15-16 comes that's when all the zombies

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.630 
15-16 comes that's when all the zombies
really<00:01:39.380> start<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.619> spawn<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.070> that's<00:01:40.520> what

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
really start to spawn in that's what

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.649 
really start to spawn in that's what
they<00:01:40.729> eventually<00:01:40.789> start<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.329> die<00:01:41.450> because

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
they eventually start to die because

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:42.910 
they eventually start to die because
they're<00:01:41.930> not<00:01:42.020> set<00:01:42.229> up<00:01:42.320> properly<00:01:42.350> they<00:01:42.799> don't

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
they're not set up properly they don't

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.440 
they're not set up properly they don't
have<00:01:43.009> anything<00:01:43.189> open<00:01:43.399> they<00:01:43.939> only<00:01:44.060> have<00:01:44.240> maybe

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
have anything open they only have maybe

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.940 
have anything open they only have maybe
a<00:01:44.630> regulan<00:01:45.109> and<00:01:45.259> they're<00:01:45.350> gonna<00:01:45.439> kill

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
a regulan and they're gonna kill

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.840 
a regulan and they're gonna kill
themselves<00:01:46.250> because<00:01:46.340> they<00:01:46.579> don't<00:01:46.759> have

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
themselves because they don't have

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.370 
themselves because they don't have
anything<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.179> compensate<00:01:47.689> for<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.259> let

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
anything to compensate for that so let

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.569 
anything to compensate for that so let

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
then you're gonna keep wasting points so
on<00:02:21.210> early<00:02:21.480> rounds<00:02:21.840> always<00:02:22.170> buy<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> wall<00:02:22.650> weapon

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
on early rounds always buy a wall weapon

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.260 
on early rounds always buy a wall weapon
first<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.520> this<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:23.880> think<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.120> should

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
first so this is what I think you should

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.390 
first so this is what I think you should
do<00:02:24.360> by<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> wall<00:02:24.900> weapon<00:02:25.230> go<00:02:25.680> turn<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:25.920> power<00:02:26.220> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
do by a wall weapon go turn on power and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.010 
do by a wall weapon go turn on power and
then<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.790> jug<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.420> then<00:02:27.540> once<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.840> get

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
then get jug and then once you get

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.910 
then get jug and then once you get
juggler<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:28.590> when<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.860> start

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
juggler that's when you can start

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.320 
juggler that's when you can start
hitting<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.310> box<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:29.970> hit<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.240> a

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
hitting the box but don't hit it a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.270 
hitting the box but don't hit it a
million<00:02:30.600> times<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> row<00:02:31.290> hit<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.830> once<00:02:32.070> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
million times in a row hit it once and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.620 
million times in a row hit it once and
then<00:02:32.340> keep<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.730> your<00:02:32.850> wall<00:02:33.030> gun<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.420> whore

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
then keep with your wall gun and whore

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.940 
then keep with your wall gun and whore

that in mind but always go after the
first<00:03:27.209> wall<00:03:27.390> up<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.690> get<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:28.110> can<00:03:28.230> use<00:03:28.320> it

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
first wall up and you get you can use it

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.539 
first wall up and you get you can use it
to<00:03:28.500> warp<00:03:28.680> your<00:03:28.799> point<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.430> easy
