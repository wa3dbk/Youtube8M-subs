 those not using pawns like love 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.390
 not of life 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.680
 I recently heard someone say well there 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.760
 then I can do my for a very large part 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.570
 to connect 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.670
 but I do have a small one 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.620
 comment on you because yes I am already 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.420
 a while in this car and we turn and 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.310
 and I need a car for the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.620
 long distance it is not real 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.270
 you feel that it is high and narrow so on 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.310
 the highway year wipe not so good it 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.870
 is not the ideal car to ff in between 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.870
 blow for a day to southern Spain 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.280
 the pater asphalt time so it is not 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.869
 but we are lucky that we are in today 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.390
 Zealand and there is a piece 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.100
 unsolicited, of course, never far away 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.520
 so let's take a look at that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.520
 can find 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.799
 the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.880
 Yes 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.770
 yes the previous owner who was all 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.900
 behind a back car full of long distance 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.910
 is the six years that this car out of many 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.430
 our road trip and not even 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.650
 driven a 40,000 km 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.239
 So yes Oostpolder is the only thing 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.080
 they do it about it is we 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.380
 behind straps 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.640
 very small turn always getting out there 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.670
 standing is feeling for the new again 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.670
 owner 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.290
 actually the only pity is that 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.330
 factory warranty is missing 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.390
 but not to worry because if there is a wind 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.800
 are you not only this panna fieke 4 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.379

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.299
 warranty with one year breakdown assistance 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.709
 and the year old tradition view it 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.709
 but certainly still beautiful in all black 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.920

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.319
