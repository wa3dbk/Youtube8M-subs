00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.970 
so I noticed that it just plays about
five<00:05:03.120> seconds<00:05:03.600> so<00:05:03.810> whether<00:05:04.290> or<00:05:04.350> not<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.680> scans

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
five seconds so whether or not it scans

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.910
