00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:05.180
 Welcome to the Market Glory Tutorial. 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.500
 At this panel you can see the bonuses. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.559
 At this panel you can see the inhabitants. 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.040
 And here the possessions. 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.660
 Downstairs you see the government. 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.990
 De Heerser, the Prime Minister and the normal ministers. 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.579
 On the left you see the most important part. 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.700
 These are your own statuses. 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.840
 Let's zoom in first. 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.540
 You see your energy level, this is the most important thing. 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.130
 Underneath your skill. 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:01:03.829
 You can earn this by working or buying. 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:21.860
 And below your knowledge, which you can buy on the market or can also buy. 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:31.999
 The total sum of all three stats, divided by 3, gives you productivity. 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.389
 This determines your bonus. 

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:41.219
 Below you see your own possessions. 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:47.749
 You need 10 local currencies to get 1 gold. 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.499
 And 4 gold pieces to get 1 euro. 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:55.459
 First, let's work. 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.239
 Click on work. 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.020
 Then Work now. 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.299
 You have to work three days in a row to get the work bonus. 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.799
 You can only work once a day. 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.229
 Let's fight. 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.659
 Click on Fight. 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:11.659
 Attack. 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.659
 Attack now. 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.440
 You will see that you will always win against the trainer. 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.750
 You can fight 10 times a day. 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.189
 Every time you win you have to wait 10 minutes to attack again. 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.180
 The chat is also important. 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.010

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.930

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.090

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.319

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.250

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.489

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.250
