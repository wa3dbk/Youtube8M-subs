00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
this is a step-by-step tutorial how to

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.259 
this is a step-by-step tutorial how to
do<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:10.780> double<00:00:11.110> lift<00:00:11.259> which<00:00:11.620> pretty<00:00:12.190> much<00:00:12.280> way

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
do the double lift which pretty much way

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.410 
do the double lift which pretty much way
I'm<00:00:13.389> going<00:00:13.509> to<00:00:13.599> teach<00:00:13.719> you<00:00:13.780> looks<00:00:14.080> like<00:00:14.139> this

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
I'm going to teach you looks like this

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.609 
I'm going to teach you looks like this
that's<00:00:16.420> the<00:00:16.570> double<00:00:16.810> lift<00:00:16.960> okay<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.570> it's<00:00:20.470> very

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
that's the double lift okay so it's very

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.460 
that's the double lift okay so it's very
simple<00:00:21.210> I'm<00:00:22.210> doing<00:00:22.510> this<00:00:22.599> because<00:00:22.660> actually<00:00:23.439> a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
simple I'm doing this because actually a

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.980 
simple I'm doing this because actually a
lot<00:00:23.650> of<00:00:23.769> people<00:00:24.099> do<00:00:24.220> tutorials<00:00:24.640> on<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.720> double

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
lot of people do tutorials on the double

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.609 
lot of people do tutorials on the double
lift<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:27.519> in<00:00:27.699> a<00:00:27.939> later<00:00:28.570> video<00:00:28.779> I'm<00:00:29.080> going<00:00:29.320> to<00:00:29.529> be

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
lift it in a later video I'm going to be

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.690 
lift it in a later video I'm going to be
creating<00:00:29.769> how<00:00:30.279> to<00:00:31.860> how<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:32.890> make<00:00:33.309> more

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
creating how to how to make more

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.450 
creating how to how to make more
advanced<00:00:34.090> double<00:00:34.540> lives<00:00:34.719> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:36.309> bit

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
advanced double lives a little bit

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.920 
advanced double lives a little bit
better<00:00:36.610> looking<00:00:37.390> but<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:38.680> that<00:00:38.710> for<00:00:39.190> now

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
better looking but from that for now

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.290 
better looking but from that for now
here<00:00:40.930> we<00:00:41.050> go<00:00:41.670> okay<00:00:42.670> let's<00:00:42.850> get<00:00:42.940> started<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:49.210> do

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
here we go okay let's get started to do

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.330 
here we go okay let's get started to do
a<00:00:49.329> double<00:00:49.539> if<00:00:49.840> it's<00:00:50.079> very<00:00:50.320> simple<00:00:50.590> you're

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
a double if it's very simple you're

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.119 
a double if it's very simple you're
going<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.699> need<00:00:51.940> any<00:00:52.660> cards<00:00:53.350> maybe<00:00:53.649> you<00:00:53.949> have

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
going to need any cards maybe you have

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to need any cards maybe you have
some<00:00:54.399> cards<00:00:54.640> selected<00:00:55.059> or<00:00:55.149> something<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:56.050> you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
some cards selected or something and you

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.750 
some cards selected or something and you
don't<00:00:56.320> want<00:00:56.469> them<00:00:56.500> to<00:00:56.680> notice<00:00:56.829> their<00:00:57.129> card<00:00:57.460> for

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
don't want them to notice their card for

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.000 
don't want them to notice their card for
instance<00:00:58.059> you<00:00:58.149> go<00:00:58.269> through<00:00:58.480> a<00:00:58.510> change<00:00:58.870> i'm<00:00:59.260> not

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
instance you go through a change i'm not

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.610 
instance you go through a change i'm not
going<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.190> do<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.370> change<00:01:00.640> right<00:01:00.789> now<00:01:00.850> but<00:01:01.780> you

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
going to do a change right now but you

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.090 
going to do a change right now but you
do<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:04.330> get<00:01:04.480> to<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.780> top<00:01:04.980> what<00:01:05.980> you're

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
do that you get to the top what you're

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.330 
do that you get to the top what you're
going<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.280> do<00:01:06.460> is<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.710> very<00:01:08.920> simple

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
going to do is this is a very simple

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.360 
going to do is this is a very simple
doublelift<00:01:09.870> it's<00:01:10.870> actually<00:01:11.380> owes<00:01:11.830> its<00:01:12.130> wine

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
doublelift it's actually owes its wine

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.510 
doublelift it's actually owes its wine
and<00:01:12.840> chris<00:01:13.840> Kenner's<00:01:14.290> blueprint<00:01:14.980> think

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
and chris Kenner's blueprint think

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.400 
and chris Kenner's blueprint think
that's<00:01:15.700> what<00:01:15.850> it's<00:01:15.970> called<00:01:16.030> blueprint<00:01:16.780> but

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
that's what it's called blueprint but

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.830 
that's what it's called blueprint but
what<00:01:17.530> you're<00:01:17.680> going<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:17.890> do<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:19.450> going<00:01:19.630> to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
what you're going to do is going to

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.560 
what you're going to do is going to
slide<00:01:20.230> over<00:01:20.260> with<00:01:20.650> your<00:01:20.800> thumb<00:01:21.010> okay<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.390> is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
slide over with your thumb okay this is

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.450 
slide over with your thumb okay this is
a<00:01:22.600> different<00:01:23.110> double<00:01:23.350> if<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.560> most<00:01:23.800> people<00:01:24.070> do

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
a different double if the most people do

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.670 
a different double if the most people do
most<00:01:24.730> people<00:01:25.030> would<00:01:25.180> just<00:01:25.360> feel<00:01:26.200> for<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.650> and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
most people would just feel for it and

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.220 
most people would just feel for it and
do<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.160> double<00:01:27.460> lift<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:28.780> by<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:28.990> way<00:01:29.140> is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
do a double lift which by the way is

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.810 
do a double lift which by the way is
just<00:01:29.440> lifting<00:01:29.830> up<00:01:29.920> two<00:01:30.070> cards<00:01:30.430> if<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:30.640> didn't

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
just lifting up two cards if you didn't

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.340 
just lifting up two cards if you didn't
know<00:01:30.910> that<00:01:31.410> but<00:01:32.410> what<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.800> want<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.100> do<00:01:34.350> this

know that but what you want to do this
is<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.800> think<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.370> personally<00:01:36.850> looks<00:01:37.030> better

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
practice then I just grip it I flip it

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.209 
practice then I just grip it I flip it
over<00:05:38.520> or<00:05:39.520> what<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:39.940> can<00:05:40.090> do<00:05:40.270> is<00:05:41.099> have<00:05:42.099> your
