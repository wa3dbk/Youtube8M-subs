you<00:00:43.370> know<00:00:43.520> what<00:00:43.550> it<00:00:44.329> could<00:00:44.570> happen<00:00:44.840> before<00:00:45.410> the

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
you know what it could happen before the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.160 
you know what it could happen before the
game<00:00:45.739> for<00:00:46.040> all<00:00:46.160> we<00:00:46.340> know<00:00:46.520> I<00:00:46.820> mean<00:00:47.360> there<00:00:47.930> wasn't

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
game for all we know I mean there wasn't

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.139

any real obvious situation during that
game<00:00:53.390> where<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:53.840> could<00:00:54.050> have<00:00:54.170> said<00:00:54.380> yeah

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
game where you could have said yeah

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.650 
game where you could have said yeah
there<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.340> that's<00:00:55.640> what<00:00:55.880> happened<00:00:56.420> you

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
there it is that's what happened you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.150 
there it is that's what happened you
know<00:00:56.750> that's<00:00:56.989> where<00:00:57.200> he's<00:00:57.440> one<00:00:57.649> thing<00:00:57.890> that's

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
know that's where he's one thing that's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.819 
know that's where he's one thing that's
where<00:00:58.840> you<00:00:59.840> know<00:00:59.960> something<00:01:00.380> obvious

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
where you know something obvious

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.749 
where you know something obvious
occurred<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:03.350> would<00:01:03.530> have<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:03.739> guess<00:01:04.460> or

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
occurred you would have to guess or

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.940 
occurred you would have to guess or
assume<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:05.990> know<00:01:06.170> something<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.799> happen

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
assume you know something to happen

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.969 
assume you know something to happen
during<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.580> game<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.540> that's<00:01:08.870> best<00:01:09.409> that's

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
during the game so that's best that's

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.399 
during the game so that's best that's
what<00:01:10.400> we're<00:01:10.549> going<00:01:10.760> on<00:01:11.060> right<00:01:11.360> now<00:01:11.409> and

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
what we're going on right now and

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.789 
what we're going on right now and
obviously<00:01:12.909> something<00:01:13.909> is<00:01:14.000> wrong<00:01:14.299> RL<00:01:14.810> he<00:01:15.620> would

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
obviously something is wrong RL he would

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.969 
obviously something is wrong RL he would
be<00:01:15.979> showing<00:01:16.220> up<00:01:16.520> with<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.820> futon<00:01:17.210> in<00:01:17.360> front

Jared<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.490> was<00:01:19.640> clear<00:01:19.909> to<00:01:19.940> from<00:01:20.420> his

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
Jared it was clear to from his

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.630 
Jared it was clear to from his
performance<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.200> wasn't<00:01:21.619> Tom<00:01:21.860> Brady<00:01:22.220> like<00:01:22.460> I

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
performance it wasn't Tom Brady like I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.670 
performance it wasn't Tom Brady like I
know<00:01:22.700> who<00:01:23.090> looked<00:01:23.270> at<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.840> mechanics<00:01:24.380> of<00:01:24.500> his

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
know who looked at the mechanics of his

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.190 
know who looked at the mechanics of his
throwing<00:01:24.950> motions<00:01:25.540> we<00:01:26.540> were<00:01:26.659> trying<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.990> find

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
throwing motions we were trying to find

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.230 
throwing motions we were trying to find
anything<00:01:27.650> that<00:01:27.799> might<00:01:28.040> indicate<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.490> he<00:01:28.700> was

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
anything that might indicate that he was

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.910 
anything that might indicate that he was
with<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:29.630> interval<00:01:30.110> what<00:01:30.320> did<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.500> notice

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
with that interval what did you notice

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.289 
with that interval what did you notice
why<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.689> just<00:01:32.689> thought<00:01:32.920> on<00:01:33.920> some<00:01:34.310> occasions<00:01:34.340> on

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
why I just thought on some occasions on

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.300 
why I just thought on some occasions on
some<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.869> his<00:01:36.020> deliveries<00:01:36.649> in<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.009> fourth

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
pressure on the plant foot when he was

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.740 
pressure on the plant foot when he was
getting<00:01:45.049> rid<00:01:45.680> of<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.860> ball<00:01:46.189> on<00:01:46.789> a<00:01:47.180> couple<00:01:47.659> of

getting rid of the ball on a couple of
the<00:01:47.899> throws<00:01:48.909> his<00:01:49.909> mechanics<00:01:50.509> were<00:01:50.630> off

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
the throws his mechanics were off

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.990 
the throws his mechanics were off
slightly<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.649> mean<00:01:52.189> people<00:01:52.490> were<00:01:52.580> saying<00:01:52.820> you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
slightly I mean people were saying you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.090 
slightly I mean people were saying you
might<00:01:53.149> have<00:01:53.299> been<00:01:53.450> off<00:01:53.600> ballgame<00:01:53.929> but<00:01:54.439> I<00:01:54.500> you

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
might have been off ballgame but I you

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.149 
might have been off ballgame but I you
know<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.250> can't<00:01:55.759> sit<00:01:56.450> here<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:56.750> tell<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.170> that

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
know I can't sit here and tell you that

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.249 
know I can't sit here and tell you that
that<00:01:58.369> was<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.390> know<00:01:59.450> he<00:01:59.750> had<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.929> bad

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
that was because you know he had a bad

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.139
