00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.000
 Hi everyone in this video I want 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.250
 tell you about two new products well cost 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.650
 bought as you know is not the first 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.759
 time I buy in this German brand 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.619
 because I like completely eco bio e 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.610
 in short, I found myself well with theirs 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.559
 produced or bought back a pencil and for 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.619
 to another color because I had the 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:34.800
 bright blue instead I bought the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.640
 olive green this pencil here greenish 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 it's very pretty in my opinion with a bit of 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 just tan is also a lot 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 well 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.410
 today I put the lower rhyme 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.110
 of the eye so I didn't put the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.800
 black pencil but I put below 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.300
 only this olive green pencil today 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.739
 did not even put an eye shadow made 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 a little bit more summer makeup you see 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.740
 This very soft pencil and a lot 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.710
 creamy as the other short 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.420
 I noticed differences then precisely 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.900
 since I liked it I bought it 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.990
 also the green if you want one 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.060
 eno switch I do it on the hand but that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.590
 maybe big enough so that you 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.590
 see the color a little better because 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:36.020
 I hope here is another product that 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.320
 I bought just recently is the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.119
 powder foundation of the well 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.429
 cost this here me as you know I use the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.740
 mineral foundation type of powder 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.350
 mineral tip mineral foundation use 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.470
 I had never experienced that of good 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.789
 so I decided to try also 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.340
 this brand 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.560
 I bought the light sand in the 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.750
 range of war mineral foundation on 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.310
 the clearest one and fortunately because 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.080
 was a certain whether to take this pur 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.700
 being fortunately that I have seen 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.120
 the live set because it 's great for me 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.970
 so better at least I haven't touched 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:20.810
 color and is a light products not 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.739
 it has a great opacity in fact second 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 me does not cover much I had made a 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.120
 video spoke of magical crises he had 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.030
 the same problem of being a lot 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.190
 light and in fact I saw that it is a lot 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.230
 well put on this climate cc 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.900
 putting if you have a c first too 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.690
 a bike that start a colored cream 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.660
 and put on this then it covers well 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.880
 alone, however, it is a slight effect 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.640
 cute the same in the sense that if you want 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.640
 ready an effect 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.790
 even now in the summer maybe only 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.100
 to uniform a little but you have so much 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.950
 to be covered can be the same one 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.670
 beautiful effect here I say just because 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.209
 however I found this thing with 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.190
 that fine impalpable powder is not 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.250
 a coarse powder like some 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.290
 mineral foundation spreads it fades 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.620
 easily I use kabuki also for 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.150
 this as for the others 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.310
 anyway, I like it as a product 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.110
 among other things it is cheap because it contains 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.130
 10 grams of product and I paid for it 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.330
 I think 4 euro 80 feel anyway 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.700
 can do well today I showed you the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.060
 my last two products well cost 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.100
 buy then i will update you when i do 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.100
 other purchases of this brand bye bye
