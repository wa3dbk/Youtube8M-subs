forward and backwards using pour them
back<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.690> combine<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.440> with<00:02:05.000> movement

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
back and then combine that with movement

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
like movement and then you just press

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.700 
like movement and then you just press
back<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.020> hit<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.230> little<00:02:16.560> middle

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
back so you can hit that little middle

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.580 
back so you can hit that little middle
jump<00:02:17.070> button<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.550> jump<00:02:17.790> up<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:19.050> it's<00:02:19.200> pretty

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
jump button to jump up and it's pretty

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
jump button to jump up and it's pretty
intuitive<00:02:20.040> once<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.550> get<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> hang<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
intuitive once you get the hang of it it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.580 
intuitive once you get the hang of it it
just<00:02:21.480> takes<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.750> little<00:02:21.870> getting<00:02:22.020> used<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
just takes a little getting used to that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.200 
just takes a little getting used to that
little<00:02:22.830> jump<00:02:23.190> button<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> middle<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.030> kind

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
little jump button in the middle is kind

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.120 
little jump button in the middle is kind
of<00:02:24.270> threw<00:02:24.480> me<00:02:24.630> off<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.320> guess<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.830> actually

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
of threw me off but I guess it actually

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.220 
of threw me off but I guess it actually
makes<00:02:26.340> sense<00:02:26.640> when<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.910> think<00:02:27.090> about<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.450> I'm

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
makes sense when you think about it I'm

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.690 
makes sense when you think about it I'm
sure<00:02:28.410> if<00:02:28.500> you'll<00:02:28.620> play<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.040> enough<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.580> would

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
sure if you'll play this enough I would

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.420 
sure if you'll play this enough I would
have<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> down<00:02:30.630> pat<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:31.530> no<00:02:31.650> problem<00:02:32.160> I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
have it down pat but no problem I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.850 
have it down pat but no problem I
already<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.450> down<00:02:33.570> pretty<00:02:33.780> well<00:02:33.900> so
