 the father the sun and the wind one is totally dried up the track when 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.540
 the elites prepare for the grid and a few shots of water jets have not 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.330
 enough dust the dirt the pressure is on an empty seat he has 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.869
 lost 25 points on his rival aranda 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 once again this turn but could say goodbye to his title of champion of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.169
 la France 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.810
 from the start as usual 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100
 10:25 and takes off in the lead 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.950
 in a few corners 8 and a gap almost 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.280
 it was decisive 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.290
 aranda shifted him to fifth place and will quickly overtake him 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.700
 davidas time he goes hunting in front of him again the two regional

 in the back disaster for nicolas aubin and fall in the first pass 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.170
 technically by 37 yen last so 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 then starts a mad comeback that banishes everything to tackle 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.940
 in one round Gregory Aranda resumed his position as dolphin behind this 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.020
 time but it has already taken ten seconds late 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.309
 it will have to align the chronos ordered ifop to catch up 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.800
 alas too southerly of the richier florent peloton also the attack this time 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.400
 in the fourth lap he is on the virtual podium 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.560
 paul has always been to the credit of thomas allier may be exhausted by his 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.359
 first run he creaked halfway 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.359
 downgraded to 5th position it will eventually finish the fact 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.990

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.000
 he must bow after an intense fight with expectations

 to the city in the last round and finish 6th and 5th and precede 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.130
 the title was definitely lost for the young driver 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.579
 this address 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.590
 before that it's been a long time since this era ensured victory 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:24.279
 with a mattress about fifteen seconds advanced digests 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:24.870
 quietly 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.870
 no this time no mechanical breakage 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.149
 the checkered flag 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:36.829
 that he was celebrating his fourth win of the season perhaps the most 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.829
 important that which falls 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:44.819
 but surely for so fast one of the first innings we 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.790
 really want young people need no less than 160 grams in the world that I 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:50.609
 I'm happy with him jean-luc de buman 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.609

 to the mechanical menu 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.779
 I think my project was in the lead every time 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:05.639
 even if it's part of the sport by 2012 health data afssaps the

 Red Cross 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.760
 the title will be played to equal a record here and davidas tendency to fight 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.029
 for third place 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:17.819

 the first the excess supply 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.880
 the cause is heard under the regime of former president albert zafy she herself
