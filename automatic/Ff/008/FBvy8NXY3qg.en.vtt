00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.970
 well this time we are going to make a 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.310
 comparison of two xperia one bought 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.790
 against the other bought with foreign currency 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.560
 in theory they are the same but with the great 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.360
 except that we realize that 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.940
 when you use he brings more things and more 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.410
 hardware plus accessories in this case that 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:33.020
 with telcel is not because they take things away 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.630
 in third because they do they put more 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.150
 to sell more we do not know yet 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.500
 then the team with telcel is 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.500
 showing the same equipment yes 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.550
 but let's see the accessories 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.360
 a usb cable the same 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 so 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.140
 the usb cable is the same is not right 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.690
 the connector that is the same the same 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.460
 come on let's see the main 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.210
 disadvantage 3rd 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.850
 in the third only comes with a 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 a single cover the current one with him in the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.740
 bottom part comes black and brings a 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.930
 white and the get rid of back 2 is 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.740
 white between black and yellow 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.740
 First 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.630
 and the most important point 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.300
 are the headsets of the center in this 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.370
 type of hearing aids and the truth seen in 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.850
 several a boxing in the channels of 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.130
 youtube that bring these same hearing aids 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.130
 the xperia 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 journeys 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.530
 as you can see it is very different and very 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.650
 similar to those that the file brings 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.000
 is the truth is more an injustice for 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.130
 say it little but 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.620
 good you do what you wanted 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.450
 demonstrate so that they would see that equally if 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.680
 they buy it in gods he may 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.480
 bring these hearing aids and more caps and if 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.530
 complement it is the one in these 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.830
 wines and only one tapa would be all after 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.690
 we will make a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.510
 a review of the equipment fund 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.299
 to this 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.299
 to be able to offer you better
