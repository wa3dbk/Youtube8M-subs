here

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
here

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.899 
here
you<00:03:53.810> want<00:03:54.349> to<00:03:54.439> keep<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.799> watch<00:03:55.159> out<00:03:55.459> on<00:03:55.760> the

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
you want to keep a watch out on the

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.509 
you want to keep a watch out on the
mango<00:03:56.239> when<00:03:56.389> it's<00:03:56.569> cooking<00:03:56.959> just<00:03:57.590> because<00:03:58.040> you

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
mango when it's cooking just because you

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.970 
mango when it's cooking just because you
won<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:58.879> slices<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.599> retain<00:04:00.199> the<00:04:00.469> form<00:04:00.769> and

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
won the slices to retain the form and

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.119 
won the slices to retain the form and
you<00:04:01.489> don't<00:04:01.730> want<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.419> to<00:04:02.810> become<00:04:03.019> too<00:04:03.620> soft

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
you don't want it to become too soft

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.369 
you don't want it to become too soft
because<00:04:04.939> otherwise<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.659> mangos<00:04:06.019> are<00:04:06.199> just

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
because otherwise the mangos are just

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.379 
because otherwise the mangos are just
going<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.650> become<00:04:06.769> like<00:04:07.129> a<00:04:07.189> pulp<00:04:07.549> and<00:04:07.909> you

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
going to become like a pulp and you

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.089 
going to become like a pulp and you
don't<00:04:08.599> want<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.230> want<00:04:09.469> to<00:04:09.739> be<00:04:09.859> able<00:04:09.949> to

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
don't want that you want to be able to

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.030 
don't want that you want to be able to
see<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:11.000> pieces<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.689> mango<00:04:12.049> so<00:04:12.650> we<00:04:12.799> just

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
see the pieces of the mango so we just

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.789 
see the pieces of the mango so we just
let<00:04:13.250> this<00:04:13.430> simmer<00:04:13.909> for<00:04:14.419> a<00:04:14.480> while<00:04:14.569> and<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
let this simmer for a while and in the

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.189 
let this simmer for a while and in the
meantime<00:04:16.070> we<00:04:16.820> will<00:04:16.940> get<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.359> next<00:04:17.389> step

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
meantime we will get to the next step

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.360 
meantime we will get to the next step
which<00:04:18.889> is<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.489> making<00:04:19.940> up<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.479> coconut<00:04:21.380> paste<00:04:21.739> so

keep this aside and we want to just take
a<00:05:02.620> look<00:05:02.920> at<00:05:03.220> our<00:05:04.200> mango<00:05:05.200> curry<00:05:05.440> it<00:05:06.160> just<00:05:06.520> needs

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
a look at our mango curry it just needs

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.960 
a look at our mango curry it just needs
a<00:05:07.240> little<00:05:07.780> bit<00:05:07.960> more<00:05:08.110> cooking<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:08.980> can<00:05:09.580> see<00:05:09.790> that

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
a little bit more cooking I can see that

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.450 
a little bit more cooking I can see that
the<00:05:10.210> mangoes<00:05:10.840> have<00:05:11.170> softened<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.920> little<00:05:12.310> bit

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
the ones that you get in the cans but

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.600 
the ones that you get in the cans but
make<00:05:46.450> sure<00:05:46.480> you<00:05:46.900> do<00:05:47.080> add<00:05:47.320> in<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.860> coriander

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
powder and the red chili powder to

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.140 
powder and the red chili powder to
substitute<00:05:52.450> for<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.900> ones<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.650> we<00:05:53.830> used

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
substitute for the ones that we used

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.180 
substitute for the ones that we used
with<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.300> fresh<00:05:55.510> coconut<00:05:55.810> so<00:05:56.620> this<00:05:56.890> seems

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
with the fresh coconut so this seems

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.440 
with the fresh coconut so this seems
great<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.880> am<00:05:58.030> just<00:05:58.450> going<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.900> add<00:05:59.140> brown<00:06:00.130> sugar

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
great I am just going to add brown sugar

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.980 
great I am just going to add brown sugar
what<00:06:01.450> this<00:06:01.690> will<00:06:01.900> do<00:06:02.140> is<00:06:03.000> balance<00:06:04.000> out<00:06:04.240> the

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
what this will do is balance out the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.340 
what this will do is balance out the
flavors<00:06:05.980> since<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.640> mangoes<00:06:07.030> are<00:06:07.330> quite<00:06:07.690> sour

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
flavors since the mangoes are quite sour

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.790 
flavors since the mangoes are quite sour
so<00:06:09.190> it<00:06:09.280> will<00:06:09.400> give<00:06:09.970> it<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.150> nice<00:06:10.300> sweet<00:06:10.720> and<00:06:10.960> sour

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
so it will give it a nice sweet and sour

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.380 
so it will give it a nice sweet and sour
flavor<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.600> add<00:06:13.600> in<00:06:14.080> some<00:06:14.110> salt<00:06:14.710> and<00:06:15.210> stir<00:06:16.210> it

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
flavor and add in some salt and stir it

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.510
