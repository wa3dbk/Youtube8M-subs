how<00:01:45.180> does<00:01:45.240> plague<00:01:45.810> affect<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.799> units<00:01:47.220> I'd

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
how does plague affect your units I'd

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.910 
how does plague affect your units I'd
imagine<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.509> would<00:01:48.780> make<00:01:49.049> them<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> lot<00:01:49.680> weaker

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.480 
imagine it would make them a lot weaker
and<00:01:50.450> obviously<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.780> units<00:01:52.200> numbers<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.340> be

and obviously your units numbers will be

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.300 
and obviously your units numbers will be
depleted<00:01:53.939> over<00:01:54.390> time<00:01:54.810> due<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> dying<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
depleted over time due to dying of the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.179 
depleted over time due to dying of the
plague<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.820> yeah<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> pretty<00:01:58.229> brutal<00:01:58.619> so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
plague and yeah it's pretty brutal so

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.760 
plague and yeah it's pretty brutal so
let's<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> look<00:01:59.790> at<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.479> card<00:02:01.079> itself

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
let's have a look at the card itself

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.630 
let's have a look at the card itself
that<00:02:02.490> shows<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.479> squalor<00:02:04.469> stat<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.040> proves

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that shows the squalor stat and proves

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
that shows the squalor stat and proves
that<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.240> Rome<00:02:06.630> -<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.229> basically<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that it's in Rome - and basically this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.029 
that it's in Rome - and basically this
is<00:02:08.009> an<00:02:08.280> upgrade<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.840> farm<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.950> an

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
is an upgrade for a farm it's as an

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.000 
is an upgrade for a farm it's as an
agricultural<00:02:11.849> minor<00:02:12.450> upgrade<00:02:13.200> called

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
agricultural minor upgrade called

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.949 
agricultural minor upgrade called
irrigation<00:02:14.370> ditches<00:02:14.879> and<00:02:15.360> I'm<00:02:15.510> sorry<00:02:15.659> if<00:02:15.840> this

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
irrigation ditches and I'm sorry if this

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.660 
irrigation ditches and I'm sorry if this
is<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> little<00:02:16.379> bit<00:02:16.500> pixelated<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:17.459> was

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
is a little bit pixelated it was

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.940 
is a little bit pixelated it was
pixelated<00:02:18.299> when<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.540> found<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.319> can't<00:02:19.769> really

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
pixelated when I found it I can't really

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.369 
pixelated when I found it I can't really
help<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.579> video<00:02:20.909> but<00:02:21.120> I'll<00:02:21.299> add<00:02:21.629> text

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
help it in the video but I'll add text

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.069 
help it in the video but I'll add text
next<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.040> make<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.489> clearer<00:02:23.819> and

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
next to it to make it clearer and

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.830 
next to it to make it clearer and
basically<00:02:25.079> it<00:02:25.500> says<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.069> will<00:02:26.189> give<00:02:26.510> -1<00:02:27.510> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
basically it says it will give -1 to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.839 
basically it says it will give -1 to
public<00:02:28.319> order<00:02:28.620> per<00:02:29.159> turn

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
public order per turn

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.990 
public order per turn
due<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.090> squalor<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.590> -1<00:02:32.310> public<00:02:32.700> order

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
due to squalor so that's -1 public order

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.080 
due to squalor so that's -1 public order
per<00:02:33.480> turn<00:02:33.989> but<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.709> positive<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.760> 8

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
per turn but the positive of it is 8

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.589 
per turn but the positive of it is 8
food<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:37.040> 50<00:02:38.040> wealth<00:02:38.280> from<00:02:38.579> agriculture<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
food and 50 wealth from agriculture and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.699 
food and 50 wealth from agriculture and
farms<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.590> +4<00:02:41.549> unit<00:02:42.239> replenishment<00:02:42.959> in<00:02:43.109> that

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
farms and +4 unit replenishment in that

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.280 
farms and +4 unit replenishment in that
area<00:02:44.159> so<00:02:44.939> it<00:02:45.359> also<00:02:45.540> means<00:02:45.930> we're<00:02:46.140> going<00:02:46.230> to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
area so it also means we're going to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.830 
area so it also means we're going to
have<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.709> take<00:02:46.920> into<00:02:47.190> consideration<00:02:47.840> whether

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
have to take into consideration whether

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.160 
have to take into consideration whether
it's<00:02:49.349> worth<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.180> benefits<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.659> 8<00:02:51.840> food

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
it's worth the benefits of the 8 food

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.710 
it's worth the benefits of the 8 food
which<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.859> assume<00:02:53.579> would<00:02:53.819> count<00:02:54.180> as<00:02:54.359> being<00:02:54.420> a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
which I assume would count as being a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.080 
which I assume would count as being a
lot<00:02:54.959> but<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.769> order<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.819> have<00:02:57.060> to

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
lot but in order to do that you have to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.949 
lot but in order to do that you have to
set<00:02:58.049> squalor<00:02:58.680> on<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.579> settlement<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.540> order

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
set squalor on that settlement in order

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.660 
set squalor on that settlement in order
to<00:03:01.139> achieve<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.680> which<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.549> these

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
to achieve it which is one of these

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.789 
to achieve it which is one of these
active<00:03:03.150> decisions<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.200> having<00:03:04.769> to

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
active decisions that I like having to

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.020 
active decisions that I like having to
pick<00:03:05.129> because<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.579> makes<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.849> more

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
pick because it makes it more

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.330 
pick because it makes it more
interesting<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.870> we'll<00:03:07.170> see<00:03:07.500> how<00:03:07.829> these

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
interesting and we'll see how these

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.610 
interesting and we'll see how these
decisions<00:03:08.790> impact<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.840> game<00:03:10.019> what<00:03:10.379> other

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
decisions impact the game what other

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.530 
decisions impact the game what other
effects<00:03:11.099> will<00:03:11.370> there<00:03:11.519> be<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.909> I'm<00:03:12.060> sure<00:03:12.329> that

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
effects will there be and I'm sure that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.140 
effects will there be and I'm sure that
there<00:03:12.690> will<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.840> buildings<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.709> are<00:03:14.150> counter

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
there will be buildings that are counter

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.479 
there will be buildings that are counter
actors<00:03:15.629> to<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.500> sort<00:03:16.889> of<00:03:16.920> thing<00:03:17.129> but<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.430> is

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
actors to this sort of thing but this is

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.220 
actors to this sort of thing but this is
one<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:17.970> features<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.720> was<00:03:18.870> talking

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
one of the features that I was talking

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.020 
one of the features that I was talking
to<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.500> about<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.859> previous<00:03:20.129> videos<00:03:20.400> where

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
to you about in previous videos where

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.360 
to you about in previous videos where
you<00:03:21.239> can<00:03:21.540> choose<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.900> completely<00:03:22.680> make<00:03:23.040> your

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
you can choose to completely make your

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.939 
you can choose to completely make your
city<00:03:23.669> however<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.540> want<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.079> be<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.590> this

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
city however you want it to be so this

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.189 
city however you want it to be so this
one<00:03:26.220> seems<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.669> be<00:03:26.790> an<00:03:26.970> agricultural<00:03:27.299> upgrade

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
one seems to be an agricultural upgrade

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.259 
one seems to be an agricultural upgrade
and<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.859> lots<00:03:29.129> of<00:03:29.250> agriculture<00:03:30.000> and

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
and if you have lots of agriculture and

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.050 
and if you have lots of agriculture and
you<00:03:30.900> know<00:03:31.319> it's<00:03:31.500> usually<00:03:31.889> a<00:03:31.919> lower<00:03:32.160> class<00:03:32.519> of

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
you know it's usually a lower class of

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.379 
you know it's usually a lower class of
people<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.840> work<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.829> farms<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.609> you're

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
people that work on the farms so you're

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.809 
people that work on the farms so you're
probably<00:03:36.720> going<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.109> see<00:03:37.319> squalor<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.980> thus

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
probably going to see squalor and thus

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.119 
probably going to see squalor and thus
if<00:03:39.389> you<00:03:39.780> don't<00:03:39.989> control<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.620> you'll<00:03:40.980> get

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
if you don't control it you'll get

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.009 
if you don't control it you'll get
plague<00:03:41.459> appearing<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.269> on<00:03:42.419> top<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.840> this

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
plague appearing and on top of this

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.369 
plague appearing and on top of this
we've<00:03:43.620> also<00:03:43.949> found<00:03:44.609> out<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:44.910> random<00:03:45.840> events

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
we've also found out that random events

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.309 
we've also found out that random events
will<00:03:46.560> happen<00:03:46.799> during<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.669> campaign

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
will happen during the campaign
