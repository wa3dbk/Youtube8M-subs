house my dad did nothing to help he had

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.129 
house my dad did nothing to help he had
in<00:01:55.520> fact<00:01:55.669> helped<00:01:55.939> me<00:01:56.060> pack<00:01:56.299> so<00:01:56.630> my<00:01:56.779> dad<00:01:56.959> and<00:01:56.990> I

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
in fact helped me pack so my dad and I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:58.690 
in fact helped me pack so my dad and I
had<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.349> very<00:01:57.499> touchy<00:01:57.829> relationship<00:01:58.520> for<00:01:58.669> quite

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
had a very touchy relationship for quite

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.760 
had a very touchy relationship for quite
a<00:01:58.849> while<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.270> see<00:01:59.840> him<00:01:59.959> now<00:02:00.109> but<00:02:00.349> it's<00:02:00.499> still<00:02:00.619> a

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
a while I see him now but it's still a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.529 
a while I see him now but it's still a
love-hate<00:02:01.130> relationship<00:02:01.639> because<00:02:02.389> I<00:02:02.419> think

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
love-hate relationship because I think

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.800 
love-hate relationship because I think
he<00:02:02.869> should<00:02:03.049> have<00:02:03.139> stood<00:02:03.289> up<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:03.439> us<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.810> so

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
he should have stood up for us and so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.490 
he should have stood up for us and so
when<00:02:05.959> I<00:02:06.020> left<00:02:06.169> home<00:02:06.469> of<00:02:07.159> course<00:02:07.489> I<00:02:07.989> made<00:02:08.989> sure<00:02:09.259> I

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
when I left home of course I made sure I

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.350 
when I left home of course I made sure I
didn't<00:02:09.770> go<00:02:09.860> without<00:02:10.039> food<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:11.209> only

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
didn't go without food and it's only

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.930 
didn't go without food and it's only
since<00:02:11.630> starting<00:02:11.989> easy<00:02:12.140> loss<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.700> see

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
since starting easy loss that I can see

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.540 
since starting easy loss that I can see
that's<00:02:14.209> where<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> problem<00:02:14.780> was<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.520> I

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that's where the problem was and so I

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.010 
that's where the problem was and so I
would<00:02:16.880> always<00:02:17.030> want<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.510> biggest<00:02:17.780> portion

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
would always want the biggest portion

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.500 
would always want the biggest portion
the<00:02:18.860> biggest<00:02:19.160> bit<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.790> extra<00:02:20.360> bit<00:02:20.480> of

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
the biggest bit of this and extra bit of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.750 
the biggest bit of this and extra bit of
that<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:21.200> even<00:02:21.950> though<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.130> knew<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:22.490> would

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
that because even though I knew I would

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.860 
that because even though I knew I would
never<00:02:22.940> be<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.330> situation

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
never be in that situation

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.600 
never be in that situation
and<00:02:23.959> again<00:02:24.200> that's<00:02:24.860> obviously<00:02:25.340> how<00:02:25.459> it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
and again that's obviously how it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.420 
and again that's obviously how it
affected<00:02:26.030> me<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.629> so<00:02:27.379> I<00:02:27.409> tried<00:02:27.739> losing<00:02:28.280> weight

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
affected me and so I tried losing weight

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.460 
affected me and so I tried losing weight
twice<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.120> went<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.360> Weight<00:02:29.510> Watchers<00:02:29.540> once<00:02:30.110> I

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
twice I went to Weight Watchers once I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.550 
twice I went to Weight Watchers once I
was<00:02:31.010> quite<00:02:31.220> young<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.700> my<00:02:31.790> twenties<00:02:32.560> probably

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
only about 14 stone at the time not

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.990 
only about 14 stone at the time not
hugely<00:02:36.170> overweight<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.519> they<00:02:37.640> said<00:02:37.790> all<00:02:37.879> you

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
the recollection to being restricted to

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.319 
the recollection to being restricted to
food<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.230> restricting<00:02:51.920> me<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.190> food<00:02:52.400> puts<00:02:53.209> me

food and restricting me and food puts me

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.039 
food and restricting me and food puts me
in<00:02:53.390> bad<00:02:53.540> places

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
in bad places

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.319 
in bad places
the<00:02:54.560> thing<00:02:54.709> with<00:02:54.829> easy<00:02:54.980> losses<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.489> it's<00:02:56.180> not

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
the thing with easy losses that it's not

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.750 
the thing with easy losses that it's not
restricted<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:58.040> find<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.459> can<00:02:58.609> have

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
restricted and I find that I can have

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.309 
restricted and I find that I can have
whatever<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.090> want<00:02:59.329> and<00:02:59.450> like<00:02:59.780> sue<00:02:59.959> says<00:03:00.140> you

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
whatever I want and like sue says you

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.869 
whatever I want and like sue says you
find<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.890> don't<00:03:01.010> want<00:03:01.340> those<00:03:01.549> things

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
find that you don't want those things

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.930 
find that you don't want those things
that<00:03:02.829> you<00:03:03.829> know<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.519> would<00:03:04.609> have<00:03:04.730> probably

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
that you know you would have probably

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.910 
that you know you would have probably
craved<00:03:05.359> before<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> became<00:03:06.019> a<00:03:06.079> comfort<00:03:06.470> eater<00:03:06.620> I

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
craved before I became a comfort eater I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.000 
craved before I became a comfort eater I
