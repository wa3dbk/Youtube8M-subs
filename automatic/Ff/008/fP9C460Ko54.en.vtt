worry about that as you would with a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.540 
worry about that as you would with a
headlight<00:02:38.959> that<00:02:39.200> doesn't<00:02:39.620> come<00:02:39.980> factory<00:02:40.430> with

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
headlight that doesn't come factory with

headlight that doesn't come factory with
the<00:02:40.670> projector<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:43.239> that's<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.540> hope<00:02:44.810> you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930
