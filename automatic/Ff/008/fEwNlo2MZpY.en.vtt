00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:10.170
 Hi Hi today let's try tasting this very rare wine here 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.849
 I think the wine of the Jura region of France 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 Although the Jura is I think the kana are not very familiar 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.320
 It is located near the Swiss public 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.110
 Flags of Buruponu Dosuisu 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:30.200
 Under the Jura 300, which is between the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:34.360
 The wine region is called Jura 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.360
 Today's wine is there 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.100
 I try to taste the lost 100% made of 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.260
 Do you see it so yellow ? 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.260
 It is already shining in gold 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.620
 I smell a little during the fermentation 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:07.400
 It is a kind of smell that you really like a cheese 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:12.710
 It is not a refreshing scent, but there are some facts 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:16.190
 Rather than say the acidity also like something squeezed even this of the lemon 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.180
 It smells of peeled skin 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.830
 It also smells of herbs that have a slight bitter taste 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.830
 Fleas Nenanu 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.620
 The scent of that mirror is this 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.640
 Medium rural it was named to say that I'm You're So in this is made by an incision was made 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.730
 But 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:43.070
 Distress most was the calcareous because its 100 million 5000 years ago Jurassic strata 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:45.440
 I'm So now has named this Ju da 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.340
 What's so bad 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.479
 Be real 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.479
 I smell of play 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 The acidity is very strong 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.280
 It has a strong acidity, but it loses second place. 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.740
 Amami comes out later 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.320
 2 then 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.310
 Well there is so much I thought I Na whether this rise is strong, but there is in fact this 14% 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.620
 not to mention 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.730
 I know when I've made a plus again this way, but in this rape backward very much 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.920
 You're fancy 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:41.950
 Though the sound is still in the mouth, alcohol is spreading pacorner 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:48.230
 Uh-Hot hot feeling is spreading in my mouth 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:53.840
 The taste of alcohol comes out of the body, but it is good 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:58.700
 It is a taste that original rich and rich in extract 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:05.110
 I say it very unique Well unfamiliar This juran fear Itteyuu 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.110
 And had made the do it but in fact very rare wine there is no 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.700
 It wine is made of one double bran but to also Tteyuu that version 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:19.290
 It means the meaning of yellow vine to France 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.800
 Well but I do this not cut very well before more yellow wine than this is made 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.770
 I will 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.900
 It's a wine made from nature 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.890
 To say whether has made its y I I've forgotten the person who made Eve say with nature 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.970
 And but it stayed all 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:42.270
 I kept it aged in the barrel for a long time 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:48.150
 And if you try to drink it , it means that the taste like sherry came. 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:51.910
 Then the edition manager came to be opened and made 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.710
 The law is bad if you don't go to bed 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:00.650
 It is supposed to be a bad thing 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.260
 And the other is called 1 de Paille and this is in French 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.610
 Tadano it's a thing called double 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:13.549
 In you keep on top of it the straw and we have gained Bloom 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:15.170
 And let it dry and make it like raisin, but that raisin 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:20.030
 It became like a grape 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.049
 I will make wine using the blue So Sunbok delicious that dessert Mine 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.250
 There is a 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:29.460
 Well at the time I went to France 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.529
 Also not be able to enter the hand while quite disappointing in Japan but I drank two of which 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.189
 Hmm 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:38.329
 Well here is also a very rare y 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:43.219
 First of all the size of this bottle is 500mm 

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:46.040
 Really than half of the bottle is smaller than the usual bottle 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:51.740
 It is a little big size 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:57.200
 As I mentioned earlier, the size of the inside is 620ml 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.060
 The size is a bit odd, but this 620 says where it came from 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.470
 Masu and its 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:08.889
 One liter of wine is eroded after 6 years 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:12.909
 Size This means that the size is about 620 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:20.249
 Well today I also introduced a really unusual Wai 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:20.249
 If you find this wine at the store, please buy and try it
