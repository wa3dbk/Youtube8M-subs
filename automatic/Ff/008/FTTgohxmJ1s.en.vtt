00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.650 
resurgence with the new model Mustangs
and<00:01:57.950> there's<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.369> new<00:01:58.550> camaro<00:01:58.910> on<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.240> way<00:01:59.360> and

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
and there's a new camaro on the way and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.170 
and there's a new camaro on the way and
the<00:02:00.080> challenges<00:02:00.590> which<00:02:00.830> has<00:02:01.070> given<00:02:01.880> us<00:02:02.030> all<00:02:02.119> a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
the challenges which has given us all a

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.460 
the challenges which has given us all a
little<00:02:02.330> bit<00:02:02.570> of<00:02:02.660> a<00:02:02.750> nut<00:02:02.930> for<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.200> couple<00:02:03.440> of

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
little bit of a nut for a couple of

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.430 
little bit of a nut for a couple of
years<00:02:04.210> sadly<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.240> don't<00:02:05.360> think<00:02:05.570> that'll<00:02:05.960> last<00:02:06.140> I

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
years sadly I don't think that'll last I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.560 
years sadly I don't think that'll last I
think<00:02:06.649> that'll<00:02:06.890> go<00:02:07.119> traction<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.300> biggest

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
think that'll go traction is the biggest

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.540 
think that'll go traction is the biggest
issue<00:02:08.660> with<00:02:08.899> these<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.259> course<00:02:09.429> they<00:02:10.429> don't

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
issue with these of course they don't

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.160 
issue with these of course they don't
have<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.850> ability<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.870> know<00:02:11.930> they<00:02:12.110> don't

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
have the ability to you know they don't

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.610 
have the ability to you know they don't
have<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.500> traction<00:02:12.860> control<00:02:12.890> side<00:02:13.489> of<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.730> so

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
have the traction control side of it so

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.870 
have the traction control side of it so
you're<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.739> still<00:02:16.220> wheel<00:02:16.430> spinning<00:02:16.670> in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
you're just still wheel spinning in

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.180 
you're just still wheel spinning in
second<00:02:17.180> gear<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.739> much<00:02:18.890> weight

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
second gear and just so much weight

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.610 
second gear and just so much weight
takes<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.730> while<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.000> get<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.209> momentum<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.959> was

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
takes a while to get the momentum I was

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.370 
takes a while to get the momentum I was
soon<00:02:21.769> in<00:02:21.890> my<00:02:21.920> part<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.670> think<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.870> kind<00:02:24.230> of

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
soon in my part I think that kind of

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.440 
soon in my part I think that kind of
brings<00:02:24.799> out<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.130> bogan<00:02:25.489> most<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.940> us<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:26.209> I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
brings out the bogan most of us like I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.800 
brings out the bogan most of us like I
guess<00:02:27.790> there's<00:02:28.790> taught<00:02:28.970> guys<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.540> Chevy

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
guess there's taught guys this Chevy

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.140 
guess there's taught guys this Chevy
guys<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.290> there's<00:02:30.440> no<00:02:30.680> power<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:31.970> having

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
guys and there's no power I just having

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.120 
guys and there's no power I just having
