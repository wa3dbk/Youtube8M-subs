00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.670

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.590
 Now a farmer in Thuringia has that 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.830
 you can join business model 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.840
 Feel free to pay yourself for food 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.970
 the animal is ready for slaughter and then can 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.860
 you get over excellent organic meat 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.630
 looking forward 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.550
 unusual but obviously a model 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.520
 more and more customers are coming with us in the future 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.800
 at least on the taste rainer 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.170
 Behnke from Erfurt just got a cow 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.730
 He enjoys the offer of farmer 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.829
 ringo liebau from Thuringia 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.600
 gierstÃ¤dt accepted and seems over 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.780
 the decision pretty happy too 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.780
 his 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.950
 It is overwhelming to say so it is 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.750
 one has a strange feeling now 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.670
 so the feeling you have your own 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.830
 you can not stop him in the butcher 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 and bought some goods there 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.439
 but I know that's mine now 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.720
 can not wait that the 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.299
 is grown and yes I'm glad 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.070
 it is 28 years old 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.350
 important to know where the meat came from 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.000
 comes that he consumes with the help of 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.429
 farmer he has an animal 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.109
 chosen and the formalities clarified 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.659
 You are now waiting for a one-time price 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:28.609
 pay 5 535 euros and then every month 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.920
 107 euro that is a year if you for 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.549
 the carers with the repayment of 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.189
 535 euro is the animal in principle to them 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.600
 Total costs for less 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.030
 from around 3000 euros 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.969
 For that he receives in a few months if 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.520
 the animal is fully grown 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.479
 250 kilograms of meat vacuum packed for 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.869
 the freezer 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.459
 that's too much for some 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.829
 the farmer also offers so-called 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.740
 cattle sharing so cattle sharing 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.869
 Five customer interest in share 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.689
 rather the meat of an animal by 5 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.499
 this reduces mass and costs 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.539
 for the customers 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:09.289
 the people at the sneeze now 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.000
 can not be registered and say 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.440
 are turn on it in our hands 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.240
 the stall can see a child like 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.099
 sees it in the position as what for 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.340
 Food is a bot on the spot 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.349
 hay is also stored that the cattle 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.420
 rare breed resinous red 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.850
 eating livestock is from the fields 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.500
 of the farmer 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.420
 then the meat quality is already one 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.890
 quite different than when you say the teams 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.980
 I once have something in the press tv 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.390
 print is where every day corn silage is 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.300
 is introduced and the animal inside 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.160
 This is measured from a very short time 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.290
 You will see customers at the latest 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.090
 with if the piece of meat in the village one 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.770
 lies and they have a big one before 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.960
 had and when it is ready 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.100
 it danes half the size of the the 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.860
 They have a fiasco here 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.300
 of course not more with the meat 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.350
 farmer Liebau the natural feel 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.990
 very connected 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.910
 The trained vehicle painter hopes that he 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.650
 with the cattle leasing also sometime 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.630
 to feed his family 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.370
 since birth i am with her and haid 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.020
 grew up and have the well experienced 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.240
 so's turn 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.130
 agriculture or to the animals too 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.930
 so enormous I have that of mine 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.190
 I have grandparents from my parents 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.090
 but that's less so in the cradle 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.060
 get laid 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.620
 The new cattle owners need benches now 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.620
 actually only one thing to clarify 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.700
 hat that was from us from the
