little<00:04:13.630> harsh<00:04:13.960> on<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:15.820> breakfast<00:04:16.209> menu<00:04:16.239> at

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
little harsh on the breakfast menu at

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.380 
little harsh on the breakfast menu at
Taco<00:04:16.959> Bell<00:04:17.260> but<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.890> think<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:18.640> lot<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.150> has<00:04:19.360> to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
Taco Bell but I think a lot of it has to

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.260 
Taco Bell but I think a lot of it has to
do<00:04:19.720> with<00:04:20.130> what<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.160> order<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.970> how<00:04:22.120> its

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
do with what you order and how its

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.340 
do with what you order and how its
prepared<00:04:23.640> for<00:04:24.640> instance<00:04:25.860> this<00:04:26.860> waffle<00:04:27.460> is

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
prepared for instance this waffle is

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.140 
prepared for instance this waffle is
everything<00:04:29.350> in<00:04:29.470> here<00:04:29.710> is<00:04:29.740> like<00:04:30.150> freaking

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
everything in here is like freaking

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.410 
everything in here is like freaking
fresh<00:04:32.020> off<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.440> griddle<00:04:32.710> or<00:04:32.890> whatever

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
fresh off the griddle or whatever

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.150 
fresh off the griddle or whatever
actually<00:04:34.420> it's<00:04:34.510> probably<00:04:34.600> frozen<00:04:35.050> but<00:04:35.470> it's

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
actually it's probably frozen but it's

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.870 
actually it's probably frozen but it's
hot<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.760> if<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.840> can<00:04:38.200> just<00:04:38.350> taste<00:04:38.620> that<00:04:38.880> clip

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
hot and if I can just taste that clip

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.780 
hot and if I can just taste that clip
being<00:04:39.910> hot<00:04:40.420> is<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:41.560> major<00:04:41.860> component<00:04:42.130> to<00:04:42.640> its

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
being hot is a major component to its

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.770 
being hot is a major component to its
flavor<00:04:43.090> enjoyment<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:45.790> I'm<00:04:46.060> going<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.420> try<00:04:46.750> it

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
flavor enjoyment so I'm going to try it

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.910 
flavor enjoyment so I'm going to try it
with<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.140> syrup<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.600> see<00:04:49.600> how<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.410> affects

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
with the syrup and see how that affects

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.150 
with the syrup and see how that affects
the<00:04:51.010> flavor<00:04:55.020> because<00:04:56.020> it<00:04:56.380> is<00:04:56.530> made<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.830> eat

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
the flavor because it is made to eat

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:17.710 
the flavor because it is made to eat
with<00:04:57.430> syrup<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:58.000> guess<00:04:58.450> so

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.570 

the<00:05:18.720> syrup<00:05:19.110> is<00:05:19.290> probably<00:05:20.040> the<00:05:20.250> missing

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
the syrup is probably the missing

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.060 
the syrup is probably the missing
component<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.840> helps<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.500> complete<00:05:22.890> the

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
component it helps to complete the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.450 
component it helps to complete the
overall<00:05:23.430> experience<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:28.350> sweetness<00:05:28.920> maple

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
overall experience the sweetness maple

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.260 
overall experience the sweetness maple
eNOS<00:05:29.790> of<00:05:29.970> it<00:05:31.160> fills<00:05:32.160> in<00:05:32.340> a<00:05:32.370> lot<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.790> gaps<00:05:33.030> in

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
eNOS of it fills in a lot of the gaps in

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.100 
eNOS of it fills in a lot of the gaps in
the<00:05:33.390> flavor<00:05:33.630> profile<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:39.360> eggs<00:05:39.600> are<00:05:39.900> a<00:05:39.930> little

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
the flavor profile the eggs are a little

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.630 
the flavor profile the eggs are a little
bland<00:05:40.470> I<00:05:42.800> feel<00:05:43.800> like<00:05:43.920> it<00:05:44.100> just<00:05:44.130> needs<00:05:44.490> a<00:05:44.610> little

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
bland I feel like it just needs a little

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.540 
bland I feel like it just needs a little
more<00:05:44.940> seasoning<00:05:45.210> perhaps<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.260> little<00:05:47.190> salt

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
more seasoning perhaps a little salt

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.080 
more seasoning perhaps a little salt
pepper<00:05:47.850> maybe<00:05:48.650> but<00:05:49.650> overall<00:05:50.040> it's<00:05:50.520> a<00:05:50.790> it's

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
pepper maybe but overall it's a it's

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.440 
pepper maybe but overall it's a it's
acceptable<00:05:51.810> I<00:05:52.310> would<00:05:53.310> eat<00:05:53.460> overall<00:05:54.150> it

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
acceptable I would eat overall it

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.610 
acceptable I would eat overall it
reminds<00:05:54.990> me<00:05:55.140> of<00:05:55.380> a<00:05:56.780> slightly<00:05:57.780> less<00:05:58.140> enjoyable

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
reminds me of a slightly less enjoyable

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.000 
reminds me of a slightly less enjoyable
a<00:05:59.390> mcgriddle<00:06:00.390> sandwich<00:06:01.200> from<00:06:01.410> mcdonalds<00:06:02.040> I

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
a mcgriddle sandwich from mcdonalds I

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.960 
a mcgriddle sandwich from mcdonalds I
think<00:06:05.010> you're<00:06:05.100> better<00:06:05.250> off<00:06:05.370> going<00:06:05.670> with<00:06:05.940> that

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
think you're better off going with that

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.420 
think you're better off going with that
as<00:06:06.300> an<00:06:06.510> option<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:07.080> mean<00:06:07.290> it's<00:06:07.470> fun<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.830> try<00:06:08.100> just

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
as an option I mean it's fun to try just

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.860 
as an option I mean it's fun to try just
for<00:06:08.460> something<00:06:08.760> a<00:06:08.940> little<00:06:09.000> different<00:06:09.390> it's<00:06:09.780> a

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
for something a little different it's a

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.730 
for something a little different it's a
decent<00:06:10.230> concept<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:10.890> all<00:06:11.010> but<00:06:11.280> I<00:06:12.140> feel<00:06:13.140> aside

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
decent concept and all but I feel aside

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.090 
decent concept and all but I feel aside
