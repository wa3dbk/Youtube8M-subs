00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.320 
in Hamburg broke the top ten and then
eventually<00:03:35.160> won<00:03:35.489> Wimbledon<00:03:35.670> for<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> first

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
eventually won Wimbledon for the first

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.240 
eventually won Wimbledon for the first
time<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.810> think<00:03:37.050> those<00:03:37.620> are<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.830> moments

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
time and I think those are the moments

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.680 
time and I think those are the moments
which<00:03:38.430> are<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.850> big<00:03:39.000> breakthroughs<00:03:39.450> for<00:03:39.600> me

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
which are the big breakthroughs for me

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.570 
which are the big breakthroughs for me
are<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.290> things<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:40.800> not<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.250> good<00:03:41.519> to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
are the things that it's not so good to

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.820 
are the things that it's not so good to
be<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:42.120> your<00:03:42.390> position<00:03:42.900> what<00:03:43.230> what's<00:03:43.620> tough

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
be in your position what what's tough

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.620 
be in your position what what's tough
about

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
about

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.020 
about
I<00:03:44.800> think<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:45.920> know<00:03:46.040> being<00:03:46.310> away<00:03:46.520> from<00:03:46.850> home

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
I think you know being away from home

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.900 
I think you know being away from home
all<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.420> time<00:03:47.950> sometimes<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.370> would<00:03:49.520> like<00:03:49.670> to

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
all the time sometimes I would like to

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.420 
all the time sometimes I would like to
hide<00:03:50.810> under<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.230> radar<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.800> know<00:03:51.920> not<00:03:52.160> having

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
hide under the radar you know not having

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.800 
hide under the radar you know not having
to<00:03:52.640> be<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:52.820> alignment<00:03:53.000> all<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.450> time<00:03:53.660> even

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
to be in alignment all the time even

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.380 
to be in alignment all the time even
though<00:03:53.960> I<00:03:54.020> like<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.410> be<00:03:55.090> something<00:03:56.090> obviously

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
though I like to be something obviously

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.180 
though I like to be something obviously
it<00:03:56.540> just<00:03:56.720> gets<00:03:56.900> too<00:03:57.080> much<00:03:57.110> just<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.710> traveling

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
it just gets too much just to traveling

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.950 
it just gets too much just to traveling
I<00:03:58.340> love<00:03:58.640> it<00:03:58.790> but<00:03:59.000> at<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.300> same<00:03:59.330> time<00:03:59.720> it's<00:03:59.900> just

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
I love it but at the same time it's just

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.170 
I love it but at the same time it's just
at<00:04:00.320> times<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.740> gets<00:04:00.770> too<00:04:01.040> much<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.550> but<00:04:01.730> I
