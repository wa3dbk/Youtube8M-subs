give a family when they're preparing for

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.840 
give a family when they're preparing for
a<00:00:58.390> visit<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.750> a<00:00:58.780> school<00:00:59.079> is<00:00:59.320> to<00:00:59.850> really

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
a visit to a school is to really

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.360 
a visit to a school is to really
research<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.809> school<00:01:02.020> on<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.200> website<00:01:02.590> talk

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
research the school on the website talk

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.609 
research the school on the website talk
to<00:01:03.520> anyone<00:01:03.820> they<00:01:03.969> know<00:01:04.000> who<00:01:04.719> is<00:01:05.320> affiliated

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
to anyone they know who is affiliated

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.760 
to anyone they know who is affiliated
with<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.280> school<00:01:07.109> so<00:01:08.109> that<00:01:08.229> they<00:01:08.350> can<00:01:08.499> prepare

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
with the school so that they can prepare

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.489 
with the school so that they can prepare
themselves<00:01:08.950> for<00:01:09.189> questions<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
themselves for questions and for the

student I think it's important that they
just<00:01:13.420> relax<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.229> feel<00:01:14.950> comfortable<00:01:15.459> being

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
themselves and to know that anyone

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.859 
themselves and to know that anyone
interviewing<00:01:18.999> them<00:01:19.149> is<00:01:19.270> only<00:01:19.389> going<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.719> ask

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
interviewing them is only going to ask

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.590 
interviewing them is only going to ask
them<00:01:20.079> questions<00:01:20.429> related<00:01:21.429> to<00:01:21.459> who<00:01:22.389> they<00:01:22.569> are
