00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Good thing is thiago I saw on the internet that 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.080
 There are a lot of people killing themselves to try. 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.509
 install that payne 2 din which is a must 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
 of virtually a multimedia center 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.740
 she does not have all the commands one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.900
 media center can speak more 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.210
 a multimedia center that happens 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.330
 when you install it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.269
 or these cars it comes with the command of 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.039
 you turn the key and automatically 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.849
 after about 30 seconds the car 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 turns off 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.739
 only in case of three here when 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.680
 you turn the key it's not turning off 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.730
 and what happens to these new sounds of 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 I'll tell you that, until one day, they too. 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 come many of them come no more than the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.140
 power button turns off 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.579
 then you will say key beauty you think 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.809
 which is off but not really 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.000
 It's off 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.879
 Is your DVD connected? Is it consuming? 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.550
 battery power in many cases up to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.120
 the javi of people staying on the street for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.400
 It 's the delicate dz I made here 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.200
 very practical that people are killing themselves in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.439
 Yes, I ended up talking about it, so baked. 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.540
 because the car turns off the display I do not know 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.070
 tell on the display and there is everything he 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.689
 You think it 's turned on but it's not turned off 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060
 really because I'm going to give an example 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.100
 for you 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.830
 the playoffs but if you click here 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.560
 the display automatically switches on 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.920
 I did here on the red thread that the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.150
 that comes out of the car 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.680
 key 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.369
 I made a league club and then hung up 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.439
 the screen that the connection said I do not want 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.229
 say anything just want to show 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.140
 you here are a little you only 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.619
 bridge does not need to deal positively 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.939
 Nothing, you come with this rubber band. 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.030
 of wire 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.399
 you call so much 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 turn on and off backwards because 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.540
 his job here is just to cut the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.950
 current so it does not come from repulsion 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.610
 so look here button I hung up 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.280
 and I want energy 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 I'll call you back to normal, it's just you. 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.250
 to fit in 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.930
 I'll stretch this thread to make a 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.459
 extension to try to put it in the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.360
 panel will not get a thing too much 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.459
 beautiful, right? 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.930
 but at least you have the option there said 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.660
 the car is off you want 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.569
 hear a sound a beat in front of the bar 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.840
 Wherever you are there, you feel at ease. 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.840
 turn on
