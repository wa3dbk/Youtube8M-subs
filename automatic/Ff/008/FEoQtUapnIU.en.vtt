hey guys and welcome to part 3 of my
furious<00:00:02.760> fists<00:00:03.149> booster<00:00:03.570> box<00:00:03.780> opening<00:00:03.959> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
furious fists booster box opening the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.039 
furious fists booster box opening the
first<00:00:05.250> two<00:00:05.400> parts<00:00:05.640> were<00:00:05.910> pretty<00:00:06.210> much<00:00:06.359> duds<00:00:06.720> so

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
first two parts were pretty much duds so

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.500 
first two parts were pretty much duds so
I'm<00:00:07.140> expecting<00:00:07.440> part<00:00:07.859> 3<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.280> 4<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.880> be<00:00:09.210> pretty

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
I'm expecting part 3 and 4 to be pretty

I'm expecting part 3 and 4 to be pretty
awesome

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
awesome

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.629 
awesome
unless<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.559> booster<00:00:10.800> box<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.130> sucks<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.550> it

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
unless the booster box just sucks but it

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.089 
unless the booster box just sucks but it
probably<00:00:11.790> doesn't<00:00:12.240> well<00:00:12.960> maybe<00:00:13.139> well<00:00:13.980> then

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
probably doesn't well maybe well then

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.740 
probably doesn't well maybe well then

hawlucha once again I think I already
have<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.670> surprisingly<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> lot<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
have this surprisingly I have a lot of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600 
have this surprisingly I have a lot of
these<00:01:04.019> holographics<00:01:04.589> already<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.580> still

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
these holographics already but still

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.600 
these holographics already but still
cool<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.330> our<00:01:06.720> fourth<00:01:06.960> holographic<00:01:07.610> set

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
cool to get our fourth holographic set

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.530 
cool to get our fourth holographic set
them<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.729> back<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> rest<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
them right back there with the rest of

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.140 
them right back there with the rest of
them<00:01:10.280> funny<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
them funny that we actually get the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.359 
them funny that we actually get the
holographic<00:01:12.869> hawlucha<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.740> hollow<00:01:13.920> attack

holographic hawlucha in a hollow attack

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.340 
holographic hawlucha in a hollow attack
I'm<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> hoping<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.840> don't<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I'm kind of hoping we don't get a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.440 
I'm kind of hoping we don't get a
hallelujah<00:01:16.619> e^x<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:17.610> one<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> our<00:01:17.939> exes

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
hallelujah e^x as one of our exes

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
hallelujah e^x as one of our exes
because<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> those

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
because I think I have two of those

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640 
because I think I have two of those
already<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> would<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.350> he's<00:01:22.500> not

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
already so I would I don't know he's not

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
already so I would I don't know he's not
particularly<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.280> card<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> have

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I'll go ahead and give a close up I have

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.170 
I'll go ahead and give a close up I have
showed<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.710> off<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.040> videos<00:02:02.310> before<00:02:02.460> because

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
showed this off in videos before because

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.450 
showed this off in videos before because
I<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.540> two<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> these<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.430> case

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
I do have two of these but just in case

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.410 
I do have two of these but just in case
did<00:02:05.700> anyone<00:02:05.880> seeing<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.360> first

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
did anyone seeing this for the first

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
did anyone seeing this for the first
time<00:02:06.659> there's<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> close<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.590> pretty<00:02:08.160> cool

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
time there's the close up pretty cool

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.180

well so that's our first DX from the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
getting started with this part keep

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.300 
getting started with this part keep
going<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:10.170> probably<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.620> probably<00:03:11.740> should<00:03:12.280> have

going I probably I probably should have

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.770

had<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> Plusle<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.210> minun<00:03:13.360> count

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
had like a Plusle and minun count

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.240 
had like a Plusle and minun count
because<00:03:13.990> there's<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.290> many<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:14.770> think<00:03:15.070> that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
because there's so many but I think that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.440 
because there's so many but I think that
we<00:03:15.340> tapped<00:03:15.580> through<00:03:15.790> most<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.090> them<00:03:16.210> in<00:03:16.390> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
we tapped through most of them in the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.000 
we tapped through most of them in the
first<00:03:16.600> couple<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:17.050> parts<00:03:17.260> they've<00:03:17.740> got<00:03:17.920> to

Torchic<00:03:30.420> Pancham<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.990> reverse<00:03:32.290> holographic

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
Torchic Pancham the reverse holographic

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.040 
Torchic Pancham the reverse holographic
is<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> different<00:03:33.700> Pancham<00:03:34.150> oops<00:03:34.390> just<00:03:34.810> picked

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
is a different Pancham oops just picked

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.540 
is a different Pancham oops just picked
up<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.230> Torchic<00:03:35.560> there<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:36.130> can<00:03:36.280> see<00:03:36.370> there's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
up the Torchic there you can see there's

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.100 
up the Torchic there you can see there's
actually<00:03:36.640> two<00:03:36.970> different<00:03:37.000> Pancham<00:03:37.660> parts<00:03:37.900> in

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
actually two different Pancham parts in

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.580 
actually two different Pancham parts in
this<00:03:38.230> particular<00:03:38.500> set<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.580> last<00:03:39.880> card<00:03:40.209> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
this particular set and the last card is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.300 
this particular set and the last card is
and<00:03:41.820> aurorus<00:03:42.850> once<00:03:43.300> again<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.990> non<00:03:44.470> holographic

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
and aurorus once again a non holographic

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.520 
and aurorus once again a non holographic
rare<00:03:45.610> Wow

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
rare Wow

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.690 
rare Wow
okay<00:03:47.530> so<00:03:47.590> we're<00:03:47.950> definitely<00:03:48.160> going<00:03:48.520> through

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
okay so we're definitely going through

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.430 
okay so we're definitely going through
all<00:03:48.790> those<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.030> think<00:03:49.060> the<00:03:49.390> last<00:03:49.570> video<00:03:49.870> either

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
all those I think the last video either

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.110 
all those I think the last video either
of<00:03:50.590> these<00:03:50.680> last<00:03:50.980> five<00:03:51.250> facts<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:51.820> video

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
of these last five facts of this video

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.640 
of these last five facts of this video
or<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.450> last<00:03:52.690> part<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.020> booster<00:03:53.350> box<00:03:53.500> is

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
or the last part of the booster box is

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.680 
or the last part of the booster box is
gonna<00:03:53.800> be<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.610> one<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:55.030> has<00:03:55.150> everything<00:03:55.420> in

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
gonna be the one that has everything in

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.500 
gonna be the one that has everything in
it<00:03:56.520> because<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:57.610> should<00:03:57.730> still<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.030> seven<00:03:58.390> more

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
it because it should still be seven more

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.560 
it because it should still be seven more
good<00:03:58.750> cards<00:03:59.050> in<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.530> box<00:04:00.240> usually<00:04:01.240> there's

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
good cards in this box usually there's

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.160 
good cards in this box usually there's
12<00:04:01.890> holographic<00:04:02.890> /v<00:04:03.310> X's<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:04.630> here<00:04:04.750> we<00:04:04.840> have<00:04:04.959> a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
12 holographic /v X's so here we have a

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.000 
12 holographic /v X's so here we have a
Combusken

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010

licky<00:04:06.880> licky<00:04:06.910> I'm<00:04:07.630> gonna<00:04:07.780> start<00:04:07.900> going<00:04:08.020> pretty

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
licky licky I'm gonna start going pretty

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.660 
licky licky I'm gonna start going pretty
quickly<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.740> guess<00:04:09.160> there's<00:04:09.340> something<00:04:09.490> new

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
quickly I guess there's something new

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.650 
quickly I guess there's something new
right<00:04:09.760> there<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.030> was<00:04:10.239> gonna<00:04:10.360> say<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.600> think

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
right there I was gonna say I think

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.030 
right there I was gonna say I think
we've<00:04:11.020> seen<00:04:11.200> all<00:04:11.320> the<00:04:11.410> incumbents<00:04:11.890> and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
we've seen all the incumbents and

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.310 
we've seen all the incumbents and
Commons<00:04:12.760> but<00:04:12.970> there's<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.630> klefki<00:04:13.930> we<00:04:14.080> haven't

the reverse holographic and the last

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.520 
the reverse holographic and the last
card<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.729> Glaceon<00:04:24.729> so<00:04:25.210> our<00:04:25.780> Glaceon<00:04:26.229> allowed

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
but not holographic rare but my favorite

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.110 
but not holographic rare but my favorite
evolution<00:04:29.980> so<00:04:30.160> I'm<00:04:30.250> still<00:04:30.490> pretty<00:04:30.520> happy<00:04:31.000> to

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
evolution so I'm still pretty happy to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.250 
evolution so I'm still pretty happy to
see<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.300> awesome<00:04:32.550> four<00:04:33.550> packs<00:04:33.760> left<00:04:34.260> yeah

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
see that awesome four packs left yeah

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.600 
see that awesome four packs left yeah
but<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.800> said<00:04:35.860> guys<00:04:36.100> I'm<00:04:36.280> gonna<00:04:36.370> start

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
but like I said guys I'm gonna start

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
but like I said guys I'm gonna start
going<00:04:36.850> through<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.120> Commons<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.540> um

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
going through the Commons and um

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.700 
going through the Commons and um
comments<00:04:37.960> pretty<00:04:38.110> quickly<00:04:38.350> because<00:04:38.530> we're

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
comments pretty quickly because we're

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.050 
comments pretty quickly because we're
just<00:04:38.860> kind<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.040> seeing<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.310> same<00:04:39.520> cards<00:04:39.850> over

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
just kind of seeing the same cards over

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.900 
just kind of seeing the same cards over
and<00:04:40.090> over<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:40.540> tend<00:04:41.140> to<00:04:41.170> go<00:04:41.320> pretty<00:04:41.530> fast<00:04:41.850> in<00:04:42.850> the

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
and over I tend to go pretty fast in the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.790 
and over I tend to go pretty fast in the
later<00:04:43.210> parts<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.870> boxes<00:04:44.230> pretty<00:04:44.530> slow<00:04:44.710> at

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
later parts of the boxes pretty slow at

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.830 
later parts of the boxes pretty slow at
the<00:04:44.890> start<00:04:45.480> we<00:04:46.480> have<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.660> retriever<00:04:47.550> Pancham

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
the start we have to retriever Pancham

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.500

and<00:04:56.800> Plusle<00:04:57.130> it's<00:04:57.250> just<00:04:57.400> they<00:04:57.520> were<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:57.790> common

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
and Plusle it's just they were so common

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.310 
and Plusle it's just they were so common
in<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.240> first<00:04:58.480> part<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:58.900> I'm<00:04:58.960> just<00:04:59.170> gonna

and sleeve that one up

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.110 
and sleeve that one up
open<00:06:07.480> these<00:06:07.600> last<00:06:07.840> two<00:06:08.080> packs<00:06:08.440> so<00:06:09.400> on<00:06:09.760> average

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
open these last two packs so on average

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.900 
open these last two packs so on average
again<00:06:11.020> I've<00:06:11.230> kind<00:06:11.560> of<00:06:11.620> broken<00:06:12.370> record<00:06:12.730> on<00:06:12.820> this

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
again I've kind of broken record on this

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.909 
again I've kind of broken record on this
point<00:06:13.150> but<00:06:13.330> normally<00:06:14.080> there<00:06:14.290> is<00:06:14.320> twelve

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
point but normally there is twelve

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.030 
point but normally there is twelve
holographics<00:06:15.910> /e<00:06:16.570> x's<00:06:17.050> we've<00:06:17.350> only<00:06:17.500> done<00:06:17.680> six

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
holographics /e x's we've only done six

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.130 
holographics /e x's we've only done six
so<00:06:18.880> that<00:06:19.060> means<00:06:19.300> that<00:06:19.510> there<00:06:19.630> should<00:06:19.780> be<00:06:19.810> 6

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
so that means that there should be 6

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.330 
so that means that there should be 6
