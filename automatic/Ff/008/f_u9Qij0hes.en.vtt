00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.550
 hello, hello, good day we do 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.599
 Today, the wonderful penetrates 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.340
 first unspectacular sounds looks 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:34.580
 alien and something is changing and indeed 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.960
 by Jamaican tion we take calls 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.250
 now in rome from nepal 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.809
 both draw their own 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.580
 Some brands demand it in the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.129
 usually very austria around 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.519
 stronger to physically heavy 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.800
 we have it too seriously 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.900
 area tend to be around and not quite like that 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.809
 strong but still quite up and 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.729
 bresan longer in the taste where you say 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.440
 he can get along well with others 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.750
 Spanish brandy are now in very 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.780
 otherwise you should rather be nice 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.260
 Cherry is known to manufacturer 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.030
 solid gran reserva really 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.680
 has to precipitate with almond tones 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.750
 the full program is almost in 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.680
 Direction clear to Petrus at the end 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.530
 So totally touched in based too 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.930
 required in the recipe and then is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.280
 still a whole country 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.020
 I personally find the drink then 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.429
 So let's just say something about that 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.539
 matisse that is the biggest flowering 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.880
 that was the end of one more 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.619
 give it a bit about it too 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.420
 a bit so to remove the high ones 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.009
 and to the taste even who this 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.929
 to make a small explosion 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.549
 if we know the drink after art ring 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.590
 we will be really surprised 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.030
 First only the ingredients sound 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.609
 hardly anybody is a bit strange 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.570
 enthusiastic about the thing because 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.710
 The taste can be right 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.100
 but it can be imagined 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.719
 highlight wait quite a big doubt 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.719
 is behind the camera 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.980
 but we are looking , albeit generating 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.420
 we can certainly a nice thing to 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.860
 can also surprise with should 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 drinks proportionate spirituose same 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:22.209
 proportion of 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:29.030
 and then we take call them that we play 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:32.090
 slightly reduced to half to 119 stands 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.370
 even a little sugar syrup the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.790
 where now as such relative 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.650
 Low sugar content is the syrup 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.440
 you can be a bit stronger 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.000
 cooperate each of it small at first 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.690
 sees himself thinking so fruit that can not 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.370
 function 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.400
 But as I said the drink surprised 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.530
 So the taste is complete 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.880
 similar to stenger is the most 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.670
 They also could not imagine 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.580
 and from or not at all 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.230
 order something in them and two ingredients 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.540
 is that also somewhere I say that is 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.000
 underestimated and not really 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.950
 announced 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.880
 Shake vigorously if whole year 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.950
 can you really say unix and learn 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.610
 more must say that actually 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.910
 had come 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:29.920
 is the time for real consistency 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.970
 taste wonders we nationally 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:38.350
 76 million spectators what 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:43.080
 He can use the components included 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.080
 with a stir and round off 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:13.790
 and there come the nice color 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:13.790
 actually slightly old and pink 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:24.500
 then there is something on top as I said 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:32.640
 from the moscow blossom but only slightly 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:34.650
 already rises the nose with the 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.220
 Muskat really knows what 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.840
 spicy sweetish a fine upward 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.840
 play 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.840
 you are welcome
