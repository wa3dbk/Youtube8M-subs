designs and patterns that are a little

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.789 
designs and patterns that are a little
more<00:02:38.890> abstract<00:02:40.870> here's<00:02:41.870> one<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.319> I<00:02:42.379> painted

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
more abstract here's one that I painted

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.839 
more abstract here's one that I painted
to<00:02:42.950> look<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> peacock<00:02:44.150> feather<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:46.670> can

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
to look like a peacock feather you can

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.460 
to look like a peacock feather you can
paint<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> back<00:02:47.360> side<00:02:47.629> of<00:02:47.659> the<00:02:47.810> feather<00:02:48.049> too

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
paint the back side of the feather too

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.220 
paint the back side of the feather too
but<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.430> even<00:02:49.730> more<00:02:49.760> texture<00:02:50.629> than<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.989> top

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
but it is even more texture than the top

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.440 
but it is even more texture than the top
side<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.129> tends<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.459> resist<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.090> paint<00:02:53.299> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
side and it tends to resist the paint a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.670 
side and it tends to resist the paint a
little<00:02:53.599> bit<00:02:54.879> now<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:55.910> barrel<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.540> pen<00:02:56.810> can

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
little bit now the barrel of the pen can

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.930 
little bit now the barrel of the pen can
be<00:02:57.709> designed<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.430> some<00:02:58.609> very<00:02:58.849> interesting

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
be designed in some very interesting

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.660 
be designed in some very interesting
ways<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:00.670> recommend<00:03:01.670> putting<00:03:01.970> black<00:03:02.480> first

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
ways I recommend putting black first

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.670 
ways I recommend putting black first
near<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.819> nib<00:03:05.140> because<00:03:06.140> that's<00:03:06.349> where<00:03:06.590> the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
near the nib because that's where the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.800 
near the nib because that's where the
ink<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.159> going<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.549> come<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.849> contact<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.510> it

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
ink is going to come in contact with it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.210 
ink is going to come in contact with it
most<00:03:09.459> I'll<00:03:10.459> tie<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.030> knot<00:03:11.299> first<00:03:13.599> at<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.750> top<00:03:15.220> of

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
most I'll tie a knot first at the top of

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.800 
most I'll tie a knot first at the top of
the<00:03:16.370> feather<00:03:18.609> tuck<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:19.849> end<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.480> thread

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
the feather tuck the end of the thread

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.349 
the feather tuck the end of the thread
down<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.500> then<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.239> wind<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.450> around<00:03:25.150> if<00:03:26.150> I

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
down and then just wind it around if I

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.210 
down and then just wind it around if I
wrap<00:03:26.599> it<00:03:26.750> closely<00:03:27.049> enough<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.620> don't<00:03:27.680> need<00:03:27.919> to

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
wrap it closely enough I don't need to

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.940 
wrap it closely enough I don't need to
remove<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.700> masking<00:03:29.180> tape<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.379> a<00:03:36.410> waxed

remove the masking tape this is a waxed

would be designed in much the same

it's going to be partially exposed on
the<00:04:53.490> backside<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:57.780> can<00:04:57.930> be<00:04:58.050> further<00:04:58.289> decorated
