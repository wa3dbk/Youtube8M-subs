new one soup charges you get to see the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.810 
new one soup charges you get to see the
two<00:03:16.670> little<00:03:17.350> little<00:03:18.350> slots<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.490> light

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
two little little slots for the light

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.460 
two little little slots for the light
and<00:03:19.940> dark<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.300> gets<00:03:20.510> see<00:03:20.660> two<00:03:20.840> characters<00:03:21.230> for

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
and dark and gets see two characters for

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.980 
and dark and gets see two characters for
both<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.190> we'll<00:03:22.400> get<00:03:22.580> one<00:03:22.880> returning<00:03:23.240> for<00:03:23.720> each

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
both so we'll get one returning for each

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.780 
both so we'll get one returning for each
element<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:24.530> we'll<00:03:24.650> get<00:03:24.740> spotlight<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.700> then

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
element so we'll get spotlight and then

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.710 
element so we'll get spotlight and then
we'll<00:03:25.880> get<00:03:25.970> blackout<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.420> then<00:03:26.540> we've<00:03:26.690> got

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
we'll get blackout and then we've got

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.840 
we'll get blackout and then we've got
two<00:03:27.050> new<00:03:27.200> characters<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.430> I<00:03:28.459> think<00:03:28.610> that's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
two new characters so I think that's

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.199 
two new characters so I think that's
really<00:03:29.420> cool<00:03:30.160> how<00:03:31.160> will<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.400> couch<00:03:31.640> co-op<00:03:31.940> be
