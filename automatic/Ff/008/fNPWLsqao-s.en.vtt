00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.990 
that's brilliant double stealth so if
you<00:02:11.110> if<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.500> break<00:02:11.770> out<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.010> stuff<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.580> combat

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you if you break out of stuff in combat

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.060 
you if you break out of stuff in combat
then<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.989> can<00:02:14.140> go<00:02:14.260> straight<00:02:14.440> back<00:02:14.620> into<00:02:14.920> it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
then you can go straight back into it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.750 
then you can go straight back into it
with<00:02:15.220> this

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
with this

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.090 
with this
I<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:16.570> it's<00:02:16.750> cool<00:02:16.959> down<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.800> short

I think it's cool down but it's short

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.580 
I think it's cool down but it's short
cooldown<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.580> no<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.180> cares<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.750> more

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
cooldown so no one cares but more

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.740 
cooldown so no one cares but more
