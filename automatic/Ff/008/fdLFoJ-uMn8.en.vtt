00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.420
 good afternoon today I will cook 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.410
 chocolate ganache 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.759
 This ganache is suitable for lubrication 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.109
 killer cakes and various pastry shops 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:31.619
 products and for this recipe to me 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:44.809
 need 6 tablespoons of sugar 6 3 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:44.809
 tablespoons of cocoa with a hill all is well 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:59.460
 if you want more gravy Kolka 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.320
 such a ganache or cream someone call someone 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.189
 add less sugar if you want 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.270
 sweeter you can add sugar a little 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:14.220
 more and now add 9 dining rooms 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:25.640
 spoons of boiling water all mix well 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:25.640
 and put on the stove will bring to the boil and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.380
 then after 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.790
 garage and boil 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.229
 I will reduce the heat and I will guess already 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.510
 Molding does not suit me by consistency 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.740
 nightstand also hal should be like this 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.310
 quite viscous much considering that where 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.350
 ganache cools it will become much thicker 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.350
 so they made it for thick 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.649
 well all mixed up now I will grieve 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.250
 over chocolate ganache boiled I turned it down 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.120
 heating will be quite often now 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.400
 stirring 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.680
 uvalivaet somewhere in the region of 5 minutes, well, 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.080
 folding gunner ganache boiled here 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.510
 it's come pretty 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.820
 thickish now add here 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:32.780
 a teaspoon of butter 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:38.299
 mix well to dissolve 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.810
 oils oil dissolved 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:44.390
 and after adding oil ganache immediately 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.360
 acquired such a silky glossy 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.680
 texture that is even noticeable already on 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.940
 video well, in principle, everything now I put 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.079
 ganache to complete cooling ganache ready 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.890
