about 30 seconds into this scenario
these<00:03:20.939> objects<00:03:21.389> that<00:03:21.480> were<00:03:21.599> coming<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.049> and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
these objects that were coming in and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.750 
these objects that were coming in and
and<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:23.299> want<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.389> say<00:03:24.510> they<00:03:24.659> were

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
and then I want to say they were

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.699 
and then I want to say they were
registered<00:03:26.760> at<00:03:26.879> about<00:03:27.139> 180,000<00:03:28.139> feet<00:03:28.379> and

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
registered at about 180,000 feet and

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.530 
registered at about 180,000 feet and
they<00:03:29.250> were<00:03:29.340> being<00:03:29.609> tracked<00:03:30.060> at<00:03:30.269> about

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
they were being tracked at about

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.360 
they were being tracked at about
anywhere<00:03:30.989> between<00:03:31.169> four<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.650> six<00:03:31.949> thousand

miles an hour

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.030

and<00:03:33.209> that's<00:03:33.389> about<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.780> speed<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.169> an<00:03:34.260> ICBM<00:03:34.829> by

and that's about the speed of an ICBM by

and that's about the speed of an ICBM by
the<00:03:35.099> way<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:37.620> during<00:03:37.919> this<00:03:38.040> scenario<00:03:38.689> these
