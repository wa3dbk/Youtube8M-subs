it's who's running the fastest at the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.350 
it's who's running the fastest at the
end<00:03:57.530> because<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.430> could<00:03:58.700> have<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.820> horse<00:03:59.030> that

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
will go we'll say our fractions like 22

at the end you're gonna be last
like<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.390> that's<00:04:11.720> where<00:04:11.900> strategy<00:04:12.110> comes

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
like so and that's where strategy comes

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.410 
like so and that's where strategy comes
into<00:04:12.739> it<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.370> how<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.549> harness<00:04:13.880> your<00:04:14.239> horse
