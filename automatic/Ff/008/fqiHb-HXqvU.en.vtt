00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
so now Betty then was taking how much

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.700 
so now Betty then was taking how much
you<00:00:37.980> know<00:00:38.129> whether<00:00:39.059> he<00:00:39.420> knows<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.050> how<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
you know whether he knows or not how to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.840 
you know whether he knows or not how to
change<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.430> diaper<00:00:42.440> so<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.590> first<00:00:43.920> step<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
change a diaper so the first step is you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.040 
change a diaper so the first step is you
take<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.980> off<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.700> peel<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.690> back

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
take this off and you peel it back

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.990 
take this off and you peel it back
because<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.039> reason<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.640> don't<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:50.940> her

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
because the reason is you don't want her

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.090 
because the reason is you don't want her
to<00:00:51.090> pee<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.079> wreck<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> try<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
to pee on it and wreck it so you try to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.860 
to pee on it and wreck it so you try to
save<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.730> save<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.640> onesie<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.539> we
