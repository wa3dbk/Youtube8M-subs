fan<00:01:34.860> what's<00:01:35.340> cool<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.210> thirty

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
fan what's cool about this one thirty

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
fan what's cool about this one thirty
five<00:01:36.600> millimeter<00:01:36.869> fan<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> uses<00:01:37.770> one

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
five millimeter fan as it uses one

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.160 
five millimeter fan as it uses one
twenty<00:01:38.250> millimeter<00:01:38.610> holes<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.570> neat<00:01:39.780> also

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
twenty millimeter holes very neat also

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
twenty millimeter holes very neat also
you've<00:01:40.320> got<00:01:40.350> these<00:01:40.590> silicone<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.640> call<00:01:41.820> them

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you've got these silicone they call them

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
you've got these silicone they call them
pins<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.290> mean<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
pins but I really think they mean is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.740 
pins but I really think they mean is
like<00:01:43.829> fan<00:01:44.670> mounting<00:01:45.560> doodads<00:01:47.570> all<00:01:48.570> right<00:01:48.720> I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
like fan mounting doodads all right I

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
like fan mounting doodads all right I
guess<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:48.930> not<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.409> better<00:01:49.649> so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
guess that's not really better so

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.880 
guess that's not really better so
basically<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.119> goes<00:01:51.479> into<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:52.020> case<00:01:52.439> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
basically this goes into your case and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.999 
basically this goes into your case and
it<00:01:53.009> acts<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:54.470> rubber<00:01:55.470> layer<00:01:55.770> in

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it acts as like a rubber layer in

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.410 
it acts as like a rubber layer in
between<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> actual<00:01:56.850> effects<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.149> no

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
between the actual effects so no

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.209 
between the actual effects so no
vibration<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.110> be<00:01:58.229> passed<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> case<00:01:58.979> or

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
vibration can be passed to the case or

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.560 
vibration can be passed to the case or

were<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> first<00:02:03.840> ones<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.170> start<00:02:04.380> doing<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
were the first ones to start doing this

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.230 
were the first ones to start doing this
if<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.070> recall<00:02:05.219> correctly<00:02:05.549> their<00:02:05.969> famous

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240

if I recall correctly their famous
inline<00:02:07.020> resistors<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.369> easily<00:02:08.640> put

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
inline resistors so you can easily put

let's go and do a quick sound test with

ahead of ourselves here so I'm going to
go<00:02:19.760> ahead<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.390> plug<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.660> into<00:02:21.050> one<00:02:21.320> of<00:02:21.440> the

I'll<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.070> do<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.690> make<00:02:26.810> my<00:02:27.020> life<00:02:27.200> easier

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
I'll just do this to make my life easier

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.350 
I'll just do this to make my life easier
because<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:28.130> way<00:02:28.250> I'll<00:02:28.400> know<00:02:28.820> that<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.270> a

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
because that way I'll know that it's a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.540 
because that way I'll know that it's a
full<00:02:29.570> speed<00:02:29.900> header<00:02:30.710> so<00:02:30.950> we<00:02:31.070> can<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.370> some

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
full speed header so we can get some

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.490 
full speed header so we can get some
idea<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:32.060> how<00:02:32.450> quiet<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.960> fan<00:02:33.110> actually<00:02:33.230> is

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500

sort of stupid overly loud fans in them
wow<00:02:49.790> that's<00:02:50.090> actually<00:02:50.210> outstanding<00:02:50.930> and

is like sort of lionesses gut feel about

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.390 
is like sort of lionesses gut feel about
how's<00:02:59.960> the<00:03:00.140> fan<00:03:00.350> sounds<00:03:00.830> how<00:03:00.950> much<00:03:01.100> air<00:03:01.280> it's

about is on the defense is they tend to
