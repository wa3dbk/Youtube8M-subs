00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
vegetable solids with a spoon right into

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.940 
vegetable solids with a spoon right into
my<00:03:14.170> sieve

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
my sieve

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.520 
my sieve
so<00:03:15.370> with<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.910> back<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.270> your<00:03:16.300> spoon<00:03:16.690> just

so with the back of your spoon just

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.880 
so with the back of your spoon just
squeeze<00:03:18.010> out<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:19.330> vegetables<00:03:19.960> so<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.680> you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
squeeze out the vegetables so that you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.580 
squeeze out the vegetables so that you
