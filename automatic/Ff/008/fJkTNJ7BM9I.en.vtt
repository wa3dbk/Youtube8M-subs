because we think it's been a big
inspiration<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:33.210> how<00:00:33.239> people<00:00:33.480> live<00:00:33.780> their

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
inspiration on how people live their

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.950 
inspiration on how people live their
lives<00:00:33.989> today<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.700> how<00:00:36.510> they're<00:00:36.690> gonna<00:00:36.750> live

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
lives today and how they're gonna live

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.060 
lives today and how they're gonna live
their<00:00:37.170> lives<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> future<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> how

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
their lives in the future and how

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760 
their lives in the future and how
they're<00:00:38.190> gonna<00:00:38.280> look<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> past<00:00:39.649> hold<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
they're gonna look at the past hold on a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
they're gonna look at the past hold on a
second<00:00:41.100> holds<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.969> example<00:00:42.270> afro<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> think

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
second holds for example afro I think

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.650 
second holds for example afro I think
comes<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> from<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.399> 70s<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.210> then

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
comes kind of from the 70s but then

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.090 
comes kind of from the 70s but then
again<00:00:45.750> there's<00:00:46.020> other<00:00:46.260> styles<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
again there's other styles like the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.830 
again there's other styles like the
greased<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.579> hair<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.510> use

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
greased up hair when they actually use

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
greased up hair when they actually use
grease<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.739> totally<00:00:50.070> sure<00:00:50.100> where

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
grease and I'm not totally sure where

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.260 
grease and I'm not totally sure where
that<00:00:50.579> comes<00:00:50.820> from

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that comes from

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.330 
that comes from
whether<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:51.989> from<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> 20s<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.980> from

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
whether or not it's from the 20s or from

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
whether or not it's from the 20s or from
the<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.940> definitely<00:00:54.270> not<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> sixties

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the it's definitely not from the sixties

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.590 
the it's definitely not from the sixties
I<00:00:55.199> don't<00:00:55.379> think<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.670> 60s<00:00:57.090> sort<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.480> we're

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
I don't think the 60s sort of we're

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.180 
I don't think the 60s sort of we're
taking<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.960> very<00:00:58.170> seriously<00:00:58.230> yeah<00:00:58.980> please

don't<00:00:59.370> into<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.969> sixties<00:01:00.359> sort<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.899> had<00:01:01.050> their

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
don't into the sixties sort of had their

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.979 
don't into the sixties sort of had their
the<00:01:01.500> Maude<00:01:01.649> hairstyle<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.520> believe

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
the Maude hairstyle which I believe

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.910 
the Maude hairstyle which I believe
evolved<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> sort<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.530> grease<00:01:04.739> back

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
evolved into the sort of grease back

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
evolved into the sort of grease back
look<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> 70s<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.060> Peter<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.360> you're

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
look of the 70s but Peter what you're

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.149 
look of the 70s but Peter what you're
saying<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.750> he<00:01:07.229> became<00:01:07.470> more<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> twenty
