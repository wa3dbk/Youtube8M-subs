video or with ads by the way if you get
that<00:03:15.910> kind<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.240> analogy<00:03:16.720> it's<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.990> wee<00:03:17.110> writes

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
that kind of analogy it's a wee writes

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.320 
that kind of analogy it's a wee writes
weird<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.770> know<00:03:17.800> but<00:03:18.100> what<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.060> can<00:03:19.180> take<00:03:19.270> from

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
weird I know but what we can take from

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.270 
weird I know but what we can take from
that<00:03:19.570> then<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:19.959> ok<00:03:20.140> well<00:03:20.680> what<00:03:21.040> if<00:03:21.160> you

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
that then is that ok well what if you

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.160 
that then is that ok well what if you
just<00:03:21.459> paid<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.790> buck<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.540> get<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.810> skip<00:03:22.990> all

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
just paid a buck and you get to skip all

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.860 
just paid a buck and you get to skip all
the<00:03:23.260> ads<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.670> math<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:25.030> not<00:03:25.060> correct<00:03:25.540> by<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
the ads the math is not correct by the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.690 
the ads the math is not correct by the
way<00:03:25.990> because<00:03:26.320> randomly<00:03:26.830> abs<00:03:27.040> will<00:03:27.280> be<00:03:27.430> good

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
way because randomly abs will be good

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.570 
way because randomly abs will be good
and<00:03:28.030> they<00:03:28.060> will<00:03:28.750> work<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.380> most<00:03:29.830> most<00:03:30.310> you

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
and they will work and most most you

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.100 
and they will work and most most you
know<00:03:30.670> more<00:03:31.060> than<00:03:31.150> all<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.420> times<00:03:31.630> they<00:03:31.840> won't

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
know more than all the times they won't

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.710 
know more than all the times they won't
so<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.860> will<00:03:33.310> be<00:03:33.370> like<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> very<00:03:33.910> flip-floppy

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
so it will be like a very flip-floppy

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.900 
so it will be like a very flip-floppy
weird<00:03:35.230> system<00:03:35.740> but<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.280> compensate<00:03:36.459> for<00:03:36.790> this

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
weird system but to compensate for this

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.120 
weird system but to compensate for this
um<00:03:37.180> I'm<00:03:37.990> probably<00:03:38.440> thinking<00:03:38.860> about<00:03:39.040> the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
um I'm probably thinking about the

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.890 
um I'm probably thinking about the
people<00:03:39.280> over<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.880> Google<00:03:40.540> they<00:03:40.630> were<00:03:40.690> like

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
people over that Google they were like

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.380 
people over that Google they were like
alright<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.530> by<00:03:41.890> reverse<00:03:42.310> engineering<00:03:42.390> let's

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
alright so by reverse engineering let's

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.960 
alright so by reverse engineering let's
say<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.750> ads<00:03:43.930> are<00:03:44.110> gonna<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.440> okay<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.610> should

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
say that ads are gonna be okay we should

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.820 
say that ads are gonna be okay we should
probably<00:03:46.209> just<00:03:46.630> set<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.170> one<00:03:47.380> buck<00:03:47.560> but

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
probably just set it to one buck but

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.990 
probably just set it to one buck but
that's<00:03:47.980> not<00:03:48.160> really<00:03:48.370> going<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.610> work<00:03:48.760> because

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
that's not really going to work because

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's not really going to work because
if<00:03:49.480> really<00:03:49.930> good<00:03:50.080> ads<00:03:50.290> are<00:03:50.500> now<00:03:50.620> gonna<00:03:50.860> be

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
if really good ads are now gonna be

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.680 
if really good ads are now gonna be
skipped<00:03:51.340> maybe<00:03:51.880> we<00:03:51.940> should<00:03:52.090> just<00:03:52.120> compensate

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
skipped maybe we should just compensate

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.780 
skipped maybe we should just compensate
for<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.050> let's<00:03:53.260> say<00:03:53.410> two<00:03:53.470> bucks<00:03:53.830> but<00:03:54.430> then

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
for it so let's say two bucks but then

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.610 
for it so let's say two bucks but then
again<00:03:54.910> maybe<00:03:55.240> we<00:03:55.510> could<00:03:55.720> add<00:03:55.840> other<00:03:56.080> services

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
again maybe we could add other services

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.110 
again maybe we could add other services
I've<00:03:56.830> heard<00:03:57.100> like<00:03:57.340> speculations<00:03:58.030> about

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
I've heard like speculations about

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.530 
I've heard like speculations about
people<00:03:58.870> being<00:03:58.959> able<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.470> download<00:04:00.220> songs<00:04:01.060> and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
people being able to download songs and

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.140 
people being able to download songs and
and<00:04:01.720> videos<00:04:02.440> on<00:04:02.740> their<00:04:02.890> phones<00:04:03.190> shit<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.000> shit

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
and videos on their phones shit and shit

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.330 
and videos on their phones shit and shit
like<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.930> know<00:04:05.020> store<00:04:05.350> it<00:04:05.590> if<00:04:06.070> they

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
like that and you know store it if they

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.010 
like that and you know store it if they
pay<00:04:06.550> extra<00:04:06.580> for<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:07.270> kind<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.510> service<00:04:07.840> which

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
pay extra for this kind of service which

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.420 
pay extra for this kind of service which
I<00:04:08.140> but<00:04:08.500> by<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.680> way<00:04:08.800> that's<00:04:08.950> absolutely

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
I but by the way that's absolutely

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.310 
I but by the way that's absolutely
bullshit<00:04:09.880> if<00:04:10.000> that's<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.330> feature<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.989> hope<00:04:11.170> that

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
bullshit if that's a feature I hope that

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.080 
bullshit if that's a feature I hope that
nobody<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.770> you<00:04:11.920> are<00:04:12.130> using<00:04:12.430> my<00:04:12.700> future

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
nobody of you are using my future

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.199 
nobody of you are using my future
because<00:04:13.570> you're<00:04:13.660> using<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.989> data<00:04:14.200> data<00:04:14.620> plan<00:04:14.890> on

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
because you're using a data data plan on

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.599 
because you're using a data data plan on
downloading<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.600> video<00:04:17.290> file<00:04:17.650> on<00:04:18.010> your<00:04:18.250> phone

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
downloading a video file on your phone

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.630 
downloading a video file on your phone
that<00:04:19.030> has<00:04:19.150> limited<00:04:19.660> storage<00:04:20.109> as<00:04:20.799> like<00:04:21.070> there's

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
that has limited storage as like there's

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.250 
that has limited storage as like there's
so<00:04:21.760> many<00:04:21.850> pol<00:04:22.479> tease

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
so many pol tease

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.780 
so many pol tease
like<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:23.500> many<00:04:23.800> things<00:04:23.950> don't<00:04:24.370> wrong<00:04:24.610> with

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
like so many things don't wrong with

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.700 
like so many things don't wrong with
that<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:24.940> don't<00:04:25.420> understand<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.050> what<00:04:26.440> we<00:04:26.560> can

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
that I don't understand but what we can

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.530 
that I don't understand but what we can
learn<00:04:26.740> from<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.270> will<00:04:28.510> be

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
learn from that is that if that will be

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.510 
learn from that is that if that will be
done<00:04:28.810> that's<00:04:28.990> absolutely<00:04:29.440> bad<00:04:29.680> um<00:04:30.130> even

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
done that's absolutely bad um even

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.240 
done that's absolutely bad um even
though<00:04:30.640> again<00:04:30.970> me<00:04:31.270> getting<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.170> skip<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.070> many

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
though again me getting to skip so many

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.620 
though again me getting to skip so many
ads<00:04:33.370> because<00:04:33.670> if<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.120> didn't<00:04:34.360> know<00:04:34.450> I'm<00:04:34.570> a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
ads because if you didn't know I'm a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.630 
ads because if you didn't know I'm a
power<00:04:34.930> user<00:04:35.110> via<00:04:35.380> youtube<00:04:35.710> I'm<00:04:36.070> essentially

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
power user via youtube I'm essentially

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.640 
power user via youtube I'm essentially
watching<00:04:37.120> like<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.540> couple<00:04:38.020> thousand<00:04:38.530> videos

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
watching like a couple thousand videos

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.920 
watching like a couple thousand videos
of<00:04:38.890> every<00:04:39.100> month<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.550> a<00:04:39.700> per<00:04:40.600> day<00:04:40.780> I'm

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
watching you know like 20 30 maybe more

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.210 
watching you know like 20 30 maybe more
it<00:04:43.780> all<00:04:43.990> depends<00:04:44.350> on<00:04:44.470> how<00:04:44.590> many<00:04:44.650> videos<00:04:45.040> I'm

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
it all depends on how many videos I'm

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.070 
it all depends on how many videos I'm
finding<00:04:45.670> that<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:45.820> enjoy<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.360> by<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.720> way<00:04:46.900> I'm

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
finding that I enjoy and by the way I'm

you can download the video better and
faster<00:06:53.230> but<00:06:53.770> the<00:06:54.040> downside<00:06:54.370> is<00:06:54.760> that<00:06:54.790> it<00:06:55.000> looks

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
faster but the downside is that it looks

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.210 
faster but the downside is that it looks
really<00:06:55.360> ugly<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:56.080> um<00:06:56.740> it's<00:06:56.950> got<00:06:57.040> to<00:06:57.130> get

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
really ugly so um it's got to get

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.560 
really ugly so um it's got to get
interesting<00:06:57.460> to<00:06:57.760> see<00:06:57.880> what<00:06:58.000> it's<00:06:58.150> going<00:06:58.240> to<00:06:58.360> go
