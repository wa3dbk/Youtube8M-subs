00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.200
 very important cups for the club 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.150
 with a very great happiness the fact of 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.600
 have achieved the objectives that we 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.510

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.000
 it gives us a lot of satisfaction so good 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.160
 now to continue training because we 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 there is one more game against against the mouth 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.840

 next semester is going to be very 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.300
 important because there are many many 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.500
 contests in play so 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.970
 good thing the group is really 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.350
 convinced and we know that if we could 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.360
 achieve this we can see many more things 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.040
 how was the return to work today to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.690
 difference from last week maybe a 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.550
 little quieter more relaxed or 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
 just as concentrated thinking about the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.989
 superclásico in mexico if maybe today 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.360
 because the first practice is a bit 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.369
 more relaxed but already last morning 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.720
 we will do the practices as we come 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.840
 working because 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.340
 the commitment on Saturday before mouth for 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.130
 we are important also beyond 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.009
 that is a friendly 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.320
 we know that people always always 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.899
 he wants to win the mouth so we 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.380
 also and well let's prepare the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.490
 party with a lot of responsibility and 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.320
 After good, the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.149
 vacations so missing little go 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.619
 you jan with more confidence than mouth 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.450
 after the good campaign they did 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.380
 this year of not losing any matches 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.360
 against the eternal rival but this year we 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.409
 it went we did pretty well so this one 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.049
 will continue to be the idea of 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:49.210
 to obtain good results as well 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:52.240
 that we are going to prepare it as it was in 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.799
 the classics that we play in the summer 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.659
 so we 're going to take it in a way 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.310
 that well that the defenders do not 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.780
 true that lately all come 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.479
 many goals the back of the court 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.750
 Yes good is good to be able to help the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.240
 team converting one we talked to 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.090
 German that at the time of shooting 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.769
 free I told him 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 german let's go now let's do the 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.540
 goal and good because we laughed because 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.910
 just from that play came comes goal 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.160
 because it was a tight match and sometimes 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.470
 it's a stop ball what can be defined 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.739
 in our favor or as against 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.349
 and it was seen that Germán anticipated very 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.470
 well did the goal and so good a 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.420
 happiness for him because he is a 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.430
 great person is a player that good we 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.220
 he played a lot but he was always very 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.330
 well predisposed and good is a prize 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.340
 also for the effort that is coming 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.480
 doing good then the superclassic 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.280
 of Saturday after I imagine that to 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.110
 rest not deserved rest after 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.680
 of so much competition and so much 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.750
 pressure if afterwards it passes very fast it 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.660
 It happens very fast but good one takes advantage 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.819
 to share with the family to 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.379
 be with the near ones that one sometimes 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.540
 can not enjoy how we are here 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.860
 working but surely also 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.200
 preparing what will be the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.020
 preseason so there's not much time 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.289
 to rest 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.289
