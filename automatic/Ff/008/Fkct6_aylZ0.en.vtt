00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
amplify the sound and it really works

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.990

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
the end this is a really amazing case

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.270

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
I've mentioned will definitely cause it

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.430 
I've mentioned will definitely cause it
not<00:05:47.969> to<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.300> daily<00:05:48.509> case<00:05:48.719> for<00:05:48.930> many<00:05:49.050> people

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
not to be the daily case for many people
