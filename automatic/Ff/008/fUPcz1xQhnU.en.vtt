00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 hayushki with all his opponents today he 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.619
 present your impression of the game at 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 sunset overdrive effective not dating 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.100
 with nc 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.680
 so what to say this game is made 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.470
 especially for those who like to wet 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 hordes of bloodthirsty monsters who 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.750
 they want only your death but this one 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.880
 the game offers us a little bit of new 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.800
 Firstly, it is absolutely not marriageable 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.800
 pretty funny atmosphere 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.500
 for example in the mission that was on 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.290
 igromir needed to wet I don't know 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.539
 how many not ordered quantity 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.039
 monsters in different ways and just 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.770
 this game has succeeded 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.649
 you can simply kill the foe 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.469
 almost all of anything first 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.870
 you have a sword that is supposed to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.530
 helps us melee if you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.080
 swooped all sorts of incomprehensible 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.510
 Mastryukov in this case boevka very 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.270
 difficult from devil may edge and for example 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.049
 you can scatter with a jump all at once 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.729
 around can also be pretty 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.920
 alternately each luptsevat this sword 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.409
 muscles do not forget about the weapon 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.720
 ranged and when knocking is where 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.659
 roam for example there is a gun which 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.850
 just sets fire to everyone around you 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.670
 there were also weapons that fired and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.829
 the projectile flew off the wall and hit anyone 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.409
 He also killed such a mass 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.210
 defeat the gun was pretty cool 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.520
 there was also an ice winter weapon 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.350
 blowing with him is also very cool you can 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 just freeze everyone they are like 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.700
 stuck in place 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.369
 These monsters and these can run up and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.320
 nothing so dad and everyone just scatter 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.720
 also very beautiful and spectacular 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.950
 look but don't forget that 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.220
 sunset overdrive 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 for the first time, we show how well parkour 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.780
 For the first time such games are shown for the first time . 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.270
 we ca nâ€™t have this before 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.070
 it was going to be possible there 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.250
 climb this but that's all but not parkour 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.250
 was here you can jump on the walls to climb 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.930
 where do you want to ride very effectively 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.060
 all kinds of electric lines along paths here 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.120
 for example in this haze you could 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.140
 ride on railways which for 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.360
 roller coaster 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.300
 it was also very cool there know so 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.519
 driving yourself along these paths and dais 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.769
 jumping from the sword u what is the effect on her 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.130
 straight there also falls packard marine 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.290
 on all sorts of bonuses a whole bunch 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.870
 the game is really very impressive and very 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.209
 beautiful and very driving so new 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.670
 music siren urges them to wet 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.040
 all the twig and twig on you in general game on 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.670
 really get such a game for 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.030
 gameplay that is, those who love to kill 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.670
 a bunch of bloodthirsty monsters I just 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.200
 I personally recommend doing it not very 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.079
 love because it's some kind of 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.940
 a bit long silly process well 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.420
 here it will be very effective 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.360
 very nice a lot of ways to kill 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.820
 adversaries it is really very cool in 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.400
 in general, I probably will take as you 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.560
 wanna think really the game is there 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.829
 here but this is a true first impression 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.250
 which folded after playing at the exhibition 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.830
 2014 games 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.900
 mom shooters in general she has it 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.470
 all these were my impressions of sunset 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.390
 overdrive 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.330
