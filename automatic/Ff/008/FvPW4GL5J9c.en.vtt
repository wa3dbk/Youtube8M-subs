00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.419
 welcome all fans five nights at 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.600
 freddy's 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.389
 I am a son and today at your request and I 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.820
 tell you about Sparky or rather tell 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.770
 about whether he is a real character 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.740
 playing five nights at freddy's in a park 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.320
 in English and Sparky zippo tee-dog 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.019
 This is a fictional animatronic dog 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.769
 the creator of this screenshot is himself in this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.310
 confessed 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.619
 he has no hands they are cut off from some 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 places sticking wires probably the one who 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 created it wanted to make it like 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.879
 abandoned animatronic legend 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.670
 Appears on the 7th night in the location 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.360
 backstage installation workshop 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.160
 parameters 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 artificial intelligence freddie and chike 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.610
 Bonnie and Foxy at 6666 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.610
 or 66 60 units but this is a fake 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 even before the author's recognition a lot 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.660
 amateur programmers checked files 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.399
 and pointed to gullible game fans 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 what is fake 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.090
 also on the image of sparky need 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.640
 notice that it is not written there 7 night but 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.820
 the third night maybe the fake creator was 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.130
 just not attentive when creating it 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 They say that with a chance of about 0.5 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 percent can see his screamer in 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.330
 the first and second parts of the game but this too 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.340
 is a lie 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.030
 many players say they saw it 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 Sparky 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.990
 his screamer is actually a lie 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.360
 several times the park 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.479
 he himself does not exist because 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.610
 then he would be in the game files but him there 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.850
 no, respectively, and the appearance of Sparki 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.820
 impossible maybe he filed 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.750
 the idea of broken animatronics for you on 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.620
 this freddy's 2 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.350
 but it's probably not true either 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.040
 however, in the third part of the game there are 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.310
 the real matchy is more accurate drawing at the end 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.100
 office on the right side maybe scott 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.440
 specially brought into the toy from the spark or 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.200
 picked up the myth though many characters 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.600
 which scott did are taken from real 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.940
 things for example the purple guy is 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.550
 villains from marvel foxy world this 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.980
 the popular name of the foxes is possible he 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:23.540
 knew un from Sparky and decided to put it 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:26.660
 into the game well here you learned a lot about everything 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.390
 Sparky and the main thing is that you understand it 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.110
 fake hope your like and good
