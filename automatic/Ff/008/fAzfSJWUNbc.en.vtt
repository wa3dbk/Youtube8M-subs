00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.500
 before 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.820
 and tokyo 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.530
 to 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:45.850
 the girls then finally approached 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.720
 in the hot season it is hoped that between 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.060
 few months 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.770
 we will be able to get some sun 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.930
 because a bit of color finally a 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.240
 permanently remove the greyness 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.400
 winter paralyzed the look you have 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.130
 given the introduction of the video not 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.120
 this you want to wear now that 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.980
 how the list is particularly 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.360
 focused on the use of the face base 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.910
 of the earth and on the blue of my eyes 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.630
 also taken with the blue mask on 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.010
 lower lashes 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.350
 this because in the world of this video 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.700
 particularly sunny I looked for and 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.290
 wanted to bring you at least a little what 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.770
 I made on the coasts of Australia 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.180
 where really very hot but I've been 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.640
 inspired by the landscape 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.100
 Australian from the color of the sea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.619
 heaven of the earth in the video that you will see 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.890
 these new lands here that are the sites 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.560
 spears bronzing powder by derby how 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.660
 you see my hand are smaller 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.479
 compared to the maxi bronzin power that 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.780
 usage usually came out already at 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.700
 late March and they are fabulous fabulous 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.470
 especially for this period and for the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.380
 summer time first thing because 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.270
 contain spf 15 so they contain a 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.690
 good sun protection than together with 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.429
 that of the base I think is excellent 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.619
 especially just to protect yourself from 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.750
 UV rays are present in themselves colors 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.759
 two different of which are shimmer 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.550
 so you can use the terre map 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.020
 to go for a contouring 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.170
 then revive the color if we are 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.350
 still white in fact we have not 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.120
 still tanned or usually not 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.380
 we love the sun the tan 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.660
 as for the two 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.950
 I recommend more shimmer colors than 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.580
 other to the girls who already have a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.069
 color amber or that they have already taken 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.050
 a bit of sunshine then to go to 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.040
 accentuate to enhance the tan e 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.330
 to give this beautiful blue effect 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.950
 bright face with regards to makeup 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.290
 of the eyes a must have 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.690
 as in the summer to go to 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.260
 give some color to the eyes too 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.030
 without using a betti or exceeding 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.519
 precisely with eye makeup is the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.440
 one hundred percent with mascara and this and 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.660
 the blue one I use you will see 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.019
 also use in the video tutorial 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.180
 you will also see how different ways to 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.430
 be able to use these mascara that 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.769
 they will come out in a century of wound action 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.569
 mid-April print boys as usual 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.540
 I hope he likes you I send you a 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.459
 big kiss and see you passions 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.069
 first I use lai pencil mica 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.230
 white shimmer as a base in the center of the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.510
 my part of the piece of furniture is just below the 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.620
 my eyebrows subsequently fade 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.049
 all with a brush I go for 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.260
 use the mono core keys dry 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.530
 white to fix the pencil under the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.140
 eyebrows will lose an effect again 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.599
 more shimmer instead of use abbagnato 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.019
 this other beige color for the fold 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.019
 I'm going to blur this light blue that 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:50.170
 I'm going to step up to the inner corner 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:51.760
 and to stretch towards the outer corner is 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.500
 always in the fold of the eye for 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.540
 intensify the light blue applied 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.810
 previously I apply this blue more 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.980
 dark in this way I also go to give 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.980
 depth to eye makeup 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.260
 after cleaning up any excesses 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.930
 of eyeshadow finished on the lower part 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.940
 value use this mega eye pencil 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.680
 blue as an eyeliner on the eyelid 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.330
 that after I usually applied 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.820
 fake eyelashes that as always are 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:27.800
 optional I correct my dark circles 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:29.630
 using a concealer stick to 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.600
 open your eyes and to create a great one 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.520
 base for the colored masks that I will go 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.290
 to apply later I apply the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.800
 white pencil both inside the rhyme 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.520
 that on the lower lashes and only in the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.200
 bottom 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.090
 I'm going to apply the colored mascara 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.160
 group as you have seen the look of the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.560
 eyes is really very simple to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.170
 carry out immediately with the 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.540
 face makeup after having already achieved 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.330
 the base of zoe using a tint 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.430
 notifier and a chip to fix it I go 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.580
 immediately to take the new del pisa neither 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.220
 xperience browsing powder and this in 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.840
 coloring 02 and recreating with this a 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.440
 perfect account angers in a shade 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.440
 badly applied immediately under the cheekbone 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.930
 on the temples and under the forehead if you have 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.530
 the forehead as high as mine and also 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.810
 immediately below her jaw I use her 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.840
 but the mega white shimmer like 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.250
 illuminating above the high cheekbone and also 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.900
 a little on the temples 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.260
 obviously it has blurred with the beginning and 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.520
 notice the difference on one side of the face 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.560
 with the contouring to the other the same 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.480
 earth then I'm going to make an account 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.910
 very light ring also on the nose 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:50.140
 and always lit the center of the nose 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.180
 using her think white mega for 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:57.240
 I go to the lips to spread the thought 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.980
 a beige mega class this color news 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.750
 really beautiful very light but 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.210
 which at the same time in my opinion stands 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.300
 very well with a nice complexion like 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.770
 the one realized with the control ying 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.180
 since in this look he used 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.960
 the blues mascara on the lower lashes 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.820
 I show you other ways to use 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.290
 original colored mascara in 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.650
 this case after always applying 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.560
 the white pencil as a base on the eyelashes 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.500
 I spread the purple mascara here too 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.360
 on the lower lashes and for the eyelashes 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.510
 higher instead you can choose to 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.540
 apply the colored mascara only to the 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:39.280
 end of the eyelashes in this way or in 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.780
 alternative on all the eyelashes of 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.190
 boys and we have come to an end too 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.080
 of this video and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.290
 that I send a big kiss close to 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.290
 next one 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.319
 and law returns
