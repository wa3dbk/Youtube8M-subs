00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.030 
a decent design it's a little bit too
blocky<00:02:53.960> for<00:02:54.320> me<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.530> looks<00:02:54.680> like<00:02:54.740> it<00:02:54.890> was<00:02:54.980> made

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
blocky for me it looks like it was made

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.220 
blocky for me it looks like it was made
and<00:02:55.400> an<00:02:55.490> older<00:02:55.880> Lego<00:02:56.060> set<00:02:56.300> now<00:02:56.900> not<00:02:57.080> saying

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
and an older Lego set now not saying

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.360 
and an older Lego set now not saying
that's<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> really<00:02:57.650> bad<00:02:57.800> thing<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.190> could<00:02:58.310> be

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
that's a really bad thing it could be

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130 
that's a really bad thing it could be
very<00:02:58.670> accurate<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.150> TV<00:02:59.420> show<00:02:59.750> but<00:02:59.780> it<00:03:00.020> just

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
very accurate to the TV show but it just

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.810 
very accurate to the TV show but it just
kind<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.320> looks<00:03:00.380> a<00:03:00.560> little<00:03:00.650> bit<00:03:00.860> generic<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.790> me

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
kind of looks a little bit generic to me

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.980 
kind of looks a little bit generic to me
but<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.120> actually<00:03:02.360> kind<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.690> cool<00:03:02.840> design

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
but it's actually kind of a cool design

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.510 
but it's actually kind of a cool design
it<00:03:03.290> really<00:03:03.590> reminds<00:03:03.890> me<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.160> one<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.370> those

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
it really reminds me of one of those

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.400 
it really reminds me of one of those
things<00:03:04.790> from<00:03:05.060> Halo<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.780> Hornets<00:03:06.140> which<00:03:06.290> is

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
things from Halo the Hornets which is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.930 
things from Halo the Hornets which is
kind<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.650> interesting<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.280> does<00:03:07.400> rotate<00:03:07.610> right

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
kind of interesting it does rotate right

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.910 
kind of interesting it does rotate right
there<00:03:08.180> they're<00:03:08.630> also<00:03:08.780> all<00:03:09.050> do<00:03:09.380> flips<00:03:09.770> our

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
there they're also all do flips our

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.380 
there they're also all do flips our
missiles<00:03:10.220> one<00:03:10.430> on<00:03:10.550> either<00:03:10.700> side<00:03:10.820> right<00:03:11.030> there

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
missiles one on either side right there

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.450 
missiles one on either side right there
that's<00:03:12.050> decent<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:12.650> also<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.040> back<00:03:13.220> here

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
that's decent and also the back here

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.100 
that's decent and also the back here
looks<00:03:13.610> kind<00:03:13.820> of<00:03:13.880> cool<00:03:14.030> some<00:03:14.300> engine<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.930> nice

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
looks kind of cool some engine the nice

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
little flipping features and you can

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.150 
little flipping features and you can
easily<00:03:17.180> open<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> cockpit<00:03:17.990> to<00:03:18.680> reveal<00:03:18.980> no

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
easily open the cockpit to reveal no

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.400 
easily open the cockpit to reveal no
controls<00:03:19.640> but<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:19.940> can<00:03:20.150> fit<00:03:20.600> dr.<00:03:20.900> doom<00:03:21.050> inside

controls but you can fit dr. doom inside

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.110 
controls but you can fit dr. doom inside
there<00:03:21.620> like<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.580> cockpit<00:03:22.970> does

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
there like this and the cockpit does

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.490 
there like this and the cockpit does
close<00:03:23.390> pretty<00:03:23.690> easy<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.080> then<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.290> main

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
close pretty easy and then the main
