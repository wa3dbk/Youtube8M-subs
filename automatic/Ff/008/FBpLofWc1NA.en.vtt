00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 at the end of the game is steven opinion the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.290
 ser button and I directly charge it 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.019
 15 facebook page lest it 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.540
 that ends here check it very well 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.849
 what we have now are not 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.910
 game presentations but a glimpse 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.460
 of the future that will surely challenge your 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.460
 current vision of the game two of our 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.039
 more talented creators will give us a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.539
 glimpse of this concept process and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.900
 demonstrate what is possible when you 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.030
 combine ps4 with creativity 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:39.050
 unbridled then let's give them a great 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.050
 welcome to david cage de quantic dream 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.690
 when people ask me what is 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.280
 the feature you most want from the 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.870
 future hardware platforms my 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.830
 answer is always the same 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.840
 the emotion make the player 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.760
 participate emotionally is the saint 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.580
 Grail of all game creators 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.010
 we all try to unleash emotions 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.570
 diverse subtle we do that 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.220
 the players forget that 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.410
 it is simply a program that encourages 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.500
 pixels on the screen we do not want 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.350
 simply that they look something but what 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.979
 live and suspend your disbelief that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.420
 experience in that magical moment when 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.700
 lives in a different reality the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.460
 emotion is something complex and difficult to 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.800
 capture the transmit in the graphics 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.890
 animations sounds cinematography 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.590
 dialogue and obviously the game in a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.100
 medium as ours technology is 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.040
 very important is what we rely on 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.909
 to make the player participate 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.429
 emotionally 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.640
 if we look at the past some movies 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.549
 they were very emotional even though they were 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.219
 silent and in black and white but they were 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.530
 limited in their expression of stories 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.170
 simple ones that had to be counted under the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.030
 technological limits the actors must 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 exaggerate their movements to transmit 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.830
 your emotions the cameras just barely 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.530
 moved and lights and photography irma 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.940
 pains some concepts the cinema really 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.430
 it became what it is today 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.470
 when technology evolved as 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.379
 to allow filmmakers and actors 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.209
 to create subtle emotions of what 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.579
 they wanted the screen in the long run 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.709
 developed a sound color lights and 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.349
 higher resolution formats and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.569
 suddenly the public could see in 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.060
 the eyes of the actors when they were lying or 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:41.180
 when they were about to mourn pantomimes 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.180
 they were no longer necessary because the nuances 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.610
 it's more subtle than the emotion could be 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.760
 perceived on the screen with 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.760
 playstation 4 the games finally 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.830
 reached that stage 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:07.060
 in 1999 comic of first game of 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.660
 quantic dream had characters with 350 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.340
 polygons the most important characters 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:20.190
 of indigo in case they had 1500 polygons 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:24.250
 'heavy rain' 15,000 face had 20,000 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:28.600
 this year judi james shipments will have 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.890
 approximately 30 thousand polygons in 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.840
 Playstation 4 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.840
 this is what is offered to them 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.719
 when a climate has developed a new 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:44.659
 completely new engine what is good 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:47.870
 Real-time 3d is our first 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.019
 attempt to use skin shading 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.560
 with eyeshadow transparency 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.719
 Realistic realistic and volumetric lights 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.439
 Depth of field three times and many 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:02.150
 many other features that were 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.459
 only intended for movies 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.169
 this is quality and we know that 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.819
 we can go beyond the most important thing is 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.439
 which is of these technical characteristics 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.480
 is that we got to a point I could 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.459
 live subtle emotions in the face of 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.829
 a character we had not felt his 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.729
 emotions simply by looking at his face 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.889
 and we could see in his soul simply to 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.530
 look into the eyes when viewing from a distance 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.960
 we can imagine who he is 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.570
 think what has happened without the day 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.310
 a single word with psc 4 the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.960
 creators now you can forget about 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.729
 technological limitations and 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.190
 simply focus on inventing 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.410
 experiences never seen before we can 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.490
 focus on wonderful stories 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.500
 we want to tell and some incredible 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.330
 create we can take them to places that 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.759
 have never seen them before 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.910
 emotions that you have never felt in the 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.830
 real life without actually having 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.750
 the power to do it but not 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.750
 We only limits our imagination 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.920
 davis a little
