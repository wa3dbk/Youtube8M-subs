00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 With you a video review from the micro site . info 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.450
 today we will consider you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.670
 chinese magnetic earpiece 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.240
 This is the easiest option magnetic 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.210
 micro earphone which is generally available 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 the earphone market in russia is the most 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.260
 the cheapest option you can find the most 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.260
 plain 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.160
 He will approach many modern 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.869
 phone what he can do for 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.869
 connect three and a half millimeters 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:43.219
 this earphone is no longer powered by one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.219
 batteries from two batteries crown 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 power comes from 18 volts from 9 as 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:58.640
 ordinary size 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:05.280
 the microphone is here here 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:08.939
 adapters well how did it survive here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.500
 I want to connect the batteries right away 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.750
 note that the connector is not these 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.509
 inspire confidence as such 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.229
 but I think it is neat 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.450
 use the earpiece will work 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:32.240
 some time here here still here such 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.360
 The connector can be made for example 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.360
 connection 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.540
 from here make it possible future we 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.149
 make it better 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:51.110
 premium version of this earphone with 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:54.110
 reliable connectors well this time will tell 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.110
 connect 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:08.369
 but just want to say that the guarantee is not 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.610
 Here is the breakdown of these sections because 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.440
 that they are really even from their 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.630
 gently disconnect then they are in principle 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:24.630
 may eventually break here we are I 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.180
 I think that everybody was holding a soldering iron 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.420
 will be able to repair them but because 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.330
 sale here these connectors sell all sorts 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 electronics stores that is principle 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.430
 he i think will be ramon or fit like this 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.590
 Included are two magnets three on 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.570
 two millimeter extractor also if we 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.270
 we will do some improved version 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.250
 this earpiece then maybe we will do 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.020
 so the extractor will be made 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.700
 shrinking it will be convenient 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.940
 keep not like here 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.750
 the Chinese do it and check it 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.410
 works 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:21.680
 to the gorge of which they like the usual radio 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:25.549
 inflicted begins to vibrate and laid 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:33.020
 we see that the magnet vibrates 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:37.220
 Here you can even hear the music probably das licht 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.170
 and audible at the magnetic headphone 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.010
 Chinese one which we produce 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:48.230
 she is the same compared 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.660
 audibility is the same for this headset 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.900
 the antenna is slightly thicker and the power goes 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.370
 from two batteries 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.850
 what else about this one really doesn't want to 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:04.130
 say well, his price is much lower than 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.190
 even the one that we produce so 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:20.930
 let's next time 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:23.590
 in the middle of the battery chickens tanks also 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.590
 can be here 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.470
 watch no microchip all this 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.210
 assembly do you now 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.210
 demonstrate what's inside 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:55.710
 neatly connect and open it yourself 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:03.390
 amplifier block god amplifier made 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:09.420
 microcircuit lm386 m standard such 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:13.290
 we see microcircuit to solder with us 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.280
 here is the power principle if here these 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.860
 connectors you have over time 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.890
 tear up then take it to a person who 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.930
 able to solder and he can easily 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.330
 here even solder marking 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.820
 there is a battery minus battery plus then 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:42.270
 have this earbud repairable for sure 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:44.960
 there is nothing difficult here please do not 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.960
 will help you
