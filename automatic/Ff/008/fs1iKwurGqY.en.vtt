00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
to get a similar size when you're making

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.120 
to get a similar size when you're making
a<00:01:15.270> jalapeno<00:01:16.049> poppers<00:01:16.409> sometimes<00:01:16.890> very

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
a jalapeno poppers sometimes very

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.940 
a jalapeno poppers sometimes very
difficult<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.880> showing<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> two<00:01:18.630> ways

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
difficult so I'm showing you two ways

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.090 
difficult so I'm showing you two ways
wherein<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:21.680> I'm<00:01:22.680> cutting

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
wherein you can make this I'm cutting

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.670 
wherein you can make this I'm cutting
this<00:01:23.250> into<00:01:23.970> small<00:01:24.540> pieces<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:28.290> course<00:01:28.530> I'm

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this into small pieces and of course I'm

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
this into small pieces and of course I'm
going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> use<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.509> mix

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
going to use this as well in the mix

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.859 
going to use this as well in the mix
again<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:32.220> important<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.840> use

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
again it's very important that you use

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.499 
again it's very important that you use
gloves<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:35.369> working<00:01:35.400> with<00:01:35.939> these<00:01:36.119> chilies

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
gloves when working with these chilies

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.620 
gloves when working with these chilies
because<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:38.430> hurt<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.790> later<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
because it will really hurt you later so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.590 
because it will really hurt you later so
that's<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> reason<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.920> using<00:01:41.130> gloves<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that's the reason I'm using gloves the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
that's the reason I'm using gloves the
other<00:01:42.720> Chili's<00:01:43.079> what<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> done<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> have

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
other Chili's what I have done is I have

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.429 
other Chili's what I have done is I have
cut<00:01:44.460> lengthwise<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.869> tried<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.140> take

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cut lengthwise and I have tried to take

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
cut lengthwise and I have tried to take
whatever<00:01:46.770> seeds<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.399> could<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.729> taken<00:01:48.149> out

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
whatever seeds I could have taken out

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.520 
whatever seeds I could have taken out
from<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.439> chilies<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.780> will<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.899> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
from these chilies and so it will be it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
from these chilies and so it will be it
will<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.710> better<00:01:53.189> when<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> be

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
will be better when I'm going to be

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
will be better when I'm going to be
stuffing<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.439> cheese<00:01:55.860> stuffing<00:01:56.159> yeah

so<00:03:27.459> your<00:03:27.580> mix<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.940> ready<00:03:28.110> I'll<00:03:29.110> keep<00:03:29.349> it<00:03:29.470> on<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
so your mix is ready I'll keep it on the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:43.780 
so your mix is ready I'll keep it on the
side<00:03:30.000> I'm<00:03:31.000> trying<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.540> Chili's<00:03:31.780> up

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.500 

we're<00:03:44.390> taking<00:03:44.689> milk

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.170 

keeping<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.379> on<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:48.500> side<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.970> first

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
keeping it on the side and the first

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.670 
keeping it on the side and the first
step<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.510> we're<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.049> be<00:03:51.110> stuffing<00:03:51.530> our

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
step is we're going to be stuffing our

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.699 
step is we're going to be stuffing our
jalapenos<00:03:52.629> so<00:03:53.629> we<00:03:53.720> are<00:03:53.810> stuffing<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.319> the

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
jalapenos so we are stuffing this the

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.470 
jalapenos so we are stuffing this the
small<00:03:55.010> ones<00:03:55.250> these<00:03:56.030> are<00:03:56.239> not<00:03:56.390> blanched<00:03:58.480> so

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
small ones these are not blanched so

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.920 
small ones these are not blanched so
let's<00:03:59.689> do<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.989> stuffing<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.159> big<00:04:01.459> ones

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.420 

so<00:04:07.930> likewise<00:04:08.319> we<00:04:08.680> are<00:04:08.739> going<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:08.950> stuff<00:04:09.220> all

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
so likewise we are going to stuff all

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.390 
so likewise we are going to stuff all
our<00:04:10.209> peppers<00:04:10.660> so<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.440> first<00:04:11.680> step<00:04:11.890> to<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.220> is

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
our peppers so the first step to this is

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.580 
our peppers so the first step to this is
now<00:04:12.610> because<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.510> slimy<00:04:13.750> nature<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.379> the

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
now because of the slimy nature of the

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.170 
now because of the slimy nature of the
jalapenos<00:04:15.220> it's<00:04:15.459> difficult<00:04:15.879> to<00:04:15.940> do<00:04:16.060> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
jalapenos it's difficult to do the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.000 
jalapenos it's difficult to do the
coming<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:16.989> we<00:04:17.109> are<00:04:17.200> dipping<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.590> in<00:04:17.739> milk

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
coming so we are dipping this in milk

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.330 
coming so we are dipping this in milk
and<00:04:20.250> then<00:04:21.870> we<00:04:22.870> are<00:04:22.960> going<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.139> be<00:04:23.320> dipping<00:04:24.100> in

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and then we are going to be dipping in

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.920 
and then we are going to be dipping in
the<00:04:24.460> flour<00:04:25.260> lightly<00:04:26.260> dust<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:31.060> now<00:04:31.240> we're

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
the flour lightly dust it and now we're

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.990 
the flour lightly dust it and now we're
going<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.139> dip<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:33.100> again<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.880> milk<00:04:34.090> and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
going to dip it again in the milk and

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.340 
going to dip it again in the milk and
after<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:39.720> this<00:04:40.720> will<00:04:40.870> go<00:04:41.050> in<00:04:41.200> the

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
after this this will go in the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:49.650 
after this this will go in the
breadcrumb<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:47.440> it's<00:04:47.560> always<00:04:48.010> good<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.660> work

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
breadcrumb so it's always good to work

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.510 
breadcrumb so it's always good to work
with<00:04:49.690> one<00:04:49.990> more<00:04:50.169> one<00:04:50.530> more<00:04:50.560> friend<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.190> yours

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
or one of our another family member

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.450 
or one of our another family member
because<00:04:54.520> doing<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.570> all<00:04:55.720> together<00:04:55.900> alone<00:04:56.560> will

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
because doing it all together alone will

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.909 
because doing it all together alone will
be<00:04:57.639> slightly<00:04:58.090> difficult<00:04:58.419> now<00:04:59.200> what<00:04:59.500> we<00:04:59.620> can<00:04:59.770> do

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
be slightly difficult now what we can do

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.980 
be slightly difficult now what we can do
to<00:05:00.070> this<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.430> we<00:05:00.850> can<00:05:01.000> keep<00:05:01.150> in<00:05:01.330> our<00:05:01.419> D<00:05:01.720> freezer

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
to this is we can keep in our D freezer

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.260 
to this is we can keep in our D freezer
you<00:05:02.350> know<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.710> few<00:05:02.830> days<00:05:03.040> as<00:05:03.250> well<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.700> use

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
you know for a few days as well and use

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.600 
you know for a few days as well and use
it<00:05:04.419> as<00:05:04.570> and<00:05:04.750> when<00:05:04.870> required<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:06.490> know

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
it as and when required and you know

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.920 
it as and when required and you know
surely<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.090> need<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.330> put<00:05:07.510> it<00:05:07.570> in<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.720> fridge

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
surely you need to put it in the fridge

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.360 
surely you need to put it in the fridge
for<00:05:07.960> some<00:05:08.290> time<00:05:08.500> before<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:08.889> start<00:05:09.160> frying

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
for some time before you start frying

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.040 
for some time before you start frying
this<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.120> we<00:05:10.240> are<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:10.389> to<00:05:10.479> keep<00:05:10.630> this<00:05:10.810> in<00:05:10.870> the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
this so we are going to keep this in the

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.469 
this so we are going to keep this in the
fridge<00:05:11.229> for<00:05:11.289> some<00:05:11.620> time<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.010> we<00:05:12.940> will<00:05:13.090> do<00:05:13.300> the

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
fridge for some time and we will do the

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.460 
fridge for some time and we will do the
other<00:05:13.600> ones<00:05:13.840> as<00:05:14.020> well

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
other ones as well

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.180 
other ones as well
so<00:05:14.889> as<00:05:15.010> we<00:05:15.160> are<00:05:15.190> dipping<00:05:15.550> this<00:05:15.700> in<00:05:16.030> milk<00:05:16.419> and

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
so as we are dipping this in milk and

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.779 
so as we are dipping this in milk and
then<00:05:18.190> in<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.240> floor<00:05:19.950> see<00:05:20.950> basically<00:05:21.340> this<00:05:21.610> is

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
then in the floor see basically this is

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.610 
then in the floor see basically this is
the<00:05:22.150> most<00:05:22.389> tricky<00:05:22.630> part<00:05:22.930> of<00:05:23.080> doing<00:05:23.380> the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
the most tricky part of doing the

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.700 
the most tricky part of doing the
jalapeno<00:05:24.180> purposes<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.479> coating<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:25.930> well<00:05:26.139> so

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
jalapeno purposes to coating it well so

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.260 
jalapeno purposes to coating it well so
when<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:26.979> blanch<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.520> actually<00:05:28.000> it<00:05:28.120> also

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
when you blanch it actually it also

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.320 
when you blanch it actually it also
becomes<00:05:28.630> slightly<00:05:28.930> easier<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:30.370> coat<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:30.760> with

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
becomes slightly easier to coat it with

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.820 
becomes slightly easier to coat it with
the<00:05:31.360> with<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.870> flour<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.440> then<00:05:32.620> the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
the with the flour and then the

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.650 
the with the flour and then the
breadcrumbs<00:05:33.190> as<00:05:33.400> well<00:05:33.610> but<00:05:34.060> you<00:05:34.210> have<00:05:34.419> to<00:05:34.539> do

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
breadcrumbs as well but you have to do

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.779 
breadcrumbs as well but you have to do
at<00:05:34.870> least<00:05:34.900> twice<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.919> coating<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.669> know

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
at least twice the coating you know

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.120 
at least twice the coating you know
sometimes<00:05:37.419> even<00:05:37.720> thrice<00:05:38.410> you<00:05:38.710> know<00:05:38.800> otherwise

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
sometimes even thrice you know otherwise

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.980 
sometimes even thrice you know otherwise
the<00:05:39.490> cheese<00:05:39.669> might<00:05:39.880> start<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.330> come<00:05:40.479> out<00:05:40.510> who's

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
the cheese might start to come out who's

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.010 
the cheese might start to come out who's
out<00:05:41.200> on<00:05:41.680> frying<00:05:42.160> so<00:05:42.520> just<00:05:43.000> make<00:05:43.150> sure<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.539> you

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
out on frying so just make sure that you

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.340 
out on frying so just make sure that you
know<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.260> other<00:05:44.410> good<00:05:45.100> other<00:05:45.970> good<00:05:46.270> tip<00:05:47.139> would

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
know the other good other good tip would

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.770 
know the other good other good tip would
be<00:05:47.530> that<00:05:47.800> once<00:05:48.550> you<00:05:48.760> do<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:49.000> coating<00:05:49.389> let<00:05:49.660> it

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
be that once you do the coating let it

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.080 
be that once you do the coating let it
dry<00:05:50.020> off<00:05:50.260> for<00:05:50.590> some<00:05:50.770> time<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:51.280> then<00:05:51.639> again<00:05:51.760> put

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
dry off for some time and then again put

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.969 
dry off for some time and then again put
in<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.270> milk<00:05:52.450> and<00:05:52.630> do<00:05:52.870> that<00:05:53.080> twice<00:05:53.440> so<00:05:53.919> you

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
in the milk and do that twice so you

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.219 
in the milk and do that twice so you
have<00:05:54.160> a<00:05:54.190> better<00:05:54.370> coating<00:05:54.789> to<00:05:55.030> your<00:05:55.240> jalapeno

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
have a better coating to your jalapeno

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.400 
have a better coating to your jalapeno
poppers<00:05:56.620> we<00:05:57.430> have<00:05:57.520> added<00:05:57.940> this<00:05:58.090> into<00:05:58.990> milk

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
poppers we have added this into milk

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.230 
poppers we have added this into milk
again<00:05:59.710> and<00:05:59.919> now<00:06:00.370> we<00:06:00.430> are<00:06:00.610> going<00:06:00.729> to<00:06:00.789> be<00:06:00.910> coating

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
again and now we are going to be coating

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.510 
again and now we are going to be coating
with<00:06:01.419> our<00:06:01.570> bread<00:06:01.780> crumbs

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.170 

as<00:06:06.199> I've<00:06:07.199> seasoned<00:06:07.620> my<00:06:07.740> flour<00:06:08.160> a<00:06:08.430> bit<00:06:08.699> so<00:06:09.120> I'm

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
as I've seasoned my flour a bit so I'm

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:31.850 
as I've seasoned my flour a bit so I'm
going<00:06:09.360> to<00:06:09.389> give<00:06:09.570> another<00:06:09.690> coat<00:06:10.350> of<00:06:10.380> it

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.800 

and<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.490> goes<00:06:32.669> in<00:06:32.879> the<00:06:32.970> fridge<00:06:34.610> so<00:06:35.610> as<00:06:35.759> I<00:06:35.810> boil

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
and it goes in the fridge so as I boil

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.360 
and it goes in the fridge so as I boil
is<00:06:37.020> hot<00:06:37.229> enough<00:06:37.379> and<00:06:37.800> we<00:06:38.039> are<00:06:38.099> going<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.280> be

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
is hot enough and we are going to be

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.210 
is hot enough and we are going to be
putting<00:06:38.580> our<00:06:39.409> jalapeno<00:06:40.409> poppers<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.949> small

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
putting our jalapeno poppers the small

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.980 
putting our jalapeno poppers the small
one

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.560 

so<00:06:47.990> we<00:06:48.080> just<00:06:48.290> need<00:06:48.440> a<00:06:48.500> golden-brown<00:06:48.890> color<00:06:49.570> and

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
so we just need a golden-brown color and

00:06:50.570 --> 00:07:01.770 
so we just need a golden-brown color and
we<00:06:50.720> are<00:06:50.780> taking<00:06:51.110> it<00:06:51.200> out

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.630 

so<00:07:02.410> now<00:07:02.530> we<00:07:02.590> are<00:07:02.770> going<00:07:02.890> to<00:07:02.950> be<00:07:03.010> frying<00:07:03.280> our<00:07:03.490> big

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
so now we are going to be frying our big

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.680 
so now we are going to be frying our big
ones<00:07:08.700> so<00:07:09.700> this<00:07:09.850> again<00:07:10.120> we<00:07:10.330> are<00:07:10.420> going<00:07:10.570> to<00:07:10.630> be
