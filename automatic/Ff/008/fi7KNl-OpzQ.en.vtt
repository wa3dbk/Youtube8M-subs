00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.100 
I guess jumping ship because they don't
like<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> game<00:02:33.570> you're<00:02:33.720> playing<00:02:33.960> because

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
like the game you're playing because

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.270 
like the game you're playing because

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's not the game that they would

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.240 
it's not the game that they would
typically<00:02:35.520> play<00:02:36.320> because<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.500> I'm<00:02:37.890> not<00:02:38.070> one<00:02:38.220> of
