00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello welcome to tempo plain 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.730
 chrome steel and today we have another one 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 video for you why not tips and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.420
 tricks it is a small series that will be 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.599
 status will come occasionally 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.550
 whole for servants and that is so we 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.000
 so many experiences with 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.529
 minecraft would pee and play vivaro 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.740
 We've been to the battle 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 project with us and we have insights 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.429
 pretty good in minecraft and believe 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.380
 I would like our tips 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 that will be pretty good 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.450
 Become the world a bit further 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.130
 bring 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 and yes I would say we drive then 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.399
 this is the first one here 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.079
 The result is then the same as the tip 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.700
 1 so start today 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.680
 we will go and we will come 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 beforehand we want such a whole 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.700
 start series how to win why there 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.190
 is also good start to do so 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.660
 and that these tips do know the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 But most of us want it anyway 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 because if we do not do that and it 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.870
 is just too warm then we come 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.870
 Just to the tip 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.240
 Tip number one is you running in the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.460
 middle or running away but if you are in 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.020
 the middle is running here is first tip in 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.000
 the box is mostly about true 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.619
 I guess earth and so distributed and 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.740
 in the middle the good things that is good 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.500
 if you say good again 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.030
 For example, a sword in a matter of minutes 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.789
 rausholen but important is also apples 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.399
 can you get not so fast so 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.539
 Let's see what important things I am 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.990
 would then quickly on the things 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.579
 click 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.469
 but it would be good if he 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.970
 would run away because otherwise we can 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.009
 to be dead but there are still others 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.110
 other trick of the games would be betrayed 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.750
 How to find apple like apple finds here 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 we have already seen here 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.329
 run away that it types numero two 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.390
 decades of writing now that you 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.909
 when sprinting does not jump that is 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.770
 sprinting jumping jumps a lot 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.610
 hungry and consumed them opportunity 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.039
 rather dissuade 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.729
 and then when the first pop arrived 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.429
 time I would do it all 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.709
 and each two tree trunks 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.780
 break down and then become a one webman 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.510
 sports and makes a sword 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 that's the way to get started 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.400
 the work came then immediately went to it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.109
 ward off and kill animals, here we come 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.489
 run away right at the tip when I want 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.620
 recommend that you first far away 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.690
 runs until you reach a height first 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.730
 a bit sorry run away the good 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.530
 this is the way we went 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.079
 For example, if pig or pig 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.250
 animals city ​​all feet because the ss names 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.560
 I do not want to eat that right now 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.970
 but only if you really 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.620
 needed because it could be too 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.450
 also paten that we bring through more 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.700
 and I would recommend that to you again 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:50.739
 take all the cane that is on 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.660
 In any case, an important tip 4 is that 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.169
 were before you go into a cover 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.319
 enough meat from animals for example 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.700
 to be that for every one of me because one 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.790
 Height is when you 're pretty 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.160
 fast and that's pretty long down 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.410
 because in the rolling mill after information 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.250
 we until now, we have in fact no 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.380
 given fires 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.780
 and if there is no escape there is 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.240
 A few tips less than us 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.520
 actually expected 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.260
 because with drinking we would of course have one 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:27.410
 to make many more tips about brown 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:30.510
 but of course everyone around 16 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.400
 logs you always have to go for 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.230
 picking sticks forces 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.600
 Of course, leather is needed too 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.540
 you can not only do that in the 1.8 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.160
 the cows kill but also the horses 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.130
 to get songs because you have to 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.080
 Of course I also do our books 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.160
 of course, another one too 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.320
 Tip the sugarcane I would not 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.570
 cope but grow first because 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.370
 In the beginning, the whole people would not be 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.880
 on same people looking so 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.500
 recommend that we do not produce after 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.510
 so short was not produced less 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.960
 before I attack here are such 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.030
 could 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.230
 but now it's on board what you 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.320
 so you then a bit more 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.730
 that was so of tip 54 is it then 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.740
 is it then that they fast 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.090
 Food that is remembered is one 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.560
 cave or a small gorge at 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.820
 best cave because he is not for people 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.140
 purely at a gorge pulls you 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.770
 maybe the people a bit the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.900
 United States 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.450
 then I would like myself in a cave 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.570
 i have a lot of iron family all the while 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.200
 you then 24 first need one for 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.120
 Preparing for a sword +3 he for 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.060
 a pickaxe that's the beginning 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.970
 equip, I would say so, and if any 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.610
 if you have about 29 m this is me 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.470
 whole for everyone in three or four ovens 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.270
 you melt that off quickly 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.790
 even gets in the first episode 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.290
 In any case, really good then you can 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.140
 her in the second episode so ne 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.710
 make the little ones or the round ones 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.370
 learn that we will move on to the next one 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.340
 camp 6 yes the exit is about the small 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.990
 in the cave and that gives of course 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.830
 many tips require a bit 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.830
 get longer 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.180
 the train and that if you see redstone 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.949
 then I would be our modern one 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.969
 build roadster because there are quite a few 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.590
 often you if you are now if now 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.669
 doesnt think i think thats what you do 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.669
 just a long walk 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.729
 you can because you are then 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.560
 chance increases a bit then see 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.870
 you for this find yes and what if 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.699
 now you in the cave and want 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.949
 I would therefore have the right height 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.120
 recommend twelve or thirteen and me 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.770
 I want to recommend that we have the sound 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.780
 makes loud because then hear sounds 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.099
 nice because i will be beautiful as lava is 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.050
 and then we will not award 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.669
 burned because that just sounds natural 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.669
 is important if you are there then that 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.830
 short, even if you find that, I would 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.599
 you were so I in the room how much they 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.629
 are large animals and not perhaps the 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:59.099
 subways could also be in zb then 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.990
 this long devastating direction 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.060
 That's why I would do that 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.759
 training I only know how much the 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.680
 I have and secondly who is there what 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.939
 is all around and if I'm the easy one 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.099
 can break down without the 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:13.289
 running windows etc 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.719
 You do not need oliver once 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.180
 but what once because then you can 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:20.610
 delete you from al arian and if you 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.840
 then you would be pure power and height 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.550
 I with service and build myself with 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.740
 you do not get away so soon 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.219
 where he can play in the side of the 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.589
 other people around then I would if you 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:35.069
 districts handle and have matthias 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:37.800
 I would make myself a charter and the 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:41.250
 make deals to the sword and with the 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.810
 sugar and leather books and aunts 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.279
 we come at the sign because that 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.800
 at first the beginning 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:51.509
 so i would say that because am 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.460
 at the beginning also very much longer 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:55.560
 There would still be how to do it correctly 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.020
 Do not copy the combos etc 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.550
 that will also come in successes 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.440
 but we wanted small at first simply 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.539
 just have the beginning and that was it from 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.819
 this new format maybe industry 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:07.169
 or pilots have seen the driver 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.560
 then I would definitely 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:14.599
 happy and what are you doing far from this 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.599
 video and see you next time
