if you want to do is you want to make

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.570 
if you want to do is you want to make
sure<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.020> take<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.200> weight<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.220> look<00:02:25.370> at

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
sure you take a weight and you look at

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.770 
sure you take a weight and you look at
it<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.900> curvature<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:28.459> weight

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it so the curvature of this weight

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.720 
it so the curvature of this weight
there's<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.900> deeper<00:02:30.260> intention<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:31.430> where

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
there's a deeper intention that's where
