00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.770 
playing around this for the last 20
minutes<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:40.220> I'm<00:03:40.940> not<00:03:41.060> really<00:03:41.180> getting<00:03:41.420> very

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
minutes and I'm not really getting very

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.100 
minutes and I'm not really getting very
far<00:03:41.959> that's<00:03:42.350> where<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.560> show<00:03:42.740> you<00:03:42.800> something<00:03:44.110> to

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
far that's where I show you something to

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.180 
far that's where I show you something to
get<00:03:45.230> used<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.620> why<00:03:45.800> you're<00:03:45.920> doing<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:46.220> is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
get used to why you're doing this is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.620 
get used to why you're doing this is
basically<00:03:49.190> looking<00:03:49.550> around<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.209> figured<00:03:50.510> how

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
basically looking around and figured how

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.810 
basically looking around and figured how
through<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.410> do<00:03:51.620> things<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.489> if<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.640> hold<00:03:52.760> your

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
through to do things so if you hold your

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.640 
through to do things so if you hold your
shift<00:03:53.120> key<00:03:53.300> down<00:03:53.330> while<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:54.170> move<00:03:54.320> your<00:03:54.470> mouse

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
shift key down while you move your mouse

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.220 
shift key down while you move your mouse
you'll<00:03:55.280> rotate<00:03:55.459> around<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.300> selected<00:03:57.110> object

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
you'll rotate around the selected object

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.600 
you'll rotate around the selected object
like<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.930> now<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.250> click

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
like this now if you just click

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.750 
like this now if you just click
something<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.090> move<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.630> they<00:04:03.530> will<00:04:03.709> move<00:04:03.920> as

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
something and move it they will move as

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.780 
something and move it they will move as
for<00:04:05.150> rotating<00:04:05.720> it<00:04:05.810> i'm<00:04:06.020> not<00:04:06.080> sure<00:04:06.890> but<00:04:09.640> this<00:04:10.640> is

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
for rotating it i'm not sure but this is

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.210 
for rotating it i'm not sure but this is
definitely<00:04:11.090> interesting<00:04:11.750> i<00:04:12.230> went<00:04:13.100> through

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
definitely interesting i went through

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.979 
definitely interesting i went through
the<00:04:13.250> tutorial<00:04:13.760> start<00:04:14.030> with<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.300> tutorial<00:04:14.450> and

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
the tutorial start with the tutorial and

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.960 
the tutorial start with the tutorial and
definitely<00:04:15.890> helps<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.280> do<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:16.760> like<00:04:16.940> i

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
definitely helps to do that and like i

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.750 
definitely helps to do that and like i
said<00:04:17.090> before<00:04:17.299> i'm<00:04:17.930> not<00:04:18.230> a<00:04:18.260> modder<00:04:18.590> I'm<00:04:18.799> not<00:04:19.070> you
