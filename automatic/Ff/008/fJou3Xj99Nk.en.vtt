00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
what tire character development actually

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.250 
what tire character development actually
emphasized<00:00:48.580> on<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:49.269> was<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.510> part<00:00:49.870> where<00:00:50.049> she

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
emphasized on it was the part where she

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.840 
emphasized on it was the part where she
actually<00:00:50.409> learnt<00:00:50.830> to<00:00:51.010> accept<00:00:51.159> who<00:00:51.610> she<00:00:51.640> is

actually learnt to accept who she is

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.910 
actually learnt to accept who she is
instead<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.659> wanting<00:00:52.900> to<00:00:53.019> be<00:00:53.229> someone<00:00:53.650> else

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
instead of wanting to be someone else

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.189 
instead of wanting to be someone else
and<00:00:54.159> so<00:00:54.580> I<00:00:54.610> really<00:00:55.119> say<00:00:55.269> that<00:00:55.510> was<00:00:55.690> some<00:00:55.930> really

good character Mellon especially for

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.280

someone<00:00:58.150> I<00:00:58.299> could<00:00:58.420> actually<00:00:58.540> transform<00:00:58.930> into

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
tokhes character that he comes off as a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.760 
tokhes character that he comes off as a
bit<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.130> an<00:03:06.460> asshole<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:07.030> guess<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:07.960> here<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.590> my

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
bit of an asshole I guess but here is my

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.770 
bit of an asshole I guess but here is my
entire<00:03:09.070> assumption<00:03:09.910> on<00:03:10.030> his<00:03:10.270> character

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
entire assumption on his character

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.680 
entire assumption on his character
pretty<00:03:11.410> much<00:03:11.620> he<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.460> a<00:03:12.640> tsundere<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.390> he

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
pretty much he is like a tsundere and he

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.630 
pretty much he is like a tsundere and he
doesn't<00:03:14.620> want<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.950> express<00:03:15.220> his<00:03:15.340> feelings

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
doesn't want to express his feelings

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.460 
doesn't want to express his feelings
he's<00:03:15.760> pretty<00:03:15.940> much<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.090> guy<00:03:16.450> equivalent<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.320> a

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
he's pretty much the guy equivalent of a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.220 
he's pretty much the guy equivalent of a
tsundere<00:03:17.800> so<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:19.060> that's<00:03:19.540> exactly<00:03:20.020> what

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
tsundere so really that's exactly what
