00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.830
 car seat load on the spine 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.290
 minimal because always in touch 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 with a back on a larger area 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.859
 distributed it not on the strap not on 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.140
 strap area and over a larger area 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 shoulders in place spine in place 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.510
 internal brain overloads 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.210
 organs are fine 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.429
 either the second option is now the highest 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 indicators show car seat with 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 passive airbag is not here 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.540
 body is held and the child along with 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 head childhood forward ie he 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 lies down and the corner of Sochi does not exceed 45 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.489
 degrees as opposed to 5 point 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.620
 belt where the body is held but not 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.379
 keep head 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.270
 plus there is such an important factor account 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.309
 groin trauma up that is for boys 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.660
 a very difficult child to me being Aubrey 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.109
 can get a groin injury 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.170
 that is, after 20 years can haunt 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.000
 injury before road accident 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.519
 these pillows are safer than you 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.470
 besides, that is, there is not really 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.990
 good maker who can't 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 hold this table that is he should 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 also fixed in the chair now 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.810
 according to the new rules children need 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 carry in children hold 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.120
 devices that include car seat 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.780
 or other devices ie 90 percent 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.030
 come and say 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.250
 give a booster for a four year old they are not 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 adapted boosters are used 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.120
 only for children who are over 150 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 centimeters and that don't fit 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.770
 standard chair up to 12 years 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.870
 they are dangerous in a frontal strike that is 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.720
 they change the design of the belt 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.730
 security so when a child doesn't 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.950
 strapped on it bad when baby 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.470
 small below 150 centimeters 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 strapped on it is also bad because 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.500
 belt 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.370
 anything below 150 centimeters passes 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.770
 on the chest 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.210
 and overlaps the larynx with a sharp 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.760
 braking child gets hurt 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.740
 larynx second lower part of the belt behind 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.230
 narrow pelvic expense the children slip and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.960
 The belt does not hit the pelvic bones until 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.000
 holding exactly goes bump belly where 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.430
 internal organs 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.890
 that is, it is a combination wound 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.960
 internal organs in prices that is, we 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.150
 focus on crash test dc and 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.400
 minimum recommended price there in 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.340
 Europe up to the most inexpensive armchair 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.750
 I repeat from one and a half to 12 years on 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.290
 ten years of use 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.660
 it costs about 59 euros that is with us 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.900
 it starts as far as I know online 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.440
 shops from 16000 tenge for 10 years 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.200
 use divide it by 10 years 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.660
 1600 money in one year of use when 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.890
 this chair will guarantee the average 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.150
 load degree uncritically and average 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.730
 average crash that is not 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.550
 panic now a lot of that where 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.800
 and so on so now up to the market 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.739

 in fact, in a week we sold 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.100
 two-month supply 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.739
 when it was before you understand for week 75 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.910
 percent of car seats are installed 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.540
 wrong in the world it is in a civilized 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.610

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.959
 isofix 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.170
 our car here is equipped with 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.400
 fix and we put guides for 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.450
 isofix and in guides 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:37.600
