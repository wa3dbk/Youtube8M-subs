00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello everyone keep miksovat on witches 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.870
 this time I only have 4 pieces 2 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 Golimaya again I have 28 magicians king 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.630
 Queen of the 4 hills sang in the slopes of the weather to us 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 because they will not do it just 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 I will release the rebound 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.650
 the very end when some 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.670
 d will act as goblins let's say 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.340
 so true the cost of these 4 we see 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.620
 one thousand black elixir is obtained 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.770
 yes, but we see the enemy 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 some resources 200 thousand gold 300,000 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.140
 elixir and 1300 black understandably not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.870
 elixir her black i'm not here at all 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 fighting off but at least earning some gold 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.180
 by the way a very interesting enemy base 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 two first crossbow principle pdf he 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.030
 probably 8 8 t x more than 9 and the fence 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.559
 the fence is very interesting with him 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.430
 dominated by fence 6 10 7 and 8 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.970
 there are 9 left fence very interesting 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.040
 paws 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.049
 I'm used to a little bit different experience 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.780
 first there in order everything about them 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.180
 totally 10 by 2 3 but there are such 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.460
 Now it turns out that the guys like this on 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.290
 especially forget it so well 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.080
 back let's kinda in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.119
 mid-middle main group all 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.009
 being treated 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.619
 even apparently some have already passed a couple 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.450
 see left left a couple of species right yet 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.640
 many mages left king of king usm 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.930
 he finishes the queen still alive 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.210
 healthy a couple of golems 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.329
 also alive and well and also distracting 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.899
 distracted by df yes nothing together 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.630
 there is at least bad two of them 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.509
 golem dodat one and tighter wall bottles 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.979
 so that they were on different sides 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.000
 distracted df that we will now see in 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.160
 gun principle 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.160
 guns bows mortars took them over 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.009
 witch glasses because the bags are alive and well 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.390
 the middle here is another one still alive 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.030
 enters releases your style and tones as well 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.430
 it's not bad as we see the style and tone 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.060
 also fulfills the role of defo treatment 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.810
 yourself cannons there any 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.360
 try to shoot at with kelly tone 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.400
 in general, everything is clear and understandable to all 100 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.800
 percent it turns out to demolish this base she 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.410
 pretty simple easy but not 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.620
 less and golems 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.610
 I don't have witches too, but 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.670
 magicians name and magic 5 have made their do 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.790
 100 percent by the way I decided 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.500
 be sure to swing golems after love 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.470
 I have set up a lava on the way now 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.810
 two three four days required 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:59.600
 I 'll put the golems on 2 well I will about these 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.970
 until the end on your nines to 4 levla and 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400
 because the golem is very necessary right now 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.790
 frequent uses especially on to you not 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.890
 only in mixes but in top mixes but 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.870
 also for you maniac long as on 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.310
 the destruction of the king with the queen there and so 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.370
 further bulat will golem apathy 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.209
 but the second opponent is already more serious 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.370
 In principle, this is the maximum nine 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.690
 crossbow 3 left rds does not interest us 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.570
 cannon bows 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:36.590
 she only has his magicians tower of magicians 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.980
 Until there were two from as well in principle 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.720
 it's fu nine let bows 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.660
 clearing let's see man will 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.280
 interesting a couple golems went 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.970
 kind of tricky him such a base so 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.989
 say inviting 2 inside this we and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.760
 let's use almost all magicians i 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.010
 already released behind the foot mercy 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.880
 buildings you phrase throw hill i'm 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.829
 did because yes and decided not to go 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.709
 all the same not the middle decided to go they 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.650
 left why not dude go left 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:14.090
 until then I hope they will go for 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.519
 the middle one golem decided yet 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.030
 finish off 9 the fence does not catch it turns out 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.270
 very very hard they manage so 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.530
 released her 6 see again on 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.810
 the suit was magicians 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.720
 is not very fast but I think the beat 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.330
 nine yes excellent very quickly that only 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.920
 the fence immediately ran a bunch just 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:41.280
 skeletons cool mixed on themselves from 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.040
 legal our carbolic but mortar them 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.300
 very quickly destroy 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.520
 finishing off they finish by the way yes everything 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.470
 great they pass the middle but touch 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.830
 very interesting that the bomb exploded 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.290
 very interesting in radius everyone was 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.610
 who are witches around magicians style and tone and 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.960
 bing separated just two rows 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.080
 the fence from the bomb and everything was destroyed just 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.390
 little little health see our magicians 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.310
 I did not take anything, well, I principle 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.660
 took two stars all 4 percent and 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:23.700
 wrecked full nine but it's just 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.770
 such garbage I will say bye-bye witch 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.230
 first lvela me not particularly impress 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.630
 I'll be about these at level 2 and I don't know 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.820
 just where they can be applied just not 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.580
 I know how they play better than goblin 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.060
 fix for stay fix on this all 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.060
 bye everyone
