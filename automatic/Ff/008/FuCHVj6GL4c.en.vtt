00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:05.680
 in the weekend with the sun that combines with the sport in the parks and alias green 

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:10.630
 of the city who practices running regularly knows that the benefits I will 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.369
 more than contact with nature 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.629
 I'm much more excited to delegate 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.939
 I think the work has come to know the work 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.929
 the race helps to relax even those who lead a life 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.809
 if the fast pace if I were to focus more I am a person 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:28.989
 also calmer 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.250
 on the last 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.609
 very strange very 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.370
 anxiety 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.340
 That's what helped me in this. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.620
 the sport that just demands that they jersey and shorts have no limits and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.460
 change the habit of the people amadeu changed the cigarette addiction by the race 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.480
 It's been 15 years I've done half marathon marathons like every night but before 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.850
 to practice the race you must have a medical orientation depending on the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.700
 forrÃ³ with you will set different intensities 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.160
 and exercise plans 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.410
 different will depend on the person's body and the desire that it has 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 run 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 basically try to person was 110 pounds I'm with 21 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.760
 I want to get to 85 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.810
 the highest caloric expenditure is not directly linked to running fast 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.869
 the same person that almost 15 miles per hour can be spending less calorie 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.380
 not that he was running behind 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.680
 it's a weight loss 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.630
 I prefer intensity that will provide fat or carbohydrate burning or 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.920
 pose by performing high-intensity exercises and 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.350
 allows you today to make a control through the heart rate 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.550
 using frequency meters are clocks that make reading frequency 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.040
 card and allows you found the sentence to hold for a while 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.030
 quite prolonged 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 according to the physiologist should never run fast 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.490
 before training you need a light diet 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.759
 it is necessary that there is force energy these are the carbohydrates 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.340
 will be able to sustain the exercise and that we have an advantage 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.049
 in the race as much pleasure to sing or to touch of the body responds correctly of the 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:03.740
 sport
