is<00:01:14.130> delete<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> messer<00:01:14.940> in<00:01:15.570> folder<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
is delete the messer in folder and I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.960 
is delete the messer in folder and I
find<00:01:17.910> this<00:01:18.030> helps<00:01:18.539> sort<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.679> error<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.880> if

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
find this helps sort out the error so if

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.430 
find this helps sort out the error so if
it<00:01:21.030> didn't<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> msre<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.869> FIFA<00:01:22.080> game<00:01:22.229> black

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440

it didn't the msre and FIFA game black
screen<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> whatnot<00:01:23.849> but<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.630> should<00:01:24.899> fix

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
right and I might provide a link to as

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.830 
right and I might provide a link to as
well<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.410> also<00:01:50.730> test<00:01:51.730> out<00:01:52.030> if<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:52.450> can

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
well so you can also test out if I can

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.390 
well so you can also test out if I can
find<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.530> link<00:01:53.650> birthing<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.530> what<00:02:00.250> we're<00:02:00.340> gonna

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
find a link birthing so what we're gonna

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.340 
find a link birthing so what we're gonna
do<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.910> put<00:02:01.360> item<00:02:02.110> on<00:02:02.770> an<00:02:03.010> untried<00:02:03.190> table<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
do is put item on an untried table and

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.430 
do is put item on an untried table and
as<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.590> can<00:02:05.740> see<00:02:05.860> here<00:02:06.040> by<00:02:06.160> hovering<00:02:06.400> over<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
to so for instance it will get

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.790 
to so for instance it will get
