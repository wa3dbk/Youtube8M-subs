done<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:52.649> gonna<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> other<00:00:53.190> side

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
done so we're gonna do the other side

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
done so we're gonna do the other side
again<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.750> pick<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.140> hair<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> roll<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.209 
again just pick up the hair and roll it
up<00:00:56.539> if<00:00:57.539> you're<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.719> used<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> doing<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.649> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
up if you're not used to doing this it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830 
up if you're not used to doing this it
might<00:00:59.550> take<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> little<00:01:00.030> bit<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.210> practice<00:01:00.600> but

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
might take a little bit of practice but

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
might take a little bit of practice but
it's<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> lot<00:01:02.309> easier<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.820> anything

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it's probably a lot easier than anything

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.840 
it's probably a lot easier than anything
else<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.750> you've<00:01:03.899> done<00:01:04.339> make<00:01:05.339> sure<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> grab

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
very trivial step but I'm just gonna

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.009

twists<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.540> braided<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.740> roots<00:03:54.130> about<00:03:54.810> half

an inch down and then loosely twisted

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.180 
an inch down and then loosely twisted
maybe<00:03:58.120> five<00:03:58.390> times<00:03:58.710> until<00:03:59.710> I<00:03:59.800> reached<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.160> end

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
maybe five times until I reached the end

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.210 
maybe five times until I reached the end
and<00:04:00.700> then<00:04:01.120> tightly<00:04:01.810> twisted<00:04:01.960> so<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.590> got<00:04:03.010> this

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
and then tightly twisted so I got this

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.240 
and then tightly twisted so I got this
method<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.660> idea<00:04:04.930> from<00:04:05.230> Miss<00:04:05.500> finish<00:04:05.860> one
