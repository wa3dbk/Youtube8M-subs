this is one it is also a gem in 10 but
something<00:01:51.000> interesting<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> I've<00:01:51.869> noticed

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
something interesting that I've noticed

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
something interesting that I've noticed
about<00:01:52.380> PSA<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.130> how<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.430> grade<00:01:53.640> pokemon

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
about PSA and how they grade pokemon

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.580 
about PSA and how they grade pokemon
cards<00:01:54.360> i<00:01:54.420> believe<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.780> become<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> heck<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
cards i believe they become a heck of a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.499 
cards i believe they become a heck of a
lot<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.770> lenient<00:01:56.460> especially<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.090> recent

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
lot more lenient especially in recent

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.620

there's no dust on the plastic sleeve I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.619 
there's no dust on the plastic sleeve I
have<00:02:16.799> this<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.760> I've<00:02:17.849> tested<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:18.299> and

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
have this in and I've tested this and

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.199 
have this in and I've tested this and
this<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:19.379> part<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> PSA<00:02:20.489> case<00:02:20.760> itself

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
this is not part of the PSA case itself

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.530 
this is not part of the PSA case itself
either<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.769> fact<00:02:23.010> part<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.209> card

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
either that is in fact part of the card

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.350 
either that is in fact part of the card

printing<00:02:35.970> defect<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.739> that's<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.220> I've

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
printing defect and that's it but I've

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.380 
printing defect and that's it but I've
checked<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.579> corners<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.030> edges<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
checked the corners and edges and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.390 
checked the corners and edges and
everything<00:02:39.810> else<00:02:39.959> turned<00:02:40.470> out<00:02:40.590> perfect<00:02:41.129> what

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
everything else turned out perfect what

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.220 
everything else turned out perfect what
it<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.640> virtually<00:02:42.180> perfect<00:02:42.629> there<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.049> that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it is virtually perfect there is that

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.470 
it is virtually perfect there is that
one<00:02:43.439> minor<00:02:43.709> flaw<00:02:44.459> there<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:44.849> it<00:02:44.939> used<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.299> be

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
one minor flaw there but it used to be

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.509 
one minor flaw there but it used to be
if<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.140> got<00:02:46.319> cards<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.859> I<00:02:46.890> had<00:02:47.069> something<00:02:47.489> that

if I got cards and I had something that

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.750 
if I got cards and I had something that
obvious<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.359> wouldn't<00:02:49.349> send<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.799> because

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
obvious I wouldn't send it in because

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.069 
obvious I wouldn't send it in because
more<00:02:50.970> often<00:02:51.090> not<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.510> would<00:02:51.569> come<00:02:51.780> back<00:02:51.810> as

less than that so that kind of dates the
cards<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.709> little<00:03:16.950> bit<00:03:17.159> but<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:17.700> thought<00:03:17.909> this

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
cards a little bit but I thought this

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.740 
cards a little bit but I thought this
was<00:03:18.269> interesting<00:03:18.449> how<00:03:19.019> how<00:03:19.470> early<00:03:19.889> are<00:03:20.750> excuse

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
was interesting how how early are excuse

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.449 
was interesting how how early are excuse
me<00:03:21.870> how<00:03:22.049> late<00:03:22.319> this<00:03:22.500> card<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.859> great<00:03:23.069> in<00:03:23.250> and

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
me how late this card is great in and

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.080 
me how late this card is great in and
what<00:03:24.180> kind<00:03:24.449> of<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:25.579> grade<00:03:26.579> they<00:03:26.760> gave<00:03:26.940> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
what kind of a grade they gave it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.240 
what kind of a grade they gave it
despite<00:03:27.449> that<00:03:27.599> major<00:03:27.870> flaw<00:03:28.290> while<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:28.889> my<00:03:29.040> mind

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
despite that major flaw while in my mind

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.920 
despite that major flaw while in my mind
a<00:03:29.340> major<00:03:29.519> flaw<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.030> regardless<00:03:30.449> this<00:03:30.690> still

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
a major flaw but regardless this still

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.990 
a major flaw but regardless this still
counts<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:31.319> a<00:03:31.379> gem<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.680> 10<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.549> well<00:03:32.730> worth<00:03:32.849> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
counts as a gem in 10 and well worth the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.920 
counts as a gem in 10 and well worth the
money<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:35.459> finally<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.030> mentioned<00:03:36.540> some<00:03:36.660> cards

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
money and finally I mentioned some cards

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.720 
money and finally I mentioned some cards
go<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.079> little<00:03:37.319> bit<00:03:37.500> higher<00:03:37.709> only<00:03:38.280> definitely

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
go a little bit higher only definitely

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.369 
go a little bit higher only definitely
have<00:03:38.879> one<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.269> went<00:03:39.449> way<00:03:39.840> above<00:03:39.870> what<00:03:40.169> it

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
have one that went way above what it

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.860 
have one that went way above what it
normally<00:03:40.500> does<00:03:40.919> goes<00:03:41.760> about<00:03:41.970> twice<00:03:42.480> what<00:03:42.720> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
normally does goes about twice what you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.099 
normally does goes about twice what you
would<00:03:43.049> expect<00:03:43.530> just<00:03:44.129> an<00:03:44.250> average<00:03:44.639> PSA<00:03:45.150> 10<00:03:45.419> to

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
would expect just an average PSA 10 to

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.369 
would expect just an average PSA 10 to
go<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.699> what<00:03:47.699> for<00:03:47.940> good<00:03:48.060> reason<00:03:48.359> this<00:03:49.019> is<00:03:49.230> the

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
go for what for good reason this is the

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.170 
go for what for good reason this is the
first<00:03:49.590> edition<00:03:49.980> charmeleon<00:03:50.489> and<00:03:50.609> it's<00:03:50.940> just

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
first edition charmeleon and it's just

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.800 
first edition charmeleon and it's just
one<00:03:51.480> step<00:03:51.510> away<00:03:51.810> from<00:03:52.370> Charizard<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.810> anything

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
one step away from Charizard so anything

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.339 
one step away from Charizard so anything
with<00:03:55.169> Charmander<00:03:55.669> Charmeleon<00:03:56.930> does<00:03:57.930> tend<00:03:58.290> to

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
with Charmander Charmeleon does tend to

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.189 
with Charmander Charmeleon does tend to
send<00:03:58.590> well<00:03:58.739> sell<00:03:59.400> well<00:03:59.699> when<00:03:59.940> it's<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.269> basin<00:04:00.959> so

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
send well sell well when it's a basin so

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.970 
send well sell well when it's a basin so
