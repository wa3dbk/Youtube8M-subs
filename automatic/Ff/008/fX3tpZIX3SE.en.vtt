00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 I want to learn maths sign up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.309
 Come with me, I'm here at the bar today. 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.940
 from tijuca in front of the pizzeria payment 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:19.260
 to show that mathematics can be 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:21.510
 Also delicious as whole pizza confidence 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 can be understood as if it were a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.680
 cylinder and all cylinder can be 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.210
 understood to be a circus series 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.420
 placed on top of one another 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.550
 hence to calculate but the area of a circus 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.450
 it is enough that one of the small the value of e 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.969
 that approximately equal to 3.14 by 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.730
 ray of 75 squared 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 from there we have to calculate the volume of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.870
 a cylinder is enough to multiply the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 area of this circle that is the basis of 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.879
 cylinder by cylinder height 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.430
 represented by the letter h 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.300
 then to calculate but the volume of a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.510
 Pizza 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 just that and multiply the url 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.400
 square which is the radius of pizza by 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.250
 thick that pizza 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 if we consider that the radius of this 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.369
 pizza will do and the thickness of the pizza is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 same as we have that the volume of the pizza is 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.710
 equal to pike multiply to square 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.860
 Multiplying this by the dismembering 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.869
 multiplication we have the name of the pizza and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 what kind of gazette a lot of kz 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:34.710
 multiply now read this formula 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.409
 pizza volume is equal to and this is the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.020
 time in which everything ends with pizza 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.220

 sign up for our channel and run 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.960
 now for a good head is a cylinder 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.700
 Big hug and see you next month
