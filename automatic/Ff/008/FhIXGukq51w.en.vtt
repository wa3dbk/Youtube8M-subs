can't leave that nexus yeah he can't
leave<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.210> Nexus<00:00:38.539> but<00:00:38.690> he<00:00:38.750> also<00:00:38.870> needs<00:00:39.170> to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
leave the Nexus but he also needs to

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.250 
leave the Nexus but he also needs to
eliminate<00:00:39.500> his<00:00:39.800> opponent<00:00:40.309> so<00:00:41.090> it's<00:00:41.300> like<00:00:42.230> I

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
it fall here sees it this hallucinate

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.349 
it fall here sees it this hallucinate
Phoenix<00:00:51.649> yeah<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.609> what<00:00:52.760> does<00:00:52.850> he<00:00:52.940> do<00:00:53.089> disease

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
Phoenix yeah so what does he do disease

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.090 
Phoenix yeah so what does he do disease
I<00:00:53.539> mean<00:00:53.719> if<00:00:53.870> he<00:00:53.960> sends<00:00:54.230> out<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.350> squad<00:00:54.679> of<00:00:54.769> units
