 be careful because most already 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.280
 thought so do not put not only will 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.220
 putting salt to taste and then you go 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 moving forward until it begins to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.439
 a dough to hold in your hand 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.200
 easy to handle the water too. 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.060
 has to be presented a little 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.960
 but you will see when the dough stays 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.619
 this texture without sticking 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.329
 mass up to a little elastic 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:40.259
 so delicious to handle 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:44.159
 That's when she's in the right mood. 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.799
 process with filling of August can 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.299
 make as much chicken as you can 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.329
 also palmetto can also make 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.119
 cheese can put mozzarella cheese 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.030
 Parmesan is at your discretion anyway. 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.219
 Can you stop everything? I thought you 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.069
 I want you to make the shredded chicken I 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:13.020
 I usually make cooking in pressure 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.650
 of string with garlic onion the smell of it 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.000
 do not salt olive oil and it will get a filling 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:28.980
 so not too dry with a little bit of 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:55.560
 Basil also facilitate ready I found 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:03:06.180
 well wet 51 quantity puts on 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:51.320
 line and makes it very deep with 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:51.320
 race but you will sing line and 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.530
 sides 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:07.370
 You'll add an addict who gemma 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.370
 to paint conjos and you will 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.440
 to lay out depending on the oven 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.630
 40 50 minutes 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.120
 amount of mass to do this 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.810
 Small sympathy will give much paid 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.300
 will shake hands and 150 in each shape 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.690
 very small so think when you have left 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:31.640
 I was with a short goa in the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.000
 roll so much more round than 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.100
 this put on top of that stones shape 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.490
 that this was a form of 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.370
 Removable bottom squeezes the sides 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.720
 puts a generous amount of filling and 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.590
 do the same process of this type 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:56.930
 remaining and fulfilling this form is also 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:58.790
 near her will be the same thing 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.770
 who will sit give they will also have there with 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:07.520
 gem and place a team is 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:09.710
 I would advise you to write down 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.310
 put a fluffy oven in temperature 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.620
 too high can happen will stay 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.320
 golden top and the bottom of it goes 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.320
 stay with a bass 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:37.039
 What are we going to find? 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.850
 another video to be able to show her with 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.850
