00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
basically the only thing that completely

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.350 
basically the only thing that completely
wolves<00:00:50.100> weave<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.460> other<00:00:50.670> than<00:00:50.789> Infernape

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
really was expecting her power but

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.520 
really was expecting her power but
whatever<00:01:19.920> i<00:01:20.070> take<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> explosion<00:01:21.240> um<00:01:21.420> i<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.380> a
