00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.180
 good 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.800
 the work with the junior ballet that has 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.900
 been really very interesting because 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 I found that all dancers 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.730
 were very engaged in the project he 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.960
 did not please he was also very 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.960
 very young people want on their way to 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.760
 help work 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.860
 Kiara it was much the 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.460
 reconstitution of this piece the piece has 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.769
 was created end of 2010 for another group 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 of dancers what am I 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.930
 found interesting from this experience 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.270
 last already 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.820
 watch 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.750
 in this group how did they equate 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.160
 from just digest people to a 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.260
 event that existed in creation 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
 I really had time to convince 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.050
 everyone to come into my universe 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.590
 to bring out this invention which 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.490
 was also interpreted for fear of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.490
 not see them again 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.350
 the inspiration for this 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.810
 creation was diamanda music 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.200
 galas what is an artist that 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.860
 I love because 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.930
 a job that is enough and are even 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.740
 side I will not speak she talks a lot 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:49.380
 of the sea ​​is still there to know 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.270
 technicality and inability to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.770
 transform so much this normal time 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.659
 than 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.369
 that it becomes a product very very very 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.530
 very strange and I have very little but 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.530
 this coast is strange to seine 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.650
