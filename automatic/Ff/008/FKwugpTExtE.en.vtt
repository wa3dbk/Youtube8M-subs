00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.019
 hello with you, Sergey, we continue 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.940
 vlog dedicated to maintenance and 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.509
 small car repair and today 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.570
 we will talk about batteries this topic 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.410
 It concerns not only batteries 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.779
 on a particular car Muscovite 2140 but 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.189
 and in principle on any cars like 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.150
 Russian and foreign 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.059
 production that I would like it a little bit 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.059
 tell what information appeared in 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.710
 first when for example sometimes disappears 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:45.270
 Ignition need to watch and the number 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.270
 contacts oxidizes contact constantly 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.710
 plus it will need a sandpaper like myself 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:58.859
 clamp clean and so let's say in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:02.120
 one this pin needs to be cleaned and this 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.119
 problems you get it in second 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.500
 generator that feeds us 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.979
 as we say and support 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.920
 battery life 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.770
 also nuances that you need to do 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.830
 if you are running out of battery you need 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 will be on these two terminals 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.570
 check the voltage here she is at 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:30.420
 idle should be 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 about 13 and 14 volts it should 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.079
 move accordingly 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 we charge the battery + we 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.600
 all the voltage that is consumed during 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.329
 engine running time but comes with 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.909
 generator and at the same time charging at 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.369
 us battery as soon as we have voltage 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.970
 and charger second alternator 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.979
 drops to about 13 there are 12 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.070
 then accordingly around 12 he already 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.780
 practically does not work therefore for us 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.880
 there is an expense 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.209
 battery capacity directly 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.720
 so the problem with quality work 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.280
 you can check on small ones so 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.519
 let's say shops for sale 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.060
 batteries there is even a small service 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.739
 to measure the operation of the generator 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.140
 directly you can give away 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.680
 battery check it has a density of 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.340
 cans are special for hydrometers 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.670
 density checks and manufacturers so 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.190
 let's say renÃ© manufacturers and sellers 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.709
 batteries recommended once a week 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.829
 bi-weekly charge 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.560
 battery and because there are times 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.750
 when the power consumption exceeds 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.530
 energy that the generator works 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.079
 I therefore recommend that you charge harsh 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.989
 frost still has to bring 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:00.489
 because the battery but I have by wave 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.890
 I found such a porcupine Tyumen 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.329
 therefore it is necessary on him and him 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.010
 exploit so as to 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.100
 charging and maintaining vital functions 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.810
 battery and I basically small 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.480
 Obzorchiki explained therefore do not forget 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.680
 density check in banks there 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.310
 certain rizochki 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.230
 and you can basically completely more or less 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.780
 maintain servicing batteries 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.389
 explosion is subject to maintenance not 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.019
 forget to 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:42.079
 electrodes that is to say, these are copper 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:43.760
 copper zabu words do not brighten that is 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.700
 have you should not see them should you 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.900
 liquids mostly water evaporates 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.060
 add distilled water to 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.269
 the terminal blocks of you were completely closed in 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.250
 banks otherwise they will start with time 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.400
 pour in 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.370
 The main load on the battery is not 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.650
 in the winter all the same in the summer during high 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.049
 temperatures goes very strong some 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.370
 such a specific process and in winter he 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:12.700
 roughly speaking you are dying 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.980
 but I wanted to tell you a little bit 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.600
 about batteries many information 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.609
 will come in handy 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.609
 with you was Sergey goodbye
