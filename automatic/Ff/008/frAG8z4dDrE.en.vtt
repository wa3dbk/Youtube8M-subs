fixture here was actually getting very

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
fixture here was actually getting very
hot<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.420> lot<00:00:24.630> hotter<00:00:24.810> than<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.320> standard

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710

hot a lot hotter than what the standard
OEM<00:00:25.970> globes<00:00:26.970> would<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.330> emit<00:00:27.779> out<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:29.689> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
OEM globes would have emit out so so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
whether they are actually running hotter

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.090 
whether they are actually running hotter
so<00:00:43.850> on<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.600> left<00:00:45.719> hand<00:00:45.960> side<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.860> the

the OEM and that's what that this is the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
the OEM and that's what that this is the
left-hand<00:01:07.200> side<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> right-hand

now<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> try<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.430> not

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
now what I'm going to try to do it's not

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
now what I'm going to try to do it's not
the<00:01:14.700> most<00:01:14.880> accurate<00:01:15.119> way<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> testing<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the most accurate way of testing this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.609 
the most accurate way of testing this
but<00:01:17.009> I've<00:01:17.100> got<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.450> pit<00:01:18.780> temp<00:01:19.049> temperature

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
but I've got to to pit temp temperature

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
but I've got to to pit temp temperature

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the new units by Maverick and as you can

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.810 
the new units by Maverick and as you can
see<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.659> running<00:01:30.979> 62<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.220> 63<00:01:32.549> degrees

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
see I'm running 62 and 63 degrees

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.789 
see I'm running 62 and 63 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> ambient

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
Fahrenheit and that's the ambient

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.550 
Fahrenheit and that's the ambient
temperature<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> intend<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.409> is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
temperature so what I intend to do is

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
temperature so what I intend to do is
start<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> bike<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.610> run<00:01:41.820> those

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
start the bike up and run those

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
start the bike up and run those
headlights<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> few<00:01:43.950> minutes

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
headlights you know for a few minutes

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 
headlights you know for a few minutes
and<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.570> which<00:01:46.170> side<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.770> running

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and just to see which side is running

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.389 
and just to see which side is running
hotter<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> will<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.439> confirm<00:01:49.890> my

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
hotter and that will just confirm my

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.950 
hotter and that will just confirm my
belief<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:50.970> pretty<00:01:51.119> sure<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.630> Philips

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
belief so I'm pretty sure that Philips

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.480 
belief so I'm pretty sure that Philips
this<00:01:52.140> running<00:01:52.439> hotter<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.009> quite<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> bit

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
this running hotter and it's quite a bit

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.850 
this running hotter and it's quite a bit
hotter<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:55.290> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> damage

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
hotter and I just do not want to damage

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.069 
hotter and I just do not want to damage
my<00:01:56.460> head<00:01:56.670> light<00:01:56.820> fixtures

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.580

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
and as you can see there's the back of

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.319 
and as you can see there's the back of
the<00:02:03.649> head<00:02:03.770> light<00:02:03.950> fixture<00:02:04.280> there<00:02:04.520> showing<00:02:05.060> the

two different colors of the the beams
and<00:02:27.790> we'll<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:28.940> see<00:02:29.060> what<00:02:29.209> happens<00:02:29.540> now

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.590 

through<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> temperature<00:02:33.560> oh<00:02:34.930> yeah

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.000 

so<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.840> see<00:02:41.020> straight<00:02:41.320> away<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.650> Philips

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
so you can see straight away the Philips

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.300 
so you can see straight away the Philips
globe<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.550> actually<00:02:42.850> pulling<00:02:43.090> up<00:02:43.300> quicker

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
globe is actually pulling up quicker

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.759 
globe is actually pulling up quicker
we've<00:02:45.310> got

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:03:02.130 

77<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.900> 75

and<00:03:03.140> we're<00:03:03.319> still<00:03:03.530> climbing<00:03:03.740> up<00:03:04.069> here<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.460> the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
and we're still climbing up here on the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.910 
and we're still climbing up here on the
Philips<00:03:04.910> globe<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.540> mean<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.410> spent<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.770> lot<00:03:06.860> of

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
Philips globe I mean I spent a lot of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.460 
Philips globe I mean I spent a lot of
time<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> internet<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:07.970> morning

information<00:03:10.130> on<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.850> how<00:03:11.000> hot<00:03:11.209> these<00:03:11.390> things

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
information on the how hot these things

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.590 
information on the how hot these things
burn<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.069> do<00:03:13.550> they<00:03:13.760> actually<00:03:14.060> burn<00:03:14.270> hotter

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
burn and do they actually burn hotter

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.660 
burn and do they actually burn hotter
than<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.959> am<00:03:15.319> globe<00:03:15.709> but<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:16.340> was<00:03:16.430> very

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
than the I am globe but I there was very

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.380 
than the I am globe but I there was very
little<00:03:16.819> information<00:03:17.150> there<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.810> find<00:03:19.390> but

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
little information there to find but

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.350 
little information there to find but
yeah<00:03:20.570> we<00:03:20.780> can<00:03:20.810> see<00:03:21.140> straight<00:03:21.620> away<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:23.240> know

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
yeah we can see straight away you know

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.790 
yeah we can see straight away you know
we're<00:03:24.020> pushing<00:03:24.230> 101<00:03:24.980> paranoid<00:03:25.550> here<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.530> on

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
we're pushing 101 paranoid here and on

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.760 
we're pushing 101 paranoid here and on
this<00:03:28.070> side<00:03:28.520> it's<00:03:28.940> 91<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.989> it's<00:03:30.140> 10<00:03:30.410> over

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
this side it's 91 so it's 10 over

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:47.920 
this side it's 91 so it's 10 over
straight<00:03:31.190> away<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:32.380> much<00:03:33.380> hotter<00:03:33.650> much<00:03:34.040> hotter

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.080 

I'd<00:03:48.709> also<00:03:48.890> like<00:03:49.129> to<00:03:49.189> add<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.790> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
I'd also like to add to that the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.319 
I'd also like to add to that the
standard<00:03:50.510> OEM<00:03:50.689> globe<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:52.549> this<00:03:52.760> model<00:03:52.970> Falls

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
standard OEM globe that this model Falls

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.750 
standard OEM globe that this model Falls
Iran's<00:03:53.750> Isaiah<00:03:54.379> Nava<00:03:54.920> made<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:55.939> Germany

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.459 

and<00:03:59.760> we<00:03:59.879> can<00:04:00.060> say<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:00.930> just<00:04:01.140> getting

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:01.469 
and we can say that it's just getting

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.959 
and we can say that it's just getting
hotter<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.920> hotter<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.459> actually<00:04:02.819> the

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:02.969 
hotter and hotter and actually the

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.209 
hotter and hotter and actually the
margin<00:04:03.420> between<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.930> two<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.829> actually

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 
margin between the two is actually

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.640 
margin between the two is actually
increasing<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.840> what<00:04:06.989> do<00:04:07.049> we<00:04:07.109> got<00:04:07.349> here<00:04:07.620> oh

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
increasing so what do we got here oh

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.190 
increasing so what do we got here oh
yeah<00:04:07.980> only<00:04:08.359> 135<00:04:09.359> F<00:04:10.159> and<00:04:11.159> on<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.459> side<00:04:11.730> 115<00:04:12.719> so

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
yeah only 135 F and on this side 115 so

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.820 
yeah only 135 F and on this side 115 so
yeah<00:04:13.439> there's<00:04:14.129> 20<00:04:14.400> degrees<00:04:14.790> there<00:04:15.019> ridiculous

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.850 

all<00:04:19.830> right<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.010> think<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.370> test<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.760> paid<00:04:21.030> now

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
all right I think the test is paid now

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.990 
all right I think the test is paid now
I've<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:23.040> been<00:04:23.190> keeping<00:04:23.490> an<00:04:23.580> eye<00:04:23.670> on<00:04:23.850> these

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
I've just been keeping an eye on these

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.290 
I've just been keeping an eye on these
two

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
two

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.740 
two
to<00:04:25.220> temperature<00:04:26.220> thermometer<00:04:27.000> things<00:04:27.450> here

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
to temperature thermometer things here

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.550 
to temperature thermometer things here
and<00:04:29.330> they've<00:04:30.330> just<00:04:30.360> been<00:04:30.660> stable<00:04:31.230> both<00:04:31.380> of

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
and they've just been stable both of

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.320 
and they've just been stable both of
them<00:04:31.680> now<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:32.070> for<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.370> last<00:04:32.550> minute<00:04:32.850> or<00:04:33.120> so

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
them now like for the last minute or so

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.120 
them now like for the last minute or so
so<00:04:33.770> what<00:04:34.770> we've<00:04:34.950> got<00:04:34.980> here<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.780> 148<00:04:36.800> 149<00:04:37.800> I

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
so what we've got here is 148 149 I

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.730 
so what we've got here is 148 149 I
could<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.880> could<00:04:38.910> almost<00:04:39.180> call<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.570> 150<00:04:40.440> or<00:04:40.590> it

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
could you could almost call it 150 or it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.270 
could you could almost call it 150 or it
would<00:04:41.070> rise<00:04:41.310> up<00:04:41.640> just<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.180> one<00:04:42.360> extra<00:04:42.540> degree

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
would rise up just that one extra degree

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.430 
would rise up just that one extra degree
so<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.460> Phillips<00:04:44.790> is<00:04:44.940> pushing<00:04:45.270> 150<00:04:45.930> degrees

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
so the Phillips is pushing 150 degrees

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.390 
so the Phillips is pushing 150 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:48.570> Nava<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:49.440> standard<00:04:49.830> OEM

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
Fahrenheit and the Nava the standard OEM

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.710 
Fahrenheit and the Nava the standard OEM
wonder<00:04:50.790> globe<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.590> 124<00:04:53.180> so<00:04:54.180> yeah<00:04:54.450> we're

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
wonder globe is 124 so yeah we're

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.870 
wonder globe is 124 so yeah we're
looking<00:04:54.930> at<00:04:55.050> 25<00:04:55.530> degrees<00:04:55.980> difference<00:04:56.460> between

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
looking at 25 degrees difference between

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.270 
looking at 25 degrees difference between
the<00:04:57.030> two<00:04:57.240> this<00:04:57.570> as<00:04:58.380> far<00:04:58.590> as<00:04:58.680> I'm<00:04:58.830> concerned

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
the two this as far as I'm concerned

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.200 
the two this as far as I'm concerned
that's<00:04:59.400> not<00:04:59.610> acceptable

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
that's not acceptable

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.900 
that's not acceptable
I'm<00:05:00.960> going<00:05:01.140> to<00:05:01.200> pull<00:05:01.380> them<00:05:01.440> out<00:05:01.590> go<00:05:02.580> back<00:05:02.610> to

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
I'm going to pull them out go back to

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.330 
I'm going to pull them out go back to
standard
