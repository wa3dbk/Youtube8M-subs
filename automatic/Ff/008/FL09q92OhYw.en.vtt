just got mine on for also back here is
where<00:03:20.620> they<00:03:20.739> have<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.370> texture<00:03:21.790> knob

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
where they have the the texture knob

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.929

where you can go from from full power
Class<00:03:25.629> A<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.560> all<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:26.980> good<00:03:27.459> stuff<00:03:27.489> back

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
Class A and all that good stuff back

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.830 
Class A and all that good stuff back
here<00:03:28.030> what<00:03:28.780> I've<00:03:28.900> come<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.169> realize<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:30.840> what

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
here what I've come to realize with what

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.429 
here what I've come to realize with what
the<00:03:31.930> texture<00:03:32.260> knob<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:33.629> if<00:03:34.629> you<00:03:34.780> cut<00:03:35.049> if

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
the texture knob is that if you cut if

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.080 
the texture knob is that if you cut if
you<00:03:35.500> cut<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.919> waters<00:03:36.250> back<00:03:36.489> because<00:03:36.909> if<00:03:37.060> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
you cut the waters back because if you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.610 
you cut the waters back because if you
can<00:03:37.359> cut<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.629> to<00:03:37.980> 50<00:03:38.980> watts<00:03:39.159> I<00:03:40.139> find<00:03:41.139> if<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.409> do

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
can cut it to 50 watts I find if you do

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.349 
can cut it to 50 watts I find if you do
it<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:42.069> way<00:03:42.129> you<00:03:42.370> don't<00:03:42.549> have<00:03:42.669> to<00:03:42.790> crank<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
it that way you don't have to crank the

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.089 
it that way you don't have to crank the
amp<00:03:43.599> as<00:03:43.810> much<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.780> get<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.199> get<00:03:47.409> the<00:03:47.560> full<00:03:47.829> you

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
amp as much to get to get the full you

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.759 
amp as much to get to get the full you
know<00:03:48.159> -<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.629> know<00:03:49.659> coloration<00:03:50.349> it<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.620> you

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
know - you know coloration it that you

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.460 
know - you know coloration it that you
can<00:03:50.919> get<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.250> can<00:03:51.400> kind<00:03:51.579> of<00:03:51.699> just<00:03:51.849> you<00:03:52.000> know

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
can get you can kind of just you know

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.710 
can get you can kind of just you know
you<00:03:53.470> can<00:03:53.590> turn<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.889> all<00:03:53.979> the<00:03:54.009> way<00:03:54.099> back<00:03:54.720> then

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
you can turn it all the way back then

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.800 
you can turn it all the way back then
you<00:03:55.810> have<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.169> you<00:03:56.409> know<00:03:56.939> have<00:03:57.939> to<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.599> just

you have to you know have to you just
roll<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.199> volume<00:03:59.560> back<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.759> just<00:04:00.790> make<00:04:01.030> it

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
roll the volume back and it just make it

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.569 
roll the volume back and it just make it
easier<00:04:01.419> for<00:04:01.449> you<00:04:01.599> to<00:04:01.629> get<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.959> two-tone

the gang up really loud you can hear a
loud<00:04:57.680> hissing<00:04:58.010> sound<00:04:58.460> like<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.180> like<00:04:59.300> us<00:04:59.450> but<00:05:00.230> if

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
loud hissing sound like I like us but if

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.860 
loud hissing sound like I like us but if
you<00:05:00.440> put<00:05:00.830> in<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.010> second<00:05:01.370> one<00:05:01.540> it's<00:05:02.540> not<00:05:02.630> as

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
you put in the second one it's not as

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.940 
you put in the second one it's not as
it's<00:05:03.650> not<00:05:03.740> prevalent<00:05:04.630> because<00:05:05.950> active

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
it's not prevalent because active

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.860 
it's not prevalent because active
guitars<00:05:07.370> have<00:05:07.850> you<00:05:08.060> know<00:05:08.180> have<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.660> higher

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
guitars have you know have a higher

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.620 
guitars have you know have a higher
output<00:05:09.080> obviously<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:10.340> it's<00:05:10.970> just<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.240> bit<00:05:11.390> more

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
output obviously so it's just a bit more

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.340 
output obviously so it's just a bit more
you<00:05:11.870> know<00:05:11.900> natural<00:05:12.890> for<00:05:13.100> that<00:05:13.870> for<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:14.900> input

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
you know natural for that for that input

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.010 
you know natural for that for that input
