00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.430 
in Formula 3 back in the early 70s we've
seen<00:04:50.670> it<00:04:50.790> when<00:04:51.240> we<00:04:51.330> have<00:04:51.450> pop<00:04:51.690> off<00:04:51.870> valves<00:04:52.260> on

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
seen it when we have pop off valves on

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.020 
seen it when we have pop off valves on
turbocharged<00:04:53.160> engines<00:04:53.490> luckily<00:04:53.790> we<00:04:53.910> don't

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
turbocharged engines luckily we don't

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.690 
turbocharged engines luckily we don't
have<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.510> these<00:04:54.690> turbo<00:04:55.470> engines<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> we

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
have that on these turbo engines and we

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.220 
have that on these turbo engines and we
saw<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.030> of<00:04:57.150> course<00:04:57.540> when<00:04:57.720> we<00:04:57.780> had<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.930> fuel

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
saw it of course when we had the fuel

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.230 
saw it of course when we had the fuel
Bowser's<00:04:58.680> in<00:04:59.070> Formula<00:04:59.490> one<00:04:59.640> at<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.850> time<00:05:00.060> when

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
we had refuelling there was

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.220 
we had refuelling there was

back to push rod for 2014 and I wonder
if<00:06:57.460> the<00:06:57.760> Ferrari<00:06:58.090> technicians<00:06:58.660> are<00:06:58.780> looking

if the Ferrari technicians are looking
at<00:06:59.110> these<00:06:59.230> pictures<00:06:59.500> now<00:06:59.800> whether<00:07:00.070> they're

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
at these pictures now whether they're

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.640 
at these pictures now whether they're
thinking<00:07:00.730> maybe<00:07:01.060> we<00:07:01.450> too<00:07:01.690> should<00:07:02.380> have<00:07:02.500> gone

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.380 
thinking maybe we too should have gone
back<00:07:02.920> to<00:07:03.400> push<00:07:03.610> rod<00:07:03.730> I<00:07:03.820> know<00:07:03.970> there<00:07:04.270> are

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
back to push rod I know there are

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.700 
back to push rod I know there are
aerodynamic<00:07:04.930> reasons<00:07:05.290> for<00:07:05.440> staying<00:07:05.590> with

aerodynamic reasons for staying with

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
pull rod and that's no doubt why my

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.150 
pull rod and that's no doubt why my
client<00:07:07.360> by<00:07:07.630> Ferrari<00:07:08.050> have<00:07:08.590> done<00:07:08.830> that<00:07:08.980> but

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
client by Ferrari have done that but

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160 
client by Ferrari have done that but
look<00:07:09.400> at<00:07:09.490> the<00:07:09.580> mechanical<00:07:10.150> elements<00:07:10.660> of<00:07:10.780> the
