this game it's not called toughness it's

this game it's not called toughness it's
called<00:00:45.630> focus<00:00:46.109> and<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.649> doesn't<00:00:47.129> only<00:00:47.370> reduce

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
called focus and it doesn't only reduce

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.049 
called focus and it doesn't only reduce
your<00:00:48.660> view<00:00:48.989> kick<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:50.129> has<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.670> more

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
your view kick it actually has one more

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.759 
your view kick it actually has one more
benefit<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.899> make<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.410> bit<00:00:52.589> better

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
benefit to make it a little bit better

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.110 
benefit to make it a little bit better
than<00:00:52.949> toughness<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.609> way<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> course

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
than toughness in a way of course

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.880 
than toughness in a way of course
because<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.929> does<00:00:55.109> one<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.589> thing

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
because you know it does one more thing

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
because you know it does one more thing
it's<00:00:56.070> not<00:00:56.329> necessarily<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.539> noticeable

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it's not necessarily all that noticeable

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
it's not necessarily all that noticeable
but<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.949> still<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.519> more<00:00:59.730> thing<00:00:59.969> that<00:00:59.999> might

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
but it's still one more thing that might

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.759 
but it's still one more thing that might
help<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.839> especially<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.440> long

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
help a little bit especially at long

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.240 
help a little bit especially at long
range<00:01:02.129> gunfights<00:01:03.530> but<00:01:04.530> most<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> noticed

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
range gunfights but most of you noticed

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.470 
range gunfights but most of you noticed
that<00:01:05.370> in<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.610> game<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.120> what<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
that in this game there is what a

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.250 
that in this game there is what a
weapons<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.700> focus<00:01:08.970> does<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
weapons way now what focus does is it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
weapons way now what focus does is it
will<00:01:10.320> reduce<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.340> weapons<00:01:11.700> way<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.000> how

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
will reduce your weapons way now how

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
will reduce your weapons way now how
does<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.450> reduce<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.110> makes<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.740> actual

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
does it reduce it it makes the actual

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.450 
does it reduce it it makes the actual
sway<00:01:14.840> slightly<00:01:15.840> reduced<00:01:16.230> but<00:01:17.010> what<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.280> really

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sway slightly reduced but what it really

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.160 
sway slightly reduced but what it really
kind<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.180> does<00:01:18.329> where<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:18.930> notice

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
kind of does where you can really notice

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.030 
kind of does where you can really notice
it<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:20.250> reduces<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.479> speed<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it is it reduces the speed at which the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.830 
it is it reduces the speed at which the
weapon<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.850> sways<00:01:24.149> as<00:01:24.390> well<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:24.720> you're

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
weapon actually sways as well now you're

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.760 
weapon actually sways as well now you're
going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.170> we're<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> get<00:01:25.619> into

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
going to see we're about to get into

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.929 
going to see we're about to get into
some<00:01:25.920> tests<00:01:26.189> here<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.399> just<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.610> couple<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
some tests here in just a couple of

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.590 
some tests here in just a couple of
seconds<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.930> tested<00:01:28.439> an<00:01:28.590> SMG<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
seconds and I tested an SMG and a are a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.139 
seconds and I tested an SMG and a are a
secondary<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.950> sniper<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
secondary and a sniper that's all I

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.550 
secondary and a sniper that's all I
tested<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.689> didn't<00:01:33.930> feel<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> need<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.380> test

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
tested I didn't feel the need to test

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.469 
tested I didn't feel the need to test
anymore<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.219> see<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.329> can

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
anymore but as you can see here you can

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.310 
anymore but as you can see here you can
clearly<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:38.600> right<00:01:39.600> hand<00:01:39.810> side<00:01:39.960> where

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
clearly see on the right hand side where

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
clearly see on the right hand side where
it<00:01:40.439> does<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.860> focus<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
it does have focus that there was a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
it does have focus that there was a
noticeable<00:01:43.380> difference<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.399> like

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
noticeable difference it's not like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.620 
noticeable difference it's not like
night<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.420> day<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.189> there<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
night and day but it is there and it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.959 
night and day but it is there and it's
more<00:01:48.990> noticeable<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> further<00:01:50.130> away<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.610> are

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
more noticeable the further away you are

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.520 
more noticeable the further away you are
from<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.329> target<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.869> you're<00:01:51.990> shooting<00:01:52.409> at

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
from the target that you're shooting at

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.990 
from the target that you're shooting at
now<00:01:52.710> obviously<00:01:53.039> I'm<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:53.430> close<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
now obviously I'm pretty close to the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
now obviously I'm pretty close to the
wall<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.140> might<00:01:55.380> not<00:01:55.530> notice<00:01:55.829> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
wall here so you might not notice it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.130 
wall here so you might not notice it
quite<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.700> much<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:57.719> you're<00:01:57.840> trying<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
quite as much but when you're trying to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
quite as much but when you're trying to
pick<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:58.560> guy's<00:01:58.770> head<00:01:59.039> off<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.490> head

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
pick some guy's head off of a head

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.069 
pick some guy's head off of a head
glitch<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.030> something<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.899> your

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
glitch or something like that and your

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.690 
glitch or something like that and your
weapons<00:02:01.229> moving<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.829> over<00:02:01.859> the<00:02:02.130> place<00:02:02.250> it's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
weapons moving all over the place it's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
weapons moving all over the place it's
going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.119> make<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> quite<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.170> more

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
going to make it quite a bit more

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.830 
going to make it quite a bit more
difficult<00:02:04.859> now<00:02:05.369> where<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.450> really

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
difficult now where you can really

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900 
difficult now where you can really
really<00:02:07.020> notice<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.590> right<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.070> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.640> US

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
really notice it is right here on the US

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.340 
really notice it is right here on the US
are<00:02:09.180> on<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> sniper<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.470> sway<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:12.020> i'd<00:02:13.020> say

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
are on a sniper the sway is i'd say

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.020 
are on a sniper the sway is i'd say
maybe<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.830> twenty<00:02:14.280> percent<00:02:14.700> smaller

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
maybe like twenty percent smaller

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.420 
maybe like twenty percent smaller
something<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> actual<00:02:16.830> speed

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
something like that but the actual speed

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.700 
something like that but the actual speed
in<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:17.700> its<00:02:18.060> ways<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.570> reduced<00:02:18.960> pretty

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
in which its ways is reduced pretty

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.440 
in which its ways is reduced pretty
dramatically<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.880> see<00:02:21.060> here<00:02:21.300> with

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
dramatically as you can see here with

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.050 
dramatically as you can see here with
the<00:02:21.540> side<00:02:21.720> by<00:02:21.900> side<00:02:21.930> tests<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.910> where

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the side by side tests now this is where

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.060 
the side by side tests now this is where
it<00:02:24.210> really<00:02:24.240> shines<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.410> view<00:02:25.620> kick<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.950> this

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
it really shines the view kick in this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.050 
it really shines the view kick in this
game<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.430> clearly

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
game is clearly

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.350 
game is clearly
really<00:02:27.380> absolutely<00:02:28.380> nuts<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.160> no<00:02:29.819> focus<00:02:30.209> on

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
really absolutely nuts so no focus on

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.820 
really absolutely nuts so no focus on
the<00:02:30.450> left<00:02:30.660> focus<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.260> right<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.800> see

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
the left focus on the right you can see

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.949 
the left focus on the right you can see
in<00:02:32.190> every<00:02:32.489> shot<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.940> kicks<00:02:33.180> way<00:02:33.480> above<00:02:33.750> their

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
in every shot it kicks way above their

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.170 
in every shot it kicks way above their
head<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:34.560> no<00:02:34.739> focus<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.790> does<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.060> go

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
head with no focus and all it does is go

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.030 
head with no focus and all it does is go
from<00:02:36.300> their<00:02:36.510> chest<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.230> maybe<00:02:37.380> like<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> neck

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
from their chest to maybe like the neck

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.100 
from their chest to maybe like the neck
or<00:02:38.310> their<00:02:38.430> head<00:02:38.730> when<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.270> are<00:02:39.420> wearing<00:02:39.660> focus

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
or their head when you are wearing focus

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
or their head when you are wearing focus
same<00:02:40.290> thing<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.680> sniper<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.459> huge

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
same thing with the sniper it's a huge

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.860 
same thing with the sniper it's a huge
huge<00:02:42.660> difference<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.319> it<00:02:43.709> can<00:02:43.860> make<00:02:44.130> or<00:02:44.340> break

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
huge difference and it can make or break

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.660 
huge difference and it can make or break
winning<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.959> gunfight<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:47.220> guys<00:02:47.370> aren't

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
winning a gunfight so if you guys aren't

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.300 
winning a gunfight so if you guys aren't
using<00:02:48.060> focused<00:02:48.660> I<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:49.319> really<00:02:49.650> recommend

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
using focused I really really recommend

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.180 
using focused I really really recommend
that<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.610> try<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.030> out<00:02:51.300> at<00:02:51.540> least<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.349> see<00:02:53.010> if

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
that you try it out at least and see if

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.160 
that you try it out at least and see if
it<00:02:53.340> actually<00:02:53.370> helps<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.450> know<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.780> might

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
it actually helps you you know you might

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.630 
it actually helps you you know you might
notice<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.739> you're<00:02:55.860> winning<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.280> lot<00:02:56.459> more

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
notice that you're winning a lot more

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.059 
notice that you're winning a lot more
gunfights<00:02:57.180> then<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.930> were<00:02:58.110> previously<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
gunfights then you were previously and

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.770 
gunfights then you were previously and
if<00:02:59.519> that's<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.850> case<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.060> make<00:03:00.510> sure<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
if that's the case just make sure you

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.809 
if that's the case just make sure you
keep<00:03:00.959> running<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.560> mean<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:01.890> wouldn't<00:03:02.250> run<00:03:02.549> a

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
keep running it I mean I wouldn't run a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.150 
keep running it I mean I wouldn't run a
class<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.900> black<00:03:04.080> ops<00:03:04.260> 2<00:03:04.380> without<00:03:04.590> toughness

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
class in black ops 2 without toughness

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.620 
class in black ops 2 without toughness
and<00:03:05.340> I'm<00:03:05.430> probably<00:03:05.819> not<00:03:06.209> going<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.450> run<00:03:06.600> a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
and I'm probably not going to run a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.380 
and I'm probably not going to run a
class<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.140> college<00:03:07.709> ID<00:03:08.010> ghost<00:03:08.280> without<00:03:08.940> focus

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
class in college ID ghost without focus

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.890 
class in college ID ghost without focus
it's<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.069> big<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:12.060> difference<00:03:12.480> in

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
it's just that big of a difference in

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.650 
it's just that big of a difference in
winning<00:03:13.230> or<00:03:13.530> losing<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:14.160> gunfight<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:15.510> that's

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660
