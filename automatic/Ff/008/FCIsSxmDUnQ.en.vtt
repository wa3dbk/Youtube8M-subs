impressive and really nice and you can
see<00:01:29.070> right<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.790> there's<00:01:30.600> eight<00:01:30.960> worlds

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
see right here that there's eight worlds

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410 
see right here that there's eight worlds
and<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> last<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.400> popped<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:33.000> right

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and the last one just popped up right

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020 
and the last one just popped up right
there<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> didn't<00:01:34.259> even<00:01:34.320> expect<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:35.100> there's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
there I didn't even expect that there's

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.749 
there I didn't even expect that there's
eight<00:01:36.540> worlds<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.259> play<00:01:37.470> each<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.040> has<00:01:38.340> ten

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
eight worlds to play each one has ten

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.670 
eight worlds to play each one has ten
levels<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.900> decent<00:01:40.170> metal<00:01:40.350> level<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
levels so that the decent metal level is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
levels so that the decent metal level is
considering<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.310> only<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:42.119> through<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
considering this is only one through the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.600 
considering this is only one through the
gameplay<00:01:42.990> I'll<00:01:43.229> show<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.310> easy

accelerometer on the DS or the circle

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
accelerometer on the DS or the circle
pad<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.610> designed<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.180> use<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> circle<00:02:00.630> back

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
pad I'm designed to use a circle back

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.289 
pad I'm designed to use a circle back
because<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.340> better<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.060> I'm

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
because I like it a lot better and I'm

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.789

used to the iphone and all that stuff
and<00:02:07.340> when<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.550> tilt<00:02:08.849> controls<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> 3d

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and when you use tilt controls the 3d

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.020 
and when you use tilt controls the 3d
doesn't<00:02:10.140> work<00:02:10.920> too<00:02:11.400> well<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
doesn't work too well because you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
doesn't work too well because you
combine<00:02:12.300> tilting

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
combine tilting

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.540 
combine tilting

the sweet spot of seeing on staying in

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.480 
the sweet spot of seeing on staying in
3d<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.180> you'll<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.960> if<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> 3ds<00:02:19.800> so

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
3d as you'll know if you have a 3ds so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.070 
3d as you'll know if you have a 3ds so

way<00:02:25.320> more<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.800> deep<00:02:25.950> end<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.340> think<00:02:26.370> it's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
way more in the deep end I think it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.150 
way more in the deep end I think it's
one<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.030> huge<00:02:27.630> improvement<00:02:28.260> anyways<00:02:28.950> what

you can unlock as well basically there's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.070 
you can unlock as well basically there's
three<00:03:05.760> different<00:03:05.880> worlds<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.660> each<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.990> them

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
three different worlds and each of them

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.380 
three different worlds and each of them
has<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> set<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.160> three<00:03:08.460> tracks<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.240> play

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
has a set of three tracks if you play

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.790 
has a set of three tracks if you play
grand<00:03:09.720> prix<00:03:10.050> play<00:03:10.410> through<00:03:10.650> those

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
grand prix play through those

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.890 
grand prix play through those
sequentially<00:03:11.520> or<00:03:11.670> if<00:03:12.240> you<00:03:12.300> play<00:03:12.480> quick<00:03:12.720> race

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
sequentially or if you play quick race

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.950 
sequentially or if you play quick race
you<00:03:13.080> can<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.380> choose<00:03:13.590> from<00:03:13.890> each<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:15.780> it

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
you can just choose from each one so it

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.060 
you can just choose from each one so it
takes<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.200> little<00:03:16.290> while<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.560> load<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:16.980> then

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
takes a little while to load and then

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.070 
takes a little while to load and then
you<00:03:17.430> can<00:03:17.580> start<00:03:17.790> up<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.239> just<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.780> mario

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
you can start up and just like mario

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.540 
you can start up and just like mario
kart<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.709> press<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:19.980> at<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.250> right<00:03:20.340> time

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
kart if you press it at the right time

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.699 
kart if you press it at the right time
you<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.730> get<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> boost<00:03:21.300> it's<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:22.110> little<00:03:22.410> harder

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
you can get a boost it's a little harder

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.550 
you can get a boost it's a little harder
to<00:03:22.739> time<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:24.300> not<00:03:24.510> as<00:03:24.630> much<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.020> sound

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
to time and it's not as much of a sound

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320 
to time and it's not as much of a sound
effect<00:03:25.709> than<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.100> do<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.000> go<00:03:27.150> through

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
effect than you do but you go through

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.690 
effect than you do but you go through
those<00:03:27.450> gates<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.959> get<00:03:28.170> items<00:03:29.160> which<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.550> then

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
those gates to get items which you then

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.120 
those gates to get items which you then
shoot<00:03:29.970> with<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> left<00:03:30.480> trigger<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.920> right

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
shoot with the left trigger the right

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.510 
shoot with the left trigger the right
trigger<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:33.209> used<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.930> spin<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.739> drift<00:03:35.160> which

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
trigger is used the spin and drift which

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.310 
trigger is used the spin and drift which
is<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.670> little<00:03:36.000> harder<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.450> control<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.170> is

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
is a little harder to control and it is

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.280 
is a little harder to control and it is
in<00:03:37.470> mario<00:03:37.770> kart<00:03:38.180> but<00:03:39.180> it's<00:03:39.480> definitely<00:03:39.720> useful

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
in mario kart but it's definitely useful

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.090 
in mario kart but it's definitely useful
for<00:03:40.830> turning<00:03:41.760> very<00:03:41.940> quickly<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.800> like<00:03:44.070> i

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
for turning very quickly so it like i

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.170 
for turning very quickly so it like i
said<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> lot<00:03:44.580> like<00:03:44.700> Mark<00:03:44.880> fight<00:03:45.060> we're

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
said it's a lot like Mark fight we're

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.460 
said it's a lot like Mark fight we're
just<00:03:45.300> going<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.480> run<00:03:45.810> through<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:46.020> few<00:03:46.080> laps

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
just going to run through a few laps

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.820 
just going to run through a few laps
here<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.010> show<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:47.940> how<00:03:48.030> all<00:03:48.450> works<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.440> this

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.550 
here and show you how all works and this
looks<00:03:50.070> very<00:03:50.370> nice<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.970> three<00:03:51.390> dimensions<00:03:52.080> and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
looks very nice in three dimensions and

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.340 
looks very nice in three dimensions and
I<00:03:53.130> can't<00:03:53.370> display<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.910> but<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:55.020> fun<00:03:55.320> and

I can't display that but it is fun and

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.470 
I can't display that but it is fun and
especially<00:03:55.920> getting<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.550> new<00:03:56.700> 3ds<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.360> one

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
especially getting a new 3ds and one

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.479 
especially getting a new 3ds and one
trying<00:03:57.810> all<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.200> type<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.410> game<00:03:58.650> modes<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.130> 3d

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
trying all the type of game modes in 3d

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.310 
trying all the type of game modes in 3d
monkey<00:04:00.180> ball<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.630> pretty<00:04:00.840> good<00:04:01.080> game

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
monkey ball is a pretty good game

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.050 
monkey ball is a pretty good game
because<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.709> get<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.950> lot<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.220> variations<00:04:02.910> to

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
because you get a lot of variations to

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.650 
because you get a lot of variations to
try<00:04:03.420> out<00:04:03.600> your<00:04:03.630> 3d<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.060> like<00:04:06.060> we<00:04:06.209> said<00:04:06.390> many

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
try out your 3d and like we said many

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.870 
try out your 3d and like we said many
times<00:04:06.750> it's<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.500> lot<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.890> Mario<00:04:08.340> Kart<00:04:08.610> so<00:04:08.820> if

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
times it's a lot like Mario Kart so if

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.430 
times it's a lot like Mario Kart so if
you're<00:04:09.030> looking<00:04:09.120> forward<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.780> or<00:04:10.230> like

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.140 
the previous version you'll probably
like<00:04:12.420> this<00:04:12.660> now<00:04:13.590> I'm<00:04:13.950> going<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.190> be<00:04:14.400> quitting

make all the computers the other so you

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.990 
make all the computers the other so you
have<00:04:37.870> three<00:04:38.169> stages<00:04:38.759> just<00:04:39.759> choose<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000

easiest one for video purposes and

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.860 
easiest one for video purposes and
continue<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:47.970> once<00:04:48.970> this<00:04:49.150> loads<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:52.539> can<00:04:52.569> see

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
continue so once this loads you can see

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.839 
continue so once this loads you can see
you<00:04:53.139> can't<00:04:53.349> see<00:04:53.530> in<00:04:53.590> 3d<00:04:53.800> but<00:04:54.129> this<00:04:54.430> version

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
you can't see in 3d but this version

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.999 
you can't see in 3d but this version
also<00:04:55.270> looks<00:04:55.659> very<00:04:55.960> well<00:04:56.199> incorporated<00:04:56.800> with

also looks very well incorporated with
3d<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.659> can<00:04:58.840> look<00:04:58.960> forward<00:04:59.259> to<00:04:59.379> that<00:04:59.620> what

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
reminds me of like a dumbed down version

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.170 
reminds me of like a dumbed down version
of<00:05:20.620> super<00:05:20.949> smash<00:05:21.159> brothers<00:05:21.430> if<00:05:21.789> you<00:05:21.879> ever<00:05:21.969> play

of super smash brothers if you ever play
that<00:05:22.229> it's<00:05:23.229> a<00:05:23.440> pretty<00:05:23.680> fun<00:05:23.949> game<00:05:24.000> definitely
