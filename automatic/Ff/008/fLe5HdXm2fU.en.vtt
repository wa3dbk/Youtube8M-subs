00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.070 

I'm<00:00:01.050> back<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:02.149> part<00:00:03.149> three<00:00:04.140> um<00:00:05.870> this<00:00:06.870> is

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
I'm back this is part three um this is

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.500 
I'm back this is part three um this is
another<00:00:07.379> random<00:00:07.770> bit<00:00:08.130> when<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.059> have<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.330> power

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
another random bit when I have the power

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.419 
another random bit when I have the power
on<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.950> toggled<00:00:11.550> random<00:00:11.969> bit<00:00:12.090> i<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.420> i

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
on it's a toggled random bit i think i

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.880 
on it's a toggled random bit i think i
flank<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.030> frankly<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.260> know<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:16.740> this

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
flank I I frankly do not know how this

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.560 
flank I I frankly do not know how this
works<00:00:18.650> it<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.920> seems<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.279> my<00:00:20.400> put<00:00:21.390> more

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
works it just seems for my put more

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.810 
works it just seems for my put more
power<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.050> faster<00:00:22.590> turns<00:00:22.890> off<00:00:23.100> faster<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
power to it faster turns off faster I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.750 
power to it faster turns off faster I
don't<00:00:24.720> know<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> works<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.580> my

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
don't know how it works I think in my

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.970 
don't know how it works I think in my
opinion<00:00:27.080> when<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.140> put<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> power<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.710> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
opinion when you put the power in it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.780 
opinion when you put the power in it
turns<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:30.080> then<00:00:31.080> after<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> while<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:32.279> random

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
turns it on then after a while of random

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
turns it on then after a while of random
why<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> time<00:00:33.719> it'll<00:00:34.020> turn<00:00:34.290> itself<00:00:34.620> back

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
why not a time it'll turn itself back

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.180 
why not a time it'll turn itself back
off<00:00:35.219> we'll<00:00:36.180> come<00:00:36.450> back<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.840> app<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.860> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
off we'll come back to that app in that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.959 
off we'll come back to that app in that
and<00:00:38.430> an<00:00:38.579> episode<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.350> see<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.710> true<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and an episode and see if that's true so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.250 
and an episode and see if that's true so
we're<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> end<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
we're just going to get to the end of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.790 
we're just going to get to the end of
this<00:00:43.350> rail<00:00:43.620> for<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.920> episode<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.379> then<00:00:46.379> all

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
this rail for this episode and then all

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.420 
this rail for this episode and then all
the<00:00:47.129> other<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.329> don't<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:49.190> these<00:00:50.329> so

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
the other one all I don't know these so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
the other one all I don't know these so
this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.210> clock<00:00:54.480> i<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:54.899> convert

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
this is like the clock i think convert

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.150 
this is like the clock i think convert
last<00:00:55.829> episode<00:00:57.440> except<00:00:58.440> i'm<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.980> sure<00:01:01.160> if

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
last episode except i'm just not sure if

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.630 
last episode except i'm just not sure if
it<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.820> no<00:01:03.149> way<00:01:03.359> soon<00:01:03.660> with<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> clock

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.370 

again<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:10.619> seems<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.570> i<00:01:12.600> click<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
again it seems that the more i click the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.969 
again it seems that the more i click the
letter<00:01:13.700> stash<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.939> goes<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.830> i'm

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
letter stash it goes on and off so i'm

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.240 
letter stash it goes on and off so i'm
not<00:01:17.159> sure<00:01:17.430> how<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> works<00:01:18.890> there<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.040> bit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
not sure how that works there any bit

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.880 
not sure how that works there any bit
suppose<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> i<00:01:22.500> don't<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.860> um

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
suppose not going off so i don't know um

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
suppose not going off so i don't know um
I've<00:01:25.890> noticed<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.549> few<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.689> ICS<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.320> are

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
I've noticed a few of the ICS that are

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.700 
I've noticed a few of the ICS that are
broken<00:01:28.680> maybe<00:01:29.130> those<00:01:29.369> are<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.700> two<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.030> them

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
broken maybe those are just two of them

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.410 
broken maybe those are just two of them
this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> transmitter<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.030> showed<00:01:33.329> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
this is a transmitter as you showed in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.039 
this is a transmitter as you showed in
the<00:01:33.509> first<00:01:33.750> episode<00:01:35.270> when<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> power<00:01:36.570> goes<00:01:36.630> in

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the first episode when the power goes in

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.550 
the first episode when the power goes in
it<00:01:37.259> goes<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.680> receiver<00:01:38.220> down<00:01:38.729> there<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.560> if

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it goes to receiver down there and if

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.819 
it goes to receiver down there and if
it's<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> power<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.670> receiver<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.320> if

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it's the power out of the receiver so if

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
it's the power out of the receiver so if
you<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> bunch<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> first<00:01:44.640> episode<00:01:45.030> it's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you have a bunch of first episode it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.429 
you have a bunch of first episode it's
it's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.799> further<00:01:47.009> explain<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> their<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it's a further explain to their this is

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's a further explain to their this is
a<00:01:49.470> mob<00:01:49.950> spawner<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:51.240> spawns<00:01:51.750> every<00:01:52.079> single<00:01:52.350> mom

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
a mob spawner it spawns every single mom

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
a mob spawner it spawns every single mom
including<00:01:52.979> joints<00:01:54.049> um<00:01:55.880> once<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.030> finished<00:01:57.329> want

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
including joints um once I finished want

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
including joints um once I finished want

new player coop um I'll show you what

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.759 
new player coop um I'll show you what
things<00:02:09.289> that<00:02:09.440> I've<00:02:09.619> done<00:02:09.649> with<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:12.080> ICS<00:02:12.560> we

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
things that I've done with the ICS we

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.100 
things that I've done with the ICS we
have<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.950> PVE<00:02:13.370> area<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.879> that<00:02:13.970> these<00:02:14.480> users<00:02:14.870> and

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
have a PVE area and that these users and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.869 
have a PVE area and that these users and
it<00:02:15.200> uses<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.530> bunch<00:02:15.890> more<00:02:16.069> i<00:02:16.160> sees<00:02:16.400> initially

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
it uses a bunch more i sees initially

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.479 
it uses a bunch more i sees initially
these<00:02:16.940> multipliers<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:18.590> basically<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.430> will

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
these multipliers but basically it will

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.240 
these multipliers but basically it will
spawn<00:02:19.849> a<00:02:19.879> pink<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.510> each<00:02:20.660> current<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:22.190> goes

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
spawn a pink with each current that goes

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.820 
spawn a pink with each current that goes
into<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:24.230> cell<00:02:24.440> phone<00:02:24.560> i<00:02:24.590> put<00:02:24.799> a

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
into it and the cell phone i put a

block now note it does not turn the
block<00:02:54.650> off<00:02:54.890> when<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.250> power<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.489> on<00:02:55.700> it's<00:02:55.849> a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
block off when the power is on it's a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.900 
block off when the power is on it's a
one-time<00:02:56.359> deal<00:02:56.420> only<00:02:57.019> now<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:58.250> are<00:02:58.459> things

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
one-time deal only now there are things

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.099 
one-time deal only now there are things
that<00:02:59.060> will<00:03:00.190> um<00:03:01.190> make<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.390> block<00:03:02.599> disappear

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
that will um make the block disappear

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.680 
that will um make the block disappear
afterwards<00:03:03.640> now<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:04.819> is<00:03:04.879> the<00:03:05.000> same<00:03:05.299> thing<00:03:05.540> it

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
afterwards now this is the same thing it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.319 
afterwards now this is the same thing it
could<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.989> place<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.410> block<00:03:06.620> right<00:03:07.190> here

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
could the place is the block right here

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.569 
could the place is the block right here
and<00:03:08.329> set<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.599> up<00:03:08.690> there<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.489> tough<00:03:10.489> to

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
and set it up there it's a tough to

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.170 
and set it up there it's a tough to
block<00:03:10.609> below<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.609> the<00:03:13.970> gold

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
block below so you just do that the gold

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.270 
block below so you just do that the gold
block<00:03:14.389> up<00:03:14.569> here's<00:03:14.780> cuz<00:03:14.989> i<00:03:15.079> have<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:15.470> I'm<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.099> ID

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
block up here's cuz i have it I'm the ID

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.289 
block up here's cuz i have it I'm the ID
it's<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.910> goal<00:03:17.090> but<00:03:17.239> they're<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.000> block

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
it's a goal but they're like a block

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.370 
it's a goal but they're like a block
interesting<00:03:20.750> now<00:03:21.380> this<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.680> cent<00:03:22.160> blog<00:03:22.459> now

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
interesting now this is a cent blog now

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.569 
interesting now this is a cent blog now
my<00:03:24.380> here<00:03:24.620> I'll<00:03:24.769> have<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.010> as<00:03:25.329> 41<00:03:26.329> dash<00:03:26.930> 42<00:03:27.579> which

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
my here I'll have it as 41 dash 42 which

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.259 
my here I'll have it as 41 dash 42 which
means<00:03:28.849> it<00:03:29.209> will<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.870> between<00:03:30.340> an<00:03:31.340> iron<00:03:31.910> block

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
means it will go between an iron block

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.199 
means it will go between an iron block
and<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.599> gold<00:03:32.810> blog<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:33.620> hot<00:03:34.489> chocolate<00:03:34.970> they'll

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
and a gold blog so hot chocolate they'll

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.199 
and a gold blog so hot chocolate they'll
go<00:03:35.389> to<00:03:35.419> gold<00:03:35.690> block<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.560> goes<00:03:36.709> no<00:03:37.340> power<00:03:37.609> it'll

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
go to gold block it goes no power it'll

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.270 
go to gold block it goes no power it'll
go<00:03:38.299> back<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.569> Iron<00:03:38.750> now<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.709> could<00:03:40.130> do<00:03:40.250> something

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
go back to Iron now I could do something

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.470 
go back to Iron now I could do something
like<00:03:40.700> forty<00:03:41.239> one<00:03:41.450> dash<00:03:41.870> 0<00:03:42.459> so<00:03:43.459> it'll<00:03:43.880> disappear

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
like forty one dash 0 so it'll disappear

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.780 
like forty one dash 0 so it'll disappear
when<00:03:45.910> there's<00:03:46.910> no<00:03:47.180> power<00:03:47.450> i<00:03:47.630> think<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.829> gold

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
when there's no power i think the gold

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.339 
when there's no power i think the gold
block<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.150> what<00:03:50.329> he<00:03:50.389> wants<00:03:50.599> oh<00:03:50.690> yeah<00:03:50.870> if

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
block is what he wants oh yeah if

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.430 
block is what he wants oh yeah if
they're<00:03:51.919> if<00:03:52.310> there's<00:03:52.760> no<00:03:53.269> power<00:03:53.540> it'll

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
they're if there's no power it'll

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.970 
they're if there's no power it'll
disappear<00:03:54.889> if<00:03:55.040> there<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.310> no<00:03:55.459> real<00:03:55.700> comeback

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
disappear if there is no real comeback

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.059 
disappear if there is no real comeback
now<00:03:57.980> this<00:03:58.099> is<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.310> set<00:03:58.849> p<00:03:59.239> door<00:03:59.650> now<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.829> don't

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
now this is a set p door now I don't

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.690 
now this is a set p door now I don't
really<00:04:01.160> know<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.730> does<00:04:02.000> but<00:04:02.810> well<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:04.519> can

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
really know this does but well you can

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.080 
really know this does but well you can
see<00:04:04.940> what<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.180> does<00:04:05.829> probably<00:04:06.829> understand<00:04:07.250> how

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
see what it does probably understand how

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.000 
see what it does probably understand how
like<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.959> applications<00:04:09.530> for<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.799> right<00:04:09.980> now

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
like the applications for this right now

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.580 
like the applications for this right now
I<00:04:10.129> haven't<00:04:10.400> read<00:04:10.639> about<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:11.180> much<00:04:11.590> but

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
I haven't read about that much but

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.870 
I haven't read about that much but
basically

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
basically

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.660 
basically
again<00:04:14.510> like<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:14.960> i<00:04:15.230> have<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.740> set<00:04:15.770> so<00:04:16.160> it's

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
again like this i have it set so it's

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.650 
again like this i have it set so it's
bedrock<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.810> obsidian<00:04:18.820> one<00:04:19.820> power<00:04:20.120> goes<00:04:20.360> in

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
bedrock and obsidian one power goes in

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.020 
bedrock and obsidian one power goes in
it<00:04:20.959> changes<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:21.650> let's<00:04:22.490> change<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.970> to

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
it changes that let's change that to

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.140 
it changes that let's change that to
bedrock<00:04:24.100> empowers<00:04:25.100> your<00:04:25.220> move<00:04:25.430> it'll<00:04:25.850> go<00:04:25.970> back

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
bedrock empowers your move it'll go back

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.340 
bedrock empowers your move it'll go back
to<00:04:26.330> obsidian<00:04:27.310> now<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:29.660> starts<00:04:30.140> at<00:04:30.320> three

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
to obsidian now it's it starts at three

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.480 
to obsidian now it's it starts at three
away<00:04:30.620> from<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.860> block<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.420> goes<00:04:32.570> one<00:04:33.050> two

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
away from the block so it goes one two

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.840 
away from the block so it goes one two
three<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.850> starts<00:04:35.180> right<00:04:35.240> here<00:04:36.220> now<00:04:37.220> this

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
three and it starts right here now this

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.120 
three and it starts right here now this
next<00:04:38.240> number<00:04:38.420> after<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.200> colon<00:04:39.440> indicates

does<00:04:49.880> iron<00:04:50.590> but<00:04:51.590> it's<00:04:52.160> kind<00:04:52.550> of<00:04:52.610> same<00:04:52.850> thing<00:04:53.090> I

guess<00:04:53.390> um<00:04:53.890> it's<00:04:54.890> just<00:04:54.950> toggles<00:04:55.490> between<00:04:56.530> 57

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
guess um it's just toggles between 57

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.120 
guess um it's just toggles between 57
diamond<00:04:57.920> block<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.370> gold<00:04:58.520> box<00:04:59.470> which<00:05:00.470> is<00:05:00.680> five

diamond block and gold box which is five

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.340

away<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.790> it's<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.270> three<00:05:02.930> long<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:05.960> lot<00:05:06.320> of

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
away and it's a three long a lot of

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.040
