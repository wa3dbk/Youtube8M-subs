so<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.099> est<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.820> we'll<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.059> using

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
so this is the est that we'll be using

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.870 
so this is the est that we'll be using
on<00:00:15.509> our<00:00:15.540> little<00:00:15.900> project<00:00:16.350> as<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:17.520> can<00:00:17.670> see

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
on our little project as you can see

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.260 
on our little project as you can see
it's<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> turnigy<00:00:18.600> century<00:00:19.140> 40<00:00:19.590> amp<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.270> it

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
it's the turnigy century 40 amp and it

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.750 
it's the turnigy century 40 amp and it
came<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.810> 20<00:00:22.109> dollars<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.680> 91<00:00:23.100> cents<00:00:23.550> if

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
came in at 20 dollars and 91 cents if

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.250 
came in at 20 dollars and 91 cents if
you're<00:00:23.939> keeping<00:00:24.119> track<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> cost<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.140> this

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you're keeping track of the cost of this

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
you're keeping track of the cost of this
little<00:00:25.529> build<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:27.090> reason<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.390> chose<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
little build and the reason I chose the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
little build and the reason I chose the
century<00:00:28.289> over<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> plush<00:00:29.010> version<00:00:29.340> also

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
century over the plush version also

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.120 
century over the plush version also
offered<00:00:30.269> by<00:00:30.420> turnigy<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.260> because<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.980> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
offered by turnigy is because that this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.120 
offered by turnigy is because that this
one<00:00:32.369> comes<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.030> switching<00:00:33.660> VEC<00:00:34.200> whereas

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
one comes with a switching VEC whereas

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.990 
one comes with a switching VEC whereas
the<00:00:35.280> plush<00:00:35.520> comes<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.390> linear<00:00:36.780> BGC

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
the plush comes with a linear BGC

another feature that this one has over
that<00:00:41.280> plush<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.360> comes<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that plush is that it comes with the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.340 
that plush is that it comes with the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
going to use this feature for two

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.000 
going to use this feature for two
reasons<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.360> balanced<00:00:57.780> charge<00:00:58.140> my

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
reasons one because I balanced charge my

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.650 
reasons one because I balanced charge my
batteries<00:00:59.489> after<00:00:59.699> every<00:01:00.629> run<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:02.660> because

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
batteries after every run and because

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.620 
batteries after every run and because
the<00:01:03.960> wire<00:01:04.199> running<00:01:05.010> from<00:01:05.129> them<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> ESC

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
the wire running from them from the ESC

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.500 
the wire running from them from the ESC
to<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> balanced<00:01:07.350> port<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.180> long<00:01:09.479> enough

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
to the balanced port is not long enough

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.800 
to the balanced port is not long enough
to<00:01:09.960> reach<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> battery<00:01:11.400> compartment<00:01:11.810> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
to reach from the battery compartment to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.200 
to reach from the battery compartment to
where<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.070> mounting<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> ESC

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
where I'm going to be mounting the ESC

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.020 
where I'm going to be mounting the ESC
which<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.200> within<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> cowl<00:01:17.189> underneath<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
which is within the cowl underneath the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
which is within the cowl underneath the
motor<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.320> closer<00:01:22.560> look<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
motor this is just a closer look at the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
motor this is just a closer look at the
motor<00:01:23.340> we'll<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.670> using<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.119> project

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
motor we'll be using in this project

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.219 
motor we'll be using in this project
it's<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.170> Eternity<00:01:25.770> 35<00:01:26.369> 36<00:01:26.939> 1100<00:01:27.689> kV<00:01:28.020> motor

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it's the Eternity 35 36 1100 kV motor

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's the Eternity 35 36 1100 kV motor
and<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.729> hoping<00:01:30.030> from<00:01:30.210> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and all I'm really hoping from this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.770 
and all I'm really hoping from this
motor<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.439> will<00:01:31.590> help<00:01:31.799> me<00:01:31.920> achieve

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
motor is that it will help me achieve

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
motor is that it will help me achieve
shorter<00:01:33.780> takeoffs<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.530> should<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.920> ample

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
shorter takeoffs it should be ample

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
shorter takeoffs it should be ample
power<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> also<00:01:36.299> give<00:01:36.630> me<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.780> good

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
power for that and also give me a good

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.789 
power for that and also give me a good
climb<00:01:37.350> rate<00:01:38.659> this<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> servo<00:01:40.530> we'll<00:01:40.680> be

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
climb rate this is the servo we'll be

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
climb rate this is the servo we'll be
using<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> project<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.869> two

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
using in the project it's all of two

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780 
using in the project it's all of two
dollars<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.470> sixty<00:01:43.799> nine<00:01:43.950> cents<00:01:44.220> each<00:01:44.430> it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
dollars and sixty nine cents each it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
dollars and sixty nine cents each it's
the<00:01:44.970> nine<00:01:45.149> ground<00:01:45.479> servo<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.409> hobbyking<00:01:47.070> and

the nine ground servo from hobbyking and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.969 
the nine ground servo from hobbyking and
it's<00:01:48.180> kind<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.420> hard<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.659> believe<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it's kind of hard to believe that you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's kind of hard to believe that you
can<00:01:50.159> put<00:01:50.340> six<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:50.850> into<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> plane<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.840> a

can put six of these into a plane for a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.170 
can put six of these into a plane for a
total<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.320> sixteen<00:01:52.649> dollars<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.189> change<00:01:53.430> so

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
total of sixteen dollars and change so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.429 
total of sixteen dollars and change so
if<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> build<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> budget<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
if you want to build on a budget it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.980 
if you want to build on a budget it
doesn't<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.829> much<00:01:55.979> cheaper<00:01:56.399> than<00:01:56.430> this

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
doesn't get much cheaper than this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.270 
doesn't get much cheaper than this
there's<00:01:57.990> enough<00:01:58.229> content<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.890> there<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.159> the

there's enough content out there on the

these things that I'm not terribly

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.539 
these things that I'm not terribly
worried<00:02:03.750> about<00:02:03.899> them<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.259> did<00:02:04.649> hook<00:02:05.040> several<00:02:05.460> of

worried about them I did hook several of
them<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.170> they<00:02:07.170> all<00:02:07.290> seemed<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.560> Center

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
them up and they all seemed to Center

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.219 
them up and they all seemed to Center
fairly<00:02:08.310> well<00:02:08.429> I've<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:09.479> two<00:02:09.810> installed

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
fairly well I've got two installed

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.210 
fairly well I've got two installed
already<00:02:10.560> one<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> elevator<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.730> for

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
already one for the elevator and one for

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.460 
already one for the elevator and one for
and<00:02:12.490> they<00:02:12.820> moved<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.420> control<00:02:13.750> services<00:02:14.260> just

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and they moved the control services just

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.540 
and they moved the control services just
fine<00:02:16.350> well<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.650> want<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.920> build<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.250> project

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
fine well if you want to build a project

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.580 
fine well if you want to build a project
on<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> budget<00:02:19.240> there's<00:02:19.990> no<00:02:20.080> better<00:02:20.260> place<00:02:20.530> than

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
on a budget there's no better place than

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.320 
on a budget there's no better place than
to<00:02:21.250> start<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> $7<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.930> 95<00:02:23.410> Sentra<00:02:23.890> Seaver

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330

giving<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.200> try<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.830> am<00:02:33.580> obviously<00:02:33.910> worried

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
giving this a try I am obviously worried

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.570 
giving this a try I am obviously worried
about<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.870> as<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.050> am<00:02:35.440> sure<00:02:35.740> many<00:02:35.920> others<00:02:36.310> are

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
about it as I am sure many others are

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.790 
about it as I am sure many others are
especially<00:02:37.330> when<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.810> invest<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.290> lot<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.590> time

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
especially when you invest a lot of time

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.160 
especially when you invest a lot of time
and<00:02:39.160> effort<00:02:39.880> into<00:02:40.150> putting<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.510> plane<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.900> into

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
and effort into putting a plane up into

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
the air you want to make sure you can

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.120 
the air you want to make sure you can
get<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.820> back<00:02:43.000> well<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.110> feel<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.530> lot<00:02:44.709> better<00:02:44.770> now

has<00:02:47.200> three<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> these<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:48.100> some<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.060> his<00:02:49.180> planes

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
has three of these in some of his planes

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.449 
has three of these in some of his planes
and<00:02:50.730> he<00:02:51.730> he<00:02:52.330> reports<00:02:52.840> back<00:02:52.990> that<00:02:53.560> there's<00:02:54.160> been

and he he reports back that there's been
absolutely<00:02:54.670> no<00:02:55.120> issues<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.290> they<00:02:56.470> work

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
absolutely no issues and that they work

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.630 
absolutely no issues and that they work
just<00:02:56.709> great

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
just great

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.090 
just great
he's<00:02:58.180> even<00:02:58.450> flown<00:02:58.660> one<00:02:58.900> plane<00:02:59.140> pretty<00:02:59.950> much

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
he's even flown one plane pretty much

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.490 
he's even flown one plane pretty much
out<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.340> sight<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.970> had<00:03:01.660> no<00:03:01.959> trouble

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
out of sight and had no trouble

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.940 
out of sight and had no trouble
whatsoever<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.060> hoped<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.780> up<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.050> a<00:03:05.590> radio

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
whatsoever so I I hoped it up to a radio

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.970 
whatsoever so I I hoped it up to a radio
and<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.580> was<00:03:07.270> able<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.630> bind<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.110> right<00:03:08.350> away<00:03:08.590> to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
and I was able to bind it right away to

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.660 
and I was able to bind it right away to
my<00:03:09.130> dx7<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:11.140> operated<00:03:11.800> some<00:03:12.040> servos<00:03:12.430> with

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
my dx7 and I operated some servos with

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.070 
my dx7 and I operated some servos with
that<00:03:13.000> there<00:03:13.270> doesn't<00:03:13.450> seem<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.750> be<00:03:13.840> any

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
that there doesn't seem to be any

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.320 
that there doesn't seem to be any
glitching<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.860> so<00:03:15.730> I'm<00:03:15.820> really<00:03:15.940> looking

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
glitching and so I'm really looking

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.270 
glitching and so I'm really looking
forward<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.660> giving<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.470> try<00:03:17.530> because

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
forward to giving this a try because

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.390 
forward to giving this a try because
yeah<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.150> they<00:03:19.390> work<00:03:19.600> as<00:03:19.810> well<00:03:20.080> as<00:03:20.320> I'm<00:03:21.070> hoping

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
yeah if they work as well as I'm hoping

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.170 
yeah if they work as well as I'm hoping
they're<00:03:21.550> going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.940> what<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> great<00:03:23.140> score<00:03:23.470> at

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
they're going to what a great score at

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.070 
they're going to what a great score at
$7.95<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> left<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.090> 3-inch<00:03:28.630> Toubro

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
$7.95 to the left is the 3-inch Toubro

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.890 
$7.95 to the left is the 3-inch Toubro
superlight<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.850> had<00:03:31.330> planned<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.720> using

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
superlight that I had planned on using

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.350 
superlight that I had planned on using
for<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.320> project<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:33.010> sitting<00:03:33.910> beside<00:03:34.209> it

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
for this project and sitting beside it

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.090 
for this project and sitting beside it
is<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.570> stock<00:03:35.110> wheel<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.560> tire<00:03:35.680> combination

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
is the stock wheel and tire combination

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.670 
is the stock wheel and tire combination
that<00:03:36.550> comes<00:03:36.760> with<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.390> Super<00:03:37.630> Cub<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.530> can

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
that comes with the Super Cub so you can

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.020 
that comes with the Super Cub so you can
see<00:03:38.830> there's<00:03:39.040> quite<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.220> dramatic<00:03:39.400> difference

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
see there's quite a dramatic difference

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.390 
see there's quite a dramatic difference
in<00:03:40.180> terms<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.720> size<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.830> I<00:03:41.890> think<00:03:42.100> it's<00:03:42.220> going

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
in terms of size and I think it's going

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.070 
in terms of size and I think it's going
to<00:03:42.430> help<00:03:42.730> give<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.209> bush<00:03:43.480> play<00:03:43.690> look<00:03:43.930> that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
to help give it that bush play look that

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.350 
to help give it that bush play look that
we're<00:03:44.200> after<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.799> will<00:03:45.459> share<00:03:45.670> with<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.180> I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
we're after I will share with you that I

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.590 
we're after I will share with you that I
have<00:03:46.570> ordered<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.290> set<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.980> Eppler<00:03:48.600> foam

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
have ordered a set of the Eppler foam

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.720 
have ordered a set of the Eppler foam
wheels<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:50.290> come<00:03:50.470> on<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.799> multiplex<00:03:51.280> fun

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
wheels that come on the multiplex fun

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.300 
wheels that come on the multiplex fun
cub<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.269> when<00:03:53.019> they<00:03:53.140> get<00:03:53.320> here<00:03:53.620> if<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:53.890> can<00:03:54.190> get

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
cub and when they get here if I can get

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.009 
cub and when they get here if I can get
them<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.549> work<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.030> think<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.420> might<00:03:55.630> substitute

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
them to work I think I might substitute
