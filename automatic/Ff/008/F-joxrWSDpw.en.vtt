00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello youtube friends I'm here from 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.900
 new with this video which is the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.740
 problem with this hp officejet printer 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.740
 45 75 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.539
 model 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.800
 every 7 10 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.960
 ante pettitte 675 ok 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.289
 we go general or main then it turns out 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.359
 that this printer I've been seeing what 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.079
 many say that the logical failure of the 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.590
 printer because blue light though 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.450
 well this problem many call of that 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.310
 it is a software or logical error 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.700
 It can be many times because of the terror that 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.710
 generates ok but let's see where 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 It is the error where lies where 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.500
 starts this logic error so that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 many think that it is a mistake of the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.520
 software because it 's on the page 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.489
 hp official tells you that it is error of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.239
 software ok then let's give it 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:07.040
 start the printer that starts 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.040
 to do in this case the guide of the car 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.810
 loading 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.230
 the problem remains 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.590
 From home 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.710
 in the car and the scare returns you and good 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.430
 to continue and apart from that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.430
 he stays 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.460
 and the saying that depressing problem 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.490
 all right 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.969
 and the problem persists and continues 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.640
 the basis of the error in this printer or in 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.560
 this car in this piece that until the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.050
 today I could not find it and now 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.819
 I'm going to throw away this good machine, not so 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.660
 only to discard because only 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.730
 walking in the cartridges serves me asisa 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.160
 for printing I only have to 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.680
 disconnect the data strip that is going to 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.040
 devote to connectors with the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.440
 printer and in turn to the data cable 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.879
 that computers carry less for 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.610
 transfer the information that is going to 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.400
 print ok let's see where in 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.660
 reality lies the error we are going to 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.660
 proceed to stop the machine 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.830
 English 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.430
 and it stops completely although for this 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.189
 let's do the following 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.189
 I have it around all armed 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.040
 apparently everything seems to be 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.230
 normal 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.739
 everything seems to be located its position 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.390
 but to do a test we 'll see 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.390
 where the error is actually 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.230
 we turn on the machine 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.230
 and we will automatically see an anomaly 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.060
 how can you see this gear here 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.930
 is making a small flaw is 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.440
 going in band or swimming ok but if 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.390
 they notice something strange this article here 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.330
 is this track 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.580
 He will accompany us on these accounts 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.100
 cheerful with a support 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.100
 like a post that should not be 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.400
 doing in no time 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.350
 ok now with you where in 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.280
 reality are holy mistakes of this 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.950
 product 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.240
 and that's why at the beginning of avalor 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.240
 logic or software 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.930
 let's pay it 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.470
 and I 'm going to show you in short where 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.470
 is the verb 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.139
 ok the error ended in this case it 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.139
 find here in this piece 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.400
 in this piece here as you 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.400
 can see 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.730
 no longer try to paste it did not get 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.480
 because because it turns out that this piece 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.570
 when it reaches the top it starts to hit 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.940
 paste and paste and paste and that makes 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.640
 this piece is detached from its position 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.070
 so here in this has all the 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.310
 fails to start the error of 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.010
 logic or software 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.960
 and then it is automatically 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.300
 printers already for the only thing that is 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.620
 Worth it would be for printing only 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.560
 I have to change the cartridges 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.590
 the black and the color because then 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.350
 for fax seems clear in the copier not 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.190
 it's going to serve me for nothing then all 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.060
 this piece here and here and here 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.580
 was all the error in this little machine 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.760
 this does 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.280
 turn that when it hits the top 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.280
 can not return because he is not giving 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.220
 the signal to the sensor that I have to 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.670
 return to its original position 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.800
 ok then that certain the error of everything 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.780
 This product starts with an error of 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.680
 logical but already after it starts doing 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.990
 sounds sounds that you raise one says that 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.210
 it's nothing because it happens but already checking the 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.250
 piece 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.470
 that we simply realize that 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.340
 it is an error 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.860
 which is already generated on this track in this 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.599
 engine is no longer working well 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.789
 The only thing they can do is take the 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.860
 9 volt battery and go back to the times 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.659
 of childhood and put a stick of 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.620
 ice cream if it's not like you 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.620
 they told me that I did not have 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.700
 and that has been all for today friends I hope 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.009
 that you liked the video and that there 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.319
 been able to solve that problem 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.509
 because here you will find this piece going to 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.259
 be very difficult then what are we going to 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.259
 do the following 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.759
 disconnect here 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:35.290
 and leave this piece and that only this 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.690
 these pieces is in place and the 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:41.200
 machine is useful for printing nothing 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:43.750
 more because from there another operation does not 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.580
 I think you can give that has been everything 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.030
 my friends, I hope you liked the 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.220
 video 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:56.640
 Manito up please, manito down 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.640
 ok this thanks to 100,000
