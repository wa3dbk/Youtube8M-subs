00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.719

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.950

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.950
 The New York in the United States 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.549
 for that reason when he made decisions that 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 same and did not think much but I'm almost sure of the decision that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.189
 that I always take I do not regret not least and so it has been 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.789
 since since I went to Monaco since deciding to 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.000
 a barcelona too 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.810
 in and now 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.390
 I know what it is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.390
 is to improve for good 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.560
 if I come because I want to make history because I want to continue winning 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.370

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.090
 because I want to be an important part in this team and in this league also with 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.930

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.370

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.230

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.890
 from the public's trust until 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 ana roth win titles 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.750
 messina 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 consecrated comfortable situation in knowing what 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.710
 that a coach that I already knew as James has been 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.189
 what happened previously working 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.530
 a selection of mexico 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.600
 percent I think that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 he's a technician who has a lot of football idea 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.230
 I have to have enough character too 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.650
 I for that is comfortable and have the confidence to talk to him about 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.060
 certain points of being able to collaborate with him also 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.830
 so 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.440
 this is going to be a good group vidic roque the function to the holy seat evil 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.700
 made to see that they do not name 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.840
 the fantastic three I go I think it will be fine 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.650
 an honor a pleasure 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.930
 that they take that way my arrival and together with aetic iguano with the 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 experience like trialogue sometimes named from 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.920
 d pablo egerique 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.470
 how good we do not know enough 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.279
 d 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.920
 that section for europe and also for the national team 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.060
 of Colombian in everything that does what he has achieved and what he has done 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.479
 the north 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.379
 we go to the farc with him because he has the experience of several years of 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.309
 to be here 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.370
 this afternoon 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.949
 comes from being a set more than three we would like the eleven 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:36.359
 with the whole group of the team will rebound trying to achieve something 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.049
 important something that has not happened 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.190
 still to whom 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.630
 in new york is to get a title but but good the rewarding also 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.479
 To return to 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:51.759
 therefore with a component since in your in Barcelona the past 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:52.699
 years 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:58.129
 and bad times yes interest we have had a great friendship also and 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.000
 that also reflects what we reflect inside 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.279
 and off the court 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.509
 nuances silos challenges that 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:07.850
 what can 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.569
 the network is 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.779
 maybe mark a game style 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:15.370
 percent and continued and set out to the best series can coast 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.759
 adapt me here but 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.399
 it's normal to lose another one that I come with the best intentions of 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.210
 to be able to adapt 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.319
 the fastest man possible to the game 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.699
 I know it's not easy because I already know it's a bit of 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.329
 of the game he 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.290
 here in the united states mostly because 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.290
 in the clashes with the United States team 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.079
 and I know what good in the physical, because if demi has touched, he is also in 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.440
 france that these 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.939
 it's something like this 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.889
 in my good hour I do not think that 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.559
 here I go 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.540
 affect or 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.849
 has a copy will attend jorge that 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.049
 mainly do not stop doing what we have been doing and different 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.689
 dial teams 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.329
 as tribune 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.459
 a style of play on the team and thus be able to make a difference 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.860
 of the other teams of who in the mls
