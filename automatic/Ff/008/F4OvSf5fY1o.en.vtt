00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
know you want to know when you're just

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.360 
know you want to know when you're just
gonna<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> wait

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
gonna have to wait

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.270 
gonna have to wait
so<00:01:51.370> these<00:01:51.520> two<00:01:51.850> are<00:01:51.880> younger<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:56.040> they<00:01:57.040> are

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
so these two are younger and they are

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.510 
so these two are younger and they are
siblings<00:01:57.909> which<00:01:58.300> is<00:01:58.450> why<00:01:58.570> they're<00:01:58.750> together

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
siblings which is why they're together

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.859 
siblings which is why they're together
these<00:02:00.520> two<00:02:00.580> came<00:02:01.180> out<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:02.850> haystack<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.520> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
these two came out of a haystack and you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.480 
these two came out of a haystack and you
get<00:02:07.869> worked<00:02:08.140> out<00:02:08.320> in<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.530> haystack<00:02:08.979> there<00:02:09.280> are

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
get worked out in a haystack there are

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.980 
get worked out in a haystack there are
four<00:02:10.330> or<00:02:10.539> five<00:02:11.010> not<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.430> couple<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.840> we're

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
four or five not just a couple so we're

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.140 
four or five not just a couple so we're
not<00:02:14.080> sure<00:02:14.290> if<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.500> others<00:02:14.770> were<00:02:15.310> older<00:02:15.820> or

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
not sure if the others were older or

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:33.990 
not sure if the others were older or
they<00:02:16.720> just<00:02:16.750> want<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.350> find<00:02:17.709> them<00:02:17.920> yet<00:02:33.000> sound

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
they just want to find them yet sound

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.640 
they just want to find them yet sound
they're<00:02:34.209> making<00:02:34.600> are<00:02:34.690> pretty<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.110> message

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
they're making are pretty a message

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.250 
they're making are pretty a message
hands<00:02:35.920> down<00:02:36.220> their<00:02:36.520> defenses<00:02:37.080> one<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.170> their

defensive mechanisms advantage to having
the<00:02:43.420> mice<00:02:43.600> is<00:02:43.950> when<00:02:44.950> they<00:02:45.100> come<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.430> and

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
the mice is when they come in and

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.100 
the mice is when they come in and
they're<00:02:45.610> really<00:02:45.850> small<00:02:46.120> they<00:02:46.390> know<00:02:46.750> that's

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
they're really small they know that's

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.449 
they're really small they know that's
food<00:02:47.560> because<00:02:47.890> that's<00:02:48.040> what<00:02:48.160> their<00:02:48.280> mom's

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
food because that's what their mom's

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.160 
food because that's what their mom's
been<00:02:48.790> giving<00:02:49.060> them<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.810> when<00:02:50.050> they're

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
been giving them so that when they're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.300 
been giving them so that when they're
released<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.680> still<00:02:51.040> have<00:02:51.190> that

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
released they still have that

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.310 
released they still have that
familiarity<00:02:51.790> with<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.780> wild<00:02:53.140> food

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
familiarity with this is the wild food

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.039 
familiarity with this is the wild food
this<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.650> what<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.860> when<00:02:54.190> I<00:02:54.220> need<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.549> go<00:02:54.670> find

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
this is what I when I need to go find

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.320 
this is what I when I need to go find
you<00:02:56.049> know<00:02:56.200> once<00:02:56.650> they're<00:02:56.799> released<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:01.180> was

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
you know once they're released it was

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.880 
you know once they're released it was
found<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.930> either<00:03:02.110> i<00:03:02.260> would<00:03:02.500> probably

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
found on this either i would probably

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.990 
found on this either i would probably
got<00:03:03.040> hit<00:03:03.190> by<00:03:03.280> car

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.360 

yeah<00:03:06.690> I'm<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.380> it's<00:03:07.530> an<00:03:07.590> adult<00:03:07.920> red-tailed

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
yeah I'm so it's an adult red-tailed

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.390 
yeah I'm so it's an adult red-tailed
hawk<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.610> has<00:03:09.030> an<00:03:09.150> injury<00:03:09.600> on<00:03:09.900> its<00:03:10.590> left<00:03:11.040> wing

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
hawk that has an injury on its left wing

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.550 
hawk that has an injury on its left wing
at<00:03:11.730> about<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.300> elbow<00:03:12.780> probably<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
at about the elbow probably in the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.320 
at about the elbow probably in the
radius<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.160> ulna<00:03:14.220> not<00:03:14.640> actually<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
radius and the ulna not actually in the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.750 
radius and the ulna not actually in the
elbow<00:03:15.690> joint<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.680> what<00:03:17.070> we<00:03:17.220> were<00:03:17.340> doing<00:03:17.580> with

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
elbow joint so what we were doing with

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.580 
elbow joint so what we were doing with
Donna<00:03:18.300> who<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.900> our<00:03:18.990> students<00:03:19.470> out

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
Donna who is one of our students out

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.250 
Donna who is one of our students out
here<00:03:19.800> at<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.040> facility<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:21.510> checking<00:03:22.050> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
here at the facility and is checking the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.870 
here at the facility and is checking the
injury<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.920> see<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.340> it's<00:03:23.520> something<00:03:23.670> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
injury to see if it's something that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.500 
injury to see if it's something that
maybe<00:03:24.090> we<00:03:24.360> can<00:03:24.540> work<00:03:24.720> with<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:26.060> get<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.270> heal

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
maybe we can work with to get it to heal

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.090 
maybe we can work with to get it to heal
so<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.959> bird<00:03:28.080> can<00:03:28.260> be<00:03:28.620> released<00:03:28.920> which

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
so that the bird can be released which

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.850 
so that the bird can be released which
ultimately<00:03:29.310> would<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.270> our<00:03:30.450> goal<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:30.959> bird

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
ultimately would be our goal this bird

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.730 
ultimately would be our goal this bird
though<00:03:32.220> we're<00:03:32.580> not<00:03:32.700> sure<00:03:33.320> because<00:03:34.320> there<00:03:34.620> are

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
though we're not sure because there are

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.140 
though we're not sure because there are
a<00:03:34.800> couple<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.160> bones<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.670> look<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:35.940> they're

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
a couple of bones that look like they're

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.240 
a couple of bones that look like they're
exposed<00:03:36.660> with<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.080> injury<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.560> there<00:03:37.920> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
exposed with the injury that there and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.160 
exposed with the injury that there and
that<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.880> something<00:03:39.060> that's<00:03:39.300> very<00:03:39.420> hard<00:03:39.900> to

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
that is something that's very hard to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.150 
that is something that's very hard to
get<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.470> heal<00:03:40.800> so<00:03:41.580> that<00:03:41.760> they<00:03:41.880> are<00:03:41.910> releasable

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
get to heal so that they are releasable

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.110 
get to heal so that they are releasable
occasionally<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.459> ones<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.790> are<00:03:44.940> not

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
occasionally the ones that are not

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.229 
occasionally the ones that are not
releasable<00:03:45.600> do<00:03:46.530> become<00:03:46.830> display<00:03:47.250> birds<00:03:47.489> which

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
releasable do become display birds which

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.449 
releasable do become display birds which
all<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:49.140> our<00:03:49.260> birds<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.830> are<00:03:49.890> air<00:03:50.040> display

all of our birds that are air display
cages<00:03:50.760> are<00:03:50.880> ones<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.120> are<00:03:51.270> injured<00:03:51.630> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
cages are ones that are injured and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.750 
cages are ones that are injured and
cannot<00:03:52.170> be<00:03:52.230> released<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:53.340> those<00:03:53.550> are<00:03:53.580> the
