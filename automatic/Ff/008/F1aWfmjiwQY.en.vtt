come back to haunt it and you can see
here<00:00:08.130> even<00:00:08.690> what<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.809> problem<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.320> now<00:00:10.590> that

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.400 

wasn't<00:00:14.160> there<00:00:14.340> yesterday

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
wasn't there yesterday

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.609 
wasn't there yesterday
so<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.180> fuckload<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.390> oil<00:00:18.750> come<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.470> don't

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
so we can a fuckload of oil come I don't

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.640 
so we can a fuckload of oil come I don't
know<00:00:19.920> where<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.449> how<00:00:21.779> gloriously

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
know where you can see how gloriously

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.130 
know where you can see how gloriously
just<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> back<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.789> mud<00:00:24.029> flatbed<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
just on the back of mud flatbed the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.300 
just on the back of mud flatbed the
amount<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.470> oil<00:00:25.820> residue<00:00:26.820> everywhere<00:00:28.310> so

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
amount of oil residue everywhere so

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.389 
amount of oil residue everywhere so
anyway<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.810> all

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
anyway you can see it all

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.540 
anyway you can see it all
everywhere<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.280> watch<00:00:35.520> me

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
everywhere all in here you just watch me

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.360 
everywhere all in here you just watch me
fingers<00:00:36.120> everywhere

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
fingers everywhere

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.440 
fingers everywhere
so<00:00:39.440> I'm<00:00:40.440> guessing<00:00:41.239> see<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> timing<00:00:42.750> cover<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
so I'm guessing see the timing cover and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.340 
so I'm guessing see the timing cover and
seal<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:45.840> crank<00:00:46.559> seal<00:00:47.280> crankshaft<00:00:48.090> seal<00:00:48.360> at

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
seal or crank seal crankshaft seal at

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.869 
seal or crank seal crankshaft seal at
the<00:00:49.379> pulley<00:00:49.980> end<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.899> I<00:00:52.460> did<00:00:53.460> remove<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the pulley end and I did remove the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
the pulley end and I did remove the
rocket<00:00:54.210> cover<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.539> few<00:00:54.719> days<00:00:54.930> ago<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.500> there's

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
rocket cover a few days ago but there's

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040 
rocket cover a few days ago but there's
no<00:00:55.920> visible<00:00:56.340> oil<00:00:56.520> leaking<00:00:56.940> from<00:00:57.090> around<00:00:57.840> there

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
no visible oil leaking from around there

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.000 
no visible oil leaking from around there
or<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.379> no<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.520> need<00:00:59.699> them<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.270> dispense

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
or not no we need them out the dispense

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.410 
or not no we need them out the dispense
billing<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.160> everywhere<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.300> was

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
billing out everywhere because I was

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.450 
billing out everywhere because I was
parked<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.780> McDonald's<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.650> noticed<00:01:05.280> just

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
parked at McDonald's and I noticed just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100 
parked at McDonald's and I noticed just
in<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.030> time<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.299> took<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> maneuver

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
in the time that took me to maneuver

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
in the time that took me to maneuver
back<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> park

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
back into the park

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.850 
back into the park
you<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.540> reverse<00:01:09.869> into<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> park<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.590> could

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you know reverse into a park you could

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.910 
you know reverse into a park you could
see<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> trail<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.549> oil<00:01:12.560> where<00:01:13.560> I'd<00:01:13.740> been

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
see a trail of oil where I'd been

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.980 
see a trail of oil where I'd been
traversing<00:01:14.340> ok<00:01:14.820> youtubers<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.509> managed<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
traversing ok youtubers so managed to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.100 
traversing ok youtubers so managed to
get<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.970> bolt<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> end<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
get the bolt out at the end of the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.630 
get the bolt out at the end of the
crankshaft<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:19.860> wasn't<00:01:20.100> very<00:01:20.220> tight

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
crankshaft which wasn't very tight

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.090 
crankshaft which wasn't very tight
actually<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.270> makes<00:01:21.420> me<00:01:21.659> wonder<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.799> anyway

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
actually it makes me wonder but anyway

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880 
actually it makes me wonder but anyway
this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.210> pulled<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.990> seal<00:01:25.590> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
this is what I pulled out of the seal in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.590 
this is what I pulled out of the seal in
the<00:01:26.040> mediate<00:01:26.430> area<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:28.770> long<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.600> stuff

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the mediate area now that long bit stuff

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
the mediate area now that long bit stuff
will<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:32.869> fooled<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.990> pulley<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.500> far<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
will be fooled the pulley as far as I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.859 
will be fooled the pulley as far as I
could<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.729> Mitsubishi<00:01:36.180> having<00:01:36.479> being<00:01:36.659> very

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
could but Mitsubishi having being very

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
could but Mitsubishi having being very
smart<00:01:37.409> pigs<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.570> up

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
smart pigs with this one you can see up

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.340 
smart pigs with this one you can see up
in<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:41.040> pulley<00:01:41.689> right<00:01:42.689> next<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
in there the pulley right next to the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
in there the pulley right next to the
rail<00:01:43.590> right<00:01:44.340> gets<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> was

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
rail right gets to that one I was

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.310 
rail right gets to that one I was
chatting<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.259> Michael<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.320> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
chatting out on the way Michael so you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.639 
chatting out on the way Michael so you
can<00:01:49.470> only<00:01:49.619> pull<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> pulley<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.270> fire

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
can only pull the pulley out that fire

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.160 
can only pull the pulley out that fire
won't<00:01:52.649> come<00:01:52.920> any<00:01:53.220> further<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.899> cannot

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
won't come any further and you cannot

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
won't come any further and you cannot
get<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.560> there's<00:01:55.799> quite<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> lot<00:01:56.310> left<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.909> I

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
get there there's quite a lot left so I

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330 
get there there's quite a lot left so I
left<00:01:57.119> axon<00:01:57.509> remove<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> engine<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.439> get<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
left axon remove the engine to get the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.520 
left axon remove the engine to get the
pulley<00:01:59.579> off<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.210> replace<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.689> seal<00:02:01.170> which<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
pulley off to replace that seal which is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.920 
pulley off to replace that seal which is
a<00:02:02.130> messy<00:02:03.060> painting<00:02:03.540> us<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.619> hope<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> seal

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
a messy painting us so hope that seal

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.510 
a messy painting us so hope that seal
hasn't<00:02:06.930> been<00:02:07.200> damaged<00:02:07.560> too<00:02:07.740> much<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.129> I

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
hasn't been damaged too much because I

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.229 
hasn't been damaged too much because I
called<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.080> much<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.730> it<00:02:11.730> was<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
called it was that much of it was on the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.550 
called it was that much of it was on the
outside<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:13.110> was<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
outside it was that

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440 
outside it was that
much<00:02:13.650> was<00:02:13.920> went<00:02:14.220> into<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> engine<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.390> I'm

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
much was went into the engine so I'm

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.380 
much was went into the engine so I'm
hoping<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.930> isn't<00:02:16.140> too<00:02:16.290> much<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:18.150> there

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
hoping there isn't too much in there

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.589 
hoping there isn't too much in there
either<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.770> know<00:02:19.980> I'd<00:02:20.340> say<00:02:20.700> that's

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
either but you know I'd say that's

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.020 
either but you know I'd say that's
probably<00:02:21.989> quite<00:02:22.290> be<00:02:22.620> rattling<00:02:23.400> around<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
probably quite be rattling around in the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.020 
probably quite be rattling around in the
sump<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:26.370> been<00:02:26.580> cooled<00:02:26.880> in

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
sump now and if that's been cooled in

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.210 
sump now and if that's been cooled in
that<00:02:27.180> much<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.739> like<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.040> wasn't

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220

there everywhere yeah and we'll try and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.580 
there everywhere yeah and we'll try and
see<00:03:24.120> whether<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.420> stops<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.019> oil<00:03:25.200> leak<00:03:25.380> but

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
see whether that stops the oil leak but

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.250 
see whether that stops the oil leak but
so<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.459> oils<00:03:26.730> gone<00:03:26.940> down<00:03:27.120> quite<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.720> fair<00:03:28.019> bit

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
so the oils gone down quite a fair bit

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.819 
so the oils gone down quite a fair bit
and<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.250> was<00:03:29.400> way<00:03:29.549> over<00:03:29.579> full<00:03:30.120> when<00:03:31.109> I<00:03:31.140> left<00:03:31.440> and

anywhere I'm weird he's leaking from

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.400 
anywhere I'm weird he's leaking from
still<00:04:27.020> instantly<00:04:27.440> around<00:04:27.680> he<00:04:29.229> likes<00:04:30.229> it's

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
still instantly around he likes it's

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.330 
still instantly around he likes it's
gotten<00:04:30.710> ugly<00:04:32.380> but<00:04:33.380> I<00:04:33.470> know<00:04:33.650> for<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.889> fact<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.250> was

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
gotten ugly but I know for a fact it was

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.589 
gotten ugly but I know for a fact it was
leaking<00:04:34.669> quite<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.910> bit<00:04:35.090> out<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.240> there<00:04:35.449> because

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
leaking quite a bit out of there because

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.600 
leaking quite a bit out of there because
you<00:04:35.810> could<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.229> stream<00:04:36.650> there<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.520> had

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
you could see the stream there it had

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.529 
you could see the stream there it had
been<00:04:37.759> streaming<00:04:38.240> out<00:04:38.620> down<00:04:39.620> here<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.330> down

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
been streaming out down here so the down

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.170 
been streaming out down here so the down
the<00:04:41.660> side<00:04:41.870> of<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.229> casing<00:04:42.729> there<00:04:43.729> anyway

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
the side of the casing there anyway

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.689 
the side of the casing there anyway
I<00:04:44.210> nipped<00:04:44.930> up<00:04:45.110> all<00:04:45.289> these<00:04:45.470> bolts<00:04:45.770> no<00:04:46.639> you

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
I nipped up all these bolts no you

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.570 
I nipped up all these bolts no you
shouldn't<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:48.710> shouldn't<00:04:49.070> sort<00:04:49.400> of

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
shouldn't and you shouldn't sort of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.110 
shouldn't and you shouldn't sort of
touch<00:04:49.970> them<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:51.770> theory<00:04:52.340> once<00:04:52.669> they're<00:04:52.940> done

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
touch them in theory once they're done

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.749 
touch them in theory once they're done
up<00:04:53.330> because<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:53.870> wind<00:04:54.050> up<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:54.979> if<00:04:55.490> you've<00:04:55.639> got

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
up because you wind up and if you've got

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.939 
up because you wind up and if you've got
tight<00:04:56.060> ones<00:04:56.300> on<00:04:56.570> one<00:04:56.720> ended<00:04:57.139> and<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.740> rest

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
tight ones on one ended and the rest

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.770 
tight ones on one ended and the rest
will<00:04:58.160> loose<00:04:58.400> then<00:04:58.669> you<00:04:58.759> wind<00:04:58.940> up<00:04:59.090> either

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
will loose then you wind up either

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.540 
will loose then you wind up either
bending<00:05:00.380> there<00:05:02.470> chasing<00:05:03.470> little<00:05:04.039> splitting

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
bending there chasing little splitting

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.140 
bending there chasing little splitting
it<00:05:04.639> at<00:05:04.759> all

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
it at all

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.120 
it at all
you'll<00:05:05.539> have<00:05:05.720> uneven<00:05:06.169> pressure<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:06.949> won't

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
you'll have uneven pressure and it won't

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.520 
you'll have uneven pressure and it won't
seal<00:05:07.460> properly<00:05:07.789> blow<00:05:08.180> over<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:09.229> they<00:05:09.349> were

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
seal properly blow over but they were

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.219 
seal properly blow over but they were
just<00:05:09.740> nip<00:05:09.979> them<00:05:10.099> up<00:05:10.280> just<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.610> make<00:05:10.699> sure<00:05:11.229> so

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
just nip them up just to make sure so

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.469 
just nip them up just to make sure so
yeah<00:05:12.470> there's<00:05:12.949> a<00:05:13.070> con<00:05:13.280> it's<00:05:13.430> like<00:05:13.639> you<00:05:13.910> take

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
yeah there's a con it's like you take

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:21.790 
yeah there's a con it's like you take
and<00:05:14.660> I<00:05:14.930> suppose<00:05:15.729> somebody's<00:05:19.930> happens<00:05:20.930> with

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
and I suppose somebody's happens with

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.839 
and I suppose somebody's happens with
the<00:05:21.979> old<00:05:22.159> bitch<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:24.530> know<00:05:24.680> I<00:05:24.710> might<00:05:24.949> old<00:05:25.190> might

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
the old bitch you know I might old might

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.450 
the old bitch you know I might old might
be<00:05:25.970> leaking<00:05:26.180> from<00:05:26.539> somewhere<00:05:26.960> else<00:05:26.990> oh<00:05:28.360> no<00:05:29.360> way

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460

be leaking from somewhere else oh no way
no<00:05:31.479> leaks<00:05:32.479> from<00:05:32.599> the<00:05:32.720> end<00:05:32.900> of<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:33.020> seal<00:05:34.090> it's

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
no leaks from the end of that seal it's

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.850 
no leaks from the end of that seal it's
probably<00:05:35.419> still<00:05:35.659> raised<00:05:35.900> you<00:05:36.110> all<00:05:36.169> down<00:05:36.680> in

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
definitely lost a bit of oil that we

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
just jacked up on the angle there's

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.960 
just jacked up on the angle there's
still<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:47.120> lot<00:05:48.020> of<00:05:48.050> all<00:05:48.259> I'm<00:05:48.380> missing<00:05:48.560> so<00:05:49.490> anyway
