choosing a keyboard tray is the

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.770 
choosing a keyboard tray is the
available<00:00:39.280> debts<00:00:39.609> you<00:00:39.879> have<00:00:40.149> on<00:00:40.390> your<00:00:40.510> desk

available debts you have on your desk

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.200 
available debts you have on your desk
for<00:00:40.960> mounting<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.679> track<00:00:41.949> you'll<00:00:42.879> need<00:00:43.089> to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
for mounting the track you'll need to

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.599 
for mounting the track you'll need to
have<00:00:43.390> at<00:00:43.659> least<00:00:43.719> 11<00:00:44.710> inches<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.309> mount<00:00:45.489> the

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
have at least 11 inches to mount the

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.579 
have at least 11 inches to mount the
track<00:00:45.850> because<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.390> shortest<00:00:46.809> track<00:00:47.140> that<00:00:47.469> we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
track because the shortest track that we

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.880 
track because the shortest track that we
carry<00:00:47.859> is<00:00:48.010> 11<00:00:48.339> inches<00:00:48.749> and<00:00:49.749> the<00:00:49.899> track<00:00:50.230> mounts

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
carry is 11 inches and the track mounts

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.319 
carry is 11 inches and the track mounts
to<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.039> underneath<00:00:51.399> of<00:00:51.519> the<00:00:51.579> desk<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.089> that

to the underneath of the desk and that

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.209 
to the underneath of the desk and that
is<00:00:52.600> what<00:00:52.749> allows<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.289> mechanism<00:00:53.769> to<00:00:53.920> slide

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
is what allows the mechanism to slide

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.360 
is what allows the mechanism to slide
back<00:00:54.399> and<00:00:54.460> forth<00:00:54.699> if<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:56.019> only<00:00:56.559> have<00:00:57.010> 11

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
back and forth if you only have 11

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.430 
back and forth if you only have 11
inches<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:58.300> can<00:00:58.329> still<00:00:58.960> use<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.170> longer

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
inches you can still use a longer

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.169 
inches you can still use a longer
mechanism<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.129> just<00:01:00.339> may<00:01:00.579> not<00:01:00.729> be<00:01:00.879> able<00:01:00.940> to

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
mechanism you just may not be able to

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.599 
mechanism you just may not be able to
stow<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.449> all<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.749> way<00:01:01.839> underneath<00:01:02.139> so<00:01:03.129> that's

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
stow it all the way underneath so that's

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.219 
stow it all the way underneath so that's
the<00:01:03.729> first<00:01:03.940> consideration<00:01:04.629> do<00:01:04.870> you<00:01:04.960> have<00:01:05.110> at

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
the first consideration do you have at

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.760 
the first consideration do you have at
least<00:01:05.350> 11<00:01:05.770> inches<00:01:06.070> for<00:01:06.549> mounting<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.939> track

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
least 11 inches for mounting the track

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.990 
least 11 inches for mounting the track
the<00:01:08.770> next<00:01:09.040> thing<00:01:09.130> you'll<00:01:09.280> want<00:01:09.369> to<00:01:09.579> consider

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
the next thing you'll want to consider

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.940 
the next thing you'll want to consider
when<00:01:10.270> choosing<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.960> right<00:01:11.140> keyboard<00:01:11.439> tray

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
can also get an above desk mechanism

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.270 
can also get an above desk mechanism
which<00:02:22.570> will<00:02:22.780> adjust<00:02:22.990> much<00:02:23.260> higher<00:02:23.590> above<00:02:24.130> the

usually<00:02:32.380> an<00:02:32.590> above<00:02:32.860> desk<00:02:33.070> mechanism<00:02:33.820> will

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
usually an above desk mechanism will

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.240 
usually an above desk mechanism will
have<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.120> longer<00:02:34.540> arm<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.860> you'll<00:02:36.040> need<00:02:36.220> a
