which<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.850> need<00:01:05.939> 115<00:01:06.689> combat<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.710> and

which you need 115 combat to be in and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.390 
which you need 115 combat to be in and
but<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.470> best<00:01:10.619> place<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.310> my

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
but it is the best place to do it in my

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
but it is the best place to do it in my
opinion<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:12.030> even<00:01:12.869> though<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> can't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
opinion because even though you can't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
opinion because even though you can't
canon<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.159> close<00:01:14.430> enough<00:01:14.460> together<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
canon they are close enough together to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
canon they are close enough together to
make<00:01:15.869> them<00:01:16.049> pretty<00:01:16.259> fast<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> rapier

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
make them pretty fast and with a rapier

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.810 
make them pretty fast and with a rapier
and<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:19.080> good<00:01:19.229> melee<00:01:19.650> gear<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.070> almost<00:01:20.640> as

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and really good melee gear is almost as

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.719 
and really good melee gear is almost as
fast<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.360> cannoning<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:23.310> places

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
fast as cannoning at the other places

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.530 
fast as cannoning at the other places
anyway<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.280> fast<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.299> i

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
anyway and if not as fast so i

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.649 
anyway and if not as fast so i
definitely<00:01:28.140> recommend<00:01:28.920> coming<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
definitely recommend coming here the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
definitely recommend coming here the
frozen<00:01:31.530> fortress<00:01:32.009> which<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:34.110> i<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
frozen fortress which is and i think you

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
frozen fortress which is and i think you
go<00:01:36.390> through<00:01:36.659> during<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> temple<00:01:37.619> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
go through during the temple of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.580 
go through during the temple of
cenastone<00:01:38.460> quest<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> best<00:01:40.350> place

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
cenastone quest that is the best place

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
cenastone quest that is the best place
to<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> cannon<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.329> are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
to do it with a cannon because they are

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.030 
to do it with a cannon because they are
slightly<00:01:42.689> closer<00:01:42.990> together<00:01:43.110> than<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
slightly closer together than in the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
slightly closer together than in the
resource<00:01:44.460> dungeon<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.420> obviously

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
resource dungeon but you can obviously

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.469 
resource dungeon but you can obviously
do<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> resource<00:01:46.470> dungeon<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.460> well<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.420> i

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
do it the resource dungeon as well but i

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.179 
do it the resource dungeon as well but i
definitely<00:01:48.689> recommend<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.439> canon<00:01:49.829> inc<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
definitely recommend not canon inc and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.149 
definitely recommend not canon inc and
just<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.090> i<00:01:52.049> personally<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> save

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
money i don't know what kind of

financial situation nobody else is in

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.020 
financial situation nobody else is in
but<00:01:57.990> that's<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.530> personal<00:01:59.189> you<00:02:00.000> know

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
but that's my personal you know

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.280 
but that's my personal you know
preference<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:02.280> definitely<00:02:03.270> recommend<00:02:03.780> just

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
preference so definitely recommend just

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.550 
preference so definitely recommend just
coming<00:02:04.799> here<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.280> them<00:02:05.430> other<00:02:06.360> things<00:02:06.659> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
coming here to do them other things you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
coming here to do them other things you
can<00:02:07.799> mage<00:02:08.220> them<00:02:08.610> maging<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.390> storm<00:02:09.660> of

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
can mage them maging with storm of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
can mage them maging with storm of
Armadyl<00:02:09.929> or<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:11.039> don't<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:11.670> about<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
Armadyl or I don't really know about the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.330 
Armadyl or I don't really know about the
polypore<00:02:12.330> staff<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.810> much

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
polypore staff that much

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.630 
polypore staff that much
tried<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.790> out<00:02:13.879> but<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.170> presume<00:02:16.040> they're<00:02:16.400> both

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
tried it out but I presume they're both

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.509 
tried it out but I presume they're both
even<00:02:17.300> faster<00:02:17.870> than<00:02:17.989> melee<00:02:18.290> or<00:02:18.470> almost<00:02:19.099> as<00:02:19.310> fast

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
even faster than melee or almost as fast

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.030 
even faster than melee or almost as fast
I'm<00:02:19.730> not<00:02:19.879> completely<00:02:20.150> sure<00:02:20.300> but<00:02:20.720> as<00:02:21.440> I've<00:02:21.800> said

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
I'm not completely sure but as I've said

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.979 
I'm not completely sure but as I've said
many<00:02:22.099> times<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:23.000> personally<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.540> prefer<00:02:23.959> to

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
many times I personally just prefer to

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.100 
many times I personally just prefer to
mail<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.379> pretty<00:02:24.680> much<00:02:24.830> every<00:02:25.069> task<00:02:25.310> so

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
mail a pretty much every task so

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.830 
mail a pretty much every task so
definitely<00:02:27.640> do<00:02:28.640> what<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:28.910> want<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:29.720> a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
definitely do what you want but it's a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.490 
definitely do what you want but it's a
lot<00:02:29.930> cheaper<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.650> kill<00:02:31.549> it<00:02:31.670> with<00:02:31.790> melee<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
lot cheaper to kill it with melee and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.320 
lot cheaper to kill it with melee and
presuming<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.769> don't<00:02:34.640> have<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.150> best

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
presuming that you don't have the best

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.500 
presuming that you don't have the best
gear<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.069> then<00:02:37.069> melee<00:02:37.790> might<00:02:37.970> be<00:02:38.120> faster<00:02:38.480> than

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
gear and then melee might be faster than

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.900 
gear and then melee might be faster than
mage<00:02:38.750> anyway<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.379> terms<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.310> people<00:02:40.700> that

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
mage anyway in terms of the people that

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.630 
mage anyway in terms of the people that
say<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.480> some<00:02:42.379> of<00:02:42.530> storm<00:02:43.069> of<00:02:43.190> Armadyl<00:02:43.310> is

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
say and some of storm of Armadyl is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.880 
say and some of storm of Armadyl is
faster<00:02:44.120> they're<00:02:44.480> using<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.140> know<00:02:45.170> all<00:02:45.829> of

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
faster they're using you know all of

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.660 
faster they're using you know all of
these<00:02:46.160> things<00:02:46.400> like<00:02:46.730> all<00:02:46.970> gooey<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:48.670> don't

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
these things like all gooey and I don't

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.270 
these things like all gooey and I don't
know<00:02:49.760> its<00:02:50.180> vertices<00:02:50.780> cetera<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:51.620> obviously

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
know its vertices cetera so obviously

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.770 
know its vertices cetera so obviously
it's<00:02:52.519> going<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.730> be<00:02:52.819> faster<00:02:53.180> for<00:02:53.209> lamo<00:02:53.510> don't

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
it's going to be faster for lamo don't

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.330 
it's going to be faster for lamo don't
know<00:02:53.930> how<00:02:54.110> much<00:02:54.260> faster<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.680> would<00:02:54.860> be<00:02:55.040> if<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
know how much faster it would be if you

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.000 
know how much faster it would be if you
were<00:02:55.519> using<00:02:55.819> arms<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.690> be<00:02:56.780> honest<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:57.650> just

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
were using arms to be honest so just

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.300 
were using arms to be honest so just
melee<00:02:58.489> if<00:02:58.819> you<00:02:58.940> have<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> rapier<00:02:59.769> spec<00:03:00.769> WEP<00:03:01.040> I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
melee if you have a rapier spec WEP I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.550 
melee if you have a rapier spec WEP I
have<00:03:01.579> claws<00:03:01.910> with<00:03:02.150> me<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:03.049> doesn't<00:03:03.440> really

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
have claws with me and it doesn't really

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.080 
have claws with me and it doesn't really
make<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.799> difference<00:03:04.099> they<00:03:04.730> aren't

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
make a difference they aren't

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.039 
make a difference they aren't
particularly<00:03:05.799> strong<00:03:06.799> against<00:03:07.519> crises<00:03:08.209> but<00:03:08.989> I

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
particularly strong against crises but I

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.890 
particularly strong against crises but I
can't<00:03:09.410> bother<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.950> go<00:03:10.099> get<00:03:10.400> one<00:03:10.670> because<00:03:11.629> I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
can't bother to go get one because I

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.890 
can't bother to go get one because I
think<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.440> died<00:03:12.680> with<00:03:12.920> mine<00:03:13.129> and<00:03:13.629> but<00:03:14.629> you<00:03:14.750> have

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900

think I died with mine and but you have
if<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.980> have<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> grassy<00:03:16.760> then<00:03:16.970> maybe<00:03:17.420> bring<00:03:17.780> it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
if you have a grassy then maybe bring it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.539 
if you have a grassy then maybe bring it
along<00:03:18.139> give<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.470> really<00:03:18.799> care<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.220> just<00:03:19.430> bring

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549

along give you really care I just bring
my<00:03:19.670> claws<00:03:19.940> along<00:03:20.269> anyway<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.410> mean<00:03:21.739> it's<00:03:22.040> just

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
my claws along anyway I mean it's just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.379 
my claws along anyway I mean it's just
force<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.819> habit<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.950> specs<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:26.000> didn't

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
force of habit so the specs I didn't

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.539 
force of habit so the specs I didn't
find<00:03:26.510> specials<00:03:27.079> that<00:03:27.230> important<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.950> know<00:03:28.340> some

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
find specials that important I know some

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.059 
find specials that important I know some
people<00:03:28.849> like<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.060> do<00:03:29.450> spec<00:03:30.049> recovery<00:03:30.650> slang

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
people like to do spec recovery slang

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.430 
people like to do spec recovery slang
but<00:03:31.340> that's<00:03:31.549> just<00:03:31.730> very<00:03:31.989> expensive<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.139> I

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
but that's just very expensive and I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.960 
but that's just very expensive and I
wouldn't<00:03:33.859> personally<00:03:34.220> be<00:03:34.489> able<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.760> do<00:03:34.849> that

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
wouldn't personally be able to do that

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.330 
wouldn't personally be able to do that
for<00:03:35.120> very<00:03:35.180> long<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.959> don't<00:03:36.769> have<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.220> many

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
for very long so I don't have that many

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.210

already<00:03:48.410> explained<00:03:48.829> before<00:03:49.010> hand<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.760> won't

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
already explained before hand I won't

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.080 
already explained before hand I won't
use<00:03:50.299> overloads<00:03:50.720> just<00:03:51.079> to<00:03:51.519> demonstrate<00:03:52.519> and

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
use overloads just to demonstrate and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.900 
use overloads just to demonstrate and
demonstrate<00:03:53.660> here<00:03:54.650> super<00:03:55.040> ranch<00:03:55.190> fires<00:03:55.519> are

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
demonstrate here super ranch fires are

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.030 
demonstrate here super ranch fires are
very<00:03:56.209> very<00:03:56.569> useful<00:03:56.840> because<00:03:57.500> obviously<00:03:57.799> we

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
very very useful because obviously we

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.300 
very very useful because obviously we
won't<00:03:58.190> need<00:03:58.400> a<00:03:58.639> dragon<00:03:59.419> fire<00:03:59.810> /<00:04:00.260> anti<00:04:00.919> dragon

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
won't need a dragon fire / anti dragon

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.659 
won't need a dragon fire / anti dragon
shield<00:04:01.609> and<00:04:02.139> so<00:04:03.139> the<00:04:03.769> defender<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.280> much

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
shield and so the defender is much

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.770 
shield and so the defender is much
better<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.299> terms<00:04:05.450> of<00:04:05.630> bonuses<00:04:06.349> then<00:04:07.780> either

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
better in terms of bonuses then either

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.069 
better in terms of bonuses then either
really<00:04:09.349> I<00:04:09.650> mean<00:04:10.280> if<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:10.639> have<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> DFS<00:04:11.389> then<00:04:11.840> and

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
really I mean if you have a DFS then and

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.559 
really I mean if you have a DFS then and
not<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:13.010> herb<00:04:13.190> low<00:04:13.340> level<00:04:13.730> then<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.419> might

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
not the herb low level then that might

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.089 
not the herb low level then that might
be<00:04:14.750> okay<00:04:15.049> but<00:04:15.079> I<00:04:15.319> still<00:04:15.380> wouldn't<00:04:15.709> recommend

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
be okay but I still wouldn't recommend

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.729 
be okay but I still wouldn't recommend
having<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.489> DFS<00:04:16.970> all<00:04:17.269> just<00:04:18.109> go<00:04:18.260> get<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.470> herb

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
having a DFS all just go get the herb

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.759 
having a DFS all just go get the herb
all<00:04:18.950> level<00:04:19.280> and<00:04:19.539> for<00:04:20.539> super<00:04:21.289> auntie<00:04:21.530> fires

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
all level and for super auntie fires

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.040 
all level and for super auntie fires
because<00:04:22.039> they're<00:04:22.310> very<00:04:22.520> useful<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.659> can<00:04:23.690> burn

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
because they're very useful you can burn

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.630 
because they're very useful you can burn
crush<00:04:24.320> these<00:04:24.500> but<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.830> prefer<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.280> bang<00:04:25.490> the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
enjoyed the guide I know it was pretty

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.070 
enjoyed the guide I know it was pretty
brief<00:05:11.330> but<00:05:11.750> as<00:05:12.440> set<00:05:13.100> for<00:05:13.310> this<00:05:13.520> place<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.389> um

brim<00:05:15.950> Haven<00:05:16.370> there<00:05:16.850> isn't<00:05:17.120> really<00:05:17.180> anywhere

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
brim Haven there isn't really anywhere

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.390 
brim Haven there isn't really anywhere
else<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.870> do<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.110> for<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.590> frozen<00:05:18.950> fortress

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
else to do it for the frozen fortress

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.219 
else to do it for the frozen fortress
which<00:05:19.580> already<00:05:19.760> mentioned<00:05:20.300> so<00:05:20.870> obviously<00:05:21.110> if

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
which already mentioned so obviously if

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.900 
which already mentioned so obviously if
you<00:05:21.320> don't<00:05:21.500> have<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.800> combat<00:05:22.130> level<00:05:22.250> just<00:05:22.790> go

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
you don't have the combat level just go

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.020 
you don't have the combat level just go
to<00:05:22.940> Bremerhaven<00:05:23.479> dungeon<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.139> kill<00:05:24.320> them<00:05:24.470> and

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
to Bremerhaven dungeon and kill them and

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.430 
to Bremerhaven dungeon and kill them and
it's<00:05:26.030> not<00:05:26.210> particularly<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.780> location<00:05:27.410> that

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
it's not particularly the location that

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.630 
it's not particularly the location that
matters<00:05:28.040> it's<00:05:28.340> more<00:05:28.669> to<00:05:29.030> do<00:05:29.180> with<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.660> and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
matters it's more to do with the and

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.550 
matters it's more to do with the and
where<00:05:31.640> you<00:05:31.789> kill<00:05:32.030> them<00:05:32.210> that<00:05:32.419> speeds<00:05:33.169> it<00:05:33.260> up<00:05:33.380> I

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
where you kill them that speeds it up I

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.469 
where you kill them that speeds it up I
guess<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:33.919> mean<00:05:34.070> obviously<00:05:34.669> kordell's<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:35.300> much

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
guess I mean obviously kordell's is much

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.510 
guess I mean obviously kordell's is much
better<00:05:35.720> in<00:05:35.870> terms<00:05:36.050> of<00:05:36.260> where<00:05:36.500> they<00:05:36.650> are<00:05:36.800> spaced

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
better in terms of where they are spaced

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.270 
better in terms of where they are spaced
together<00:05:38.020> but<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.470> know<00:05:39.590> if<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.800> can't<00:05:40.100> go<00:05:40.220> to

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
together but you know if you can't go to

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.130 
together but you know if you can't go to
kordell's<00:05:40.760> then<00:05:40.970> there's<00:05:41.150> not<00:05:41.300> many<00:05:41.450> many

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
kordell's then there's not many many

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.590 
kordell's then there's not many many
other<00:05:42.410> options<00:05:42.620> for<00:05:43.100> you<00:05:43.190> so<00:05:43.970> thanks<00:05:44.450> for
