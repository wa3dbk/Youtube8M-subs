00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you driven out to your hands I guess I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.819 
you driven out to your hands I guess I
like<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.110> part<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> effect<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> little

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
like that part of the effect a little

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.690 
like that part of the effect a little
bit<00:01:31.920> better<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.400> could<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.670> for

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bit better because you could go for

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
bit better because you could go for
shuttle<00:01:33.060> fusion<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.689> other<00:01:34.049> things<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.590> yeah

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
shuttle fusion and other things but yeah

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
shuttle fusion and other things but yeah
other<00:01:35.579> than<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.900> don't<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.170> this

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
fusion once per turn this cart is pretty

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.950 
fusion once per turn this cart is pretty
interesting<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.060> an<00:02:06.210> equip<00:02:06.509> card<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
interesting it's like an equip card that

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
interesting it's like an equip card that
helps<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.320> fuse<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> first

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
helps you fuse I think that's the first

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
helps you fuse I think that's the first
time<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.940> ever<00:02:08.970> had<00:02:09.239> card<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.989> first

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
time we ever had card like that first

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.540 
time we ever had card like that first
time<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.649> saw<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.160> why<00:02:11.340> are<00:02:11.430> they

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
time I saw I was like why are they

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.940 
time I saw I was like why are they
getting<00:02:11.670> an<00:02:11.940> equip<00:02:12.239> card<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
getting an equip card but it

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
getting an equip card but it
actually<00:02:13.129> kind<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.340> makes<00:02:13.520> sense<00:02:13.730> now

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
actually kind of makes sense now

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.490 
actually kind of makes sense now
whenever<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.390> read<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:15.020> effect<00:02:15.349> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
everything of this card it helps change

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.449 
everything of this card it helps change

hand and then go for a fusion because it
says<00:02:44.299> yeah<00:02:44.540> from<00:02:44.900> your<00:02:45.110> side<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.709> field<00:02:45.860> in

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
says yeah from your side of the field in

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.680 
says yeah from your side of the field in
hand<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.000> just<00:02:47.150> says<00:02:47.299> the<00:02:47.330> equipped

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
hand but it just says the equipped

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.860 
hand but it just says the equipped
monster<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.580> think<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.120> would<00:02:50.390> work<00:02:50.420> i'm

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
monster so I think that would work i'm

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.270 
monster so I think that would work i'm
not<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.049> person<00:02:51.319> sure<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.620> don't<00:02:51.950> quote<00:02:52.099> me

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
not a person sure on that don't quote me

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.280 
not a person sure on that don't quote me
on<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.489> i<00:02:52.700> think<00:02:53.150> that's<00:02:53.630> possible<00:02:53.840> though

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
on that i think that's possible though

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.630 
on that i think that's possible though
so<00:02:54.709> that<00:02:54.860> makes<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.130> card<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.370> lot<00:02:55.489> better

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
so that makes this card a lot better

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.130 
so that makes this card a lot better
though<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.209> if<00:02:56.390> that's<00:02:56.510> how<00:02:56.690> i<00:02:56.720> can<00:02:56.900> work<00:02:56.959> you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
though that if that's how i can work you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.300 
though that if that's how i can work you
just<00:02:57.170> take<00:02:57.410> one<00:02:57.560> your<00:02:57.650> opponent's<00:02:57.950> monsters

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
just take one your opponent's monsters

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.009 
just take one your opponent's monsters
declare<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.269> whatever<00:02:59.510> attribute<00:02:59.930> you

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
declare it as whatever attribute you

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.569 
declare it as whatever attribute you
want<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.709> then<00:03:00.980> go<00:03:01.069> for<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.310> fusion

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
want for that and then go for the fusion

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.940 
want for that and then go for the fusion
sounds<00:03:02.120> pretty<00:03:02.299> cool<00:03:02.480> down<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.989> seems<00:03:03.890> like

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
sounds pretty cool down that seems like

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.289 
sounds pretty cool down that seems like
a<00:03:04.040> really<00:03:04.250> good<00:03:04.519> card<00:03:04.760> for<00:03:04.970> them<00:03:05.060> another

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
a really good card for them another

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.569 
a really good card for them another
fusion<00:03:05.720> card<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:06.079> course<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.709> one<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.370> if<00:03:07.489> it

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
fusion card of course and one that if it

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.550 
fusion card of course and one that if it
works<00:03:07.760> like<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:08.060> said<00:03:08.329> on<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.290> can

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
works like I said on that then that can

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.500 
works like I said on that then that can
make<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.829> a<00:03:09.890> lot<00:03:10.040> scarier<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.269> what<00:03:11.390> do<00:03:11.450> you
