fat

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.400 
fat
the<00:01:44.700> only<00:01:44.880> difference<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.690> it's<00:01:46.260> a

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
the only difference is it's it's a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.650 
the only difference is it's it's a
smaller<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.010> small<00:01:47.460> procedure<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.510> is<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
smaller to small procedure so there is a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.450 
smaller to small procedure so there is a
little<00:01:48.930> bit<00:01:49.080> of<00:01:49.200> swelling<00:01:49.470> there<00:01:50.190> may<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.340> a

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
little bit of swelling there may be a

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.820 
little bit of swelling there may be a
few<00:01:50.730> days<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:51.120> downtime<00:01:51.350> there<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
few days of downtime there as with the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.950 
few days of downtime there as with the
fillers<00:01:53.190> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.060> come<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.480> injected

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
fillers you can come and get injected

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.530 
fillers you can come and get injected
and<00:01:55.080> girl<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:56.400> doesn't<00:01:56.850> mean<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.270> wants

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and girl it doesn't mean that we wants

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.390 
and girl it doesn't mean that we wants
to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.750> will<00:01:57.930> stop<00:01:58.200> doing<00:01:58.470> fillers<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.100> think

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
to be will stop doing fillers I think

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.490 
to be will stop doing fillers I think
fillers<00:01:59.760> are<00:01:59.970> good<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.720> small<00:02:00.780> areas

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
fillers are good for really small areas

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.700 
fillers are good for really small areas
little<00:02:02.010> touch-up<00:02:02.430> little<00:02:02.820> changes<00:02:03.660> but<00:02:04.440> fat

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
little touch-up little changes but fat

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.130

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.320 
face a good percentage of it will last
for<00:02:14.610> many<00:02:14.640> many<00:02:14.850> years

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
for many many years

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.860 
for many many years
not<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.740> put<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.160> right<00:02:17.340> away

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
not all of it that you put in right away

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.150 
not all of it that you put in right away
so<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> always<00:02:19.080> tell<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> patients<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:19.980> know

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
so I always tell the patients you know

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.980 
so I always tell the patients you know
in<00:02:20.610> two<00:02:20.820> or<00:02:20.910> three<00:02:21.090> months<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.420> might<00:02:21.570> see<00:02:21.810> in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
in two or three months you might see in

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.220 
in two or three months you might see in
a<00:02:22.110> settle<00:02:22.500> down<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.540> account<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:25.110> that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
a settle down and so I account for that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.290 
a settle down and so I account for that
I<00:02:25.410> try<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.740> adjust<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.700> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
I try to adjust for that and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.850 
I try to adjust for that and
occasionally<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.110> know<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> year<00:02:28.500> later<00:02:28.740> or

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
occasionally you know a year later or

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.960 
occasionally you know a year later or
two<00:02:29.070> year<00:02:29.220> later<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.610> may<00:02:29.730> do<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.910> little

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
two year later we may do a little

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.050 
two year later we may do a little
touch-up<00:02:30.470> little<00:02:31.470> maintenance<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
touch-up little maintenance but it's a

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.290 
touch-up little maintenance but it's a
very<00:02:33.270> simple

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.840 

it's<00:02:40.050> being<00:02:40.350> tried<00:02:40.830> for<00:02:40.860> breast<00:02:41.310> implants<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
it's being tried for breast implants and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.750 
it's being tried for breast implants and
I<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.240> probably<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.870> very<00:02:43.050> near<00:02:43.530> future

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
I think probably in the very near future

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.210 
I think probably in the very near future
more<00:02:44.760> surgeons<00:02:45.240> will<00:02:45.600> use<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.260> don't<00:02:46.770> use<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
more surgeons will use it I don't use it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.190 
more surgeons will use it I don't use it
for<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.640> breast<00:02:47.850> augmentation<00:02:48.540> yet<00:02:48.780> because

for the breast augmentation yet because

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.890 
for the breast augmentation yet because
I'm<00:02:49.350> waiting<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:50.040> hear<00:02:50.220> from<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:51.270> oncologist

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
I'm waiting to hear from the oncologist

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.930 
I'm waiting to hear from the oncologist
to<00:02:52.470> make<00:02:52.650> sure<00:02:52.800> that<00:02:52.980> there<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.250> no<00:02:53.430> problem

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
to make sure that there is no problem

to make sure that there is no problem
with<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.330> breast<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:55.550> have<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:56.730> diagnose

with the breast you have to diagnose
breast<00:02:57.360> cancer<00:02:57.510> we<00:02:58.500> don't<00:02:58.680> want<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.860> put

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
breast cancer we don't want to put

breast cancer we don't want to put
something<00:02:59.040> there<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.580> may<00:02:59.970> interfere<00:03:00.810> with

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
something there that may interfere with

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.380 
something there that may interfere with
the<00:03:01.350> diagnosis<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:02.370> people<00:03:02.670> are<00:03:02.760> studying<00:03:03.030> it

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
the diagnosis but people are studying it

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.600 
the diagnosis but people are studying it
and<00:03:03.540> some<00:03:04.020> people<00:03:04.260> are<00:03:04.350> trying<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.830> so<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.280> like

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
and some people are trying it so I like

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.399 
and some people are trying it so I like
to<00:03:05.640> wait<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.090> see
