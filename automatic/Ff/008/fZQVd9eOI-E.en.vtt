00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.060
 hello friends and welcome once again to 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.060
 one of the singer's tutorials 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.610
 hello very good guys today I bring you a 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.800
 hats tutorial you know what it does 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.470
 a lot that did not bring one but this is 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 quite simple to say of a 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.600
 way then let's get with him 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.129
 it's a very basic trick and we could 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.960
 treat it as a primary manipulation 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.210
 first of all you start with the hat 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.790
 in the head the right hand or the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.670
 left depending on how the bea is 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.140
 more comfortable if you are right-handed or left-handed 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.350
 grab the hat this way by 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.350
 here 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.579
 and we have to remove it worth once 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.100
 we have this step the following is a 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.859
 Wrist twist 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.859
 a turn to be able to do so 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.440
 put it back in the head all 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.740
 together it would be 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.510
 so you start with your hand here 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.500
 remove the hat tour is the doll 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.280
 you know how 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.280
 and olÃ© 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.950
 I do not know if it's appreciated you see how I'm going 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.200
 turning the wrist or start like this 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 I would turn I have here and here it is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.740
 where positioned the hat brings this 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.729
 trick is very good once you 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.729
 you have done 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.219
 making a turn because when making the turn 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.759
 of the hat depending on what I do 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:55.659
 in the same sense that the turnaround 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.859
 could do 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.859
 in a different sense 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.040
 so that it stays 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.110
 as one turn towards another and the other towards 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.759
 another I prefer to do it all in the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.700
 same sense because it is much more to me 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.550
 simple 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.190
 and it's investing to the other side I finish 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.980
 moving to a place then no no 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.930
 I like it a lot 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.489
 but basically that's what you already know 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.739
 you grab the hat this way 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.130
 you start to extend as if you were 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.530
 throw a frisbee here 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.860
 it's already when I turn and ice 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.040
 and that's it or the grip is mainly 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.040
 is 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.370
 with these dice here and the thumb over 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.510
 of the hat then when you have 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.480
 this area 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.599
 I introduce my fingers a little and 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.340
 I accompany for the twists and left let fall 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.200
 the hats to the hat right now 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.599
 is supported by these fingers and the one that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.049
 prevents it from falling is the thumb then 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.599
 it's easy to turn is an easy trick and 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.700
 nothing to see if you put with him and you 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.560
 like and I hope to upload another tutorial 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.560
 hats shortly until later
