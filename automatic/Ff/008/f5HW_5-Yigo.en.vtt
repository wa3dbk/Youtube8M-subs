00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.280
 I want to introduce you to the new procedure 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.980
 called bio skin stimulation 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.730
 we will do it by injection 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.680
 using the drug skin by 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.789
 This is an Italian drug which 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.500
 contains hyaluronic acid 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.680
 molecules that are chosen in this way 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.720
 that they are directly embedded in 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.410
 skin from mastering high molecular 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.370
 the masses are proven to be exactly certain 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.040
 length short chain hyaluronic acid 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.280
 best moisturize the skin practically 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.750
 instantly leave no noticeable traces 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.930
 after all and hillocks after injections and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.649
 as much as possible 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.210
 activates the function of skin cells 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.360
 fibroblasts which are then isolated 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.850
 own hyaluronic acid except 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.039
 hyaluronic acid in skin by 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.399
 also contained irreplaceable 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.780
 amino acids are building blocks 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.180
 for the formation of collagen and elastin 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.380
 proteins that give ours away to our 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 skin strength 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.710
 elasticity and elasticity the procedure has 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.070
 long lasting effect since directed 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.250
 to normalize the processes in the skin on 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.490
 increased production of its own molecules 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.970
 youth of hyaluronic acid and proteins 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.150
 and its features lies in the fact that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.450
 it runs at a certain point it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.390
 eliminates pain during 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.920
 recovery period procedures 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.619
 minimized 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.620
 20 minutes after the procedure is still noticeable 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.280
 tubercles and 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.370
 in general, the procedure is more easily tolerated. 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.910
 patients come to her easier again not 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.430
 afraid of some discomfort here 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.980
 plaque on the face of the neck and neckline and hands 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.130
 my patient's intended point where i'm 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:11.120
 I will enter the drug is points on 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:13.990
 neckline at each point are gone 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.020
 big enough 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.460
 papule from which is the distribution 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:28.820
 drug throughout the treated area 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:37.630
 these are points on the neckline four points and two 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.630
 points on the neck 1 2 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:49.170
 also . which covers the whole cheek 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.250
 she is in front of the tragus on the corner 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.250
 lower jaw 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.920
 corner 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.920
 there 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.510
 nasolabial fold 3 dots 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.270
 the drug from these zones of vision is widely 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.330
 distributed throughout the area 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.080
 for example the oval face due to its 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.770
 excellent diffusibility 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.670
 eye area is also treated 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.000
 only from three daughters 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:44.120
 excluding numerous punctures 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.590
 which always carries the risk of large 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.140
 traces of bruises 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.890
 but this is only possible with this drug 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.450
 because he has excellent forehead diffusion 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.489
 we process just two points 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.060
 who are in that at the base 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.030
 eyebrows 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.630
 but in them we introduce big enough 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.630
 drug volume 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.640
 another one . 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.739
 so do not forget about the hands to 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.530
 process the hands we make small 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.530
 tricholes in the interdigital spaces and 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:41.240
 good or fudy provides coverage 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:44.389
 the whole brush that's literally there for five 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:48.169
 minutes we processed the entire half of the face 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:51.740
 neck and décolleté one hand left 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.590
 another drug for the second half 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.190
 processing either we can this ampoule 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.449
 split into two procedures 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.370
 transferring the contents to a sterile syringe and 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.650
 refrigerator for storing drugs but 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.720
 then exclude any zones from 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.810
 treatments if they are not very important for 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.270
 patient for example hands and neckline 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.449
 you can exclude leaving only the face and 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.630
 neck but italians manufacturers 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.479
 still recommend to handle all 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.300
 zones in one procedure use 5 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.960
 milliliters of the drug 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.190
 courses consists of four procedures 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.639
 executable 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:37.479
 weekly and 2 more fixing 5 6 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:40.820
 which is performed every two weeks 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.960
 the drug is indicated for the youngest skin 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.389
 starting at age 25 as monotherapy 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.060
 Preventing wilting of moisture before 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:53.110
 tan recovery after stress 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.169

 biorevitalization before laser 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.889
 grinding before serious amongst
