into<00:00:08.130> your<00:00:09.800> as<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.130> see<00:00:11.370> here<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> already

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
into your as you can see here I already

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.460 
into your as you can see here I already
script<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.799> wires<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.969> basically<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:16.410> is

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
script the wires so basically this is

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.810 
script the wires so basically this is
what<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.949> looks<00:00:17.220> like<00:00:17.430> there's<00:00:18.000> three<00:00:18.240> wires

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
what it looks like there's three wires

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.259 
what it looks like there's three wires
was<00:00:20.820> attached<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.980> this<00:00:22.980> wire<00:00:23.580> right<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
was attached to this wire right here and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.750 
was attached to this wire right here and
that<00:00:25.170> wire<00:00:26.449> which<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> mini-usb<00:00:28.760> attaches

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
that wire which is the mini-usb attaches

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.040 
that wire which is the mini-usb attaches
to<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> GoPro<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.399> side<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.750> got<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to the GoPro on the side and you got the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.650 
to the GoPro on the side and you got the
power<00:00:34.260> source<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:35.270> that<00:00:36.270> we'll<00:00:36.510> be

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
power source here that we'll be

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
power source here that we'll be
attaching<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> battery<00:00:37.950> pack<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> to

eliminate the battery and the USB what

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
eliminate the battery and the USB what
you<00:00:46.440> want<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> attach

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you want to do is you want to attach

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.080 
you want to do is you want to attach
this<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.100> wires<00:00:51.320> those<00:00:52.320> three<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.489> four

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this to the wires those three one four

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.380 
this to the wires those three one four
wires<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.670> landing

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
wires that's on the side of the landing

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.830 
wires that's on the side of the landing
gear<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:59.059> soldering<00:01:00.059> those<00:01:00.420> wires

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
gear so you can be soldering those wires

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
gear so you can be soldering those wires
to<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.829> transmitter<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:04.489> you<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to this transmitter so you have to be

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.250 
to this transmitter so you have to be
careful<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> solder<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.580> especially

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
careful when you solder this especially

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.580 
careful when you solder this especially
where<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> video<00:01:11.000> output<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.590> usually

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
where the video output is usually

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.520 
where the video output is usually
sometimes<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.220> comes<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.729> three<00:01:15.060> wires<00:01:15.530> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sometimes it comes with three wires so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.539 
sometimes it comes with three wires so
make<00:01:16.799> sure<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:18.330> don't<00:01:18.540> solder<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.310> power

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
make sure you don't solder the the power

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.030 
make sure you don't solder the the power
source<00:01:21.890> into<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> wire<00:01:23.549> over<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.560> what

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
source into the wire over here so what

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.850 
source into the wire over here so what
you<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.570> solder<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.170> video<00:01:28.530> output

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you want to solder is the video output

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
you want to solder is the video output
for<00:01:29.759> mine<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.270> white<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.799> ground<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> if

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
for mine it's white and the ground so if

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.010 
for mine it's white and the ground so if
you<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.780> anything<00:01:34.020> red<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.299> video<00:01:36.720> output

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
you see anything red on the video output

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.840 
you see anything red on the video output
take<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.280> remove<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.770> okay<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.430> the

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.789 
be on the power source so we put it over
here<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:28.379> the<00:03:28.500> power<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:32.549> then<00:03:33.680> for<00:03:34.680> the
