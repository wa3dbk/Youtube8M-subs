00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.689
 Dear members of our university community 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.910
 I am very pleased to be able to address you some words 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.039
 from the first moment we have tried to face in the university this 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.289
 contingency 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.280
 doing 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 what we do best 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.320
 We have implemented a series of mechanisms through the instruments 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.590
 of distance learning 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.640
 that allow us to maintain academic work 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 in these extraordinary circumstances 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.080
 we are aware that this forced stoppage we are facing 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.270
 it should not extend to other spheres of our life 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.000
 Unlike 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.400
 an extraordinary opportunity 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.979
 to pay attention to the most relevant aspects of it 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.930
 to live with our family 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.520
 to expand our spirit 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.580
 to prepare us 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 with strength decision and prudence 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.610
 to the future that we have already committed 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.050
 with more diligence once this moment has been overcome 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.190
 I'm sure everyone's work 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.579
 the push of our 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:34.960
 teachers 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.570
 the response of our students 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 propitiate adp that we make of this critical situation 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.180
 a portu unit 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.620
 that allows us to leave 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.590
 more strengthened 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.100
 I thank all the xiol patents they have had with the university 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 I wish you 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.750
 we overcome these circumstances in the best possible way and that all find 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 and I hope to see them the next one is called like that 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.840
 thank you
