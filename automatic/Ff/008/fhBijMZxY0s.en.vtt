side of the unit there isn't a rail
bumper<00:00:55.120> system<00:00:56.019> so<00:00:56.379> you<00:00:56.440> can<00:00:56.559> mount<00:00:56.920> two

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
bumper system so you can mount two

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.939 
bumper system so you can mount two
systems<00:00:57.729> together<00:00:57.999> and<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:59.199> looks<00:00:59.499> as<00:00:59.649> if<00:00:59.679> it

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
systems together and it looks as if it

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
systems together and it looks as if it
was<00:01:00.069> one<00:01:00.100> case<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:01.649> side<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.889> just<00:01:03.100> exactly

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
was one case the side is just exactly

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.600 
was one case the side is just exactly
flat<00:01:04.809> all<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.170> way<00:01:05.320> down<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:07.210> comes<00:01:07.479> with<00:01:07.869> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
flat all the way down it comes with a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.969 
flat all the way down it comes with a
front<00:01:09.610> bumper<00:01:10.329> or<00:01:10.810> kart<00:01:12.329> bumper<00:01:13.329> and<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.740> does

opens up and out of the way one of the
unique<00:01:33.340> features<00:01:33.369> about<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.329> free<00:01:34.659> auto<00:01:34.810> case

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
unique features about the free auto case

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.029 
unique features about the free auto case
is<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:37.079> pilasters<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.710> shock

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
is that the pilasters the shock

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.819 
is that the pilasters the shock
absorbers<00:01:39.640> are<00:01:40.119> actually<00:01:40.689> contained<00:01:41.560> within

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
absorbers are actually contained within

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.720 
absorbers are actually contained within
this<00:01:42.369> side

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.690 

bar<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.750> not<00:01:47.230> out<00:01:47.560> in<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.890> open<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.520> catch

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
bar and not out in the open to catch

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.460 
bar and not out in the open to catch
dirt<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.420> those<00:01:49.690> types<00:01:49.930> of<00:01:50.020> things<00:01:50.230> I<00:01:50.410> think

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
dirt and those types of things I think

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.960 
dirt and those types of things I think
that<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.860> get<00:01:50.980> pretty<00:01:51.190> close<00:01:51.220> in<00:01:51.580> there<00:01:51.760> that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
that you get pretty close in there that

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.890 
that you get pretty close in there that
the<00:01:52.120> pylon<00:01:52.990> stirs<00:01:53.260> on<00:01:53.470> your<00:01:53.680> side<00:01:54.010> are<00:01:54.900> right

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
the pylon stirs on your side are right

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.020 
the pylon stirs on your side are right
there<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:56.920> now<00:01:56.950> we<00:01:57.130> have<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.460> open<00:01:57.790> case

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
there so now we have the open case

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.140 
there so now we have the open case
design<00:01:58.480> this<00:01:59.050> case<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.500> also<00:01:59.710> available<00:02:00.430> in<00:02:00.970> a

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
and then a shortened top glass that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.770 
and then a shortened top glass that
would<00:02:11.920> come<00:02:12.130> down<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.460> leave<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.850> wide<00:02:13.180> area<00:02:13.210> for

we<00:07:13.230> were<00:07:13.320> to<00:07:13.470> have<00:07:13.620> in<00:07:14.010> our<00:07:14.430> two<00:07:14.610> right<00:07:14.820> hand

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
we were to have in our two right hand

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.180 
we were to have in our two right hand
pans<00:07:15.330> Fried<00:07:15.900> Chicken<00:07:16.380> and<00:07:16.590> we<00:07:16.710> want<00:07:16.890> that<00:07:17.040> to

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
pans Fried Chicken and we want that to

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.550 
pans Fried Chicken and we want that to
remain<00:07:17.400> crispy<00:07:17.940> then<00:07:18.630> we<00:07:18.840> just<00:07:19.050> toggle<00:07:19.260> these

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
remain crispy then we just toggle these

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.710 
remain crispy then we just toggle these
two<00:07:19.800> on<00:07:20.010> and<00:07:20.340> the<00:07:20.700> other<00:07:20.850> three<00:07:21.120> pans<00:07:21.419> will

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
two on and the other three pans will

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.710 
two on and the other three pans will
just<00:07:22.050> have<00:07:22.290> the<00:07:22.700> convective<00:07:23.700> high<00:07:24.419> humidity

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 
just have the convective high humidity

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.920 
just have the convective high humidity
air<00:07:25.110> flow<00:07:25.410> across<00:07:25.950> them<00:07:26.340> this<00:07:27.150> is<00:07:27.450> how<00:07:27.660> free

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
air flow across them this is how free

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.530 
air flow across them this is how free
Auto<00:07:28.110> handles<00:07:28.620> individual<00:07:29.400> pan<00:07:29.790> or

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.540 
Auto handles individual pan or

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.100 
Auto handles individual pan or
individual<00:07:31.260> zone<00:07:31.680> humidity<00:07:32.550> and<00:07:32.900> it<00:07:33.900> is<00:07:34.080> a

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
individual zone humidity and it is a

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.770 
individual zone humidity and it is a
superior<00:07:34.919> and<00:07:35.280> very<00:07:35.640> simple<00:07:36.150> way<00:07:36.300> to<00:07:36.360> do<00:07:36.630> this

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 
superior and very simple way to do this

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.340 
superior and very simple way to do this
as<00:07:37.910> you<00:07:38.910> move<00:07:39.060> products<00:07:39.450> around<00:07:39.780> you<00:07:40.080> can

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.350 
as you move products around you can

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.750 
as you move products around you can
toggle<00:07:40.860> on<00:07:41.160> and<00:07:41.190> off<00:07:41.520> the<00:07:41.790> overheat<00:07:43.610> so<00:07:44.610> there

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:44.760 
toggle on and off the overheat so there

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.940 
toggle on and off the overheat so there
you<00:07:44.880> have<00:07:44.910> it<00:07:45.210> the<00:07:45.990> three<00:07:46.470> Auto<00:07:47.210> nd<00:07:48.210> series

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:48.950 
you have it the three Auto nd series

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.820 
you have it the three Auto nd series
deli<00:07:49.950> display<00:07:50.340> hot<00:07:50.490> cases
