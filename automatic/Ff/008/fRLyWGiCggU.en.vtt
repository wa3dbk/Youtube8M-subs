00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 good afternoon , we are already beginning to notice 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.960
 how do we enter the final stretch of this 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.940
 summer with this already unstable time that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 is characterized by early 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.509
 September of early autumn with 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 storms ahead of the evening however 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.740
 let's start first by talking about 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.560
 how the day of the day has begun 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060
 of today Saturday that sunrise for example to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.670
 nobody from the north in ribadesella in 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.590
 Asturias and the many roofs with a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.240
 pretty nice temperature to 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.180
 first hours also appears photo 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.090
 corresponds to that cloud 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.260
 evolution society that yesterday 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.940
 act of presence many hours the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.890
 peninsular interior leaving storms and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.960
 showers in much of the geography 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.910
 Spanish actually notice as a 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.770
 midnight we appreciate those nuclei 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.360
 convective those cloudy cores that 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.940
 as we say are responsible for 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.860
 to leave showers and storms and until 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.540
 now we begin to see how they return to 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.850
 form lightly in areas of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.379
 interior we hope that in this afternoon 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.610
 then leave again showers and 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.040
 Stormy phenomena especially 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.809
 affecting what is inside of 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.760
 Cáceres can also be punctually 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.460
 intense towards cuenca albacete 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.979
 Guadalajara even some systems 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.210
 mountainous areas of the peninsular interior 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.700
 the northwest and also in areas 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.259
 Pyrenean and face tomorrow 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.050
 we will continue talking about tomorrow 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.240
 quite solitude and again storms in 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.040
 the variable time facing the second 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.050
 half of the day for tomorrow yes it is 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.729
 true that those will intensify 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.740
 Stormy phenomena especially 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.080
 into the interior of Catalonia and he is 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.899
 leading to tarragona in good part of 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.550
 teruel zaragoza aragón in the Pyrenees 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.970
 last hours also the Cantabrian more 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.650
 oriental in nothing 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.600
 also storms that could be 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.700
 punctually somewhat more intense towards 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.530
 good part of the peninsular northwest 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.080
 also affecting what it is 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.490
 the Cantabrian coast is not expected in 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.770
 southern areas only new be 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.260
 evolution in the southeastern city of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.910
 often it has evolved especially 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.620
 towards the mountainous areas of mallorca 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.080
 menorca and with signs more 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.430
 cleared in the cannabis archipelago 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.740
 of each morning also also the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.690
 temperatures the maximums are going to descend 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.150
 only lightly in good part 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.920
 of the center and half west peninsular a 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.780
 desire is something more marked towards the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.710
 interior of galicia asturias and also 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.930
 the lion 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.610
 this afternoon the storms return 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.890
 especially the mountainous areas of the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.290
 peninsular interior and we return this 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.000
 night they spend a happy afternoon of 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.070
 storms in many points of the interior 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.040
 of the country indeed if we take a look 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.719
 to the radar 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.180
 the agency is on the clock and now 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.829
 give him rays look how until the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.500
 hydrate already counted more than 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:35.439
 1300 rays and as they define perfectly 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.900
 the Spanish geography distributed to the 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.000
 long of the central system of the Iberian 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.129
 in a good part of the Pyrenees towards the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.569
 northwest the lion mountains and as 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.239
 we say this variable time is already a 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.650
 indication that autumn is very close 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.170
 through satellite images 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.329
 we can appreciate effectively how 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.180
 As the day progressed they left 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.430
 forming those convective cores those 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.569
 clouds of evolution that were growing and 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.950
 which are responsible for leaving 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.230
 showers and storms as they can 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.760
 check spread in good part of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.379
 the national geography of each morning 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.689
 we will continue talking about that time 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.159
 Quite unstable, quieter tomorrow 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.959
 and in the afternoon of new situation with 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.209
 stormy squalls in good part the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.519
 half north of the country but let's 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.409
 analyze the situation zone by zone 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.060
 we started with galicia because from 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.799
 first hours of the day seemed 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.900
 quite covered with weak rains 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.340
 want to even be reinforced with 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.970
 afternoon storms especially 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.370
 so the inside of the community 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.860
 Galician storms that will also affect 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.930
 facing the second half of the day 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.060
 to the lion to the north of castile and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.500
 lion 'also reaching a good part of 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.720
 asturias and late in the day 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.280
 stormy showers that could be 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.770
 punctually intense and Tuesday more 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.360
 persistent towards the Rioja towards the 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.220
 peace country that even also what is 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.020
 in history areas temperatures of 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.580
 face to tomorrow by the way in these areas 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.470
 in descent a descent rather more 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.810
 marked to be noticed in area of ​​the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.730
 Galician community in the northeast of the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.290
 country in catalonia tomorrow more more 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.930
 solidarity for the afternoon we will see 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.610
 new grow some convective cloud of 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.080
 evolution that night Basques and storms 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.270
 in the area of the Pyrenees with more 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.280
 cloudiness late reaching 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.470
 barcelona is girona and also storms 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.500
 again generating itself towards the Iberian 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.900
 teruel in areas of wesco also day 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.299
 pretty rainy stormy to be what 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.030
 which is Navarre in the rest temperatures 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.340
 with just a few changes they will hardly change 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.800
 in areas of the south center of the country 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.270
 relatively calm day with 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.940

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.350
 central also to the west again be 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.480
 evolution in the mountains 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.280
 and medium and high type clouds reaching 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.230
 last hours to the west of 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.700
 extremadura also in areas of 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.380
 andalusia temperatures in these regions 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.170
 with little changes and in the Canary Islands 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.910
 we continue with situation very similar to the 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.080
 of the predominance of clear skies and 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.480
 north component winds 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.990
 pretty warm temperatures in the 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.180
 archipelago 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.800
 tomorrow afternoon we will see that 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.990
 cloudiness of evolution as in this 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.180
 photography in a good part of the interior 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.690
 of the country that passes on a happy night already
