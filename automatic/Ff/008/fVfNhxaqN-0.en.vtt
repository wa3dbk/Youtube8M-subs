00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
in this recipe I actually learned that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.560 
in this recipe I actually learned that
strawberries<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.469> not<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> fruit<00:00:44.539> they're<00:00:45.539> a

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
strawberries are not a fruit they're a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.440 
strawberries are not a fruit they're a
member<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> rose<00:00:46.320> family<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> makes

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
member of the rose family and it makes

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.479 
member of the rose family and it makes
such<00:00:48.960> good<00:00:49.230> sense<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> how

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
such good sense if you think of how

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.939 
such good sense if you think of how

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
minutes just until the juice

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.170 
minutes just until the juice
becomes<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.330> syrupy<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.180> pure

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
becomes a little syrupy then and pure

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.160 
becomes a little syrupy then and pure
rose<00:01:30.750> extract<00:01:31.759> when<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.880> put<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.450> extract

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
rose extract when you put the extract

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.060 
rose extract when you put the extract
into<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> warm<00:01:35.250> compote<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.930> sink<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.619> just

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
into the warm compote the sink is just

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
into the warm compote the sink is just
it's<00:01:38.640> dizzying<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.729> Conquer<00:01:42.180> cools<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it's dizzying as the Conquer cools the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.190 
it's dizzying as the Conquer cools the
rose<00:01:43.530> flavor<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.430> scent<00:01:45.090> becomes<00:01:45.750> subdued

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
rose flavor and scent becomes subdued

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.649 
rose flavor and scent becomes subdued
and<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> very<00:01:47.670> subtle<00:01:48.060> background

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
and so it's a very subtle background

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.789 
and so it's a very subtle background
flavor

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
flavor

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.480
