well here's what we gotta do down here
is<00:03:05.430> event<00:03:06.430> pan/crop<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.299> we<00:03:07.420> had<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.689> not

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
is event pan/crop and we had that not

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.789 
is event pan/crop and we had that not
we're<00:03:09.159> not<00:03:09.310> gonna<00:03:09.790> use<00:03:10.650> positioning<00:03:11.650> but

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
we're not gonna use positioning but

we're<00:03:11.890> gonna<00:03:11.980> go<00:03:12.159> to<00:03:12.189> mask<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.700> check<00:03:12.939> that<00:03:13.090> in

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
we're gonna go to mask and check that in

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.849 
we're gonna go to mask and check that in
and<00:03:13.659> now<00:03:14.590> click<00:03:15.329> anchor<00:03:16.329> creation<00:03:16.989> tool<00:03:17.230> if

and now click anchor creation tool if

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.280 
and now click anchor creation tool if
it's<00:03:18.099> not<00:03:18.189> already<00:03:18.430> selected<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.180> now<00:03:19.900> we

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
want to select right between the couch

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.000 
want to select right between the couch
and<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.180> remote<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.659> we<00:03:26.139> want<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.469> select<00:03:26.620> all

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
and the remote and we want to select all

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.490 
and the remote and we want to select all
the<00:03:27.969> way<00:03:28.090> out<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:30.510> let's<00:03:31.510> move<00:03:31.689> this<00:03:31.959> out<00:03:32.170> in

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
the way out and let's move this out in

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.679 
the way out and let's move this out in
just<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.859> case<00:03:33.129> so<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.150> can<00:03:34.269> get<00:03:34.359> all<00:03:34.629> the

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
just in case so we can get all the

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.289 
just in case so we can get all the
footage<00:03:35.109> weekend<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.340> straighten<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.849> out<00:03:36.970> as

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
footage weekend and straighten it out as

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.170 
footage weekend and straighten it out as
possible<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.870> we<00:03:37.959> can<00:03:38.169> so<00:03:38.349> there<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:39.180> our

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
possible as we can so there it's our

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.470 
possible as we can so there it's our
footage<00:03:40.569> right<00:03:40.780> there<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.760> I've<00:03:43.060> already

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
footage right there but I've already

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.300 
footage right there but I've already
done<00:03:43.750> one<00:03:44.169> thing<00:03:44.200> wrong<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.859> you<00:03:44.980> don't<00:03:45.159> want

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
done one thing wrong that you don't want

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.539 
done one thing wrong that you don't want
to<00:03:45.370> do<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:46.120> want<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.419> make<00:03:46.510> sure<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.919> starts<00:03:48.370> at

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
to do you want to make sure it starts at

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.390 
to do you want to make sure it starts at
the<00:03:48.730> first<00:03:49.000> keyframe<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.650> we<00:03:50.919> had<00:03:51.069> to<00:03:51.159> delete

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
the first keyframe so we had to delete

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.830 
the first keyframe so we had to delete
that<00:03:51.719> first<00:03:52.719> keyframe<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.409> then<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:55.510> want<00:03:55.750> to

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
that first keyframe and then you want to

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.089 
that first keyframe and then you want to
position<00:03:56.290> it<00:03:57.719> I'm<00:03:58.719> going<00:03:59.049> outside<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.829> thing

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
position it I'm going outside the thing

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.729 
position it I'm going outside the thing
because<00:04:00.579> I<00:04:01.000> can<00:04:01.359> get<00:04:01.980> all<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.040> footage<00:04:03.849> and

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
because I can get all the footage and

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.000 
because I can get all the footage and
there<00:04:05.739> now<00:04:06.220> we<00:04:06.280> have<00:04:06.729> the<00:04:07.449> correct<00:04:07.690> footage<00:04:08.109> so

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
there now we have the correct footage so

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.280 
there now we have the correct footage so
we<00:04:09.040> just<00:04:09.340> get<00:04:09.729> rid<00:04:09.849> of<00:04:09.940> that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
we just get rid of that

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.699 
we just get rid of that
and<00:04:11.680> now<00:04:12.010> on<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.730> other<00:04:12.969> footage<00:04:13.530> he<00:04:14.530> also

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
and now on to the other footage he also

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.060 
and now on to the other footage he also
had<00:04:15.040> two<00:04:15.159> event<00:04:15.549> pan/crop<00:04:15.849> that<00:04:16.269> too<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.739> you

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
had two event pan/crop that too so you

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.310 
had two event pan/crop that too so you
basically<00:04:18.699> do<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.090> same<00:04:19.209> thing<00:04:19.660> position

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
basically do the same thing position

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.310 
basically do the same thing position
mask<00:04:20.650> first<00:04:21.130> keyframe<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:22.960> time<00:04:23.139> you

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
mask first keyframe but this time you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.520 
mask first keyframe but this time you
want<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.560> go<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:23.979> other<00:04:24.130> side<00:04:25.259> make<00:04:26.259> sure

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
want to go on the other side make sure

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.249 
want to go on the other side make sure
you<00:04:26.800> start<00:04:27.669> that<00:04:28.570> goes<00:04:28.720> up<00:04:28.930> right<00:04:29.139> in<00:04:29.169> the

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
you start that goes up right in the

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.400 
you start that goes up right in the
middle<00:04:29.440> where<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.600> did<00:04:31.600> your<00:04:31.630> previous<00:04:32.139> one

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
middle where you did your previous one

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.580 
middle where you did your previous one
and<00:04:32.560> then<00:04:33.190> there<00:04:33.460> oh<00:04:33.840> oh<00:04:34.840> it's<00:04:35.229> messed<00:04:35.470> up

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
and then there oh oh it's messed up

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.100 
and then there oh oh it's messed up
right<00:04:35.770> there<00:04:36.009> fix<00:04:36.789> it<00:04:36.970> by<00:04:37.389> just<00:04:37.419> dragging<00:04:37.870> it

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
right there fix it by just dragging it

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.740 
right there fix it by just dragging it
over<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.380> bit<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:39.070> then<00:04:39.669> we<00:04:39.759> can<00:04:39.880> exhale<00:04:40.120> but

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
over a bit and then we can exhale but

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.990 
over a bit and then we can exhale but
there's<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.199> slight<00:04:41.680> color<00:04:42.039> mess<00:04:42.610> up<00:04:42.850> right

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
there's a slight color mess up right

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.570 
there's a slight color mess up right
there<00:04:43.330> start<00:04:44.080> there<00:04:44.470> but<00:04:44.800> then<00:04:45.009> you<00:04:45.400> can

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
there start there but then you can

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.279 
there start there but then you can
possibly<00:04:46.210> see<00:04:46.949> it's<00:04:47.949> messed<00:04:48.190> up<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:49.289> if

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
possibly see it's messed up so if

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.439 
possibly see it's messed up so if
there's<00:04:50.710> an<00:04:50.949> easy<00:04:51.099> way<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.310> fix<00:04:51.520> that<00:04:51.699> but<00:04:52.030> now

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
there's an easy way to fix that but now

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.810 
there's an easy way to fix that but now
as<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.870> can<00:04:52.990> see<00:04:53.460> there<00:04:54.460> are<00:04:54.610> two<00:04:54.639> of<00:04:54.940> me<00:04:55.090> now

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
as you can see there are two of me now

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.689 
as you can see there are two of me now
and<00:04:58.259> I'm<00:04:59.259> gonna<00:04:59.710> drag<00:05:00.009> the<00:05:00.190> draft<00:05:00.490> down<00:05:00.669> a

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
and I'm gonna drag the draft down a

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.640 
and I'm gonna drag the draft down a
quarter<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.509> can

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
quarter so it can

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.870 
quarter so it can
run<00:05:02.800> faster<00:05:04.410> there<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:05.949> I<00:05:06.130> want<00:05:06.340> them<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.550> wave

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
run faster there and I want them to wave

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:14.129 
run faster there and I want them to wave
at<00:05:07.150> both<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:08.110> same<00:05:08.320> time

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:27.560 

so<00:05:15.139> move<00:05:15.889> over<00:05:16.040> until<00:05:16.430> he<00:05:16.490> turns

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.990 

let's<00:05:28.570> see

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.930 

the<00:05:31.450> bigger<00:05:31.720> they<00:05:31.900> both<00:05:32.080> wave<00:05:32.350> at<00:05:32.500> each<00:05:32.530> other

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
the bigger they both wave at each other

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.650 
the bigger they both wave at each other

there's no one in there during that

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.770 
there's no one in there during that
little<00:05:53.290> gap<00:05:53.620> so<00:05:54.010> it<00:05:54.820> works<00:05:55.090> out<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:57.300> there<00:05:58.300> you

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
little gap so it works out and there you

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.730 
little gap so it works out and there you
have<00:05:58.810> your<00:05:59.290> clones<00:05:59.680> but<00:06:00.130> we're<00:06:01.090> not<00:06:01.210> done<00:06:01.390> yet

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
put this back to full preview we still

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.740 
put this back to full preview we still
have<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:04.990> fix<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.500> mess<00:06:06.220> up<00:06:06.430> right<00:06:06.460> there<00:06:06.850> part

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
have to fix the mess up right there part

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.180 
have to fix the mess up right there part
of<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.900> remote<00:06:08.110> is<00:06:08.350> shifted<00:06:08.710> up<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.040> the

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
of the remote is shifted up and the

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.760 
of the remote is shifted up and the
color<00:06:09.400> is<00:06:09.669> messed<00:06:10.390> up<00:06:10.510> right<00:06:10.690> there<00:06:10.930> so<00:06:11.530> we<00:06:11.650> got

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
color is messed up right there so we got

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.870 
color is messed up right there so we got
to<00:06:11.860> fix<00:06:11.980> that<00:06:13.080> first<00:06:14.080> keyframe<00:06:14.880> event

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
to fix that first keyframe event

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.390 
to fix that first keyframe event
pan/crop<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:16.660> this<00:06:16.840> time<00:06:17.080> you<00:06:17.980> got<00:06:18.160> to<00:06:18.280> make

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
pan/crop and this time you got to make

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.720 
pan/crop and this time you got to make
sure<00:06:18.870> feather<00:06:19.870> type<00:06:20.230> is<00:06:20.440> set<00:06:20.860> to<00:06:21.130> both<00:06:21.400> and

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
sure feather type is set to both and

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.610 
sure feather type is set to both and
then<00:06:22.570> just<00:06:23.350> type<00:06:23.500> in<00:06:23.650> ten<00:06:23.860> percent<00:06:24.280> and<00:06:25.620> then

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
then just type in ten percent and then

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.770 
then just type in ten percent and then
same<00:06:26.830> thing<00:06:26.860> with<00:06:27.220> the<00:06:27.340> other<00:06:27.370> footage<00:06:27.790> but<00:06:28.480> if

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
same thing with the other footage but if

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.840 
same thing with the other footage but if
it's<00:06:28.990> not<00:06:30.720> available<00:06:31.720> to<00:06:31.840> you<00:06:31.960> just<00:06:32.320> click<00:06:32.850> the

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
it's not available to you just click the

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.830 
it's not available to you just click the
one<00:06:34.000> line<00:06:35.010> ever<00:06:36.010> type<00:06:36.370> both<00:06:36.580> and<00:06:36.970> ten<00:06:37.330> percent

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
one line ever type both and ten percent

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.100 
one line ever type both and ten percent
and<00:06:38.550> there<00:06:39.550> you<00:06:39.729> go<00:06:39.760> it<00:06:40.390> has<00:06:40.570> been<00:06:40.690> feathered

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
and there you go it has been feathered

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.460 
and there you go it has been feathered
the<00:06:41.229> way<00:06:41.380> to<00:06:41.440> look<00:06:41.770> like<00:06:42.570> then<00:06:43.570> the<00:06:43.990> remote<00:06:44.320> is

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
the way to look like then the remote is

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.610 
the way to look like then the remote is
now<00:06:44.710> in<00:06:45.040> one<00:06:45.310> piece<00:06:45.580> not<00:06:46.030> shifted<00:06:46.479> up<00:06:46.630> and<00:06:46.900> the

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
now in one piece not shifted up and the

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.780 
now in one piece not shifted up and the
shadowing<00:06:48.250> looks<00:06:48.790> natural<00:06:50.040> so<00:06:51.040> if<00:06:51.400> we<00:06:51.580> watch

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
shadowing looks natural so if we watch

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.240 
shadowing looks natural so if we watch
it<00:06:51.820> if<00:06:52.180> you've<00:06:52.419> done<00:06:52.570> it<00:06:52.630> correctly<00:06:53.040> it<00:06:54.040> will

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
it if you've done it correctly it will

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.010 
it if you've done it correctly it will
stay<00:06:54.580> there<00:06:54.790> throughout<00:06:55.120> the<00:06:55.330> entire<00:06:55.630> video

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.320 

shadows<00:06:58.889> are<00:06:58.919> big<00:06:59.460> part<00:07:01.099> clones<00:07:02.099> and<00:07:02.430> now<00:07:03.120> if

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
shadows are big part clones and now if

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.670
