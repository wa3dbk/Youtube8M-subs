00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.710 
there's a whole tradition and especially
in<00:02:45.810> literature<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.830> being<00:02:47.610> very<00:02:47.880> specific<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
in literature of being very specific and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.830 
in literature of being very specific and
very<00:02:48.750> true<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.799> place<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.660> conveying<00:02:51.660> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
very true to a place and conveying the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.370 
very true to a place and conveying the

sense of place and yet doing so in a
kind<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.799> imaginative<00:02:56.760> way<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:58.910> think<00:02:59.910> Lucrezia

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
kind of imaginative way I think Lucrezia

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.890 
kind of imaginative way I think Lucrezia
is<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:01.260> very<00:03:01.680> literary<00:03:02.220> writer<00:03:02.849> in<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.630> best

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
is a very literary writer in the best

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.490 
is a very literary writer in the best
possible<00:03:04.290> sense<00:03:04.910> for<00:03:05.910> La<00:03:06.090> Cienega<00:03:06.390> she<00:03:07.290> wrote

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
possible sense for La Cienega she wrote

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.970 
possible sense for La Cienega she wrote
this<00:03:07.680> 200<00:03:08.459> page<00:03:08.849> script<00:03:09.690> which<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:10.860> they

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
this 200 page script which I think they

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.080 
this 200 page script which I think they
film<00:03:11.280> half<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.760> it

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
film half of it

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.330 
film half of it
they've<00:03:12.269> never<00:03:12.599> able<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.019> finish<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:14.069> in

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
they've never able to finish it but in

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.979 
they've never able to finish it but in
the<00:03:14.489> script<00:03:14.819> itself<00:03:15.000> there<00:03:15.630> were<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:15.900> many

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
the script itself there were so many

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.509 
the script itself there were so many
descriptions<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.880> much<00:03:19.519> concentration

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
descriptions and so much concentration

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.129 
descriptions and so much concentration
on<00:03:20.700> mood<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.010> climate<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:24.139> relationship

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
on mood and climate and relationship

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.039 
on mood and climate and relationship
between<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.709> characters<00:03:26.299> but<00:03:27.299> then<00:03:27.569> when<00:03:27.810> she

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
between the characters but then when she

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.559 
between the characters but then when she
went<00:03:28.230> up<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:29.310> actually<00:03:29.700> shoot<00:03:29.910> this<00:03:30.209> script

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
went up to actually shoot this script

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.559 
went up to actually shoot this script
she<00:03:31.109> could<00:03:31.290> basically<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:32.310> throw<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.329> in<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
she could basically just throw it in the

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.879 
she could basically just throw it in the
bin<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:35.510> she<00:03:36.510> had<00:03:36.600> already<00:03:36.750> created<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.590> world

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
bin and she had already created a world

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.050 
bin and she had already created a world
which<00:03:38.819> she<00:03:39.150> could<00:03:39.329> then<00:03:39.709> inhabit<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.670> kind

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
which she could then inhabit this kind

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.860 
which she could then inhabit this kind
of<00:03:42.600> sprawling<00:03:43.639> family<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.790> sprawling<00:03:45.209> house

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
of sprawling family and sprawling house

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.099 
of sprawling family and sprawling house
I<00:03:46.350> think<00:03:46.920> gives<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.790> impression<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.480> this

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
I think gives the impression that this

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.370 
I think gives the impression that this
world<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:50.489> we<00:03:50.850> are<00:03:51.000> witnessing<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:52.049> world

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
world that we are witnessing this world

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.559 
world that we are witnessing this world
of<00:03:52.739> La<00:03:53.069> Cienega<00:03:53.459> has<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:54.000> swamp

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
of La Cienega has a swamp

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.069 
of La Cienega has a swamp
actually<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.650> doesn't<00:03:55.950> ever<00:03:56.459> end<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.870> think

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
actually it doesn't ever end and I think

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.170 
actually it doesn't ever end and I think
this<00:03:58.260> is<00:03:58.410> something<00:03:58.799> that<00:03:58.829> maybe<00:03:59.489> she<00:03:59.940> learned

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
this is something that maybe she learned

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.819 
this is something that maybe she learned
from<00:04:00.389> literature<00:04:01.019> where<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.620> know<00:04:01.680> there's

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
from literature where you know there's

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.940 
from literature where you know there's
always<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.130> detail<00:04:03.019> speaks<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.620> wider

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
always the detail speaks of a wider

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.229 
always the detail speaks of a wider
thing<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:06.329> never<00:04:06.599> think<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.880> scenes

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
thing and you never think of the scenes

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.099 
thing and you never think of the scenes
in<00:04:09.810> SEN<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.500> got<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.829> scenes<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.849> think<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.690> see

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
in SEN I got a scenes I think you see

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.050 
in SEN I got a scenes I think you see
them<00:04:13.319> as<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:15.560> fragments<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.680> something<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
them as like fragments of something and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.909 
them as like fragments of something and
I<00:04:18.239> think<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.690> also<00:04:19.019> has<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:19.320> do<00:04:19.530> with<00:04:19.560> her

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
I think this also has to do with her

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.520 
I think this also has to do with her
filmmaking<00:04:20.729> skills<00:04:21.450> her

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
filmmaking skills her

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.230 
filmmaking skills her
intelligence<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:24.620> cutting<00:04:25.700> it's<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:26.940> she

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
intelligence in cutting it's like she

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.330 
intelligence in cutting it's like she
creates<00:04:27.690> these<00:04:27.990> scenes<00:04:28.410> which<00:04:28.770> seem<00:04:29.100> almost

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
creates these scenes which seem almost

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.570 
creates these scenes which seem almost
like<00:04:29.760> from<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.330> home<00:04:30.540> movie<00:04:30.810> almost

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
like from a home movie almost

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.170 
like from a home movie almost
documentary<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.910> then<00:04:33.540> she<00:04:34.380> cuts<00:04:34.860> before<00:04:35.760> you

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
documentary and then she cuts before you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.260 
documentary and then she cuts before you
expect<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:37.320> seem<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.860> end<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.610> you're<00:04:39.030> into

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
expect to seem to end and you're into

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.230 
expect to seem to end and you're into
something<00:04:39.510> else<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.920> again<00:04:41.310> it's<00:04:41.670> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
something else and so again it's the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.230 
something else and so again it's the
feeling<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.990> whole<00:04:43.620> complex<00:04:44.280> world<00:04:44.730> that

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
feeling of a whole complex world that

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.140 
feeling of a whole complex world that
you've<00:04:46.170> been<00:04:46.410> sort<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:46.920> thrown<00:04:47.310> into<00:04:47.580> and

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
you've been sort of thrown into and

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.150 
you've been sort of thrown into and
somehow<00:04:49.100> privy<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:53.300> even<00:04:54.300> this<00:04:55.130> quality<00:04:56.130> of

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
somehow privy to even this quality of

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.230 
somehow privy to even this quality of
sound<00:04:56.760> this<00:04:57.390> oral<00:04:58.050> language<00:04:58.920> that<00:04:59.460> we<00:04:59.760> find<00:05:00.030> in

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
sound this oral language that we find in

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.080 
sound this oral language that we find in
Lucretius<00:05:01.170> films<00:05:01.710> it's<00:05:02.250> not<00:05:02.430> just<00:05:02.730> in<00:05:02.910> the

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
Lucretius films it's not just in the

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150 
Lucretius films it's not just in the
dialogues<00:05:03.690> I<00:05:04.050> think<00:05:04.650> it's<00:05:04.800> in<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.010> whole

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
dialogues I think it's in the whole

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.070 
dialogues I think it's in the whole
structure<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.940> film<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.840> this<00:05:06.960> is

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
structure of the film and this is

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.880 
structure of the film and this is
something<00:05:07.260> that<00:05:07.590> she<00:05:07.860> herself<00:05:08.120> has<00:05:09.120> has

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
something that she herself has has

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.990 
something that she herself has has
talked<00:05:10.890> about<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.940> fact<00:05:12.240> that<00:05:13.190> she<00:05:14.190> says<00:05:14.430> her

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
talked about the fact that she says her

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.900 
talked about the fact that she says her
whole<00:05:15.480> inspiration<00:05:16.169> for<00:05:16.350> making<00:05:16.710> films<00:05:17.160> was

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
whole inspiration for making films was

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.909 
whole inspiration for making films was
in<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.600> siesta<00:05:19.560> when<00:05:20.550> in<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.270> provinces<00:05:21.810> like
