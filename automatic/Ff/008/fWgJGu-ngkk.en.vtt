Federer had fungal the infested terrans

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.040 
Federer had fungal the infested terrans
to<00:02:13.459> death<00:02:13.610> immediately<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.690> he<00:02:14.780> could<00:02:14.930> have

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
to death immediately that he could have

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.160 
to death immediately that he could have
held<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.580> what<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:16.700> feeling<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:18.020> would

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.230 
held that what is your feeling it would
be<00:02:18.290> tough<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.860> roaches<00:02:19.250> were<00:02:19.460> behind<00:02:19.940> him

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
be tough the roaches were behind him

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.309 
be tough the roaches were behind him
waiting

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319

uh you know it makes up for my my my

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.550 
uh you know it makes up for my my my
loss<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.519> supply<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.329> take<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.689> fast<00:03:20.989> if

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
loss and supply to take that fast if

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.559 
loss and supply to take that fast if
