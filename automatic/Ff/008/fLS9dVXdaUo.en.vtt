00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
performing yeah so I got the ax not a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.569 
performing yeah so I got the ax not a
guitar<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.680> which<00:01:22.680> if<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.860> call<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:26.040> arias

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.910 

I<00:01:29.579> guess<00:01:30.240> something<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.689> note<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> action

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I guess something to note is the action

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
I guess something to note is the action
is<00:01:35.220> pretty<00:01:35.850> high<00:01:37.369> almost<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.549> high<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.479> my

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
is pretty high almost as high as the my

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.179 
is pretty high almost as high as the my
no-name<00:01:40.380> guitar<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:42.000> know

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
no-name guitar you know

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.940 
no-name guitar you know
so<00:01:44.189> action<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.119> great<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.740> neck

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so action is not so great but the neck

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.350 
so action is not so great but the neck
profile<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> nice<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.299> thin<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.710> nice

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
profile is nice and thin so that's nice

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.530 
profile is nice and thin so that's nice
so<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.479> kind<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> trade-off<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.710> umm<00:01:53.540> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.290 

Oh

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.940 

Oh

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:22.110 

Oh

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.320 

ever

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.570 

Oh

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:53.580 

Oh

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:30.690 

Oh

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:56.740 

you

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.990 

so<00:04:57.750> this<00:04:57.900> uh<00:04:58.310> has<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.340> nice<00:04:59.810> sustained<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:02.000> nice

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
so this uh has a nice sustained and nice

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.110 
so this uh has a nice sustained and nice
warm<00:05:03.270> tone<00:05:03.450> um<00:05:04.200> balance<00:05:04.740> wise<00:05:04.980> this<00:05:05.490> thing<00:05:05.820> I

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
warm tone um balance wise this thing I

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.510 
warm tone um balance wise this thing I
think<00:05:06.450> has<00:05:06.480> more<00:05:06.860> low<00:05:07.860> end<00:05:12.890> however<00:05:13.890> out<00:05:14.370> when

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
think has more low end however out when

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:25.180 
think has more low end however out when
it<00:05:14.610> comes<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:16.110> mid<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.460> high<00:05:17.670> end

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.440 

it<00:05:26.190> tends<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.820> be<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.330> little<00:05:27.840> more<00:05:29.270> pulled<00:05:30.270> back

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
it tends to be a little more pulled back

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.320 
it tends to be a little more pulled back
a<00:05:30.480> little<00:05:30.630> bit<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:32.430> overall<00:05:32.820> balance

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
a little bit so the overall balance

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.080 
a little bit so the overall balance
isn't<00:05:34.050> as<00:05:34.710> good<00:05:35.010> as<00:05:35.160> Marius<00:05:37.670> it<00:05:38.670> still<00:05:38.940> has<00:05:39.060> a

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
isn't as good as Marius it still has a

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.570 
isn't as good as Marius it still has a
lot<00:05:39.330> of<00:05:39.390> projection<00:05:40.050> so<00:05:40.890> it's<00:05:41.040> pretty<00:05:41.370> decent

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
lot of projection so it's pretty decent

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.080 
lot of projection so it's pretty decent
