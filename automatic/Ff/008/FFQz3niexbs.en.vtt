00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
worked ourselves into a nice little

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.270 
worked ourselves into a nice little
position<00:01:18.850> leading<00:01:19.360> at<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.600> moment<00:01:20.280> it's

is tricky the first bit getting around
the<00:01:56.510> point<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.990> then<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:57.200> went<00:01:57.290> into<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.590> really

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
the point and then we went into a really

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.980 
the point and then we went into a really
really<00:01:58.010> light<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.820> once<00:01:59.540> we'd<00:01:59.720> wriggle

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
really light here and once we'd wriggle

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.240 
really light here and once we'd wriggle
through<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.530> sort<00:02:00.770> of<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.920> rich<00:02:01.070> got

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
through that it sort of the rich got

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.540 
through that it sort of the rich got
richer<00:02:01.630> but<00:02:02.630> um<00:02:02.810> those<00:02:03.140> are<00:02:03.170> really<00:02:03.620> so<00:02:04.310> that's

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
richer but um those are really so that's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.920 
richer but um those are really so that's
actually<00:02:04.880> quite<00:02:04.970> an<00:02:05.120> enjoyable<00:02:05.360> race<00:02:05.750> that
