 head nasal cavity 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 there many things you need to learn just 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.490
 memorize theoretically not all here 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.939
 You can see a lot in the first models in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.310
 second inside there we won't see much 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.140
 It means just to memorize and so the cavity 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.380
 us nose to vitas nazi 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.480

 posterior nasal cavity connects with the pharynx 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.760
 using huang and connects the nasal cavity 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.090
 pharyngeal nasal cavity divides 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.570
 septum on zeleosa into two 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:03.110
 halves and in each of them we teach 4 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:07.770
 bone and lateral medial wall 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.409
 upper and lower most difficult wall 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.909
 lateral you should call 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:19.070
 8 terms in the lateral wall here 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.320
 I see where the lateralis cut is 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:27.680

 or narrowly his final distance of 8 lateral 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.340
 you can not see the wall of the nasal cavity 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.229
 to put the medial paris now

 here we see here plastics means everything 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.400
 you just have to learn what is formed 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:25.170
 here six bones 6 mean firstly

 cross on climbed upper jaw thanks 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.920
 today you said cross on climbed

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:28.440
 this is a spalletti process but see axel or 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:34.900
 amine horizontal from spalletti axis not 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.739
 this is still not enough 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.739
 that 's not all
