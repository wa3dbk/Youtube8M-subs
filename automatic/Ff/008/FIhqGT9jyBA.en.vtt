00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
elementary start with the Alpha that's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.490 
elementary start with the Alpha that's
the<00:00:53.280> garment<00:00:53.789> alpha<00:00:54.329> which<00:00:54.840> gives<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> both

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the garment alpha which gives you both

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.740 
the garment alpha which gives you both
GPS<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.469> ecology<00:00:58.469> device<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.699> both<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
GPS and ecology device you get both so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299 
GPS and ecology device you get both so
we're<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> take<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.620> basic

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
we're just going to take some basic

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.000 
we're just going to take some basic
steps<00:01:02.609> again<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.870> very<00:01:04.140> elementary<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
steps again this is very elementary but

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.270 
steps again this is very elementary but
it's<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:06.090> show<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.510> how<00:01:07.140> easy<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's just to show you how easy it is to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.520 
it's just to show you how easy it is to
get<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.320> like

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
get into this and then it's it's like

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
get into this and then it's it's like
anything<00:01:10.860> else<00:01:11.189> after<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.909> learn<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> basics

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
anything else after you learn the basics

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780 
anything else after you learn the basics
then<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.500> far<00:01:13.830> beyond<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
then you can go far beyond that and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
then you can go far beyond that and
learn<00:01:14.970> though<00:01:15.240> all<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.619> features<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
learn though all the other features that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.420 
learn though all the other features that
are<00:01:17.490> involved<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.500> garment<00:01:20.070> alpha

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
are involved with like the garment alpha

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.990 
are involved with like the garment alpha
so<00:01:20.909> let's<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.299> started<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:23.070> course<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.759> first

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so let's get started of course the first

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.080 
so let's get started of course the first
step<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.080> order<00:01:25.380> your<00:01:25.560> unit<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.850> your

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
step is to order your unit you get your

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.710 
step is to order your unit you get your
unit<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.950> unpack<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.369> you'll<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.509> you've

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
unit you unpack it and you'll see you've

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.460 
unit you unpack it and you'll see you've
got<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> few<00:01:31.259> different<00:01:32.659> cables<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.079> forth

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
got a few different cables and so forth

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.609 
got a few different cables and so forth
but<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.430> two<00:01:35.670> main<00:01:35.939> units<00:01:36.360> are<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.750> handheld

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.210 
they're doing is they're connecting with
each<00:02:14.650> other<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:16.500> they're<00:02:17.500> talking<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.099> each

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
each other so they're talking to each

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.170 
each other so they're talking to each
other<00:02:18.519> through<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:20.230> satellite<00:02:20.800> system<00:02:21.640> this

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
other through the satellite system this

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.940 
other through the satellite system this
is<00:02:22.420> picking<00:02:22.810> up<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.959> satellites<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.800> then

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
is picking up the satellites and then

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.440 
is picking up the satellites and then
it's<00:02:24.099> talking<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.910> e-collar

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it's talking to the e-collar

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.160 
it's talking to the e-collar
and<00:02:25.630> once<00:02:26.230> they<00:02:26.440> make<00:02:26.709> connection<00:02:27.280> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and once they make connection and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.140 
and once they make connection and
factory<00:02:29.170> will<00:02:29.500> connect<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.640> two<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.120> you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
factory will connect the two so you

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.580 
factory will connect the two so you
don't<00:02:31.420> have<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.750> worry<00:02:31.930> about<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.349> that's

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
don't have to worry about that that's

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.160 
don't have to worry about that that's
done<00:02:32.860> at<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.130> factory<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:34.299> now<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.810> both

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
done at the factory so now we have both

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.300 
done at the factory so now we have both
on<00:02:35.670> they're<00:02:36.670> connected<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:38.769> what<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.130> do

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
on they're connected and so what we do

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.430 
on they're connected and so what we do
next<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:40.030> we're<00:02:40.720> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.900> connect<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
next is we're going to connect the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.350 
next is we're going to connect the
caller<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> dog<00:02:43.950> okay<00:02:44.950> folks<00:02:45.250> I<00:02:45.519> put<00:02:46.239> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
caller to a dog okay folks I put the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.289 
caller to a dog okay folks I put the
collar<00:02:46.630> on<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.959> dog<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.730> right<00:02:48.730> now<00:02:48.970> we're<00:02:49.180> on

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
collar on the dog and right now we're on

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.170 
collar on the dog and right now we're on
the<00:02:49.480> compass<00:02:50.079> page<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:51.489> compass<00:02:51.880> page

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
the compass page and the compass page

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.479 
the compass page and the compass page
tells<00:02:52.599> us<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.019> dog<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.560> it's<00:02:53.680> right<00:02:54.130> here<00:02:54.400> it

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
tells us the dog and it's right here it

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.910 
tells us the dog and it's right here it
says<00:02:54.670> it's<00:02:54.880> 70<00:02:55.480> yards<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.079> it<00:02:56.170> tells<00:02:56.380> us<00:02:56.590> which

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
says it's 70 yards and it tells us which

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.819 
says it's 70 yards and it tells us which
direction<00:02:56.950> we<00:02:57.610> go<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.849> find<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.420> dog<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.620> that's

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
direction we go to find a dog so that's

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.520 
direction we go to find a dog so that's
very<00:03:00.310> easy<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.910> understand<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:02.110> can<00:03:02.319> also

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
very easy to understand we can also

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.650 
very easy to understand we can also
switch<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.640> map<00:03:06.940> page<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.920> map<00:03:09.130> page

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
switch to the map page and the map page

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.530 
switch to the map page and the map page
shows<00:03:10.660> us<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:11.310> topo<00:03:12.310> map<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.940> then<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.359> also

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
shows us a topo map and then it also

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.390 
shows us a topo map and then it also
shows<00:03:14.019> us<00:03:14.230> exactly<00:03:14.470> where<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> dog<00:03:15.370> is

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
shows us exactly where the dog is

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.470 
shows us exactly where the dog is
located<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.420> again<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.500> says<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.010> dog<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.579> 70

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
located and again it says the dog is 70

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.470 
located and again it says the dog is 70
yards<00:03:19.780> away<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:20.920> we're<00:03:21.579> going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.760> slowly<00:03:22.150> go

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
yards away so we're going to slowly go

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.580 
yards away so we're going to slowly go
we're<00:03:22.660> going<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:23.319> put<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.530> back<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:23.739> compass

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.170 

we're<00:03:29.590> back<00:03:29.829> on<00:03:30.069> compass<00:03:30.579> we're<00:03:30.970> going<00:03:31.090> to

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
we're back on compass we're going to

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.270 
we're back on compass we're going to
slowly<00:03:31.540> follow<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.200> compass<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.100> we're

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
slowly follow the compass and we're

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.580 
slowly follow the compass and we're
going<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.430> locate<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:34.090> dog<00:03:34.299> again<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.380> is

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
going to locate the dog again this is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.099 
going to locate the dog again this is
very<00:03:36.010> basic<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:37.120> this<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.450> just<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.840> get<00:03:37.989> us

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
very basic but this is just to get us

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.370 
very basic but this is just to get us
started<00:03:38.139> on<00:03:38.799> the<00:03:39.370> Alpha<00:03:39.819> let's<00:03:40.780> go<00:03:40.959> find<00:03:41.230> our

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
started on the Alpha let's go find our

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.170 
started on the Alpha let's go find our
dog<00:03:43.109> now<00:03:44.109> we<00:03:44.650> haven't<00:03:44.920> gone<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.519> dog<00:03:45.819> yet

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
dog now we haven't gone to the dog yet

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.360 
dog now we haven't gone to the dog yet
the<00:03:46.510> dog<00:03:46.720> is<00:03:46.900> standing<00:03:47.109> still<00:03:47.590> according<00:03:48.010> to

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
the dog is standing still according to

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.120 
the dog is standing still according to
our<00:03:48.400> our<00:03:48.910> compass<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.349> one<00:03:50.650> other<00:03:50.829> thing

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
our our compass but the one other thing

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.129 
our our compass but the one other thing
I<00:03:51.220> wanted<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:51.549> mention<00:03:51.760> now<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.180> let's<00:03:52.840> bring

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
I wanted to mention now is let's bring

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.580 
I wanted to mention now is let's bring
in<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:54.010> e-collar<00:03:54.639> function<00:03:55.329> we<00:03:55.959> have<00:03:56.139> three

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
in the e-collar function we have three

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.629 
in the e-collar function we have three
buttons<00:03:57.040> here<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.420> this<00:03:58.750> is<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.260> simple

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
buttons here this is this is so simple

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.680 
buttons here this is this is so simple
we<00:04:00.639> have<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.620> momentary<00:04:02.620> button<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:03.910> if<00:04:04.299> we

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
we have a a momentary button so if we

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.050 
we have a a momentary button so if we
want<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.989> stimulate<00:04:05.319> this<00:04:05.859> is<00:04:06.069> momentary<00:04:06.790> and

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
want to stimulate this is momentary and

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.229 
want to stimulate this is momentary and
then<00:04:07.720> we<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.500> continuous<00:04:09.310> button<00:04:09.700> if<00:04:09.849> we

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
then we have the continuous button if we

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.599 
then we have the continuous button if we
want<00:04:10.419> to<00:04:10.510> stimulate<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.260> then<00:04:11.859> we<00:04:12.010> also<00:04:12.220> have

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
want to stimulate and then we also have

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.600 
want to stimulate and then we also have
a<00:04:12.639> tone<00:04:13.000> button<00:04:13.419> so<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.650> just<00:04:15.189> can't<00:04:15.430> be<00:04:15.519> any

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
a tone button so it just can't be any

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.930 
a tone button so it just can't be any
easier<00:04:15.849> than<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.539> if<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.549> let's<00:04:18.549> say<00:04:18.789> the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
easier than that if you let's say the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.400 
easier than that if you let's say the
momentary<00:04:19.539> button

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
momentary button

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.580 
momentary button
click<00:04:20.709> on<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.040> m4<00:04:21.550> momentary<00:04:22.200> and<00:04:23.200> what<00:04:23.500> it

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
click on the m4 momentary and what it

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.970 
click on the m4 momentary and what it
does<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:25.150> gives<00:04:25.390> us<00:04:25.780> an<00:04:26.020> opportunity<00:04:26.530> to

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
does is it gives us an opportunity to

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.730 
does is it gives us an opportunity to
set<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.370> level<00:04:27.760> we<00:04:28.300> can<00:04:28.510> go<00:04:28.660> low<00:04:28.960> medium<00:04:29.500> high

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
set the level we can go low medium high

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.740 
set the level we can go low medium high
and<00:04:30.040> in<00:04:30.160> within<00:04:30.340> low<00:04:30.910> medium<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:31.480> high

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
and in within low medium and high

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.800 
and in within low medium and high
we<00:04:32.470> have<00:04:32.770> several<00:04:33.310> levels<00:04:33.820> one<00:04:34.120> two<00:04:34.360> three<00:04:34.720> and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810
