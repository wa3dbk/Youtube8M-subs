believe me so I don't use any of that

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.289 
believe me so I don't use any of that
and<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.319> didn't<00:02:32.530> use<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> primer<00:02:33.040> or<00:02:33.459> finishing

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.990 
and I didn't use a primer or finishing
coat<00:02:34.600> either<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:36.570> once<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.370> let<00:02:39.880> it

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
coat either and once you do that let it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.060 
coat either and once you do that let it
dry<00:02:40.269> for<00:02:40.329> about<00:02:40.750> an<00:02:41.019> hour<00:02:41.170> then<00:02:43.530> basically<00:02:44.530> all

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
dry for about an hour then basically all

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.060 
dry for about an hour then basically all
you<00:02:45.190> have<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.400> do<00:02:45.519> is<00:02:45.670> put<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:45.970> back<00:02:46.150> together

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
you have to do is put it back together

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:57.790 
you have to do is put it back together
and<00:02:48.510> that's<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.720> will<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.049> right<00:02:50.260> now

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.620 

okay<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:58.860> yeah<00:02:59.640> putting<00:03:00.210> this<00:03:00.390> thing<00:03:00.450> back

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
okay so yeah putting this thing back

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.890 
okay so yeah putting this thing back
together<00:03:00.960> it's<00:03:01.380> pretty<00:03:01.650> easy<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.360> put

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
together it's pretty easy just to put

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.580 
together it's pretty easy just to put
all<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.170> buttons<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.840> said<00:03:07.080> before<00:03:07.200> they

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
all the buttons like I said before they

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.860 
all the buttons like I said before they
only<00:03:07.740> go<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.130> one<00:03:08.160> way<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.450> that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
only go in one way so it's not that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.580 
only go in one way so it's not that
difficult<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:12.180> apparently<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.410> me

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
difficult but apparently it is for me

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:32.200 
difficult but apparently it is for me
because<00:03:14.040> I
