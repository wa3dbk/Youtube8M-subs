00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.750
 a samsung galaxy s 550 euros

 it was more expensive moment these six years a 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.449

 a fake galaxy s it shows all of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.390
 continued watching this screen for ida it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 walking there are spelling mistakes 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.600
 what is this thing but 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 no, but I was very careful 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.809
 friends there gal default galaxy worries about 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.379
 fake cell phones lying around 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.379
 we talk about it right away 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.700
 olala my poor french melodica this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.210
 who had arrived there a little bit in 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.250
 corridors 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 it's amazing buying a galaxy show 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.760
 it's true that it can happen 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.550
 we see in the street be in the hallway 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 on a classifieds site by 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.879
 example ads a bit too much 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.350
 enticing to do so that's 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.519
 extremely rare to most of 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 time you are going to buy a real 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 smartphone but we can fall on 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.140
 counterfeits typically look at you 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.180
 have there galaxy bagged the real one 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.759
 which is made by samsung and next 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 you have this poor counterfeit this 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.409
 galaxy s worries moreover smaller 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.479
 that the original tap version then 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.430
 if it's amazing that says we if we 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.500
 is not very knowledgeable we can 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.970
 let's trap of course obviously then 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.920
 we bathes in smartphones so we 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.939
 see right away but someone who does not 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.500
 do not pay attention who sees writing 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.570
 galaxy to 5 on a smartphone is not going 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 think it's crazy when it's 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.369
 which distinguishes to recognize 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.320
 counterfeits his real faults 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.270
 phone we asked the question to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159
 Stephanie Molinier of the lab 01net 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.290
 before answering this question I 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.649
 would like to point out that even though it is 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.299
 not always obvious to detect the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.310
 counterfeit when she is as good 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.409
 fact that this one especially at the level of the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.369
 back that really looks like that of a 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.979
 galaxy s 5 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.310
 nevertheless if by chance we have a 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.020
 smartphone or that we are with a friend who 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.239
 has a smartphone it's worth doing 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.310
 a little search on google and 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.460
 to go see the photos of galaxy s 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.500
 5 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.960
 and look for the little detail that kills 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.160
 that is to say that here if I take the 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.750
 true galaxy s 5 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.490
 we see that it is bigger on a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.990
 photo it will not be easy to detect 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:29.380
 on the other hand at level 2 of the photo sensor 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.710
 we see that below on the galaxy s 5 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.230
 we have the heart rate sensor and 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.200
 the counterfeit flash 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.850
 we only have the flash when we have not 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.440
 really of reference point that we did not 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.630
 never seen the galaxy s 5 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.460
 the first thing actually to check 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.150
 this is the software part on this 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.090
 forgery 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.470
 we realize that it responds very poorly 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.690
 the screen a bad quality and especially 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.110
 in fact we have at the level of the screen of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.240
 Eve 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.770
 here a little button to unlock 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.500
 and the text goes out of the box and on 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.210
 big builders like samsung like 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.880
 apple like lg 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.730
 it seems a little bit surprising that they 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 have neglected this kind of details 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.930
 the second thing is to go to 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.690
 phone settings and search 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.400
 the phone reference know that about 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.410
 the android systems 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.000
 when looking in the settings 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.550
 and we're going to a part that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.090
 is often called about we will find 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.610
 the name of the phone is here we have beautiful 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.440
 search and absolutely nothing indicated 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.300
 so no name there is every chance 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.550
 whether it is a counterfeit 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.870
 good so what are the smartphones the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.130
 more counterfeit well it's the most 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.220
 sought so smartphones top of 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.740
 galaxy s 5 iphone range also the 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.450
 apple phones are fake 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.560
 also the goal always we find 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.240
 fake iphone clones 4s 5 5s before 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.950
 same as the real ones are marketed 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.670
 we even find iphone that turns 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.890
 under android 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.840
 not bad to say that this is when 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.370
 even hard enough to hurt when we go in 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.080
 China we are not surprised to see that 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.700
 obviously when this kind of product one 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.230
 you offer them for sale but if in 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.940
 France is chelou 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.710
 stand in China look at these images that we 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.109
 had captured a few years ago from 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.760
 this a fake apple store with larks 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.470
 Here is a fake apple 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.389
 store with logos a little chelou when 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.469
 even 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.509
 but we could buy should 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.979
 smartphones and should iphone in this 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.780
 store that's what's amazing 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.580
 caution do not buy anything at 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.099
 anyone at any price 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.479
 last little tip asked a friend 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.699
