00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
motherboard now the problem was you only

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.660 
motherboard now the problem was you only
have<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.449> PCI<00:00:51.809> Express<00:00:52.170> x16<00:00:52.590> slot<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.550> would

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
have one PCI Express x16 slot that would

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.729 
have one PCI Express x16 slot that would
run<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.030> full<00:00:54.360> x16<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> added<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> second

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
run at full x16 if you added a second

video card the other one run at x8 well
no<00:00:58.260> longer<00:00:58.469> check<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.219> board<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.760> one

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
no longer check this board out this one

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.470 
no longer check this board out this one
actually<00:01:00.030> has<00:01:00.270> two<00:01:00.570> PCI<00:01:01.199> Express<00:01:01.590> x16<00:01:02.550> 2.0

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
last one hey where is the last one I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.160 
last one hey where is the last one I
don't<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.150> they<00:02:57.450> said<00:02:57.630> there's<00:02:57.780> six<00:02:58.019> I

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
don't know they said there's six I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.780 
don't know they said there's six I
believe<00:02:58.200> them<00:02:58.560> oh<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.769> know<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.430> it's

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
believe them oh I know what it is it's

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.699 
believe them oh I know what it is it's
right<00:02:59.940> there<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.840> eSATA<00:03:01.170> that's<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
right there it's the eSATA that's the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.850 
right there it's the eSATA that's the
last<00:03:01.860> one<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:02.850> five<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.630> total<00:03:03.780> but<00:03:04.470> five

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
last one so it's five in total but five

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.440 
last one so it's five in total but five
satyrs<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.400> enough<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.730> give<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.030> pretty<00:03:06.360> much

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
satyrs is enough to give you pretty much

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.390 
satyrs is enough to give you pretty much
everything<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.840> want<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.320> zero<00:03:07.800> one

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
everything you want you can do zero one

five<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.420> plus<00:03:09.750> zero<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.410> don't<00:03:11.250> think<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.459> does

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
five one plus zero I don't think it does

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.729 
five one plus zero I don't think it does

but<00:04:06.900> not<00:04:07.019> really<00:04:07.410> out<00:04:07.799> just<00:04:08.400> yet<00:04:08.640> another

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
but not really out just yet another

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.990 
but not really out just yet another
thing<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.390> get<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:10.170> little<00:04:10.440> plate<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.040> I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
thing you get is this little plate and I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.400 
thing you get is this little plate and I
couldn't<00:04:12.600> figure<00:04:12.720> out<00:04:12.810> what<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.049> did<00:04:13.230> because

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
couldn't figure out what it did because

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.599 
couldn't figure out what it did because
it's<00:04:13.530> hollow<00:04:13.739> on<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:13.980> inside<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.430> then<00:04:14.549> I

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
it's hollow on the inside and then I

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.550 
it's hollow on the inside and then I
figured<00:04:14.910> out<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.150> goes<00:04:15.239> on<00:04:15.390> your<00:04:15.480> Selfridge<00:04:15.930> it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
figured out it goes on your Selfridge it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.930 
figured out it goes on your Selfridge it
actually<00:04:16.950> if<00:04:17.100> you<00:04:17.250> want<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.430> see<00:04:17.579> right<00:04:17.729> there
