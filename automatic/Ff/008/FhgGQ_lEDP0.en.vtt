00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.850
 coast-d'or you write c 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.940
 if you want a question since 2001 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.780
 we reached its peak 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.780
 of the company 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.080
 power but if that sense 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.550
 in this contest 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.410

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.070
 ap 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.740
 in the inevitable 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.820
 in conclusion the first contents of the book 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.730
 and when it is necessary they have not finished 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.810
 but why when the vehicle 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.760
 want to create any execution ground 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 exactly all the prophecies meaning 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.509
 moving not at the point between the two countries like tomtom all that 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.450
 on the French side 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.550
 it can be a track to follow 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 again rely on michel cacouault not too much 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.310
