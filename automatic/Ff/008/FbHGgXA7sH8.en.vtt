 [Music] 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.550
 our noses and themes at audi exists 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.250
 For more than 20 years since the time 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.859
 Let us fight for the customer 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.470
 get the vehicle where the smell 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.240
 Separate the high quality standard from the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.820
 audi has corresponded 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 [Music] 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.640
 I am going to do a turbo here now 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.660
 Prepare to do such a thing 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.529
 Chemical Analysis 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.710
 we have one in the bottom of our chamber 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.930
 Probe examined and there from the air 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.360
 lifted and from the air a sample 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.640
 taken and now it is this air 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.739
 gas mixture examines a bad one 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.070
 For example, book in the car can 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 cause processing errors if that 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.620
 Part has been heated too much and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.720
 then it turns dizzy it can 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.750
 unpleasant 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.320
 Smell the additives of components 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.220
 his 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.110
 but this is usually already in advance 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.880
 that does not even identify 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.880
 to the entire share your head 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.300
 [Music] 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.190
 We will be in our investigation 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.800
 both determine the smell 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.740
 to find out what the customer then with 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.290
 ordered the nose as well as what the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.380
 customer can not determine which 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.860
 Substances are there in the air 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.040
 contain there is our lab and great 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.260
 The technology used here is in demand 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.320
 told us which substances here 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.870
 can be found in it and then we can 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.240
 determine which occupational seventh 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.120
 and as a side effect we have the same 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.750
 determine and determine that there is no 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.520
 Substances in it are in some form 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.780
 are harmful to health 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.430
 [Music] 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.530
 This device is used to air up 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 from vehicles to analyze and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.080
 unpleasant odors have tried here 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.270
 to get the track 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.580
 you pull the appropriate air sample 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.320
 Also a special polymer that takes 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.330
 the corresponding rumors on like one 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.580
 sponge, the water then it will 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.370
 analyzed in the mass spectrometer and 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.210
 then you can try here 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.830
 unpleasant desired on the track too 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.180
 come here in this picture for example 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.310
 is someone the interior air of 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.920
 test vehicle and this special 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.240
 peak at the musicians solvent the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.680
 would then be in a vehicle without yourself 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.000
 with the smell cause and there if 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.000
 you try to eliminate it

 him and his mission will check again 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.490
 opportunity also complete components to 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.500
 to examine the size of a seat 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.970
 that's important to you as well 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.470
 the combination effects between 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.470
 examine individual materials 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.360
 the vehicle will finish on 65 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.180
 Grad heated up in the interior this will 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.280
 about temperature sensors in the inside and in the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.680
 outside area of ​​the vehicle exactly 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.939
 monitored and after a holding period of 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.319
 four hours will be a sample of the air in the 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.240
 Drawn interior 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:28.900
 then examined in the laboratory 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:31.609
 [Music] 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.590
 then the people rise individually 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:38.650
 from the smell team into the vehicle and 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.459
 then discuss their impressions in a team 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.330
 or the odors 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:53.499
 have been found 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:53.499
 [Music] 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.720
 the tasks of the nasal engineering the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.260
 consist mainly in that the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.100
 odor of the new vehicle is as in 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.950
 the customer would like to have something there 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.590
 But that's what the customer expects 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.600
 do not bother not biting somehow 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.140
 not unpleasant the stink 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.239
 let's say so and with that we have 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.250
 then the werder is that he has a good one 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.650
 but new car has the possibility 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.490
 has an individual smell 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.490
 add
