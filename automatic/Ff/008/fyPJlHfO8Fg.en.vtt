building in massive quantities of new
tooling<00:02:27.480> that's<00:02:28.290> why<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.500> collectors<00:02:29.130> have

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
tooling that's why the collectors have

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.380 
tooling that's why the collectors have
to<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.430> little<00:02:29.700> bit<00:02:29.850> patient<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.270> us

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
important to continue to get better and

better and to refine the processes ago
we<00:04:28.150> absolutely<00:04:28.720> listen<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.230> lot<00:04:29.650> of

reviews<00:04:32.680> on<00:04:32.980> cranes<00:04:33.340> etc<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.900> we<00:04:35.410> made<00:04:35.620> some

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
reviews on cranes etc and we made some

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.040 
reviews on cranes etc and we made some
changes<00:04:35.920> to<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.790> few<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.120> our<00:04:37.270> models<00:04:37.630> based<00:04:37.840> on

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
changes to a few of our models based on

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.860 
changes to a few of our models based on
those<00:04:38.200> reviews<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:39.040> takes<00:04:39.310> us<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> long<00:04:39.760> time<00:04:39.870> to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
those reviews it takes us a long time to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.720 
those reviews it takes us a long time to
see<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.740> changes<00:04:42.070> at<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.190> market<00:04:42.550> due<00:04:42.700> to

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
see the changes at the market due to

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.100 
see the changes at the market due to
tooling<00:04:43.180> changes<00:04:43.570> that<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.840> goes<00:04:43.960> for

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
tooling changes that it goes for

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.260 
tooling changes that it goes for
packaging<00:04:44.560> then<00:04:45.040> approval<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.850> caterpillar

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
packaging then approval the caterpillar

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.700 
packaging then approval the caterpillar
might<00:04:46.450> have<00:04:46.630> three<00:04:46.870> or<00:04:46.960> four<00:04:47.140> levels<00:04:47.590> of

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
might have three or four levels of

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.770 
might have three or four levels of
approval<00:04:48.190> before<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.180> gets<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.480> market

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
approval before it gets to the market

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.890 
approval before it gets to the market
but<00:04:50.250> we<00:04:51.250> will<00:04:51.490> absolutely<00:04:52.180> take<00:04:52.450> that<00:04:52.660> into

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
but we will absolutely take that into

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.830 
but we will absolutely take that into
account<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.500> people<00:04:54.430> are<00:04:54.520> patient<00:04:54.700> they<00:04:55.480> can

see<00:04:56.020> improvements<00:04:56.950> come<00:04:57.610> along<00:04:57.820> based<00:04:58.600> on

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
see improvements come along based on

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.260 
see improvements come along based on
their<00:04:58.930> own<00:04:59.020> comments<00:04:59.460> of<00:05:00.460> course<00:05:00.520> Tonkin<00:05:01.150> has

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
their own comments of course Tonkin has

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.150 
their own comments of course Tonkin has
had<00:05:01.390> a<00:05:01.419> long<00:05:01.600> history<00:05:01.780> of<00:05:02.050> making<00:05:02.500> us<00:05:02.680> trucks

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
had a long history of making us trucks

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.820 
had a long history of making us trucks
but<00:05:03.970> they<00:05:04.120> are<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.390> 153<00:05:04.930> scale<00:05:05.380> rather<00:05:05.650> than

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
but they are in 153 scale rather than

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.290 
but they are in 153 scale rather than
the<00:05:05.919> 1:50<00:05:06.310> scale<00:05:06.490> that's<00:05:06.940> common<00:05:07.270> for

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
the 1:50 scale that's common for

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.050 
the 1:50 scale that's common for
construction<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.990> European<00:05:08.680> trucks<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.880> are

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
construction and European trucks so are

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.230 
construction and European trucks so are
there<00:05:10.180> any<00:05:10.270> plans<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.720> change<00:05:11.080> this<00:05:11.730> in<00:05:12.730> in<00:05:13.000> the

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
there any plans to change this in in the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.290 
there any plans to change this in in the
US<00:05:13.419> we<00:05:13.630> tackled<00:05:14.110> a<00:05:14.260> number<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.740> scales<00:05:15.010> one<00:05:15.730> 287

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
US we tackled a number of scales one 287

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.960 
US we tackled a number of scales one 287
164<00:05:16.930> 153<00:05:17.740> and<00:05:17.770> then<00:05:18.040> later<00:05:18.250> 130<00:05:20.160> we<00:05:21.160> started

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
164 153 and then later 130 we started

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.180 
164 153 and then later 130 we started
though<00:05:22.240> originally<00:05:22.810> with<00:05:23.110> 153<00:05:23.650> mostly

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
though originally with 153 mostly

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.760 
though originally with 153 mostly
because<00:05:24.340> when<00:05:25.210> Jack<00:05:25.480> Tonkin<00:05:25.930> started<00:05:26.290> making

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
because when Jack Tonkin started making

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.320 
because when Jack Tonkin started making
diecast<00:05:27.130> models<00:05:27.550> he<00:05:28.860> decided<00:05:29.860> he<00:05:30.820> there<00:05:31.210> was

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
diecast models he decided he there was

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.940

no<00:05:31.419> one<00:05:31.570> else<00:05:31.690> really<00:05:31.780> building<00:05:32.290> scale<00:05:32.680> model

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
no one else really building scale model

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.530 
no one else really building scale model
trucks<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.520> he<00:05:33.580> decided<00:05:33.880> he<00:05:34.030> want<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.300> model

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
trucks and he decided he want the model

about<00:05:34.720> this<00:05:34.930> big

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
about this big

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.520 
about this big

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
and and about this big which engineers

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.820 
and and about this big which engineers
took<00:05:38.620> literally<00:05:38.920> was<00:05:39.220> 153<00:05:39.970> scale<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:40.480> he<00:05:41.110> we

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
took literally was 153 scale and he we

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.180 
took literally was 153 scale and he we
built<00:05:42.460> out<00:05:42.640> since<00:05:42.910> then<00:05:43.120> over<00:05:43.270> decades<00:05:44.190> large

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190

the 130 scale trucks that we started

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.850 
the 130 scale trucks that we started
were<00:05:56.200> actually<00:05:57.420> somewhat<00:05:58.420> well<00:05:59.170> requested<00:05:59.740> by
