too<00:02:16.080> maybe<00:02:16.590> picking<00:02:17.040> up<00:02:17.130> some<00:02:17.310> near<00:02:17.490> fall<00:02:17.700> I

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
too maybe picking up some near fall I

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.940 
too maybe picking up some near fall I
didn't<00:02:18.060> expect<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.450> at<00:02:18.600> all<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:18.900> he<00:02:19.140> SAT<00:02:19.800> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
didn't expect that at all but he SAT to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.050 
didn't expect that at all but he SAT to
the<00:02:20.070> hip<00:02:20.220> there<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.610> bit<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.000> little

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the hip there a little bit for a little

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.330 
the hip there a little bit for a little
elevation<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.020> we'll<00:02:22.800> see<00:02:22.980> if<00:02:23.070> he<00:02:23.190> has<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
elevation and we'll see if he has a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.980 
elevation and we'll see if he has a
chance<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.730> go<00:02:23.880> back<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.270> any<00:02:24.540> time<00:02:24.750> later
