00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello in today's video we will 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.740
 together a minced vegetable pan 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.610
 make for two to three persons 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.679
 For this we need about 250 grams 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.920
 minced meat I take the hague now 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.320
 maybe then a piece of one 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.830
 Celeriac a vegetable then pulls 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.070
 a carrot then a complete one too 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 pour some water to drain or 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.270
 Deglaze and then some herbs and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.649
 Spices then take some pepper 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 salt with rosemary and something clear 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.559
 Chicken stock as a side dish is then 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.960
 potatoes and yes, first of all 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.730
 the vegetables are cleaned and in small 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.800
 strip and cut dice so that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.320
 vegetables it cleaned and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 once cut the onions and the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.550
 Carrots and the celery in dices and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.129
 once the leek in slices 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.600
 who in retrospect still a sauce to do so 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.330
 want to have it or have it a little juicier 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.830
 I still want one 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.830
 cup of cream added 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.030
 in the time when the potatoes are cooking 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.369
 you can already go as a roast 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.750
 then come on top of the onion 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:38.360
 into a pan where something is oil in it 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.360
 will now roast golden yellow 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 so the onions are so far well browned 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.200
 now comes the mincemeat 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.120
 and now a little smaller 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.120
 and good for the language 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.850
 after everything is just fine attached 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.850
 one is seasoned with pepper a little 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:27.890
 then comes the time to be it and 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:31.459
 that will touch a 1 2 teaspoon 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.489
 mix it up for a minute 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.650
 did the vegetables come on 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.110
 best always the hardest vegetables first 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.010
 that's just like taking that 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.989
 Celery and the carrots 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.130
 they will feel like they are now 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.290
 and with seared 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.150
 after searing it very well 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.150
 come once more on it 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.140
 and the run will now be for another five 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.150
 minutes with seared 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.890
 after you fried everything well 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:20.800
 come about 200 to 250 milliliters 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:23.740
 Add water and there it comes now 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.140
 another lid and then it will be like that 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.120
 We let that go for about 45 minutes 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.080
 so cuddles harl just the cover 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.800
 removed 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.580
 the case is as soft as it is 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.300
 should be 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:49.740
 Now I give sugar half a cup 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:49.740
 Whipped it and earlier it again 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.370
 load from very briefly boil and then 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.670
 it's already getting started 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.010
 that is now the finished flash 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.380
 vegetable pan with potato as a side dish 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.800
 and good appetite and have fun 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.800
 imitate
