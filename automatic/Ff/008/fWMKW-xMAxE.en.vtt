I'd<00:00:58.580> say<00:00:59.230> tequila<00:01:00.230> is<00:01:00.460> probably<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:02.350> spirit<00:01:03.350> I

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
I'd say tequila is probably the spirit I

I'd say tequila is probably the spirit I
have<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.739> most<00:01:04.040> experience<00:01:04.460> with<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.420> and

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
have the most experience with that and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.900 
have the most experience with that and
bourbon<00:01:06.440> just<00:01:06.770> because<00:01:07.160> I'm<00:01:07.369> a<00:01:07.400> lover<00:01:07.729> of

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
bourbon just because I'm a lover of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.710 
bourbon just because I'm a lover of
margaritas<00:01:08.950> but<00:01:09.950> I<00:01:10.340> don't<00:01:10.970> drink<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.420> on<00:01:11.570> its

own all that often so I'll probably go

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.389

other<00:01:42.800> day<00:01:42.920> from<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.430> guy<00:01:43.460> from<00:01:44.140> Highland<00:01:45.140> Park

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
other day from a guy from Highland Park

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.100 
other day from a guy from Highland Park
the<00:01:45.920> Scotch<00:01:46.459> maker<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.750> was<00:01:47.959> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the Scotch maker and this was the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.279 
the Scotch maker and this was the
closest<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.800> hooking<00:01:49.310> glass<00:01:49.580> we<00:01:49.849> had<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.899> what

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
closest the hooking glass we had to what

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.300 
closest the hooking glass we had to what
he<00:01:51.470> used<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.300> he<00:01:53.300> said<00:01:53.539> like<00:01:53.830> twist<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.069> and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
he used so he said like twist it and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
he used so he said like twist it and
look<00:01:55.700> at<00:01:55.940> it<00:01:56.090> going<00:01:56.300> down<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.899> sides

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
look at it going down the sides

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.380 
look at it going down the sides
this<00:01:58.530> does<00:01:58.770> stick<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.370> sides<00:01:59.640> pretty<00:02:00.060> well

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
this does stick to the sides pretty well

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.070 
this does stick to the sides pretty well
so<00:02:01.290> must<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.070> least<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.460> decent<00:02:02.850> quality<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
so must be at least a decent quality the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.760 
so must be at least a decent quality the
bottle<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:05.190> on<00:02:05.369> sale<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.380> non<00:02:07.380> sale

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
bottle was on sale but the non sale

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.250 
bottle was on sale but the non sale
price<00:02:08.130> seemed<00:02:08.610> fairly<00:02:09.060> expensive<00:02:10.400> so

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
price seemed fairly expensive so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.180 
price seemed fairly expensive so
theoretically<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.319> higher<00:02:13.590> quality<00:02:14.130> of

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
theoretically a higher quality of

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.300 
theoretically a higher quality of
alcohol<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.300> that's<00:02:16.080> us<00:02:16.350> what's<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> smell

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
alcohol but that's us what's the smell

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
it in some following videos in some

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.230 
it in some following videos in some
margarita<00:04:31.360> mixtures<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:31.930> picked<00:04:32.200> up<00:04:32.380> but<00:04:33.240> I've

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
margarita mixtures we picked up but I've

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240 
margarita mixtures we picked up but I've
had<00:04:34.540> better<00:04:34.810> two<00:04:35.050> kilos<00:04:35.380> for<00:04:35.620> less<00:04:35.770> money<00:04:36.100> in

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
had better two kilos for less money in

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.430 
had better two kilos for less money in
my<00:04:36.430> opinion<00:04:36.910> I<00:04:37.420> think<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.880> think<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:41.230> was

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
my opinion I think so I think this was

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.530 
my opinion I think so I think this was
theoretically<00:04:42.070> in<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.340> fifty<00:04:42.700> dollar<00:04:42.910> bottom

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
theoretically in the fifty dollar bottom

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.900 
theoretically in the fifty dollar bottom
range<00:04:43.750> I<00:04:43.960> got<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:44.290> like<00:04:44.530> half<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.830> on<00:04:45.340> sale<00:04:45.640> I

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
range I got it like half that on sale I

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.480 
range I got it like half that on sale I
think<00:04:48.910> like<00:04:49.690> Don<00:04:49.990> Julio<00:04:50.290> or<00:04:50.710> something<00:04:51.130> for<00:04:51.430> a

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
think like Don Julio or something for a

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.720 
think like Don Julio or something for a
Blanco<00:04:52.330> which<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.200> usually<00:04:53.530> around<00:04:53.730> 4045

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
Blanco which is usually around 4045

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.880 
Blanco which is usually around 4045
something<00:04:55.660> like<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.380> tastes<00:04:56.710> much

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
something like that it tastes much

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.330 
something like that it tastes much
better<00:04:56.950> than<00:04:57.430> me<00:04:57.720> mm-hmm<00:04:58.860> so<00:04:59.860> as<00:05:00.070> far<00:05:00.280> as

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
better than me mm-hmm so as far as

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.880 
better than me mm-hmm so as far as
tequila's<00:05:00.940> go<00:05:01.180> out<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.660> 10<00:05:01.900> I'd<00:05:02.200> say<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.680> is

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
tequila's go out of 10 I'd say this is

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.300 
tequila's go out of 10 I'd say this is
probably<00:05:03.340> like<00:05:03.430> a<00:05:03.820> 5<00:05:04.770> it's<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.860> nice<00:05:06.040> looking

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
probably like a 5 it's a nice looking

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.610 
probably like a 5 it's a nice looking
bottle<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.530> don't<00:05:08.980> know<00:05:09.100> if<00:05:09.190> we<00:05:09.370> can<00:05:10.620> there

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
bottle but I don't know if we can there

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.480 
bottle but I don't know if we can there
we<00:05:11.770> go

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
we go

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.909 
we go
cool<00:05:13.450> bottle

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
cool bottle

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.189 
cool bottle
absolutely<00:05:15.699> I<00:05:15.849> think<00:05:16.150> packaging<00:05:16.689> has<00:05:16.870> a<00:05:16.930> lot

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
absolutely I think packaging has a lot

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.689 
absolutely I think packaging has a lot
to<00:05:17.349> do<00:05:17.499> with<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.770> reason<00:05:18.099> why<00:05:18.189> people<00:05:18.249> buy

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.899 
to do with the reason why people buy
things<00:05:18.759> and<00:05:19.449> this<00:05:20.169> has<00:05:20.919> a<00:05:20.949> really<00:05:21.310> nice<00:05:21.580> look

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
things and this has a really nice look

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.700 
things and this has a really nice look
to<00:05:21.939> it<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.539> kind<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:22.930> has<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.139> vintage<00:05:23.499> look

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
to it it kind of has a vintage look

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.140 
to it it kind of has a vintage look
right<00:05:24.699> and<00:05:25.199> network<00:05:26.199> top<00:05:26.909> absolutely<00:05:27.909> and

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
right and network top absolutely and

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.730 
right and network top absolutely and
there's<00:05:28.659> something<00:05:28.990> about<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.379> that<00:05:29.439> would

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
there's something about that that would

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.029 
there's something about that that would
really<00:05:30.039> appeal<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:31.289> bars<00:05:32.289> they're<00:05:32.650> trying<00:05:32.949> to

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
really appeal to bars they're trying to

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.489 
really appeal to bars they're trying to
recreate<00:05:33.460> that<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:34.180> then<00:05:34.689> could<00:05:34.870> feel<00:05:35.199> to

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:35.499 
recreate that and then could feel to

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.969 
recreate that and then could feel to
them<00:05:35.650> but<00:05:36.159> I<00:05:36.400> don't<00:05:37.590> necessarily<00:05:38.590> think<00:05:38.620> that

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
them but I don't necessarily think that

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.850 
them but I don't necessarily think that
it's<00:05:39.189> worth<00:05:39.580> the<00:05:39.759> price<00:05:40.029> I<00:05:40.509> think<00:05:41.409> that<00:05:41.680> it's

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
it's worth the price I think that it's

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.439 
it's worth the price I think that it's
interesting

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
interesting

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.450 
interesting
I<00:05:44.509> think<00:05:45.050> that<00:05:45.409> it's<00:05:45.559> just<00:05:46.039> a<00:05:46.279> little<00:05:46.639> bit<00:05:46.909> to

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
I think that it's just a little bit to

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.989 
I think that it's just a little bit to
gasoline

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999 
gasoline

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:56.170 
gasoline
yes<00:05:50.840> strong<00:05:52.059> for<00:05:53.059> me<00:05:53.740> there's<00:05:54.759> not<00:05:55.759> enough

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
yes strong for me there's not enough

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.260 
yes strong for me there's not enough
subtlety<00:05:56.839> of<00:05:56.870> flavor<00:05:57.199> for<00:05:57.559> me<00:05:57.620> but<00:05:58.460> you<00:05:59.089> might

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
subtlety of flavor for me but you might

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.869 
subtlety of flavor for me but you might
feel<00:05:59.449> differently<00:05:59.979> which<00:06:00.979> I<00:06:01.129> think<00:06:01.370> could

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 
feel differently which I think could

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.179 
feel differently which I think could
theoretically<00:06:02.300> be<00:06:02.599> good<00:06:02.960> in<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.319> margaritas

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189 
theoretically be good in that margaritas

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.719 
theoretically be good in that margaritas
I<00:06:05.080> think<00:06:06.080> it<00:06:06.229> might<00:06:06.439> disappear<00:06:07.279> into<00:06:07.550> the

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
I think it might disappear into the

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.510 
I think it might disappear into the
margarita<00:06:08.240> which<00:06:08.599> might<00:06:09.589> be<00:06:09.770> good<00:06:09.949> I<00:06:10.219> don't

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
margarita which might be good I don't

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.249 
margarita which might be good I don't
know<00:06:10.639> that's<00:06:11.029> gonna<00:06:11.330> try<00:06:11.659> you've<00:06:11.870> a<00:06:11.960> lot<00:06:12.110> of

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
know that's gonna try you've a lot of

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.739 
know that's gonna try you've a lot of
the<00:06:12.319> fruit<00:06:12.559> behind<00:06:12.889> so<00:06:13.849> watch<00:06:14.180> later<00:06:14.449> and

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:14.749 
the fruit behind so watch later and

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.129 
the fruit behind so watch later and
we'll<00:06:14.870> see<00:06:15.080> what<00:06:15.559> we<00:06:15.680> think<00:06:15.710> of<00:06:16.069> this<00:06:16.279> in<00:06:16.639> a

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
we'll see what we think of this in a

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.230 
we'll see what we think of this in a
margarita<00:06:18.139> and<00:06:18.620> if<00:06:19.189> you<00:06:19.400> don't<00:06:19.669> like<00:06:19.909> that<00:06:20.120> you

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
margarita and if you don't like that you

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.939 
margarita and if you don't like that you
have<00:06:20.419> to<00:06:20.449> wait<00:06:20.719> until<00:06:21.199> the<00:06:21.289> next<00:06:21.469> one<00:06:21.740> wall

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
have to wait until the next one wall

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.059 
have to wait until the next one wall
sorry<00:06:22.669> we<00:06:22.879> didn't<00:06:23.120> think<00:06:23.240> that<00:06:23.449> far<00:06:23.479> ahead<00:06:24.069> so

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069 
sorry we didn't think that far ahead so
