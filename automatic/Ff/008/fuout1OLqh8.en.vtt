00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.200
 and 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.760
 good kids I'm 188 and I almost get wet 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.560
 in this video we are going to talk about the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.720
 bones of cydia I already told you in a 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.580
 comment on facebook in the group that 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.080
 we have mandarin diamonds or 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.970
 with seconds that are not targeted by 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.890
 metals because we solve doubts we speak 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.330
 of many issues and well in this group 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.800
 I made a comment that I do not 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.840
 they bought the bones of cydia I 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.790
 I found on the beach looking 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.490
 we are here in the capital of turia is 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.620
 a beautiful day and we are walking around 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.350
 the beach with the family and finding 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.510
 your in dodges every 34 then the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.079
 two kilos we will have caught today as you see 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.159
 in the photos 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.809
 you see a lot of your decide who 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.770
 let's talk about the properties that 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.560
 have for our birds 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 they were mandarin diamonds are 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.030
 parakeets and nothing for my society what 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.430
 that is doing very well in a calcium 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.800
 they have phosphorus has mineral salts 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.210
 they have many good things the post 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.180
 of cydia very rich for them 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.430
 so let's talk about it the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.580
 main elements of cuttlefish bone 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.890
 are the following calcium carbonate 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.200
 sodium chloride calcium phosphate salts 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.610
 of magnesium and what is that good then 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.530
 so that we understand each other 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.540
 calcium and mineral salts calcium point 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.909
 cancer helped us to have bones 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.580
 strong because we the birds 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.140
 well up there good but to the birds 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.990
 it also helps them to have some sunsets 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.010
 more stronger in the eggs has a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.350
 harder shell and the little bird inside it 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.110
 develops a lot better as it is 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.400
 more acoustic then also 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.490
 it's going to get us two at least 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.200
 to the perfect year and what happens when 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.060
 the case the so-called soft egg what 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.250
 you have never heard because I only count the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.470
 soft egg that the egg that is not 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.890
 able to create the shell and it's never going to 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.899
 get ahead never why then because 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.540
 I know minerals salts 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.910
 minerals we will help 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.970
 our bird very much of the pen 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.200
 better very from the pen and you get one 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.880
 spectacular pen and have a lot of brightness 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.430
 a lot of brightness in blue that's going to do 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.190
 that our bird is precious 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.660
 Handsome handsome recommendation you have seen 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.090
 I've picked the bone by deciding 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.739
 serve them 10 minutes you kill me everything 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.630
 type of crap where does the 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.160
 boneless cuttlefish because I'm going to make it 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.160
 brief explanation when observing 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.430
 I have not finished are not malpensados 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.000
 men this is an idea a squid 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.000
 and now 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.730
 tent body and eyes angles 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.730
 the fiber bone where is 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.580
 here you see there is usually the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.400
 Breeding bones usually measure about 13 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.520
 centimeters since I've picked one of 20 to 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.050
 less than 20 20 centimeters and they come a 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.150
 little bit more in the cuttlefish bone 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.190
 has more has calcium has salts 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.640
 minerals and that I will tell you more 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.830
 so you know you have to go to the top 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.070
 You press click and here is the end 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.070
 video 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.440
