hey it's Gary working on a 1988 Yamaha

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.230 
hey it's Gary working on a 1988 Yamaha
50<00:00:05.759> horsepower<00:00:06.710> has<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> hard<00:00:08.340> start<00:00:08.700> problem

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
50 horsepower has a hard start problem

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.140 
50 horsepower has a hard start problem
and<00:00:09.889> if<00:00:10.889> it<00:00:11.040> does<00:00:11.190> start<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.700> might<00:00:11.849> run<00:00:12.090> up

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and if it does start it might run up

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
and if it does start it might run up
with<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.880> the<00:00:14.880> warm-up<00:00:15.210> lever<00:00:15.420> up<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.990> then

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
with the the warm-up lever up and then

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.620 
with the the warm-up lever up and then
once<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.070> go<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.220> drop<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> down<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> idle<00:00:18.240> just

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
once you go to drop it down to idle just

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.570 
once you go to drop it down to idle just
stall<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:19.109> sometimes<00:00:20.039> your<00:00:20.220> run<00:00:20.369> good

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
stall out sometimes your run good

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.509 
stall out sometimes your run good
sometimes<00:00:21.150> she<00:00:21.570> won't<00:00:21.840> run<00:00:22.050> good<00:00:22.369> the<00:00:23.369> whole

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
sometimes she won't run good the whole

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.450 
sometimes she won't run good the whole
problem<00:00:23.789> seems<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.920> there's<00:00:25.920> an<00:00:26.010> o-ring<00:00:26.130> in

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
problem seems to be there's an o-ring in

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.960 
problem seems to be there's an o-ring in
here<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.480> fuel<00:00:27.720> connector<00:00:28.369> not<00:00:29.369> exactly

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
here in the fuel connector not exactly

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.590 
here in the fuel connector not exactly
sure<00:00:30.269> if<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:32.090> it's<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
sure if you can see it but it's out of

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.350 
sure if you can see it but it's out of
the<00:00:33.690> groove<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.530> damaged<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.360> what's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the groove and it's damaged and what's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
the groove and it's damaged and what's
happening<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:36.989> leaking<00:00:37.350> air<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.950> it's

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
happening is it's leaking air so it's

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.150 
happening is it's leaking air so it's
getting<00:00:38.340> aerated<00:00:38.910> fuel<00:00:39.410> into<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.559> into<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
getting aerated fuel into the into the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.709 
getting aerated fuel into the into the
engine<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.910> closing<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.540> run

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
engine and it's closing it out to run

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.529 
engine and it's closing it out to run
right<00:00:42.930> also<00:00:43.920> there's<00:00:44.579> no<00:00:44.730> clamp<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.329> here

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
right also there's no clamp on here

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.060 
right also there's no clamp on here
there<00:00:45.719> should<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> clamp<00:00:46.350> holding<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.829> on

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
there should be a clamp holding this on

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.580 
there should be a clamp holding this on
so<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> start<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.899> suck<00:00:49.110> air<00:00:49.350> through

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
so you can start to suck air through

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
so you can start to suck air through
there<00:00:49.829> again<00:00:49.860> aerating<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.700> fuel<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.379> at

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
there again aerating the fuel and at

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
there again aerating the fuel and at
high<00:00:52.530> speed<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.160> you're<00:00:53.280> running<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.960> running

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
high speed if you're running a running

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.840 
high speed if you're running a running
aerated<00:00:55.469> fuel<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.460> really<00:00:56.730> do

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
aerated fuel in there you can really do

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.720 
aerated fuel in there you can really do
some<00:00:57.090> serious<00:00:57.960> damage<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> motor<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
some serious damage to the motor so you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
some serious damage to the motor so you
want<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> make<00:01:00.120> sure<00:01:00.270> these<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.690> sealed<00:01:00.930> tight

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
want to make sure these are sealed tight

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.349 
want to make sure these are sealed tight
and<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.440> o-ring<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> we're<00:01:03.329> just

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and that o-ring is good so we're just

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.719 
and that o-ring is good so we're just
going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> change<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.199> quick<00:01:04.920> disconnect

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
going to change this quick disconnect

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.350 
going to change this quick disconnect
this<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> tank<00:01:06.720> end<00:01:07.850> clamp<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
this is on the tank end clamp this and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.320 
this is on the tank end clamp this and
we'll<00:01:09.840> give<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> shot<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:13.790> got<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> end<00:01:15.090> off

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
we'll give it a shot I got the end off

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
we'll give it a shot I got the end off
in<00:01:15.509> another<00:01:15.659> problem<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.229> noticed<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.909> don't

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
in another problem I noticed I don't

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.780 
in another problem I noticed I don't
know<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.049> but

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
know if you can see that in there but

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.980 
know if you can see that in there but
I'm<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.939> cut<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> off<00:01:21.360> maybe<00:01:21.630> give<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I'm going to cut it off maybe give you

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
I'm going to cut it off maybe give you
better<00:01:22.200> view<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.710> inner<00:01:22.890> lining<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> hose

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
better view the inner lining of the hose

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
better view the inner lining of the hose
is<00:01:23.909> collapsed<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.750> slid<00:01:25.049> down<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
is collapsed and it's slid down it's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039 
is collapsed and it's slid down it's
blocking<00:01:26.070> blocking<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.390> passage<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
blocking blocking the passage of this

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:38.320 
blocking blocking the passage of this
thing<00:01:28.520> let<00:01:29.520> me<00:01:29.610> snip<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.970> off<00:01:30.060> real<00:01:30.299> quick

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.580 

that<00:01:39.330> lining<00:01:40.460> had<00:01:41.460> pushed<00:01:41.760> down<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.350> see

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that lining had pushed down you can see

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
that lining had pushed down you can see
right<00:01:43.770> there<00:01:43.830> where<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> had<00:01:44.550> crimped<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> was

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
right there where it had crimped it was

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.110 
right there where it had crimped it was
blocking<00:01:46.140> inside<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> hose<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:48.979> so

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
blocking inside the hose like that so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.750 
blocking inside the hose like that so
I'm<00:01:51.120> gonna<00:01:51.210> want<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.510> fix<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
I'm gonna want to fix that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.370 
I'm gonna want to fix that
all<00:01:53.760> right<00:01:53.910> so<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.420> replace<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:57.290> connector<00:01:58.290> at

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
all right so we replace the connector at

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.950 
all right so we replace the connector at
the<00:01:58.500> end<00:01:58.650> of<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.920> fuel<00:01:59.460> line<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.940> cut<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the end of the fuel line and cut the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.390 
the end of the fuel line and cut the
line<00:02:01.140> back<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> little

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
line back because it was a little

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.030 
line back because it was a little
damaged<00:02:02.820> inside<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> new<00:02:04.140> clamp<00:02:04.470> on<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
damaged inside put a new clamp on it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.359 
damaged inside put a new clamp on it
pump<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.420> here's<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> final

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
pump it up and here's the is the final

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.680 
pump it up and here's the is the final
results<00:02:14.000> doesn't<00:02:15.000> start<00:02:15.239> any<00:02:15.360> better<00:02:15.540> than

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
results doesn't start any better than

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750 
results doesn't start any better than
that
