00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
well you want to learn the backflip 360

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
well you want to learn the backflip 360
a<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:07.440> learn<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> backflip<00:01:08.130> 360

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
a here it is to learn the backflip 360

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
a here it is to learn the backflip 360
you<00:01:08.940> need<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> learn<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.630> things<00:01:09.659> two

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
prerequisites which is a normal backflip

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.450 
prerequisites which is a normal backflip
make<00:01:16.259> sure<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.649> lots<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.009> height<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
make sure you get lots of height on it

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.240 
make sure you get lots of height on it
okay<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.300> need<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.690> that<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.680> second<00:01:20.100> one

okay you need to do that the second one
is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.670> back<00:01:21.000> layout<00:01:21.299> now<00:01:21.690> make<00:01:21.899> sure<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
is a back layout now make sure that you

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.190 
is a back layout now make sure that you
stay<00:01:22.830> nice<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.630> straight<00:01:24.630> throughout<00:01:25.049> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
stay nice and straight throughout this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.020 
stay nice and straight throughout this
whole<00:01:25.440> backflip<00:01:25.890> okay<00:01:26.159> look<00:01:26.700> something<00:01:27.000> like

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
whole backflip okay look something like

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.210 
whole backflip okay look something like
this

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.590 

okay<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.280> after<00:01:32.759> you've<00:01:33.060> gotten<00:01:33.300> those<00:01:33.360> two

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
okay so after you've gotten those two

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080 
okay so after you've gotten those two
prerequisites<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.590> perfectly<00:01:35.190> what<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
prerequisites down perfectly what you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.149 
prerequisites down perfectly what you
want<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.330> do<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.690> actually<00:01:36.960> learn<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.470> twist

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
want to do is actually learn the twist

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.240 
want to do is actually learn the twist
so<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.929> a<00:01:39.960> twist<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.649> you<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.070> is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so to do a twist what you want to do is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
so to do a twist what you want to do is
start<00:01:41.490> off<00:01:41.580> like<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.789> normal<00:01:41.880> backflip<00:01:42.539> so

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
start off like a normal backflip so

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.649 
start off like a normal backflip so
start<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:44.009> when<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.490> come<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.700> delay<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
start here and when you come up delay it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.090 
start here and when you come up delay it
and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.289> when<00:01:46.440> you're<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> top<00:01:46.920> your

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and then when you're at the top your

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
and then when you're at the top your
jump<00:01:47.340> punch<00:01:47.970> your<00:01:48.149> armpit<00:01:48.509> which<00:01:48.990> will

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
jump punch your armpit which will

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.710 
jump punch your armpit which will
actually<00:01:49.530> start<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.100> rotation<00:01:50.670> okay<00:01:51.659> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
actually start the rotation okay so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.590 
actually start the rotation okay so
after<00:01:52.140> you've<00:01:52.560> gotten<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.580> twist<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
after you've gotten the twist what you

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.270 
after you've gotten the twist what you
want<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.380> learn<00:01:55.770> how<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:55.979> come<00:01:56.190> out

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
want to do is then learn how to come out

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.919 
want to do is then learn how to come out
and<00:01:56.429> land<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.569> know<00:01:57.750> that

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
and land because if you don't know that

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.359 
and land because if you don't know that
you're<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.319> seriously<00:01:59.159> injure

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you're going to seriously injure

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.580 
you're going to seriously injure
yourself<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.090> basically<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.170> keep<00:02:01.409> your

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
yourself so basically just keep your

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
yourself so basically just keep your
eyes<00:02:01.710> open<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.159> whole<00:02:02.310> time<00:02:02.340> you'll<00:02:03.030> see<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
eyes open the whole time you'll see the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.550 
eyes open the whole time you'll see the
ground<00:02:03.570> coming<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.049> when<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
ground coming and when you see the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.499 
ground coming and when you see the
ground<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.579> stretch<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.119> legs<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
ground just out stretch your legs and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.109 
ground just out stretch your legs and
you'll<00:02:06.930> land<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.950> simple<00:02:08.280> okay<00:02:09.060> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you'll land it that's simple okay so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.630 
you'll land it that's simple okay so
here's<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.989> example<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> backflip<00:02:10.979> 360<00:02:11.190> or

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
here's an example of the backflip 360 or

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.660 
here's an example of the backflip 360 or
a<00:02:11.700> back<00:02:11.910> full<00:02:12.799> I'll<00:02:13.799> do<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.430> from

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
a back full I'll do this one from

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.130 
a back full I'll do this one from
straight<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.329> then<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.660> next<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.049> will

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
straight on and then the next one will

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.920 
straight on and then the next one will
be<00:02:16.170> from<00:02:16.320> assigning<00:02:16.860> slow<00:02:17.400> motion<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.690> here<00:02:18.870> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
be from assigning slow motion so here it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:31.690 
be from assigning slow motion so here it
is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.949 

okay<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.209> have<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.599> basic

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
okay so now you have the basic

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.190 
okay so now you have the basic
fundamentals<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.890> backfill<00:02:35.250> 260<00:02:35.879> so<00:02:36.420> just

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
fundamentals of the backfill 260 so just

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.839 
fundamentals of the backfill 260 so just
keep<00:02:37.349> practicing<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.129> you'll<00:02:38.640> eventually

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
keep practicing and you'll eventually

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.220 
keep practicing and you'll eventually
get<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.870> quite<00:02:40.019> simple

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.180
