00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
comes out then and all of a sudden it's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810 
comes out then and all of a sudden it's
a<00:01:51.600> clusterfuck<00:01:52.079> mix<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.860> terminator<00:01:53.280> 1<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> 2

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
a clusterfuck mix of terminator 1 and 2

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.910 
a clusterfuck mix of terminator 1 and 2
where<00:01:54.240> everyone's<00:01:54.780> sending<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.350> multiple

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
where everyone's sending back multiple

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.300 
where everyone's sending back multiple
terminators<00:01:56.430> back<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.509> point<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:58.310> maybe

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
terminators back to the point of maybe

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
terminators back to the point of maybe
after<00:01:59.790> terminator<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.509> before

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
after terminator one but before

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.319 
after terminator one but before
terminator<00:02:01.229> 2<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.890> seems<00:02:02.640> they<00:02:02.909> send<00:02:03.149> back

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
terminator 2 it seems they send back

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.020 
terminator 2 it seems they send back
another<00:02:03.990> Arnold<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:05.399> maybe<00:02:05.579> there's<00:02:05.939> still

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
another Arnold but maybe there's still

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059 
another Arnold but maybe there's still
the<00:02:06.240> Arnold<00:02:06.570> t800<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.259> existed<00:02:07.710> still<00:02:07.920> who's

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the Arnold t800 that existed still who's

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.969 
the Arnold t800 that existed still who's
older<00:02:08.550> they<00:02:09.060> send<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.420> another<00:02:09.739> t1000<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
older they send back another t1000 as a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.370 
older they send back another t1000 as a
cop<00:02:11.730> with<00:02:11.910> liquid<00:02:12.239> metal

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
cop with liquid metal

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.740 
cop with liquid metal
and<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.860> looks<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.910> remake<00:02:15.390> about

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and it looks like to me a remake about

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.470 
and it looks like to me a remake about
Terminator<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:16.500> into<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.520> tons<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.000> action

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
Terminator one into with tons of action

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600 
Terminator one into with tons of action
with<00:02:19.020> set<00:02:19.290> pieces<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.860> look<00:02:19.890> exactly<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
with set pieces that look exactly the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.730 
with set pieces that look exactly the
same<00:02:20.730> as<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> first<00:02:21.630> two<00:02:21.900> movies<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
same as the first two movies and the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.400 
same as the first two movies and the
first<00:02:22.980> thing<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.250> saw<00:02:23.490> thought<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.410> really

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
first thing I saw thought was I really

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.680 
first thing I saw thought was I really
have<00:02:25.620> no<00:02:25.890> inclination<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.700> saying<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.210> movie

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
have no inclination of saying this movie

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.660 
have no inclination of saying this movie
at<00:02:27.810> all<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:28.530> sounds<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.250> rehash

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
at all it sounds like they they rehash

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
at all it sounds like they they rehash
the<00:02:29.910> other<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:30.210> movies<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.630> much<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.170> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
the other two movies so much that it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.310 
the other two movies so much that it
really<00:02:32.010> became<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.480> definition<00:02:33.690> of

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
really became this is the definition of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.350 
really became this is the definition of
an<00:02:34.470> unnecessary<00:02:35.190> sequel<00:02:35.700> right<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:36.270> you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
an unnecessary sequel right when you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.240 
an unnecessary sequel right when you
literally<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.140> same<00:02:37.380> plot<00:02:37.770> elements

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
literally have the same plot elements

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.640 
literally have the same plot elements
from<00:02:38.370> Terminator<00:02:38.910> 1<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.300> 2<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.320> same

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650

somehow<00:03:04.950> also<00:03:05.430> i<00:03:05.460> guess<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.210> we're<00:03:06.390> still

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
somehow also i guess it's we're still

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.820 
somehow also i guess it's we're still
five<00:03:06.750> or<00:03:06.870> six<00:03:07.020> months<00:03:07.170> out<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.380> movie<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
five or six months out in the movie the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.860 
five or six months out in the movie the
t1000<00:03:08.640> effects<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.000> liquid<00:03:09.210> metal<00:03:09.450> didn't

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
t1000 effects of liquid metal didn't

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.350 
t1000 effects of liquid metal didn't
look<00:03:09.960> any<00:03:10.140> better<00:03:10.380> than<00:03:10.680> 1991<00:03:11.580> somehow<00:03:11.910> but

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
look any better than 1991 somehow but

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.910 
look any better than 1991 somehow but
that's<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:12.630> that's<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:13.560> shows<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.890> just

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
that's but that's that shows you just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.650 
that's but that's that shows you just
how<00:03:14.130> well<00:03:14.760> i<00:03:14.790> guess<00:03:15.030> james<00:03:15.240> cameron<00:03:15.570> was

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
how well i guess james cameron was

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.480 
how well i guess james cameron was
