00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
long blocking wire along the edge

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.120 
long blocking wire along the edge
it<00:00:16.270> would<00:00:16.450> be<00:00:16.600> the<00:00:16.630> same<00:00:17.020> if<00:00:17.290> it<00:00:17.620> were<00:00:17.770> a<00:00:17.800> ribbed

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
it would be the same if it were a ribbed

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.970 
it would be the same if it were a ribbed
edge<00:00:18.430> or<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.820> garter<00:00:19.360> stitch<00:00:19.600> edge<00:00:19.980> this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
edge or a garter stitch edge this

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.910 
edge or a garter stitch edge this
sweater<00:00:21.369> happens<00:00:22.000> to<00:00:22.180> be<00:00:22.300> an<00:00:22.420> i-cord<00:00:22.810> edge<00:00:23.050> so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
sweater happens to be an i-cord edge so

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.820 
sweater happens to be an i-cord edge so
I<00:00:23.950> can<00:00:24.340> run<00:00:24.610> it<00:00:24.760> right<00:00:25.000> through<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.630> middle

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
I can run it right through the middle

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.070 
I can run it right through the middle
but<00:00:26.830> if<00:00:27.010> it<00:00:27.160> were<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.310> garter<00:00:27.820> stitch<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.450> would

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
but if it were a garter stitch I would

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.140 
but if it were a garter stitch I would
run<00:00:29.290> it<00:00:29.439> through<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.890> stitches<00:00:30.160> along<00:00:30.700> the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
run it through the stitches along the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.220 
run it through the stitches along the
edge<00:00:32.010> the<00:00:33.010> blocking<00:00:33.489> wires<00:00:33.840> make<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.080> edge

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
edge the blocking wires make the edge

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.770 
edge the blocking wires make the edge
more<00:00:35.650> stable<00:00:36.220> so<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.090> fabric<00:00:37.300> doesn't

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
more stable so the fabric doesn't

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.070 
more stable so the fabric doesn't
distort<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:38.590> you<00:00:39.489> won't<00:00:40.180> end<00:00:40.449> up<00:00:40.690> with<00:00:41.050> a

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
distort and you won't end up with a

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.479 
distort and you won't end up with a
wobbly<00:00:41.620> edge<00:00:41.739> afterwards<00:00:43.710> when<00:00:44.710> we<00:00:44.949> weave<00:00:45.190> our

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
wobbly edge afterwards when we weave our

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.259 
wobbly edge afterwards when we weave our
blocking<00:00:45.760> wires<00:00:46.090> in<00:00:46.510> we<00:00:46.989> lay<00:00:47.230> our<00:00:47.350> zip<00:00:47.590> or<00:00:47.769> down

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
blocking wires in we lay our zip or down

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.990 
blocking wires in we lay our zip or down
so<00:00:49.269> that<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.510> front<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.890> zipper<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.460> face

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
so that the front of the zipper is face
