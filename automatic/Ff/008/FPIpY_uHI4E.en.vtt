00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
protection now installation is fairly

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.049 
protection now installation is fairly
easy<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.739> case<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.160> rigid<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> want

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
easy but this case is rigid so you want

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.850 
easy but this case is rigid so you want
to<00:00:45.120> install<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.570> button<00:00:45.930> sign<00:00:46.170> first

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to install it button sign first

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
to install it button sign first
now<00:00:47.280> once<00:00:47.550> installed<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> case<00:00:48.239> feels<00:00:48.510> pretty

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
now once installed the case feels pretty

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
now once installed the case feels pretty
snug<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.410> no<00:00:49.559> movement<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.280> creaking<00:00:50.730> or

snug with no movement or creaking or

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
snug with no movement or creaking or
flexing<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> looking<00:00:52.230> around<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> see

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
flexing and looking around we can see

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.920 
flexing and looking around we can see
that<00:00:53.039> we<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.579> average<00:00:54.149> sized<00:00:54.420> counts

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that we have these average sized counts

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.840 
that we have these average sized counts
for<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> bottom<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> bottom<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.459 
for the bottom on the bottom for all the
ports<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:57.930> let's<00:00:58.050> feel<00:00:58.199> pretty

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
ports so the kind let's feel pretty

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
ports so the kind let's feel pretty
sturdy<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.010> minimal<00:00:59.430> flexing<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> don't

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
sturdy with minimal flexing so you don't

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.729 
sturdy with minimal flexing so you don't
have<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> worry<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:00.690> deformation<00:01:01.590> over

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
have to worry about deformation over

have to worry about deformation over
time<00:01:02.039> now<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> side<00:01:03.120> we'll<00:01:03.300> find<00:01:03.539> our

flush volume controls which operate
easily<00:01:06.000> through<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.270> case<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.110> are<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> little

easily through the case but are a little
harder<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:07.979> feel<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.670> because<00:01:09.000> they<00:01:09.119> are

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
harder to feel for because they are

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.940 
harder to feel for because they are
flush<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> same<00:01:10.380> story<00:01:10.619> with<00:01:10.770> a

roomy cutout for the mute switch so it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
camera flash black or glare issues with

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.160 
camera flash black or glare issues with
this<00:01:34.890> camera<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> front<00:01:36.630> we'll<00:01:36.900> find

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
this camera now on the front we'll find

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
this camera now on the front we'll find
a<00:01:37.320> modest<00:01:37.799> lip<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> lay<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.610> table<00:01:39.030> design

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
a modest lip for a lay on table design

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.789 
a modest lip for a lay on table design
so<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.869> lay<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> flat<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> table

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so you can lay this flat on the table

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.490 
so you can lay this flat on the table
without<00:01:41.100> scratching<00:01:41.460> your<00:01:41.880> glass<00:01:42.240> screen<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
without scratching your glass screen the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200 
without scratching your glass screen the
rear<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> case<00:01:44.130> does<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> lay<00:01:45.119> on

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
rear of the case does not have a lay on

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.639 
rear of the case does not have a lay on
table<00:01:45.479> design<00:01:45.750> which<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.079> unfortunate

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
table design which is unfortunate

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080 
table design which is unfortunate
because<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.979> might<00:01:47.130> help<00:01:47.310> protect<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> back

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because it might help protect the back

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
because it might help protect the back
panel<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:48.720> scratching<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
panel from scratching and that's the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.620 
panel from scratching and that's the
biggest<00:01:50.250> issue<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.329> case

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
biggest issue I have with this case

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510 
biggest issue I have with this case
which<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.200> fact<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.100> clear<00:01:53.340> back

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
which is the fact that the clear back

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.249 
which is the fact that the clear back
panel<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.299> resist<00:01:54.630> scratching<00:01:55.140> or

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
panel does not resist scratching or

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
panel does not resist scratching or
scuffing<00:01:55.619> very<00:01:55.860> well<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.369> after<00:01:56.490> only<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.880> few

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
scuffing very well and after only a few

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.539 
scuffing very well and after only a few
days<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.409> case<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.799> looking<00:01:59.159> pretty

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
days of use the case is looking pretty

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
days of use the case is looking pretty
rough<00:01:59.820> especially<00:02:00.119> under<00:02:00.540> these<00:02:00.689> bright

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
rough especially under these bright

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.569 
rough especially under these bright
lights<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.680> can't<00:02:01.890> imagine<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.399> case

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
lights so I can't imagine what this case

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.910 
lights so I can't imagine what this case
will<00:02:02.729> look<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.119> after<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.719> year<00:02:04.350> but

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
will look like after a year but

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380 
will look like after a year but
generally<00:02:05.490> speaking<00:02:05.549> under<00:02:06.210> normal

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
generally speaking under normal

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180 
generally speaking under normal
conditions<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.110> won't<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.770> scratching

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
conditions you won't know so scratching

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
conditions you won't know so scratching
this<00:02:08.310> much<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> end<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> definitely

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this much so in the end I definitely

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.229 
this much so in the end I definitely
like<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.530> case<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.550> slim

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
like this case because it's a very slim

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.790 
like this case because it's a very slim
case<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.110> provides<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.500> enough

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
case I think it provides just enough

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
case I think it provides just enough
shock<00:02:13.860> protection<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.760> softer<00:02:15.209> bumper

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
shock protection with that softer bumper

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.479 
shock protection with that softer bumper
like<00:02:15.870> material<00:02:16.349> around<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> edge<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.280> so

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
like material around the edge of it so

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.949 
like material around the edge of it so
again<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.000> very<00:02:18.030> similar<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.750> Apple

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
again it's very similar to the Apple

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.960 
again it's very similar to the Apple
bumper<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.890> they've<00:02:20.010> added<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.370> clear<00:02:20.670> plastic

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
bumper but they've added a clear plastic

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550 
bumper but they've added a clear plastic
screen<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.720> back<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.050> protect<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
screen on the back to protect the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.770 
screen on the back to protect the
delicate<00:02:23.099> surface<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.030> iPhone<00:02:24.390> 5<00:02:24.660> you

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
delicate surface of the iPhone 5 you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.910 
delicate surface of the iPhone 5 you
definitely<00:02:25.080> don't<00:02:25.140> want<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.379> scratch<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
definitely don't want to scratch the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770 
definitely don't want to scratch the
back<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> iPhone<00:02:26.580> 5<00:02:26.910> especially<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.569> if

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
back of the iPhone 5 especially that if

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.900 
back of the iPhone 5 especially that if
you<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> black<00:02:28.379> version<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.670> otherwise

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
you have the black version but otherwise

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.940 
you have the black version but otherwise
the<00:02:30.090> case<00:02:30.239> has<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> nice<00:02:30.690> rippable<00:02:31.290> texture<00:02:31.769> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the case has a nice rippable texture to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.830 
the case has a nice rippable texture to
it<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.310> buttons<00:02:32.640> feel<00:02:32.819> pretty<00:02:33.330> nice<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.690> mean

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
it the buttons feel pretty nice I mean

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.270 
it the buttons feel pretty nice I mean
you<00:02:33.959> can<00:02:34.080> operate<00:02:34.410> them<00:02:34.590> assuming<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.099> can

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
you can operate them assuming you can

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.400 
you can operate them assuming you can
find<00:02:35.550> them<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.269> know<00:02:36.690> there's<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.260> much

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
find them you know there's not as much

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.040 
find them you know there's not as much
feel<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.610> side<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:38.879> it<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.239> feel<00:02:39.720> for<00:02:39.900> those

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
feel on the side of it to feel for those

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.420 
feel on the side of it to feel for those
volume<00:02:40.290> controls<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> sleep/wake

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
volume controls and the sleep/wake

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.559 
volume controls and the sleep/wake
button<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.180> know<00:02:42.300> where<00:02:42.450> they<00:02:42.540> are

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
button but if you know where they are

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.780 
button but if you know where they are
it's<00:02:42.959> not<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> big<00:02:43.410> deal<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.640> case

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it's not a big deal so I think the case

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.759 
it's not a big deal so I think the case
is<00:02:44.819> pretty<00:02:45.090> sharp<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:45.510> only<00:02:45.629> $19.99<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.650> get

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
is pretty sharp for only $19.99 you get

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.800 
is pretty sharp for only $19.99 you get
plenty<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.129> color<00:02:47.340> options<00:02:47.970> pretty<00:02:48.330> minimal

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
plenty of color options pretty minimal

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.839 
plenty of color options pretty minimal
pretty<00:02:49.050> thin<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.709> does<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.250> job<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.489> me

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
pretty thin and does the job for me

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.820 
pretty thin and does the job for me
so<00:02:51.090> that's<00:02:51.629> gonna<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:52.050> me<00:02:52.110> guys<00:02:52.260> thanks

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830
