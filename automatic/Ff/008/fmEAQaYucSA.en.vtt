00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 best 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.880
 it's not me 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.490
 I am 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.010
 and is that for kids here louis with 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.700
 the series of how to make a good house in 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.070
 minecraft and tell you that this occasion is 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.419
 the one on the other time the other time 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.629
 I was wrong with the house or it says one 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.340
 truffle with which I am repeating it and 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.769
 what I have done the truth is that I do not 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.960
 it happens a lot but it's fine that is 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.690
 all right 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 and good to have done a building with 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.010
 with quite high iron 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 and I've put some torches so that there 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.489
 light because otherwise there would be no up 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.230
 what I have done is very easy to do this 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.379
 is to put a block to put another one over 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 put one beside and remove 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.590
 that go doing as well as making a 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.420
 pyramid and pretty cool then I have done 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.300
 here and I've put the torches like I've 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.890
 said and good and you will see they have some 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.970
 what is that what is that is an elevator 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 to get to the top I'm going to 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.270
 try it now for the first time 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.230
 see you up and let a 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.040
 chest 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.510
 and has to pay attention to what I have 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.810
 done here is a bullshit the truth 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.810
 but 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.340
 but let's change 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.230
 let's change for example this 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.450
 and this way 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.770
 to the guides that give you a lot more 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.770
 speed because if not 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 how not 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.050
 in this video you will see another intro 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.330
 I probably do not know why because I have 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.760
 a friend called albert laugh who 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.550
 has done an intro and well I want to get 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.850
 the good in some video was going to play in 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.760
 this 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.860
 with which you will surely have it 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.560
 pretty cool 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.550
 you have in this video maybe today 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.060
 Thursday , July 14 , maybe you have two 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.210
 videos and not even anything that has the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.520
 software is everything 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.520
 then you have to tender push 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.370
 big the wagon by the descent not 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.970
 established 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.490
 we could the idea was this was to push 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:05.000
 9 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:05.000
 and here I stay here 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.780
 and get off 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.489
 Well the truth is that it is very currada 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.709
 but this house is pretty good for 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.950
 make it a server now it would just be missing 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.670
 do 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:25.150
 a place like for the table 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.150
 to enchant objects and such 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.750
 I did not want to 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.630
 and here we will put a 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.530
 of joy because it is not be and they told me 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.530
 that works better 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.830
 this 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.230
 about that and here in front 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.380
 because you want to try style 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.069
 I will go 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.749
 come 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.950
 and well this is all for the video I should 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.889
 do a few minecraft and has 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.420
 finished the series as you see and nothing 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.780
