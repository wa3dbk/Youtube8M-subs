00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.600 
in any FIFA but this year he's just
dominant<00:05:06.199> look<00:05:06.440> at<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.800> shields<00:05:07.430> off<00:05:07.580> a

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
dominant look at that shields off a

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.150 
dominant look at that shields off a
defender<00:05:07.910> what<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> shot<00:05:09.110> to<00:05:09.410> soar<00:05:09.680> over<00:05:10.039> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
defender what a shot to soar over the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.300 
defender what a shot to soar over the

a<00:05:38.690> try<00:05:38.960> he<00:05:39.169> is<00:05:39.349> so<00:05:39.710> much<00:05:39.979> fun<00:05:40.280> to<00:05:40.310> use<00:05:40.580> hazard

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
a try he is so much fun to use hazard

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.480 
a try he is so much fun to use hazard
was<00:05:41.660> a<00:05:41.690> no-show<00:05:42.110> this<00:05:42.560> game<00:05:42.770> as<00:05:42.950> well<00:05:43.130> didn't

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
was a no-show this game as well didn't

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.430 
was a no-show this game as well didn't
really<00:05:43.669> get<00:05:43.789> them<00:05:43.910> involved<00:05:44.210> but<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:44.960> think

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
really get them involved but I think

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.140 
really get them involved but I think
it's<00:05:45.620> because<00:05:45.770> I<00:05:46.010> haven't<00:05:46.400> gone<00:05:46.700> into<00:05:46.940> the

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
it's because I haven't gone into the

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.240 
it's because I haven't gone into the
instruction<00:05:47.810> menu<00:05:48.169> as<00:05:48.320> I<00:05:48.349> mentioned<00:05:48.919> in<00:05:49.099> the
