00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.580

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.390
 let's have fun killing zombies 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.310
 well here says a discount of torrents 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.670
 I do not know what the fuck it means, it does not do anything 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.680
 English 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.690
 good here brings us the badge error 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.010

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.280
 delayed and the original is 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.540
 orange as you can see there 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.460
 good here tells us a player network 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.530
 players or be played to play the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.009
 multiplayer say from 2 to 16 players 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.860
 pretty good 2 is required as 5 gb 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.340
 to save the data of this game 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.649
 enough since for example in what is 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.070
 modern warfare 3 for example requires 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.930
 of 50 megs gentlemen so pretty 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.470
 it must be a pretty long game I do not know 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.420
 that is but not the resolution like that 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.970
 I was shocked a little by saying that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.729
 way it impacted me because it reaches up to 720 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.120
 p singer yosano 1080 as they usually arrive 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.060
 all games reach up to 720 p 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.530
 so, well, I think it's good 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.830

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.950

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.880
