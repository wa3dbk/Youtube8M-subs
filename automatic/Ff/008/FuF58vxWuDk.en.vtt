my kitchens in pretty good shape I'm

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.680 
my kitchens in pretty good shape I'm
somewhat<00:00:45.629> minimalist<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> kitchen<00:00:46.980> but

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
somewhat minimalist in the kitchen but

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
somewhat minimalist in the kitchen but
it's<00:00:48.800> it<00:00:49.800> gets<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.489> hand<00:00:50.789> once<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> while

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it's it gets out of hand once in a while

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.939

I<00:00:51.510> mean<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.379> isn't<00:00:52.680> something<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:54.230> is<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
I mean this isn't something that is the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.970 
I mean this isn't something that is the
fix<00:00:56.250> which<00:00:56.910> then<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> stay<00:00:58.590> after<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
to maybe it's to get nut meat salad or

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.600 
to maybe it's to get nut meat salad or
right<00:04:41.950> but<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.190> don't<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.520> actually<00:04:44.610> right
