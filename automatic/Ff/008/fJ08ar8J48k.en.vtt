00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello today, a little video here 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.490
 about 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.900
 so see asthma I use let's say so 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.900
 for lubricating your feet 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.580
 the main thing that I have bought 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.689
 I use it like this pillow 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.420
 co2 Polish production in principle 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.530
 quite normal thing as i thought how 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.840
 when gu mvd that is usually a balloon with 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.090
 shortness of breath 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.430
 tube for hard to reach places scheme 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.530
 just like a spray 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.560
 spray that is well with that i think 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.780
 especially focus on this is not 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.150
 It is worth it all I think a lot of people use 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.340
 wadshka 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:57.010
 what i would like to accentuate a little 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:01.310
 as if attention is to 2 lubricants 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.110
 which I use and it means 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:10.070
 a little background of what it all went 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.950
 I once looked at the Sasha channel returned 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.800
 video about those grease that he 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.610
 enjoys this in the comments 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.580
 such a question was 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.890
 why do not use graphite grease 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:32.030
 come as if sasha also asked 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.820
 he used or not here he somehow else 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.670
 did not get to this, you can, I decided 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.810
 buy try what kind of lubricant 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.430
 such graphite 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.720
 and actually asked how people in 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:52.790
 basically find a common density and to 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:56.510
 grease like a joke but here's a part let's say 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.930
 where lubrication is required i.e. it is 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.610
 very thick it would have to be taken apart 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.370
 as a result, I walked around the shops 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.560
 ran but I'm not far from here 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.960
 spare parts shop is for 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.130
 motorists and did not find there such 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:20.960
 here's a graphite grease spray from and in 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.720
 I decided to buy a principle, I'll try 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.580
 a little so according to the characteristics of say 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.510
 so who cares well let's say it 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.060
 grease and used in the range 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.020
 temperatures from minus 20 to plus 70 then 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.080
 there is in principle covers everything as it were 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.250
 let's say how the temperature 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.100
 such niches in which you can 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.370
 use your knife is not the same what 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:51.060
 not least personal matches the spray 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.470
 because well, very comfortable already one 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.489
 a knife greased here with this grease and 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.140
 honestly the effect is very me 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:04.760
 I liked the bottle of 140 milliliters 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.760
 and in principle there is like ours 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.950
 Belarusian money is also worth only 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.769
 32,000 then in principle it is not in principle 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.640
 it is very cheap and shows we donâ€™t 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.930
 very good 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:23.370
 at the same time there is fine 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.620
 graphite that is, but as it is written on 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.630
 the jar itself, that is, anyone interested 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.430
 can buy read try before 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.680
 using shake somewhere around 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.010
 1 minute to eat this sediment 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.350
 graphite to rise normally and you can 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.420
 it was already later 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:48.630
 actually produce the lubrication itself 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.850
 how could such a nuance also be here who 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.780
 buys maybe then reads well or in 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:59.459
 In principle, I will now tell all these 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.760
 here supplements that they are here 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.340
 over time as it were 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.930
 evaporate weathered off ie they are not 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.340
 still it remains, as it were myself and the graphite 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.019
 have it erode nothing 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.590
 erased in remains in that evil and in 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.940
 which you own fondled with butter 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.130
 so it's pretty long there 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.880
 keeps and shows itself very well 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:28.220
 and lubricating this grease this one 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:31.430
 man is gas 704 when buying from him 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.380
 was pretty tight move and decided not to 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.220
 regulate it that is a lot today 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:41.330
 twist anything just applied 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.960
 grease on the axial screw tube 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.600
 bundled there is there it all squirted with 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.960
 one from the second side well should 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:58.130
 lie down for a few days, that is, the principle of 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.490
 normal move became with a little that's 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.110
 it opens but slightly yanked it 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.940
 normal fold smoother 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.750
 softer how I feel not 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.630
 I argue but still, let's say no 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.599
 It is of course necessary to compare the ganza there with 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.639
 eminent some firms but in 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.860
 general hots in general is a little bit 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.380
 tugovat by their masters what was it 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.770
 really big difference my noticed 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.710
 account on it a grease a couple of days I lay down 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.169
 then we sort of make it so 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.620
 was driving around but I was like a little bit I still 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:37.610
 visited us in the evening pampered 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:41.410
 clicked on opened and in the end fine 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:45.139
 that so basically who cares 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.030
 can try to buy it seems to me 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:53.539
 quite good excuse will be for a knife 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:56.599
 at least not for the blade to protect 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:59.360
 against specific corrosion for softness 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:04.389
 this for smoothness seems to me 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:08.930
 will be what you need and by the way lubrication and 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:12.289
 Russian who are interested 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:17.210
 manufacturer noo npp 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:22.550
 astrohim 107 241 city moscow moscow 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:27.020
 Street Baikal house 1-3 shelf life 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.229
 she has three years so basically who 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.960
 interesting here again show this here 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:36.620
 Masochka anyone interested can 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.530
 I will try to solve my opinions 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.250
 I wonder how you have this whole thing gone 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:47.949
 basically 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.949
 thank you for your attention see you bye
