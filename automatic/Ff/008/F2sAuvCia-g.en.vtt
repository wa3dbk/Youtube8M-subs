00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
you have to film without the peel stuff

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.750 
you have to film without the peel stuff
then<00:04:02.900> you're<00:04:03.170> going<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.410> use<00:04:03.530> either<00:04:04.099> tape<00:04:04.550> or

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
then you're going to use either tape or

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.729 
then you're going to use either tape or
glue<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:05.239> would<00:04:05.690> prefer<00:04:05.720> taste<00:04:06.230> but<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.530> met

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
glue I would prefer taste but I met

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.559 
glue I would prefer taste but I met
nasty<00:04:07.100> so<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.430> probably<00:04:07.580> have<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.150> use<00:04:08.269> glute

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
nasty so you probably have to use glute

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.180 
nasty so you probably have to use glute
which<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.900> really<00:04:09.080> messy<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:09.860> I'm<00:04:09.950> going<00:04:10.130> to

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.150 

ok

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
ok

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.030 
ok
so<00:05:57.700> I'm<00:05:58.060> basically<00:05:58.510> done<00:05:59.200> step<00:05:59.620> for<00:05:59.740> this<00:05:59.800> one

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
so I'm basically done step for this one

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:14.180 
so I'm basically done step for this one
corner<00:06:00.730> that<00:06:01.540> I'm<00:06:01.660> going<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:01.930> cut<00:06:02.080> that<00:06:02.110> too

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.940 

oh<00:06:14.330> ok<00:06:15.330> so<00:06:15.690> that's<00:06:16.170> pretty<00:06:16.770> much<00:06:16.890> it<00:06:17.630> um<00:06:18.950> from

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
oh ok so that's pretty much it um from

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.550 
oh ok so that's pretty much it um from
this<00:06:20.130> angle<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.940> can<00:06:21.120> see<00:06:21.450> orange<00:06:21.990> at<00:06:22.380> the

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
this angle you can see orange at the

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.680 
this angle you can see orange at the
bottom<00:06:23.070> and<00:06:23.100> maybe<00:06:23.580> up<00:06:23.760> here<00:06:24.680> yeah<00:06:26.480> that's<00:06:27.480> my

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
bottom and maybe up here yeah that's my

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.780 
bottom and maybe up here yeah that's my
GV<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.140> it's<00:06:28.590> spongebob<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.250> it's<00:06:29.520> a<00:06:29.610> little

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
GV and it's spongebob and it's a little

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.560 
GV and it's spongebob and it's a little
smaller<00:06:30.300> than<00:06:30.390> the<00:06:30.660> big<00:06:30.870> one<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.650> chucks<00:06:31.920> and

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
smaller than the big one the chucks and

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.120 
smaller than the big one the chucks and
I<00:06:33.570> think<00:06:33.630> it's<00:06:33.960> better<00:06:34.230> that<00:06:34.380> it's<00:06:34.740> smaller

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
I think it's better that it's smaller

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.000 
I think it's better that it's smaller
because<00:06:35.760> I<00:06:36.210> can<00:06:36.480> make<00:06:36.630> even<00:06:36.870> smaller<00:06:37.260> key<00:06:37.470> like

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
because I can make even smaller key like

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.710 
because I can make even smaller key like
I<00:06:38.220> could<00:06:38.940> make<00:06:39.150> the<00:06:39.420> TV<00:06:40.280> size<00:06:41.280> of<00:06:41.730> one<00:06:42.450> of<00:06:42.540> my

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
I could make the TV size of one of my

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.930 
I could make the TV size of one of my
computers<00:06:43.110> and<00:06:43.740> I<00:06:44.100> think<00:06:44.310> I<00:06:44.400> just<00:06:44.460> broke<00:06:44.700> it

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940
