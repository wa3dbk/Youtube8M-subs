00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.910 
League of Legends game let's say one in
every<00:03:56.240> ten<00:03:56.540> players<00:03:56.810> is<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.170> troll<00:03:57.590> who

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
every ten players is a troll who

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.880 
every ten players is a troll who
intentionally<00:03:58.250> feeds<00:03:58.760> once<00:03:59.060> he<00:03:59.180> gets<00:03:59.390> in<00:03:59.510> game

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
intentionally feeds once he gets in game

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.950 
intentionally feeds once he gets in game
the<00:04:00.890> sake<00:04:01.100> of<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:01.370> example<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:02.060> means<00:04:02.360> that

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
the sake of this example that means that

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.370 
the sake of this example that means that
there<00:04:03.170> is<00:04:03.200> exactly<00:04:03.530> one<00:04:03.740> troll<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.610> every<00:04:04.880> game

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
there is exactly one troll in every game

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.600 
there is exactly one troll in every game
so<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.500> chance<00:04:06.740> of<00:04:06.860> getting<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.190> troll<00:04:07.430> on

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
so the chance of getting the troll on

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.540 
so the chance of getting the troll on
your<00:04:07.760> team<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.270> 50%<00:04:09.010> because<00:04:10.010> each<00:04:10.190> player<00:04:10.520> has

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
your team is 50% because each player has

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.370 
your team is 50% because each player has
a<00:04:10.790> ten<00:04:11.120> percent<00:04:11.210> chance<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.810> being<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.170> troll

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
a ten percent chance of being the troll

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.280 
a ten percent chance of being the troll
here<00:04:13.150> but<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.540> up<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.780> troll<00:04:15.050> and

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
here but you and up the troll and

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.830 
here but you and up the troll and
because<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.520> and<00:04:16.670> of<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.880> troll<00:04:17.150> each

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
because you and of the troll each

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.830 
because you and of the troll each
player's<00:04:18.230> chance<00:04:18.650> has<00:04:18.890> gone<00:04:19.100> up<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:20.000> 11.1

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
player's chance has gone up to 11.1

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.050 
player's chance has gone up to 11.1
percent

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
percent

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.110 
percent
so<00:04:22.660> your<00:04:22.810> team<00:04:23.020> now<00:04:23.290> has<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.530> 44-point<00:04:24.460> four

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
so your team now has a 44-point four

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.450 
so your team now has a 44-point four
percent<00:04:25.480> chance<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.990> having<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.350> troll<00:04:26.590> while

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
percent chance of having the troll while

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.430 
percent chance of having the troll while
the<00:04:27.639> other<00:04:27.790> team<00:04:28.060> now<00:04:28.450> has<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.810> fifty<00:04:29.290> five

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
the other team now has a fifty five

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.560 
the other team now has a fifty five
point<00:04:29.980> six<00:04:30.280> percent<00:04:30.730> chance<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:31.180> having<00:04:31.360> the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
point six percent chance of having the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.500 
point six percent chance of having the
troll<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:33.100> might<00:04:33.430> not<00:04:33.580> seem<00:04:33.820> like<00:04:34.090> much<00:04:34.120> of<00:04:34.300> a

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
troll it might not seem like much of a

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.020 
troll it might not seem like much of a
change<00:04:34.750> but<00:04:35.680> mathematically<00:04:36.160> over<00:04:36.730> a<00:04:36.790> period

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
change but mathematically over a period

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.930 
change but mathematically over a period
of<00:04:37.270> 100<00:04:37.840> games<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:39.070> means<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.460> could<00:04:39.580> expect
