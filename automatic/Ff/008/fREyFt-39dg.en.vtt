00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello good morning I'll say 'looking 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.230
 party and today I bring you another small 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.969
 tutorial of these for 5 or 6 minutes in the 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.679
 which explains exactly what it is to extinguish 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.630
 well as directly that 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.300
 extinguishes is a platform that through 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.369
 of steam serves to give games is 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.859
 it's that simple from easy it's worth through 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.359
 here you can get games that is 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.160
 necessary to enter here the only thing is 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.650
 necessary is a sting account a 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.769
 ching account and having spent a skin 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.590
 at least I have spent not having in 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.930
 possesses at least 100 dollars 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 in games 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 18 to 100 dollars is a lot of money 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.110
 it really is not so much because for example 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.989
 when the offers made from 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.330
 Christmas or summer holidays or even 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.060
 offers that leave daily with 75% and 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.560
 others if for example there is a game that you 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.510
 it costs for example it comes to me 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.000
 head the edge of the angle in the version 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.699
 the drop and the Ministry said that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.400
 cost I think it was five euros the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.619
 game was really in discount the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.750
 original price I do not know if it would be twenty or 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.760
 thirty euros or even more or that is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.399
 buy a game five euros is the game 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.490
 it really has a price of 30 euros and 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:18.000
 for these people they count as if the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.190
 price without discount is then clear 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.780
 at Christmas with the payments there are 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.030
 can catch Christmas and summer 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.740
 they can catch very good offers that you 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.250
 increase let's say the money that theoretically 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.509
 up to two games in etsy better 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.789
 it takes very simple to have an account 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.039
 This gives you here on the page 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.690

 tributes two dollars here if I open 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.200
 this I will not be able to participate because you see 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.310
 because to participate here you have 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.540
 to be contributed you have to have 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.010
 given a game 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.180
 you have to buy a game 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.129
 must have the gift of a game 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.310
 some way we're better off giving you a gift 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.590
 game here and you put it because you 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.890
 can bathe directly during a 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.900
 time then 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.760
 to participate here you have to give away 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.290
 games with hits or have you bought or that 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.240
 you have given to someone but not of 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.220
 this page is directly worth with 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.440
 that then to be able to participate in 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.380
 this you have to have given away so 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.690
 minus a game with a minimum value of 2 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.920
 dollars there are more than more prices 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.290
 look for example here is the has that 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.540
 I do not have it because it interests me to 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.370
 in 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.069
 people are not told what they have left 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.940
 two minutes 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.300
 for inside 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.280
 you you you your mother you have ten 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.590
 dollars to participate 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.670
 the big-three I already have it great too 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.250
 I have alternaria in gotham city but that 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.060
 it's a letter from I do not know what story board 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.910
 in which I already have of liza 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.750
 I do not see anything interesting like that but good 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.880
 you know is more or less with fishing 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.880
 of how it works 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.230
 they order 22 live 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.229
 275 dollars you have to have contributed 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.720
 for camp participants but if 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.979
 Look, 82 people have already participated and 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.870
 more chance that it's your turn to look at a 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.330
 game in which he has participated is 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.430
 brand as well as more clarito 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.479
 and for example to teach a game not 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.849
 exists in your account you can not participate 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.069
 so that it does not touch you because people 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.770
 what would it be that I would give away the game 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:02.720
 that you already have and that's like it's not very 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.490
 very ethical it's about in theory 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.210
 bring me and I tell you I have not given away 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.340
