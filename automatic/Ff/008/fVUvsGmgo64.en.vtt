00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to pause for ads this would provide

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
to pause for ads this would provide
content<00:00:59.760> creators<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.390> an<00:01:00.629> alternative

revenue<00:01:01.469> source<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.390> more

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
revenue source and it would be more

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.320 
revenue source and it would be more
reliable<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.799> volatile<00:01:05.309> CPMs<00:01:06.090> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
