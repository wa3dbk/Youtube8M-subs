electrodes<00:00:34.489> will<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.640> into<00:00:37.040> difficult<00:00:39.200> which

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
electrodes will go into difficult which

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
electrodes will go into difficult which
should<00:00:41.510> cause<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> pickle<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.140> ionize<00:00:44.239> this

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
