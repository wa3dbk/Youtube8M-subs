00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.240
 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.380
 new video of grand theft auto 'online 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.110
 in which I will tell you that it has 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.940
 filtering the emissions creator and it has 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.379
 could see a lot of information about 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 what a person will include has 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.650
 got started up has 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.570
 discovered the code and it has been 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.040
 enter in the game and you can see 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.750
 practically every option that goes 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.910
 to have there are some that are blocked 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 that are hidden we do not know what will be 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.200
 but more or less there are many that yes 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.579
 you can know what they are before they 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.050
 start the video I would like to ask you 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.730
 do not forget to hit the like if 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 you like it with nothing more to add 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.589
 we started well then this supposed video 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.179
 that as soon as you are watching during 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.089
 a few seconds you realize that it is 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:47.429
 absolutely real reveals to us many of 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.710
 the options and if we go one by one 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.690
 we could do a little summary not you 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.519
 I'm going to go one by one because it would be a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.319
 little waste of time but yes that 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.670
 I'm going to do a little summary and 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.229
 course is that you can change the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.479
 number of players the number of teams 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.850
 the minimum range to access the mission 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.460
 the number of lives that we are going to have if 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 we die to be able to reappear 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.240
 Team names could also 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.560
 change the minimum number of players that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.049
 has to see by team this would come 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 to be a bit like in the creator of 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.590
 Death games but then also 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.450
 let's select the car that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 reappearance of each team that would be the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.750
 car that will leave us just when 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.299
 let's look with our team always 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.979
 appear by a few cars in front and not 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.990
 I could also choose the points that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 It will give us death, not reputation 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.340
 but the points the reputation puts it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 automatically rockstar the points that 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 they would give us in the game I would be talking 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.310
 the points that he gives us for killing 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.929
 someone, well, if he gives us 12 or 10 points 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.690
 we can also choose the weapons with the 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.459
 that we started all this again because 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.289
 we would have seen it in the creator of 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.600
 death games there would be nothing 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.399
 important but here the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.459
 news and is that you can choose if 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.020
 there will be bands or not if there will be 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.970
 police emergencies we can choose 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.679
 the camera that will appear at the end 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.810
 the mission if you remember just when 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.909
 ends a mission appears to us as a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.470
 camera looking somewhere and we 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.509
 puts mission completed then that camera 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.819
 you could choose you can choose the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.259
 goal that we have to pursue if it goes 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.580
 to be drugs are going to be packages and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.500
 we have to kill someone and for 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.940
 of course we will be able to put characters 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.770
 we can put police bands 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.800
 and we can even decide how it's going to 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.570
 dress if it's bad if it's neutral if it's going 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.430
 with us and will help us we can 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.890
 choose your weapon we can choose your 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.450
 skills and your combat style 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.450
 even your health we can put you 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.370
 have the 300% of health that you have 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.350
 much more health than us and even 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 that other enemies this would help us by 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.640
 example to create a bit like that the roll of 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.990
 final enemies that is not very enemy 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.210
 but it is a little more 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.950
 difficult to kill well this is something of 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.270
 everything that has been leaked the video what 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.220
 you have in the description for those who 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.320
 you want to see the whole thing is a video of 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.060
 a few minutes that goes by then 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.740
 all the options for them to leave 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.940
 seeing a little bit more I hope that you 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.550
 I liked it, do not forget to leave 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.060
 your comment and a greeting and until 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.870
