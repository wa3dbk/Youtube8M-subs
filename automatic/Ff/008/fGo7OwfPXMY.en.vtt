 what guys are resman with you today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.020
 tell you how to create wy fay roadstone in 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.910
 minecraft without mods using only 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.370
 one command block well let's 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.380
 let's start by installing the command block 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.790
 open insert his command link 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.430
 where stalin under video and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.029
 activate the command block now 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.230
 waiting for the construction of the machine all 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.550
 our car is almost done perfectly and 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 we poke on the bottom green plate we 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.199
 got the control panel of our wipe 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 With networks, let's take some 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.070
 mechanism well I think let's dispenser and to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.850
 take him arrows 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.739
 and where we have arrows here are arrows and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.969
 try to create a wipe network open 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.600
 the book we see there are four pages 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.250
 the first is the page about the author and this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.260
 cartoon the second page allows 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.309
 create and delete network 3 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.820
 on-off and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.710
 and this is a looping mode that is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.000
 looped signal okay not 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 important the following we will 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 set up a wi-fi network for this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 worth a blog for which you need 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.760
 set up a network and create a network under 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.790
 name and that is, we poke a letter 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.290
 here we have a network now we are here 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.540
 put the dispenser and insert into it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.159
 arrows now with 2 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 more precisely the third page we can 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.439
 enable our network or even or also 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.220
 here turn off let's turn it on again 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.090
 and see 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.040
 the third mode i.e. 4 pages is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.040
 us meshing mode let's turn it on 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.470
 We press and so here is our dispenser 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.240
 shoots out 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.360
 let's turn it off now give in 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.190
 normal condition he turned us off 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.230
 well, to remove the network we need 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.530
 also go to our pultik off 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.300
 first our network take the place of that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.190
 where it is then we have here 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.980
 here now and just and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.110
 deactivate more precisely in delete click 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.090
 and all our network is removed and even 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.770
 if I turn it on damn I pressed the wrong button 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.970
 let's damn it and perez created nothing 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.070
 in that place let's remove again and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.570
 now try to turn it on 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.910
 as you can see nothing is included also we 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.160
 we can create several 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.630
 networks let's try this place we 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:29.250
 create a network b in this place network c and in 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:32.370
 this place is a network yes everything is fine all theon 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:38.180
 created let's scatter arrows on them 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.180
 and try to run them all 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 b.ts. 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.890
 so pancakes and do not feel created here I 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.890
 sometimes confused in this cartoon 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.610
 and here we create so here we created 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.349
 already network and now turn on c and turn on d 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.209
 everything is fine all 30 we turned on and 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.310
 now we can also any of them 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.590
 loop that let's turn on let's say c 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.620
 on loops this she is with us so 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.760
 starts shooting as well as to one bye 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.290
 one network you can tie 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.750
 several blocks of redstone and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.849
 activate a few items well 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.590

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.680
