00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
braid it in a circular motion it should

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.529 
braid it in a circular motion it should
look<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.000> keep<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.359> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
your hair in a circular motion the first

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.549 
your hair in a circular motion the first
half<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:03.059> keep<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.809> circle<00:01:04.110> and

just braid it you want to braid it as

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.710 
just braid it you want to braid it as
small<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.409> possible<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.610> more<00:01:08.850> flat<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.600> will

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
small as possible the more flat it will

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.719 
small as possible the more flat it will
look<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.680> more<00:01:10.920> natural<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.729> less<00:01:12.180> bulky

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
look the more natural the less bulky

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.950 
look the more natural the less bulky
less<00:01:14.729> bulkiness<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.420> how

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
less bulkiness you have so this is how

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
less bulkiness you have so this is how
it<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.259> look<00:01:22.320> once<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.920> create<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it will look once you create it in a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.210 
it will look once you create it in a
circular<00:01:23.850> motion<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.130> went<00:01:26.130> around

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
circular motion you see I went around

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.560 
circular motion you see I went around
you<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> pattern<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.670> pitch

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you see the pattern and then you pitch

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
you see the pattern and then you pitch
down<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.049> extra<00:01:31.350> hair<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> will<00:01:32.040> repeat

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
down the extra hair so you will repeat

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.770 
down the extra hair so you will repeat
the<00:01:32.549> same<00:01:32.790> thing<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> bottom<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.479> how

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the same thing to the bottom this is how

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.760 
the same thing to the bottom this is how
we<00:01:36.840> look<00:01:37.200> once<00:01:37.560> you're<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.950> finished<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
yes guys I cut each what to go across

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
yes guys I cut each what to go across
and<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.460> use<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.409> weaving<00:01:46.409> net<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.860> keep<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and I also use a weaving net to keep the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.319 
and I also use a weaving net to keep the
hair<00:01:47.399> more<00:01:47.640> Stern<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.439> last<00:01:49.680> longer

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
across and this is how we look once you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.950 
across and this is how we look once you
stitch<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.820> for<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.630> repeat

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
stitch it all up for all you will repeat

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.190 
stitch it all up for all you will repeat
the<00:02:04.140> same<00:02:04.350> thing<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> top<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:08.310> see<00:02:09.200> repeat

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the same thing to the top you see repeat

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.470 
the same thing to the top you see repeat
the<00:02:10.410> same<00:02:10.800> thing<00:02:11.489> until<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.120> can't<00:02:12.420> go
