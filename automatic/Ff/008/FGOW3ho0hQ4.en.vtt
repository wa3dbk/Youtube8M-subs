layers and this took me learn how to do
it<00:05:24.420> was<00:05:24.600> worth<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:25.020> do<00:05:25.200> because<00:05:25.470> he<00:05:25.950> was<00:05:26.190> like<00:05:26.670> I

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
it was worth to do because he was like I

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.880 
it was worth to do because he was like I
said<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.420> wrong<00:05:27.450> thing<00:05:28.170> he<00:05:28.500> was<00:05:28.650> one<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.800> my

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
said the wrong thing he was one of my

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.700 
said the wrong thing he was one of my
favorite<00:05:29.310> characters<00:05:29.490> besides<00:05:30.230> Lee<00:05:31.230> and<00:05:31.440> guy

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
favorite characters besides Lee and guy

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.490 
favorite characters besides Lee and guy
sensei<00:05:32.540> so<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.570> thought<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:33.900> was<00:05:33.990> necessary<00:05:34.440> to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
sensei so I thought it was necessary to

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.400 
sensei so I thought it was necessary to
make<00:05:34.650> broccoli<00:05:35.210> but<00:05:36.210> yeah<00:05:36.990> that's<00:05:37.290> basically

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
make broccoli but yeah that's basically

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.260 
make broccoli but yeah that's basically
all<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.830> used<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:39.060> make<00:05:39.590> Kiba<00:05:40.590> here<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:41.010> so<00:05:41.790> I

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
all I used to make Kiba here and so I

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.390 
all I used to make Kiba here and so I
guess<00:05:42.360> this<00:05:43.260> is<00:05:43.470> where<00:05:43.770> I'm<00:05:43.890> going<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.070> end<00:05:44.160> it

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
guess this is where I'm going to end it

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.360 
guess this is where I'm going to end it
