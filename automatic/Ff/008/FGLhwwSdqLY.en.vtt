to another tutorial on Greg tech tonight

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.419 
to another tutorial on Greg tech tonight
we're<00:00:06.060> taking<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.509> look<00:00:06.720> at<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.500> industrial

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
we're taking a look at the industrial

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.610 
we're taking a look at the industrial
grinder<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.290> kind<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.920> special<00:00:12.620> larger

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
grinder this is kind of a special larger

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.939 
grinder this is kind of a special larger
version<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.610> macerator<00:00:15.680> but<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.770> does<00:00:16.920> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
version of a macerator but it does a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.000 
version of a macerator but it does a
little<00:00:17.820> gives<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> little<00:00:19.050> bit<00:00:19.170> more<00:00:19.470> stuff

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
little gives you a little bit more stuff

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.429 
little gives you a little bit more stuff
and<00:00:20.400> gives<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.789> some<00:00:21.029> side<00:00:21.630> products<00:00:22.260> that

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
and gives you some side products that

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.490 
and gives you some side products that
you<00:00:22.529> don't<00:00:23.130> normally<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> sentra

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
you don't normally get out of a sentra

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.599 
you don't normally get out of a sentra
not<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.740> centrifuge<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.310> out<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
not up a centrifuge but out of a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.240 
not up a centrifuge but out of a
macerator<00:00:27.619> so<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.000> large<00:00:30.960> world<00:00:31.859> built

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
macerator so this is a large world built

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.270 
macerator so this is a large world built
out<00:00:32.780> item<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> there's<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> couple<00:00:34.980> ways<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
out item and there's a couple ways you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.830 
out item and there's a couple ways you
can<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:35.700> building<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> build

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
can go about building it you can build

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.229 
can go about building it you can build
the<00:00:36.960> inside<00:00:37.500> structure<00:00:38.129> first<00:00:38.520> or<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.030> can

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the inside structure first or you can

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.950 
the inside structure first or you can
place<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.070> you<00:00:41.070> can<00:00:41.219> place<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.960> actual

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
place the you can place the actual

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
place the you can place the actual
grinder<00:00:43.440> blocks<00:00:43.710> first<00:00:44.420> I'm<00:00:45.420> starting<00:00:45.809> by

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
grinder blocks first I'm starting by

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.020 
grinder blocks first I'm starting by
attempting<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.160> place<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> grinder<00:00:47.820> blocks

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
attempting to place the grinder blocks

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
attempting to place the grinder blocks
in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.420> spots<00:00:48.800> basically<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
in the right spots basically it's a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.389 
in the right spots basically it's a
three<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.239> three<00:00:51.270> by<00:00:51.750> three<00:00:52.140> structure<00:00:52.739> with<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
three by three by three structure with a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
three by three by three structure with a
hollow<00:00:53.940> block<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> middle<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> has

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
hollow block in the middle that has

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.580 
hollow block in the middle that has
water<00:00:55.530> filling<00:00:55.980> yet<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
water filling yet so and then the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.840 
water filling yet so and then the
grinders<00:00:59.250> go<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.329> center<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> each<00:01:01.199> side

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
grinders go on the center of each side

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.170 
grinders go on the center of each side
so<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.920> grinders<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.070> place<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.610> then

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so we got the grinders in place and then

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
so we got the grinders in place and then
we<00:01:06.330> take<00:01:06.570> standard<00:01:07.470> machine<00:01:07.650> casing<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
we take standard machine casing and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
we take standard machine casing and
reinforced<00:01:10.200> machine<00:01:10.650> casing<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.939> bottom

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
reinforced machine casing now the bottom

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.840 
reinforced machine casing now the bottom
and<00:01:12.420> top<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.130> standard<00:01:14.640> machine

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and top of this are the standard machine

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
and top of this are the standard machine
casing<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.689> bottom<00:01:18.960> layer<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
casing and we just the bottom layer is a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.249 
casing and we just the bottom layer is a
solid<00:01:20.250> layer<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.030> solid<00:01:21.509> machine<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
solid layer of the solid machine or the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.280 
solid layer of the solid machine or the
standard<00:01:22.799> machine<00:01:23.009> casing<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.290> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
standard machine casing just like so the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.580 
standard machine casing just like so the
next<00:01:25.590> layer<00:01:26.180> uses<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.390> reinforced<00:01:28.200> machine

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
next layer uses the reinforced machine

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
next layer uses the reinforced machine
casing<00:01:29.720> with<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> center<00:01:31.350> hollow<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.070> then

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
casing with the center hollow and then

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
casing with the center hollow and then
we<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> bucket<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.540> water<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.110> dump<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.560> in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
we take a bucket of water and dump it in

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.300 
we take a bucket of water and dump it in
the<00:01:34.770> middle<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.720> then<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.840> fill<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> top

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the middle and then we fill in the top

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
the middle and then we fill in the top
layer<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> standard<00:01:39.689> machine<00:01:39.900> casing

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
layer with the standard machine casing

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.749 
layer with the standard machine casing
and<00:01:41.540> what<00:01:42.540> will<00:01:42.689> happen<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.860> once<00:01:44.700> we

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and what will happen here is once we

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.170 
and what will happen here is once we
place<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.299> last<00:01:45.509> block<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.850> grinders<00:01:47.850> will

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
place this last block the grinders will

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.120 
place this last block the grinders will
the<00:01:48.720> actual<00:01:49.049> grinder<00:01:49.380> blocks<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.890> sense

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the actual grinder blocks will sense

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.270 
the actual grinder blocks will sense
that<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.869> structure<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:51.990> complete<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.680> then

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that the structure is complete and then

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.510 
that the structure is complete and then
they'll<00:01:53.460> turn<00:01:53.729> green<00:01:54.590> now<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.649> interface

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
they'll turn green now the interface

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.889 
they'll turn green now the interface
here<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:58.200> left<00:01:58.439> part<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.270> more<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.450> showing

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
here this left part is more just showing

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.420 
here this left part is more just showing
you<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.070> cell<00:02:02.310> set<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.329> ready

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
you that it's cell set up and ready

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.859 
you that it's cell set up and ready
actually<00:02:05.430> what<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.909> does<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.450> shows<00:02:06.689> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
actually what it does is it shows you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.609 
actually what it does is it shows you
how<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> build<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> world<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.729> then

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
how to build it in the world and then

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.050 
how to build it in the world and then
you<00:02:10.619> put<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.270> top<00:02:12.900> spot<00:02:13.379> here

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
you put the or in this top spot here

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.750 
you put the or in this top spot here
and<00:02:14.260> then<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.410> also<00:02:15.560> takes<00:02:15.890> buckets<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.730> water

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and then it also takes buckets of water

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.400 
and then it also takes buckets of water
to<00:02:17.450> function<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.849> far<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.870> don't<00:02:21.230> know<00:02:21.319> if

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
to function and so far I don't know if

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.580 
to function and so far I don't know if
it'll<00:02:21.530> work<00:02:21.590> with<00:02:21.860> these<00:02:22.040> nope<00:02:22.989> so<00:02:23.989> far<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.230> have

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
it'll work with these nope so far I have

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.190 
it'll work with these nope so far I have
not<00:02:24.620> found<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.160> way<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.370> pump<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.330> water<00:02:26.630> from

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
not found a way to pump in water from

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.960 
not found a way to pump in water from
like<00:02:27.620> waterproof<00:02:28.160> pipes<00:02:28.459> or<00:02:28.700> anything<00:02:28.940> like

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
like waterproof pipes or anything like

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.910 
like waterproof pipes or anything like
that<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.650> could<00:02:30.860> automate<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.610> by<00:02:32.349> using<00:02:33.349> a

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
that you could automate this by using a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.210 
that you could automate this by using a
machine<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:35.120> would<00:02:35.300> send<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.010> would<00:02:37.010> do--

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
machine that would send you would do--

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.400 
machine that would send you would do--
send<00:02:38.209> full<00:02:38.840> buckets<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.410> water<00:02:39.440> into<00:02:41.380> into<00:02:42.380> the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
send full buckets of water into into the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.530 
send full buckets of water into into the
grinder<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.280> then<00:02:43.459> take<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.880> empty<00:02:44.090> buckets

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
grinder and then take the empty buckets

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.240 
grinder and then take the empty buckets
and<00:02:44.750> refill<00:02:45.170> them<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.470> send<00:02:45.650> them<00:02:45.680> back<00:02:45.890> in

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
and refill them and send them back in

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.870 
and refill them and send them back in
but<00:02:47.239> unfortunately<00:02:48.160> i<00:02:49.390> wonder<00:02:50.390> oh<00:02:51.580> let's<00:02:52.580> see

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
but unfortunately i wonder oh let's see

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.830 
but unfortunately i wonder oh let's see
let's<00:02:53.239> look<00:02:53.630> at<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.049> water<00:02:54.440> cells<00:02:55.569> if<00:02:56.569> i<00:02:56.660> can

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
let's look at the water cells if i can

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.660 
let's look at the water cells if i can
find<00:02:56.989> them<00:02:57.200> real<00:02:57.380> quick<00:02:57.620> we'll<00:02:57.920> try<00:02:58.190> this<00:02:58.250> real

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
find them real quick we'll try this real

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.070 
find them real quick we'll try this real
quick<00:02:58.880> because<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.269> water<00:02:59.450> cells<00:02:59.720> do<00:02:59.989> stack

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
quick because the water cells do stack

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.680 
quick because the water cells do stack
so<00:03:03.080> those<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:04.370> does<00:03:04.640> work<00:03:04.940> as<00:03:05.180> well<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:05.599> you

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
so those that does work as well so you

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.860 
so those that does work as well so you
could<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:06.650> stick<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.180> stack<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.209> water<00:03:08.569> cells

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
could just stick a stack of water cells

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.920 
could just stick a stack of water cells
in<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.319> those<00:03:10.220> stacks<00:03:10.549> oh<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.569> also<00:03:11.720> get

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
in and those stacks oh and you also get

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.360 
in and those stacks oh and you also get
the<00:03:12.080> empty<00:03:12.349> cells<00:03:12.590> back<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.250> could

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the empty cells back so you could

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.800 
the empty cells back so you could
automate<00:03:13.670> taking<00:03:14.000> those<00:03:14.120> out<00:03:14.330> filling<00:03:14.720> them

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
automate taking those out filling them

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.530 
automate taking those out filling them
up<00:03:14.900> with<00:03:14.959> water<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.680> sticking<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.760> back<00:03:16.880> in<00:03:17.410> so

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
up with water and sticking it back in so

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.259 
up with water and sticking it back in so
that's<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.750> for<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.470> oars<00:03:21.920> most<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.060> oars
