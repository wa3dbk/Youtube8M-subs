today I'll be teach you guys how to make
your<00:00:03.780> perfect<00:00:04.200> number<00:00:04.529> chapter<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:05.040> Java<00:00:05.339> now

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
your perfect number chapter in Java now

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.940 
your perfect number chapter in Java now
for<00:00:06.420> everybody<00:00:06.870> who<00:00:07.350> doesn't<00:00:07.710> know<00:00:07.770> what<00:00:07.890> a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
for everybody who doesn't know what a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.259 
for everybody who doesn't know what a
perfect<00:00:08.250> numbers<00:00:08.519> I'm<00:00:08.730> sure<00:00:08.940> you've<00:00:09.090> already

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
perfect numbers I'm sure you've already

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.080 
perfect numbers I'm sure you've already
read<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:10.469> let<00:00:11.280> me<00:00:11.309> just<00:00:11.400> say<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.790> out<00:00:11.910> for

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
read it but let me just say it out for

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.589 
read it but let me just say it out for
you<00:00:12.200> end<00:00:13.200> up<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.679> number<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.340> which<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.120> sum<00:00:15.420> of

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
you end up a number for which the sum of

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.320 
you end up a number for which the sum of
all<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.049> positive<00:00:16.500> integer<00:00:17.010> factors<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
all the positive integer factors of the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330 
all the positive integer factors of the
number<00:00:18.630> which<00:00:18.990> are<00:00:19.170> less<00:00:19.380> than<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:20.189> number

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
number which are less than the number

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.090 
number which are less than the number
itself<00:00:20.789> add<00:00:21.090> up<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.840> number<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.920> for

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
itself add up to the number so for

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.910 
itself add up to the number so for
example<00:00:23.220> 6<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.060> 28<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.660> perfect<00:00:25.050> numbers<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
example 6 and 28 are perfect numbers the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.169 
example 6 and 28 are perfect numbers the
number<00:00:26.220> six<00:00:26.550> has<00:00:26.880> factors<00:00:27.510> 1<00:00:28.140> 2<00:00:28.410> &amp;<00:00:28.590> 3<00:00:28.650> &amp;<00:00:28.980> 1<00:00:29.070> +<00:00:29.939> 2<00:00:29.970> +

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
number six has factors 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 + 2 +

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.510 
number six has factors 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 + 2 +
3<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.840> equal<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.349> 6<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> make<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
3 is equal to 6 so we're going to make a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.250 
3 is equal to 6 so we're going to make a
program<00:00:32.759> which<00:00:33.480> will<00:00:33.690> input<00:00:33.960> any<00:00:35.059> number<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
program which will input any number and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.720 
program which will input any number and
we'll<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> check<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> numbers<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
we'll get it to check if the numbers of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.560 
we'll get it to check if the numbers of
perfect<00:00:39.300> number<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.719> love<00:00:40.320> life<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.570> first

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
perfect number I love life so first

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.299 
perfect number I love life so first
we're<00:00:42.840> going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> need<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> way<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
we're going to need a way to get the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209 
we're going to need a way to get the
input<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.180> imported<00:00:46.140> java<00:00:46.410> dot<00:00:46.620> io<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
input so we imported java dot io and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.270 
input so we imported java dot io and
we'll<00:00:47.640> use<00:00:48.260> bufferedreader<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.890> them<00:00:50.039> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we'll use bufferedreader from them and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.150 
we'll use bufferedreader from them and
we<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.390> java<00:00:51.870> dot<00:00:52.050> io<00:00:52.110> throws<00:00:52.739> an<00:00:53.010> IO

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
we know that java dot io throws an IO

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.459 
we know that java dot io throws an IO
exception<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.210> let's<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.989> handle<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
exception so let's just handle that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.529 
exception so let's just handle that
right<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:55.680> let's<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.219> main<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.149> throw<00:00:57.360> an

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
right now let's get main to throw an

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.040 
right now let's get main to throw an
ioexception<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.590> bam<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.520> now<00:01:00.149> we're<00:01:00.899> going

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
ioexception and bam so now we're going

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
ioexception and bam so now we're going
to<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> bufferedreader<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.000> make<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to make the bufferedreader we can make a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.660 
to make the bufferedreader we can make a
bufferedreader<00:01:03.660> object<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.530> static<00:01:05.100> because

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
bufferedreader object so static because

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
bufferedreader object so static because
it's<00:01:06.000> outside<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.420> main<00:01:06.720> class<00:01:06.900> may<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> our

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
it's outside the main class may I our

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.590 
it's outside the main class may I our
main<00:01:08.130> method<00:01:08.430> type<00:01:08.580> bufferedreader<00:01:09.299> BR

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
main method type bufferedreader BR

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.850 
main method type bufferedreader BR
that's<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.780> we'll<00:01:12.900> call<00:01:12.930> our<00:01:13.229> object<00:01:13.680> equals

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that's what we'll call our object equals

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.719 
that's what we'll call our object equals

offered<00:01:27.990> reader<00:01:28.229> PR<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.780> we'll<00:01:30.780> use<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
offered reader PR and we'll use the

converts the string into a number and
then<00:02:09.209> we'll<00:02:09.420> assign<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.810> number<00:02:10.110> two<00:02:10.349> input

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
then we'll assign that number two input

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.309 
then we'll assign that number two input
over<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.480> alright<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.690> now<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.140> got<00:02:13.170> our

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
over here alright so now that we got our

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.000 
over here alright so now that we got our
input

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
input

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.330 
input
let's<00:02:14.970> go<00:02:15.150> ahead<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.540> call<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.379> method<00:02:16.560> we

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
let's go ahead and call the method we

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.890 
let's go ahead and call the method we
haven't<00:02:17.610> made<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.790> yet<00:02:17.939> but<00:02:18.299> it's<00:02:18.480> always<00:02:18.599> good

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
haven't made it yet but it's always good

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.179 
haven't made it yet but it's always good
to<00:02:18.930> call<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.319> first<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.510> validate<00:02:22.189> under

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
to call it first so validate under

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.160 
to call it first so validate under
school<00:02:23.400> number<00:02:24.530> input<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.390> course<00:02:28.019> it's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
school number input and of course it's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.059 
school number input and of course it's
going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.349> throw<00:02:28.500> an<00:02:28.620> error<00:02:28.709> because<00:02:28.920> we

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
going to throw an error because we

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.259 
going to throw an error because we
haven't<00:02:29.310> made<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.459> method<00:02:29.760> yet<00:02:29.849> let's<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.209> ahead

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
haven't made a method yet let's go ahead

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.750 
haven't made a method yet let's go ahead
and<00:02:30.360> make<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> void<00:02:30.810> method<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.650> public<00:02:32.129> static

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and make a void method so public static

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.740 
and make a void method so public static
void<00:02:33.799> validate<00:02:34.819> number<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.000> we'll<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:36.540> pass

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
void validate number and we'll just pass

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.500 
void validate number and we'll just pass
in<00:02:36.989> into<00:02:37.379> n<00:02:37.500> any<00:02:37.739> int<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.700> now<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.329> gotta

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
in into n any int and now what we gotta

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.460 
in into n any int and now what we gotta
do<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:40.579> make<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.609> for<00:02:41.909> loop<00:02:42.030> which<00:02:42.599> will<00:02:42.780> loop<00:02:43.019> up

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
do is make a for loop which will loop up

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.490 
do is make a for loop which will loop up
until<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.280> number<00:02:44.579> minus<00:02:44.909> one<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:45.930> for

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
until the number minus one so for

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.149 
until the number minus one so for
example<00:02:46.730> 28-1<00:02:47.730> check<00:02:48.569> if<00:02:48.780> any<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.829> the<00:02:50.040> numbers

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
example 28-1 check if any of the numbers

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:57.170 
example 28-1 check if any of the numbers
so<00:02:50.849> from<00:02:51.090> 1<00:02:51.359> to<00:02:52.019> 2<00:02:53.010> n<00:02:53.250> minus<00:02:53.849> 1<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:55.700> our<00:02:56.700> factors

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
so from 1 to 2 n minus 1 and our factors

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.080 
so from 1 to 2 n minus 1 and our factors
of<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.420> number<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.190> then<00:02:59.190> we'll<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.609> if<00:02:59.819> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
of the number and then we'll see if the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.830 
of the number and then we'll see if the
num<00:03:00.269> if<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.690> factors<00:03:01.139> add<00:03:01.379> up<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.190> number

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
num if the factors add up to the number

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.780 
num if the factors add up to the number
so<00:03:03.840> first<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.500> need<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.709> make<00:03:04.980> an<00:03:05.190> accumulator

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
so first we need to make an accumulator

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.360 
so first we need to make an accumulator
so<00:03:06.090> we'll<00:03:06.389> just<00:03:06.420> call<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.900> into<00:03:07.739> counter

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
so we'll just call it into counter

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.339 
so we'll just call it into counter
equals<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.030> 0<00:03:09.359> now<00:03:10.519> we'll<00:03:11.519> make<00:03:11.639> a<00:03:11.700> for<00:03:12.180> loop<00:03:12.420> so

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
equals to 0 now we'll make a for loop so

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.550 
equals to 0 now we'll make a for loop so
int<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:14.159> equals<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:15.239> 1<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:15.870> don't<00:03:15.959> want<00:03:16.139> starting

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
int I equals to 1 we don't want starting

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.830 
int I equals to 1 we don't want starting
at<00:03:16.650> 0<00:03:16.920> everybody<00:03:17.730> knows<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.329> can't<00:03:18.540> really

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
at 0 everybody knows you can't really

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.039 
at 0 everybody knows you can't really
divide<00:03:19.109> by<00:03:19.290> 0<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.579> less<00:03:21.090> than<00:03:21.329> or<00:03:21.540> equal

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
divide by 0 so I is less than or equal

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.490 
divide by 0 so I is less than or equal
to<00:03:22.319> n<00:03:22.680> minus<00:03:23.310> 1<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.510> perfect<00:03:25.199> numbers

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
to n minus 1 because in perfect numbers

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.280 
to n minus 1 because in perfect numbers
you<00:03:25.919> never<00:03:26.280> account<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> number<00:03:27.989> itself

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
you never account for the number itself

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.479 
you never account for the number itself
as<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.590> factor<00:03:29.129> I<00:03:29.720> plus<00:03:30.720> plus<00:03:30.750> BAM<00:03:31.440> we've<00:03:32.190> got

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
as a factor I plus plus BAM we've got

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.939 
as a factor I plus plus BAM we've got
our<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.299> loop<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.660> we're<00:03:34.109> halfway<00:03:34.349> there<00:03:34.590> not

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
our for loop and we're halfway there not

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.629 
our for loop and we're halfway there not
even<00:03:35.099> 75%<00:03:35.970> done<00:03:36.560> now<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.620> need<00:03:37.949> to<00:03:37.980> check<00:03:38.280> if<00:03:38.489> I

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
even 75% done now we need to check if I

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.539 
even 75% done now we need to check if I
is<00:03:39.139> divisible<00:03:40.139> by<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.560> number<00:03:40.919> so<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.519> can

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
is divisible by the number so we can

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.280 
is divisible by the number so we can
consider<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.329> factor<00:03:42.720> right<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.919> if<00:03:44.160> n

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
consider it a factor right so if n

remainders<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.540> doesn't<00:04:03.810> actually<00:04:03.870> give<00:04:04.199> you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
remainders it doesn't actually give you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.629 
remainders it doesn't actually give you
the<00:04:04.409> answer<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.799> just<00:04:04.980> gives<00:04:05.159> you<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> remainder

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
the answer it just gives you a remainder

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.970 
the answer it just gives you a remainder
so<00:04:06.299> if<00:04:06.569> it's<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.870> factor<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.409> remainder<00:04:07.829> will

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
so if it's a factor the remainder will

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.009 
so if it's a factor the remainder will
be<00:04:08.099> 0<00:04:08.370> right<00:04:08.609> because<00:04:09.239> you<00:04:09.329> can<00:04:09.480> divide<00:04:09.750> evenly

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
be 0 right because you can divide evenly

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.670 
be 0 right because you can divide evenly
and<00:04:10.530> if<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.489> happens<00:04:11.849> then<00:04:12.599> accumulate<00:04:13.379> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
and if that happens then accumulate the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.120 
and if that happens then accumulate the
counter<00:04:14.099> with<00:04:14.699> the<00:04:15.389> number<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:15.989> one<00:04:16.769> will<00:04:17.010> be

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
counter with the number so one will be

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.120 
counter with the number so one will be
of<00:04:17.699> course<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:18.180> factor<00:04:18.510> so<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.650> counter<00:04:19.979> will

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
of course a factor so the counter will

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.760 
of course a factor so the counter will
have<00:04:20.430> 1<00:04:20.639> 2<00:04:20.970> will<00:04:21.150> be<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.329> factor<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.409> then<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
have 1 2 will be a factor so then the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.909 
have 1 2 will be a factor so then the
counter<00:04:23.159> will<00:04:23.639> add<00:04:23.849> 1<00:04:24.270> plus<00:04:24.659> 2<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.139> it'll<00:04:25.889> just

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
counter will add 1 plus 2 and it'll just

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.350 
counter will add 1 plus 2 and it'll just
accumulate<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.789> values

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
accumulate the values

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.480 
accumulate the values
so<00:04:28.319> now<00:04:28.530> let's<00:04:28.740> get<00:04:28.860> out<00:04:28.979> of<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:29.159> for<00:04:29.340> loop

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
so now let's get out of the for loop

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.580 
so now let's get out of the for loop
because<00:04:29.759> our<00:04:30.210> job<00:04:30.569> is<00:04:30.719> done<00:04:30.870> there<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.319> now<00:04:31.530> we

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
because our job is done there and now we

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.290 
because our job is done there and now we
need<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.979> check<00:04:32.189> if<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.580> counter<00:04:33.030> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
need to check if the counter the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300 
need to check if the counter the
accumulator<00:04:33.900> all<00:04:34.319> the<00:04:34.800> values<00:04:35.099> that<00:04:35.129> have

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
accumulator all the values that have

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.580 
accumulator all the values that have
been<00:04:35.520> stacked<00:04:35.849> up<00:04:36.030> in<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.240> accumulator<00:04:36.810> equal

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
been stacked up in the accumulator equal

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.999 
been stacked up in the accumulator equal
to<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.830> number<00:04:38.009> right<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.030> if<00:04:39.409> counter<00:04:40.409> equals

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
to the number right so if counter equals

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:47.059 
to the number right so if counter equals
to<00:04:41.340> done<00:04:41.599> to<00:04:42.599> n<00:04:42.889> then<00:04:45.199> system<00:04:46.199> dot<00:04:46.530> out<00:04:46.590> dot

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
to done to n then system dot out dot

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.309 
to done to n then system dot out dot
print<00:04:47.789> line<00:04:48.379> the<00:04:49.379> number<00:04:50.750> plus<00:04:51.750> n<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.199> the

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
print line the number plus n so the

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.520 
print line the number plus n so the
number<00:04:52.620> whatever<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:53.069> is<00:04:53.189> is<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:54.530> perfect

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
number whatever it is is a perfect

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.700 
number whatever it is is a perfect
number<00:04:56.539> BAM<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:58.009> that's<00:04:59.009> not<00:04:59.189> true<00:04:59.599> else<00:05:00.710> you

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
number BAM and that's not true else you

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.249 
number BAM and that's not true else you
can't<00:05:01.949> go<00:05:02.099> wrong<00:05:02.129> with<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.689> let's<00:05:03.689> just<00:05:03.840> be

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
can't go wrong with that let's just be

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.950 
can't go wrong with that let's just be
lazy<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.800> just<00:05:05.009> copy<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:06.529> control<00:05:07.529> C<00:05:08.210> V<00:05:09.210> the

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
lazy and just copy this control C V the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.429 
lazy and just copy this control C V the
number<00:05:10.289> n<00:05:10.439> is<00:05:13.129> not<00:05:14.129> a<00:05:14.460> perfect<00:05:14.789> number<00:05:15.439> so

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:16.439 
number n is not a perfect number so

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.779 
number n is not a perfect number so
there<00:05:16.710> we<00:05:16.860> go<00:05:17.240> let's<00:05:18.240> go<00:05:18.509> ahead<00:05:18.629> and<00:05:18.779> run<00:05:19.050> this

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
there we go let's go ahead and run this

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.760 
there we go let's go ahead and run this
so<00:05:20.789> here<00:05:21.150> we<00:05:21.240> go<00:05:21.270> our<00:05:21.629> program<00:05:22.050> is<00:05:22.199> now<00:05:22.349> open

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
so here we go our program is now open

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.249 
so here we go our program is now open
and<00:05:22.979> let's<00:05:23.909> enter<00:05:24.330> in<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.479> number<00:05:24.719> we<00:05:25.050> know

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
and let's enter in the number we know

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.969 
and let's enter in the number we know
for<00:05:25.469> sure<00:05:25.529> it's<00:05:25.949> a<00:05:26.009> perfect<00:05:26.370> number<00:05:26.490> so<00:05:26.819> 20<00:05:27.300> 80

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
for sure it's a perfect number so 20 80

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:34.070 
for sure it's a perfect number so 20 80
my<00:05:28.979> number<00:05:29.550> goes<00:05:29.819> off<00:05:29.969> 28<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:33.120> number<00:05:33.419> 28<00:05:33.839> is<00:05:33.870> a

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
my number goes off 28 the number 28 is a

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.040 
my number goes off 28 the number 28 is a
project<00:05:34.319> number<00:05:34.650> awesome<00:05:35.550> now<00:05:36.089> what<00:05:36.719> we<00:05:36.870> want

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
project number awesome now what we want

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.939 
project number awesome now what we want
to<00:05:37.169> do<00:05:37.349> is<00:05:38.389> allow<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.449> user<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:40.080> see<00:05:40.589> what<00:05:40.830> the

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
to do is allow the user to see what the

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.100 
to do is allow the user to see what the
factors<00:05:41.370> are<00:05:41.520> right<00:05:41.699> cuz<00:05:41.969> let's<00:05:42.180> pointless<00:05:42.960> it

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
factors are right cuz let's pointless it

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.749 
factors are right cuz let's pointless it
just<00:05:43.289> points<00:05:43.469> it<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:44.250> know<00:05:44.339> it<00:05:44.430> just<00:05:44.460> prints

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
just points it you know it just prints

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.450 
just points it you know it just prints
out<00:05:44.879> one<00:05:45.060> thing<00:05:45.240> so<00:05:45.990> before<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.919> fourth<00:05:47.129> day<00:05:47.279> n

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
out one thing so before the fourth day n

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.700 
out one thing so before the fourth day n
let's<00:05:47.669> type<00:05:47.940> in<00:05:47.969> system<00:05:48.629> dot<00:05:48.810> out<00:05:48.839> dot<00:05:49.020> print

let's type in system dot out dot print

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.879 
let's type in system dot out dot print
right<00:05:50.550> and<00:05:50.759> then<00:05:51.690> we'll<00:05:51.930> just<00:05:52.139> type<00:05:52.409> in<00:05:52.589> over

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
right and then we'll just type in over

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.850 
right and then we'll just type in over
here<00:05:53.339> the<00:05:53.789> factors<00:05:54.479> factors<00:05:55.139> are<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:57.860> then

here the factors factors are and then

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.760 
here the factors factors are and then
over<00:05:58.979> here<00:05:59.779> what<00:06:00.779> we'll<00:06:00.990> do<00:06:01.289> is<00:06:01.789> we<00:06:02.789> will<00:06:03.770> first

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
over here what we'll do is we will first

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.939 
over here what we'll do is we will first
let<00:06:05.039> it<00:06:05.189> accumulate<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.909> then<00:06:06.180> system<00:06:06.949> dot

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
let it accumulate and then system dot

let it accumulate and then system dot
out<00:06:07.979> dot<00:06:08.689> print<00:06:09.689> and<00:06:09.960> we'll<00:06:10.680> just<00:06:10.830> leave<00:06:10.919> a

that it will spend on the same line

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.790 
that it will spend on the same line
