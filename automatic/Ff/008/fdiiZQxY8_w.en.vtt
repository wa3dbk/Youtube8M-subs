on<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> runway<00:00:50.789> recently<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.570> been<00:00:52.019> more<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.589> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
on the runway recently is been more of a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.099 
on the runway recently is been more of a
trend<00:00:53.070> towards<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> matte<00:00:53.850> skin<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
trend towards a matte skin and so I

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.200 
trend towards a matte skin and so I
think<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.469> we're<00:00:55.859> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.250> evolving<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
think that we're kind of evolving out of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.939 
think that we're kind of evolving out of
that<00:00:57.390> we're<00:00:57.659> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:57.989> more<00:00:58.199> satin

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949

returning to a little bit of highlight

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.109 
returning to a little bit of highlight
on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> cheek<00:01:15.060> okay<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.590> we've<00:01:17.280> seen<00:01:17.670> we

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
on the cheek okay that we we've seen we

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and so on yes I think really the finish

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.550 
and so on yes I think really the finish
that<00:01:22.679> we're<00:01:23.429> gonna<00:01:23.550> change<00:01:24.300> okay<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.200> how

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that we're gonna change okay so how

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.840 
that we're gonna change okay so how
would<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.979> achieve<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.539> mean<00:01:27.750> what

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
would one achieve that what I mean what

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.539 
would one achieve that what I mean what
liquid<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.299> more<00:01:30.630> powders<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.679> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
liquid is or more powders really be the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.999 
liquid is or more powders really be the
type<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.450> foundation<00:01:33.690> you're<00:01:34.140> using<00:01:34.289> I<00:01:34.470> think

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
type of foundation you're using I think

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
type of foundation you're using I think
the<00:01:35.130> liquid<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.179> is<00:01:36.420> an<00:01:36.569> easier<00:01:36.990> way<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the liquid as it is an easier way of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980 
the liquid as it is an easier way of
