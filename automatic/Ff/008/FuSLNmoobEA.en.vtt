increase<00:01:17.270> your<00:01:17.510> ability<00:01:17.689> to<00:01:18.380> uptake<00:01:18.920> oxygen

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
increase your ability to uptake oxygen

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.520 
increase your ability to uptake oxygen
and<00:01:19.909> that's<00:01:20.240> what<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.570> want<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.960> oxygen

to do is I'm going to walk out about 12

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.190 
to do is I'm going to walk out about 12
seconds<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.150> that's<00:01:29.330> going<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.509> be<00:01:29.600> close<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:29.990> a

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
seconds so that's going to be close to a

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.980 
seconds so that's going to be close to a
hundred<00:01:30.380> yards<00:01:30.850> now<00:01:31.850> thats<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.509> little<00:01:32.720> slow

so remember in as the arms go up exhale
as<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:36.980> bring<00:02:37.099> it<00:02:37.280> down<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.750> lot

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
as you bring it down this is a lot

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.380 
as you bring it down this is a lot
harder<00:02:42.170> than<00:02:42.319> it<00:02:42.470> looks<00:02:42.769> but<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:44.150> this

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
harder than it looks but as this

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.520 
harder than it looks but as this
progresses<00:02:45.250> as<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.430> get<00:02:46.549> tired<00:02:47.380> it's<00:02:48.380> going

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
progresses as you get tired it's going

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.400 
progresses as you get tired it's going
to<00:02:48.590> go<00:02:48.680> fast<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.250> going<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.459> be<00:02:49.549> tougher<00:02:49.940> to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
to go fast it's going to be tougher to

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.440 
to go fast it's going to be tougher to
do<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.700> might<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.030> some<00:02:53.269> light

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
