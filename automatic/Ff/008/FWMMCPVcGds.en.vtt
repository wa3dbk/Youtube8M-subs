 hello youtube friends welcome to a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.580
 new tutorial in this video I'm going to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.620
 show how how to make faster 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.790
 samsung galaxy with a very 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 simple installing a gratification for 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.810
 recovery mode 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.849
 good 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.420
 the first thing they are going to do in the first 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.420
 step is 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.960
 drink 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.460
 the file 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.489
 take the file and copy it to the root of 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.220
 his memory 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:47.150
 good as you see I already have it copied 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.980
 here adrenaline engine 4.2 points and the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.980
 next step is to turn off your phone 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.530
 by boat it went out 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.460
 the next step is to turn it on 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:20.430
 these keys go up volume 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.180
 home key and lock key all three 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.180
 at the same time 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.220
 good when the samsung logo appears 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.390
 galaxy gio ugt 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.280
 360 l can drop the three buttons we 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.390
 is going to send a menu that is called 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 recovery and here go to the second good 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.220
 he is clear that in this one the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.530
 touch screen or touch buttons 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.140
 move with these two keys and 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.290
 select with good home they go to the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.110
 second option applicable from physics 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.110
 they choose adrenaline engine 4 points 2 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.520
 points 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.520
 and it will happen to install the application 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.810
 already installed well here we give 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.800
 rebut system no 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.800
 it's bouncing 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.240
 what we did with this application to 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.320
 install you free the memory of 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.720
 our cell phone I think it frees it and 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.270
 optimize the applications so that 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.400
 work in a month with performance and 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.400
 lower RAM memory consumption 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.890
 good 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.890
 we hope you understand 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.970
 and in a rumba like living pounds 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.170
 they will not be removed 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.849
 stress is not going to remove the driver 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.900
 of wifi can remove that nothing what 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.350
 simply help is an application that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.170
 it replaces the ram 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.840
 for what 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.840
 to work at a higher speed 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.180
 I know 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.180
 and me 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.230

 now as you see the beginning of this course 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.920
 It usually takes two minutes but with 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.230
 this application we optimize and now 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.810
 it lights up quicker good 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.640
 like in it coal in less than three 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.870
 seconds charge the minute all things 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.110
 the media scanner is already finished 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.140
 load everything else much faster 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.940
 good all 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.940
