00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello there is an opportunity 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 to make here such forms under 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.360
 micro jig here is one of them 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.650
 mold 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.220
 master you are playing and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.520
 from one is obtained and up to 5 dance forms 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.730
 worth 5 weights means one two three 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.450
 four five framed programs like this 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.380
 Here under collapsible Cheburashka 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 such a mortgage is 3 millimeters wide 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:52.380
 and 05 thick now try to cast and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:01:02.030
 probably even known that we 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:02.030
 turned out going 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.190
 help the truth about time in this glove 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 forward 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:35.400
 and then the thinner the construction sites of 30 m of course 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.040
 case without air flooded 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.880
 selling a gas outlet is, but still 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.660
 the form must be heated unica 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:53.460
 stream trick in lichke 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:03:03.140
 now we will analyze it okay 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:12.470
 it turned out now we will analyze here 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:15.740
 there is a form soon now we are building scales and 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.740
 although they 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.430
 like that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:04:16.110
 you can see everything can be seen one by one now life 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:16.110
 we are supposed to have one gram 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:29.639
 recognize sprue remelting such here 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.639
 such a micro jig 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.680
 and build up 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:53.629
 we throw on the gas and our one and one gram 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:05:03.169
 Well, of course if the gift network for you 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:03.169
 tenechke here because after the back water 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:07.189
 kiss ok 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:18.430
 so one now we have the idea 2 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:25.449
 gram 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.449
 need to be here it is 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:45.340
 two signs are not visible this gap about the sheet 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:55.140
 thin yes but here there is yes yes here 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:06:08.110
 Well, we throw it on the scales 2 grams exactly 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:11.830
 Now on 3 of us goes pretty 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.990
 interesting form atomic rajiv not so 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.160
 difficult to manufacture as complex 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.160
 weights fit 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:25.180
 but 3 exactly three 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:29.940
 but want them this copper surely will affect 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.140
 Of course lead in different on brand there 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.430
 density times on this 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.840
 this larch of males small 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:47.410
 I think the battery will of course 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:54.870
 different so something like this here in our 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:57.940
 four heights of this and how would the idea 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.190
 should be 5 grams in this steer 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:05.040
 last well, I kind of did not push him 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:09.250
 minimum person says that's 4 grams 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.990
 he doesn't need a cat anymore 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.860
 and it turns out to be old 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:18.790
 Unido 5 did not overclock but how did it happen 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:25.860
 here four and a half Kiryusha can 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:28.860
 will somehow use here such here 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.860
 weights 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.790
 such is the form 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:48.860
 pretty neatly small 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:55.190
 got it 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.190
 successful fishing to new meetings
