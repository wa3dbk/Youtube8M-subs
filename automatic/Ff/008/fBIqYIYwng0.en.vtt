at<00:00:01.810> the<00:00:01.930> end<00:00:02.020> of<00:00:02.080> the<00:00:02.139> day<00:00:02.230> it's<00:00:02.409> just<00:00:02.710> feeling

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.100 
at the end of the day it's just feeling

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.679 
at the end of the day it's just feeling
it's<00:00:03.340> even<00:00:03.639> more<00:00:03.790> important<00:00:04.240> than<00:00:04.330> the<00:00:04.450> sound

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:04.689 
it's even more important than the sound

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:18.029 
it's even more important than the sound
of<00:00:04.870> it<00:00:04.960> there's<00:00:05.109> a<00:00:05.170> feel<00:00:05.350> right<00:00:16.859> part<00:00:17.859> of<00:00:17.980> the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
of it there's a feel right part of the

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.019 
of it there's a feel right part of the
record<00:00:18.369> started<00:00:18.880> out<00:00:19.029> from<00:00:19.449> a<00:00:19.630> sort<00:00:19.990> of<00:00:20.019> sonic

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
record started out from a sort of sonic

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.210 
record started out from a sort of sonic
rhythmic<00:00:22.080> instrumentation<00:00:23.080> aspect<00:00:23.740> bringing

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
rhythmic instrumentation aspect bringing

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.460 
rhythmic instrumentation aspect bringing
things<00:00:24.369> together<00:00:24.579> that<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.749> hadn't<00:00:26.259> done

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
things together that I hadn't done

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.490 
things together that I hadn't done
before<00:00:30.539> I've<00:00:31.539> written<00:00:31.779> with<00:00:32.020> drum<00:00:32.200> machines

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
before I've written with drum machines

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.140 
before I've written with drum machines
and<00:00:32.680> banjos<00:00:33.100> most<00:00:33.430> of<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.670> last<00:00:33.850> decade

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
and banjos most of the last decade

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.240 
and banjos most of the last decade
that's<00:00:34.810> primarily<00:00:35.230> what<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.530> used<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:35.950> write

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
that's primarily what I used to write

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.600 
that's primarily what I used to write
and<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:37.360> there's<00:00:37.570> always<00:00:37.720> been<00:00:37.960> this<00:00:38.080> robotic

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and so there's always been this robotic

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.750 
and so there's always been this robotic
rhythmic<00:00:39.610> element<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.920> organic<00:00:42.190> music

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
rhythmic element to the organic music

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.400 
rhythmic element to the organic music
and<00:00:43.000> I<00:00:43.240> love<00:00:43.540> how<00:00:43.630> those<00:00:43.780> two<00:00:43.960> things<00:00:43.990> come

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
and I love how those two things come

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:53.040 
and I love how those two things come
together

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.229 

I'm<00:00:53.649> not<00:00:53.890> trying<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.460> make<00:00:54.579> a<00:00:54.640> record<00:00:54.879> that

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
I'm not trying to make a record that

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.119 
I'm not trying to make a record that
doesn't<00:00:55.510> sound<00:00:55.600> anything<00:00:55.719> like<00:00:56.020> me<00:00:56.620> in<00:00:56.920> some

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
doesn't sound anything like me in some

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.160 
doesn't sound anything like me in some
ways<00:00:57.309> that's<00:00:57.489> easy<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:58.120> do<00:00:58.300> it's<00:00:58.690> easy<00:00:58.840> to<00:00:59.050> go

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
ways that's easy to do it's easy to go

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.119 
ways that's easy to do it's easy to go
and<00:00:59.290> make<00:00:59.379> a<00:00:59.410> record<00:00:59.649> that<00:00:59.770> doesn't<00:00:59.920> sound

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
and make a record that doesn't sound

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.110 
and make a record that doesn't sound
anything<00:01:00.430> like<00:01:00.640> me

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
anything like me

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.880 
anything like me
I<00:01:01.270> can<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:01.660> can<00:01:01.750> go<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.230> do<00:01:02.320> that<00:01:02.440> but<00:01:02.620> trying<00:01:02.829> to

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
I can I can go and do that but trying to

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.890 
I can I can go and do that but trying to
make<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.010> record<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:04.000> sounds<00:01:04.330> like<00:01:04.420> me<00:01:04.629> but<00:01:04.839> uh

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
make a record that sounds like me but uh

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.570 
make a record that sounds like me but uh
trying<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.350> expand<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.860> that's<00:01:06.250> all<00:01:06.430> I've<00:01:06.550> been

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
trying to expand it that's all I've been

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:20.490 
trying to expand it that's all I've been
trying<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.030> do<00:01:07.240> I<00:01:19.080> certainly<00:01:20.080> couldn't<00:01:20.320> pick

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
trying to do I certainly couldn't pick

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.560 
trying to do I certainly couldn't pick
one<00:01:20.530> song<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.399> I<00:01:21.430> think<00:01:21.729> tells<00:01:22.180> you<00:01:22.360> what<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
one song that I think tells you what the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.060 
one song that I think tells you what the
records<00:01:22.899> like<00:01:23.110> there<00:01:23.440> really<00:01:23.530> wasn't<00:01:23.770> one

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
records like there really wasn't one

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.029 
records like there really wasn't one
song<00:01:24.369> seem<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.940> do<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.539> so<00:01:25.960> I'm<00:01:26.350> really
