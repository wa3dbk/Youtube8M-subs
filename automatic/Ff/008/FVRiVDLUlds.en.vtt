00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.719
 that of 1000 feet or a game of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.610
 team and trust can search 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.559
 children aged 7 and up 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.410
 at least a minimum of two players this 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 to make your tree 2 mm hg now 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.590
 we see the layout of the field of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.300
 game we should have a line 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.740
 at the beginning is an end line 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.779
 teams will be excused 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.250
 centipedes will be placed at the beginning 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.930
 so let's say we have two teams 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:42.750
 arranged in a single row 2 3 4 and 5 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:44.399
 pomponi 14 and the fifth component now 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.170
 everyone will say they will then put one 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.149
 classical finian or we can 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.570
 find it even train everyone will have the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.140
 hands on the child's shoulders 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.920
 thus precedes all children 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.109
 will be blindfolded first second third e 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.870
 except the fourth and fifth of the fifth 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.630
 made that is what looks will be 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 what can command the direction 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.280
 take the centipede mine comes 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.320
 in fact it must go from position to is 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.409
 was the function behind the position 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.409
 of therefore opposite to the other field of the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.869
 in the end line in our field of 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.810
 game admits torino feet where 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.899
 to go 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.479
 I did exactly the opposite one will have to 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.149
 go to the position of while the other 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.460
 thousand and tp where to go to the opposition 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.200
 making therefore a path of this 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.720
 kind of trying to go to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.270
 collide with the other centipede like 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.189
 makes the player who is last in the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.450
 final diana to command centipede 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.979
 does with holes then no two touches in 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.530
 this way means a thousand feet 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.030
 can go ahead in a straight way two 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.189
 touch on the shoulder of the partner with a 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.440
 winning a mouse on the right shoulder 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.390
 means that it can turn right a 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.909
 toto on the left shoulder means that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.979
 only one touch can be turned to the left 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.539
 means that he absolutely must 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.459
 stop because there is some danger that 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.530
 obstacle for example you can too 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.959
 think of inserting along the path 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.580
 some boxes some obstacle 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.430
 something short that makes the game a 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.959
 slightly more spicy we say of course the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.640
 child receiving orders then 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.560
 let's admit that twice must go 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.569
 forward must place orders back to 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.190
 child who preceded him the one for 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.410
 one hundred of a child what he sees us like this 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.090
 away so there must be more than that if 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.640
 what is indicated by the driver 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.470
 also great group combination for 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.570
 various children to reach the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.090
 position in the final position ad 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.459
 example is what you can enter is always 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.799
 well every game give a prize maybe 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.180
 which can also be a reward or willful 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.900
 it ca n't be a snack so maybe 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.220
 in the end you put five slices of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.130
 cake you have prepared 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.049
 or you put 5 cookies you have 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.980
 homemade the day before or 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.840
 maybe brought out a baby 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.400
 I have some good sweets because he must 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.590
 you can celebrate your own birthday 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.610
 maybe subdivide it to the various children 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.349
 present for the game 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.060
 then maybe leave it as but obviously 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.440
 because then everyone will go to whoever arrives 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.690
 first who arrives second 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.940
 the purpose of this game is like all the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.239
 games the one to have fun and look for 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.040
 therefore without falling without distraction 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.560
 without loosening the mind from the train of 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.860
 to get from the life of lithium to that of 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.860
 China
