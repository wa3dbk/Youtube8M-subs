be a printer with a lot of bells and
whistles<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.870> still<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.260> easy<00:00:55.350> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
whistles but it's still really easy to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.779 
whistles but it's still really easy to
use<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.340> could<00:00:56.460> walk<00:00:56.640> yourself

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
camera phones and such would meet within

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.890 
camera phones and such would meet within
their<00:01:17.670> product<00:01:18.030> portfolio<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.720> could

we're close to it and just beams a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.749 
we're close to it and just beams a
picture<00:01:21.990> over<00:01:22.080> exactly<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.040> easy<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.640> is

now<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.079> locked<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
now you don't have to be locked down to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
now you don't have to be locked down to
where<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> computer<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.060> pretty

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
where the computer is you can pretty

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.609 
where the computer is you can pretty
well<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.810> thing<00:01:40.049> anywhere<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.530> the

everybody's introducing a laptop into
their<00:01:50.159> home<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.850> easier<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> move

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
from room to room so the last thing you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
from room to room so the last thing you
want<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.939> trapped<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> large

the house and Wireless allows you to do

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
the house and Wireless allows you to do
that<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:04.170> you're<00:02:04.320> looking<00:02:04.439> at<00:02:04.680> all<00:02:04.770> in

once this one here's got a higher-end
scanner<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.049> what<00:02:07.229> should<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.649> looking

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
scanner like what should you be looking

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.619 
scanner like what should you be looking
for<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> want<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:09.119> some<00:02:09.360> high

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
for if you want to take some high

for if you want to take some high
quality<00:02:09.690> scans<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.099> at<00:02:11.400> its

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
quality scans that's right this at its

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the C 80 180

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.009 
the C 80 180
$4.99<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.640> price<00:02:14.849> point<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.750> gives

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
$4.99 is the price point and it gives

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.500 
$4.99 is the price point and it gives
you<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.650> highest<00:02:16.890> level<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.370> scanning<00:02:17.610> 9600

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
you the highest level of scanning 9600

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.899 
you the highest level of scanning 9600
dpi<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.349> what's<00:02:19.890> unique<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.400> this<00:02:20.700> is

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
dpi and what's unique is that this is

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.360 
dpi and what's unique is that this is
six<00:02:21.420> color<00:02:21.900> scanning<00:02:22.470> versus<00:02:22.860> typical

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
six color scanning versus typical

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.399 
six color scanning versus typical
scanners<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.940> all-in-ones<00:02:24.360> are<00:02:24.480> three<00:02:25.110> color

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
scanners on all-in-ones are three color

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.530 
scanners on all-in-ones are three color
so<00:02:26.010> you're<00:02:26.310> getting<00:02:26.700> obviously<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> larger

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
so you're getting obviously a larger

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.839 
so you're getting obviously a larger
range<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.200> color<00:02:28.440> variation<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.519> truer

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
range of color variation so the truer

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.789 
range of color variation so the truer
color<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.989> image<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.260> you're<00:02:31.560> scanning

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
color of the image that you're scanning

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.720 
color of the image that you're scanning
as<00:02:32.069> well<00:02:32.909> it's<00:02:33.269> 96<00:02:34.019> bit<00:02:34.319> which<00:02:35.099> is<00:02:35.129> important

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
as well it's 96 bit which is important

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.430 
as well it's 96 bit which is important
because<00:02:35.819> you're<00:02:36.000> getting<00:02:36.390> down<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.930> kind<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.319> a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
because you're getting down to kind of a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.530 
because you're getting down to kind of a
granular<00:02:37.829> level<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.430> photo<00:02:38.670> closer<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
granular level of that photo closer and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.880 
granular level of that photo closer and
deeper<00:02:39.870> into<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.349> image<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.739> you're

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
deeper into the image that you're

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.670 
deeper into the image that you're
scanning<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:41.459> as<00:02:42.090> well<00:02:42.269> there's<00:02:42.599> six<00:02:43.019> optics

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
scanning and as well there's six optics

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.619 
scanning and as well there's six optics
so<00:02:43.860> usually<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> scanner<00:02:44.670> has<00:02:44.879> one<00:02:45.239> optic

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
so usually a scanner has one optic

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.630 
so usually a scanner has one optic
covering<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.440> whole<00:02:46.590> page<00:02:46.859> this<00:02:47.250> gives<00:02:47.489> you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
covering the whole page this gives you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.420 
covering the whole page this gives you
six<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.019> looks<00:02:49.290> across<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:50.099> page

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
six and so it looks across that page

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.420 
six and so it looks across that page
that<00:02:50.459> you've<00:02:50.940> taken<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.780> scan<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.470> bridges

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that you've taken a scan of and bridges

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.039 
that you've taken a scan of and bridges
and<00:02:53.670> gives<00:02:53.819> you<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.060> clearest<00:02:54.450> consistent

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
and gives you the clearest consistent

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.410 
and gives you the clearest consistent
kind<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.709> surface<00:02:56.310> across<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:57.060> scanned

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
kind of surface across that scanned

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.330 
kind of surface across that scanned
image<00:02:57.780> which<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.260> important<00:02:58.829> if<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.069> of

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
image which is important if you think of

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.369 
image which is important if you think of
scanning<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.940> magazine<00:03:00.480> cover<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.900> could<00:03:01.230> be

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
scanning a magazine cover that could be

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.110 
scanning a magazine cover that could be
glossy<00:03:01.709> sometimes<00:03:02.640> there's<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:02.879> weird

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
glossy sometimes there's this weird

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.149 
glossy sometimes there's this weird
shadow<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.659> happens<00:03:04.049> where<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.409> magazine

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
shadow that happens where that magazine

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.949 
shadow that happens where that magazine
had<00:03:05.370> like<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.609> glossy<00:03:06.120> or<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.569> get<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> more<00:03:06.930> a

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
had like a glossy or you get a more a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.479 
had like a glossy or you get a more a
kind<00:03:07.319> of<00:03:07.409> that's<00:03:07.560> right<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.129> so<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:08.400> this

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
kind of that's right and so what this

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.130 
kind of that's right and so what this
does<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.060> gives<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.329> that<00:03:09.599> equilibrium

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
does is it gives you that equilibrium

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.649 
does is it gives you that equilibrium

getting advanced scanning we give you a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.229 
getting advanced scanning we give you a
negative<00:03:19.109> and<00:03:19.560> slide<00:03:19.829> adapter<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:21.000> with<00:03:21.150> the

negative and slide adapter you're

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.460 
negative and slide adapter you're
scanning<00:03:23.220> up<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.700> four<00:03:23.940> slides<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.200> whole

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
set of negatives here and then you can

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.500 
set of negatives here and then you can
still<00:03:27.630> use<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.169> touchscreen<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:29.239> modify<00:03:30.239> that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
still use the touchscreen to modify that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.110 
still use the touchscreen to modify that
slide<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:31.349> it<00:03:31.500> correcting<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.519> for<00:03:32.730> color<00:03:32.879> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
slide be it correcting it for color and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.720 
slide be it correcting it for color and
balances<00:03:33.840> or<00:03:34.109> correcting<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.650> for<00:03:34.889> lines<00:03:35.519> and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
balances or correcting it for lines and

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.460 
balances or correcting it for lines and
weird<00:03:35.970> creases<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.540> such<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> lot<00:03:37.290> of

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
weird creases and such so a lot of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.470 
weird creases and such so a lot of
things<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.859> could<00:03:37.980> do<00:03:38.160> with<00:03:38.190> this<00:03:38.579> scanner

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
things you could do with this scanner

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.150 
things you could do with this scanner
well<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.810> guess<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.139> important<00:03:40.530> too<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.950> far

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
well I guess that's important too as far

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.140 
well I guess that's important too as far
as<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.310> know<00:03:41.400> we<00:03:41.489> talked<00:03:41.669> about<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.910> scanner

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
as you know we talked about the scanner

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.759 
as you know we talked about the scanner
quality<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.720> higher<00:03:42.930> scanner<00:03:43.349> quality

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
quality the higher scanner quality

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.559 
quality the higher scanner quality
important<00:03:44.579> when<00:03:44.819> you<00:03:44.910> are<00:03:45.030> scanning<00:03:45.299> and

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
important when you are scanning and

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.229 
important when you are scanning and
negatives<00:03:45.900> or<00:03:46.019> slides<00:03:46.260> yes<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.430> one<00:03:48.090> thing

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
negatives or slides yes so one thing

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.670 
negatives or slides yes so one thing
that<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.419> kind<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.810> got<00:03:48.930> me<00:03:49.019> excited<00:03:49.230> about<00:03:49.500> this

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
that I kind of got me excited about this

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.580 
that I kind of got me excited about this
one<00:03:49.859> it's<00:03:50.669> got<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:50.879> DVD<00:03:51.629> burner<00:03:51.900> built<00:03:52.319> into

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
one it's got a DVD burner built into

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.020 
one it's got a DVD burner built into
this<00:03:52.680> little<00:03:52.889> guy<00:03:53.040> pretty<00:03:53.280> cool<00:03:53.519> unique<00:03:53.879> to

this little guy pretty cool unique to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.150 
this little guy pretty cool unique to
HP's<00:03:54.449> so<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.260> premise<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.040> you

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
HP's so the premise here is that you

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.830 
HP's so the premise here is that you
would<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.489> lot<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.970> photos<00:03:57.389> on<00:03:57.629> your

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
would have a lot of photos on your

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.349 
would have a lot of photos on your
memory<00:03:58.169> card<00:03:58.260> or<00:03:58.919> even<00:03:59.090> documents<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.269> you

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
memory card or even documents and you

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.460 
memory card or even documents and you
want<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.660> burn<00:04:00.810> them<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.139> don't<00:04:01.199> want<00:04:01.319> to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
want to burn them but you don't want to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.280 
want to burn them but you don't want to
power<00:04:01.680> up<00:04:02.069> your<00:04:02.310> PC<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:02.970> instead<00:04:03.599> walk<00:04:03.900> up<00:04:04.079> to

that is most of my burn CDs and DVDs but
you<00:04:34.560> know<00:04:34.650> that's<00:04:34.740> important<00:04:35.250> because<00:04:35.340> you

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
you know that's important because you

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.429 
you know that's important because you

computer and I don't think people always
back<00:04:40.110> up<00:04:40.139> stuff<00:04:40.620> like<00:04:40.740> they're<00:04:40.979> supposed<00:04:41.280> to
