00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello welcome to my channel the words 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.640
 of faith in youtube I am a fan and today we go 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.019
 to talk about the purposes of reading and 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.610
 other things that I have in 2015 when 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.269
 I say other things I mean like that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.820
 related to the channel I think but as you know 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 in the last year good if it is already what 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.970
 they saw I do not know I made two videos of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.340
 I'm going to clean them in double 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.830
 to check but if I do not explain 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.599
 Last year, review the video of the year 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.220
 ancestor to see what there was 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.750
 fulfilled what he had not fulfilled and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 had selected what was to follow 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.590
 doing what I'm doing 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.660
 this year I gave up completely and neither 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.280
 I even saw the previous videos and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.520
 I'm like that waiting for the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.079
 Lord enlightened me and I decided to erase it 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.660
 all because he is not doing anything 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.820
 I was having a lot really nothing 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.160
 I felt bad, I decided that I did not achieve anything 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 had very intense things that maybe 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 only with you have the whole year 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.170
 to make the words and like that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.300
 that I decided to completely renew 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.949
 what I 'm going to try to do this year 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.259
 and I think my biggest mistake was that I had 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.680
 very specific purposes that I'm going to 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.210
 do exactly this and so I decided 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.009
 change that and do it a little more 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 general to give me the freedom that 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.240
 during the year depends on what 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.320
 that I also want to read to 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.799
 Although I'm doing certain 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 purposes because we already saw explanations 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 in suspense practically bone for 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.259
 people believe and which one I keep mysterious name 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.659
 none practically and not even 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.340
 touch review I'm almost sure that 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.869
 none of the five purposes this year 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.049
 also the first purpose is to finish 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.049
 my earrings sagas not the same year 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:53.710
 and it's not that it's open because I do not have 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.790
 written to finish all my wings 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.670
 simply finish pending rooms 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.500
 some like for example UFO 's 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.180
 scott our cell I want to finish 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.460
 because I liked the mind a lot but what 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:11.050
 I have to reread because he only listens to me 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.730
 same super strawberry appetite listen to you 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.430
 as a web traffic officer that I saw 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.560
 how we fix it but today I have to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.240
 it's called treason in Spanish and I have it 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.300
 to reread because it's a moment I liked 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.920
 a lot but I feel like I do not know how I 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.390
 it seems that everything is in process is not 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.880
 stop 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.150
 I went to emerging Italian 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.120
 cabanillas ok the number two is reading 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.140
 all the graphic novels that I have and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.209
 not finished 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.800
 this includes compilations of commits a 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.100
 grave error of violas brought and teach 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.630
 the stories I have 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.630
 it's more I think we can do that 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:03:02.280
 because he is not a lover are all the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.000
 graphic novels that I have not read that are 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.660
 enough 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.030
 or at least here because they are 3 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.620
 are about seven volumes and large that 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.960
 it's not that I do not want to read them simply 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.000
 I bought them and I have them there 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.620
 they give them to me I have them there I concentrate 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.430
 I do not know anything else, there are few that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.990
 immediately 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.180
 I'm going to read but I do believe that 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.230
 we can perfectly finish that and if 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.480
 apart I have to update you 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.860
 with some because they are things that go to 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.650
 pass the movies then I have to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:38.310
 read already the number three is something that 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.870
 I complain the previous video waits the great 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.090
 current with the books that I am reading 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.520
 normally people have like a 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.190
 good law of 50 books this year on 30 o 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.100
 the 100 80 to whatever it is I never follow that 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.610
 because it is true that it is common and as a 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.440
 bad motivation I feel that you are leaving me 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.420
 really motivate but it's never 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.120
 noted that the book is good then 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.670
 I want this year not for numbers but for 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.920
 have a north of which I read this year 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.120
 thus making it easier to select the top 5 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.000
 the 2015 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.150
 I have a purpose of book tuber I suppose 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.580
 make more videos of my favorite books 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.300
 because as you know I have many books 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.450
 that I like 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.500
 and I have not made video of him for example 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.780
 They say where is your life in Peter Pan 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.110
 where is your life the thieves books 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.240
 my conflict with this is that I have already 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.550
 discussed in several in several videos that 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.100
 I feel like I'm going to do it wrong that I do not 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.720
 I will do well enough and 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.300
 as I like saying that I'm leaving 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.550
 disappointed himself and the author if any 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.930
 see the video that more or less happened with 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.700
 the normal person is very nervous with 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.830
 this and benito finished watching it and I 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.180
 I was crying from all 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.920
 feelings together what I have is the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.490
 conflict like I'm not going to like 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.130
 and it gives me a lot of slope then 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.110
 this year I want to talk more about those 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.970
 books that I like which is going to be 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.470
 hard work I hope it's a bit 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.060
 understandable maybe they see it as a 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.600
 chewing gum are probably not it and the 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.880
 number five is a purpose is wrong 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.360
 the reader also do not know in what category 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.540
 It fits this is what I want to get out of my 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.330
 mind a story that I bring 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.900
 since since when was born face I have 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.490
 like november the story is new but 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.590
 I bring it very present and all the time 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.280
 I'm thinking about what to add and how 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.280
 do it but I'm not writing it or 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.280
 simply 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.200
 do not even do it like in shape or does 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.690
 take out a whole story or a book not 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.100
 just get it out of my mind maybe 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.840
 in the process of getting it out of your mind 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.180
 put it on paper will be transformed into 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.650
 something else I'm not sure and I think the 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.570
 This year's purposes are much more 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.730
 quiet that those of other years I believe 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.930
 that we will do well this year let's hope 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.530
 special because I'm not demanding 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.480
 a lot so I do not know if you guys have 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.010
 purposes for this year maybe not 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.170
 necessarily reading but from other 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.580
 things tell me in the comments or if 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.260
 They will take some of which I will 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.850
 I'm saying how to finish your wings 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.800
 earrings that is quite common 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.810
 that we do not do that is all for this 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.670
 video I leave the videos I've made 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.200
 the two previous years in the dublin 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.020
 watch the following video the least 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.919
 comments 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.919
 all right 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.870
 why 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.639
 You already know that I have pending 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.199
 two of the earrings and if you want 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:45.449
 do it, you can call them sagas or 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:50.120
 encyclopedias 34 38 and those of 1934 today 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.120
 as in 18 19 3
