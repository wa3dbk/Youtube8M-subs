is<00:01:13.329> a<00:01:13.359> passive<00:01:13.960> cab<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:15.100> what<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.430> means

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
is a passive cab so what that means

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.880 
is a passive cab so what that means
passive<00:01:16.390> is<00:01:16.570> there<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.960> no<00:01:17.229> internal

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
passive is there is no internal

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.660 
passive is there is no internal

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
amplifier in the pvx 15 you will need to

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.230 
amplifier in the pvx 15 you will need to
get<00:01:21.850> an<00:01:22.030> external<00:01:22.869> amplifier<00:01:23.429> to<00:01:24.429> get<00:01:24.939> some

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
get an external amplifier to get some

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
sound out of this video now if I just

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.450 
sound out of this video now if I just
show<00:01:28.929> you<00:01:28.960> now<00:01:29.200> what<00:01:29.409> I'm<00:01:29.499> going<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.679> do<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.100> I'm

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
show you now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.389 
show you now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.640> pick<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:30.969> up<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.399> it's

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
going to pick it up it is it's

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.910 
going to pick it up it is it's
relatively<00:01:33.909> heavy<00:01:34.329> but<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.380> beauty<00:01:35.859> about

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
relatively heavy but the beauty about

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.399 
relatively heavy but the beauty about
this<00:01:36.210> similarly<00:01:37.210> with<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.780> 12-inch

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
this similarly with the 12-inch

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.239 
this similarly with the 12-inch
is<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:39.369> can<00:01:39.640> use<00:01:39.909> this<00:01:40.149> as<00:01:40.420> a<00:01:40.499> monitor<00:01:41.499> there

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
is you can use this as a monitor there

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.029 
is you can use this as a monitor there
you<00:01:42.369> go<00:01:42.520> if<00:01:42.729> I<00:01:42.850> put<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.240> now<00:01:43.450> like<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.289> it's

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
you go if I put that now like that it's

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.910 
you go if I put that now like that it's
sort<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:45.939> facing<00:01:46.810> me<00:01:46.899> around<00:01:47.170> about<00:01:47.319> a<00:01:47.350> 45

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
sort of facing me around about a 45

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.669 
sort of facing me around about a 45
degree<00:01:47.950> angle<00:01:48.340> which<00:01:48.969> is<00:01:48.999> ideal<00:01:49.840> for<00:01:49.869> let's

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
degree angle which is ideal for let's

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.889 
degree angle which is ideal for let's
say<00:01:50.890> someone<00:01:51.369> who<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.880> singer<00:01:52.509> maybe<00:01:52.780> a

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
say someone who is a singer maybe a

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.510 
say someone who is a singer maybe a
member<00:01:53.259> in<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.409> band<00:01:53.649> playing<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.039> guitar<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
member in a band playing the guitar the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.789 
member in a band playing the guitar the
bass<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.299> it<00:01:55.420> can<00:01:55.659> be<00:01:55.810> used<00:01:55.960> as<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.200> monitor<00:01:56.679> as

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
bass so it can be used as a monitor as

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.279 
bass so it can be used as a monitor as
well<00:01:57.009> two<00:01:57.939> handles<00:01:58.389> on<00:01:58.539> it<00:01:58.600> there's<00:01:59.049> one<00:01:59.079> at

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
well two handles on it there's one at

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.099 
well two handles on it there's one at
the<00:01:59.409> top<00:01:59.619> here<00:01:59.829> now<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.490> recommend<00:02:01.270> it's<00:02:01.780> quite

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
the top here now I recommend it's quite

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.129 
the top here now I recommend it's quite
heavy<00:02:02.319> so<00:02:02.590> if<00:02:03.310> you're<00:02:03.700> very<00:02:03.880> strong<00:02:04.299> fine<00:02:04.869> if

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
heavy so if you're very strong fine if

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.440 
heavy so if you're very strong fine if
you're<00:02:05.289> not<00:02:05.350> then<00:02:06.159> make<00:02:06.700> sure<00:02:06.729> it's<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:07.090> two-man

image<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:49.220> match<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.670> one<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.120> then<00:02:50.900> you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
image to match this one and then you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.050 
image to match this one and then you
could<00:02:51.290> go<00:02:51.470> into<00:02:51.769> your<00:02:51.950> base<00:02:52.190> speaker<00:02:52.640> out<00:02:52.790> of

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
could go into your base speaker out of

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.080 
could go into your base speaker out of
your<00:02:53.209> base<00:02:53.390> into<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.620> 15<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.160> horn<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.610> then

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
your base into the 15 and horn and then

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.330 
your base into the 15 and horn and then
if<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.360> base<00:02:56.540> speaker<00:02:57.019> has<00:02:57.260> got<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.739> pole<00:02:58.099> mount

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
if the base speaker has got a pole mount

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.190 
if the base speaker has got a pole mount
as<00:02:58.519> well<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:59.180> probably<00:02:59.360> need<00:02:59.629> a<00:02:59.660> piece<00:03:00.170> of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
as well you probably need a piece of

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.740 
as well you probably need a piece of
pole<00:03:00.530> maybe<00:03:00.950> about<00:03:01.190> two<00:03:01.430> foot<00:03:01.670> long<00:03:01.910> so<00:03:02.599> then

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
pole maybe about two foot long so then

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.869 
pole maybe about two foot long so then
this<00:03:03.019> will<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.349> really<00:03:03.739> it'd<00:03:04.040> be<00:03:04.370> quite<00:03:04.610> high
