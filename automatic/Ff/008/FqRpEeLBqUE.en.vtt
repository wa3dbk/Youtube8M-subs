00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:28.229 
earlier and it was hideous because I

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:30.290 
earlier and it was hideous because I
didn't<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.649> any<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.729> fondant<00:00:30.149> colors

and you see I have this rolled out here

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.380 
and you see I have this rolled out here
now<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.620> would<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.060> would<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.240> had

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
told me the difference between the gum

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.010 
told me the difference between the gum
paste<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.580> fondant<00:02:54.150> because<00:02:54.540> earlier<00:02:54.930> I

was working with fondant and now it's

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.600 
was working with fondant and now it's
all<00:02:56.760> melted<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.500> everything<00:02:58.500> over<00:02:58.770> my<00:02:58.950> my

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
all melted and everything over my my

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.990 
all melted and everything over my my
lame-o<00:03:00.000> cake<00:03:00.240> but<00:03:00.990> um<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.160> gum<00:03:02.790> paste

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
lame-o cake but um the the gum paste

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.200 
lame-o cake but um the the gum paste
will<00:03:03.240> actually<00:03:03.690> harden<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:05.120> it'll<00:03:06.120> be

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
will actually harden and it'll be

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.520 
will actually harden and it'll be
something<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.840> probably<00:03:06.960> won't<00:03:07.410> want

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
something that you probably won't want

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.530 
something that you probably won't want
to<00:03:07.620> eat<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.130> just<00:03:08.310> take<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:08.580> off<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.000> you

know<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.210> and<00:03:12.930> I'm<00:03:13.590> learning<00:03:13.740> as<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.130> go<00:03:14.160> so

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
are part of the cut so I'm going to cut

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.330 
are part of the cut so I'm going to cut
this<00:03:27.510> once<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:27.930> pink<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.380> I'm<00:03:28.920> going<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.160> cut

inches so I'll do two and a half the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.699 
inches so I'll do two and a half the
blade<00:03:41.160> depth<00:03:41.460> is<00:03:41.640> already<00:03:41.910> set<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:43.320> have<00:03:43.470> my

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
blade depth is already set and I have my

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.120 
blade depth is already set and I have my
pressure<00:03:44.310> on<00:03:44.610> three<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.420> my<00:03:46.260> speed<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.590> on<00:03:46.830> two

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
pressure on three and my speed is on two

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.330 
pressure on three and my speed is on two
so<00:03:47.730> now<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.240> need<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.510> press<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:50.070> flower

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
now I'm going to hit repeat last and

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.679 
now I'm going to hit repeat last and
it'll<00:05:47.550> cut<00:05:47.699> a<00:05:47.729> flower<00:05:48.000> but<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.270> great<00:05:48.479> thing

then I'm going to put one over here just

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.140 
then I'm going to put one over here just
kind<00:07:04.919> of<00:07:04.979> guessing<00:07:05.189> where<00:07:05.490> I<00:07:05.550> want<00:07:05.759> them<00:07:05.879> to<00:07:06.000> go

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
kind of guessing where I want them to go

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.089 
kind of guessing where I want them to go
and<00:07:06.360> then<00:07:07.020> I<00:07:07.139> can<00:07:07.319> feel<00:07:07.500> it<00:07:07.680> already<00:07:07.860> getting

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
and then I can feel it already getting

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:12.000 
and then I can feel it already getting
really<00:07:08.430> hard<00:07:08.669> and

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.010 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.040 

now<00:07:13.010> what<00:07:13.430> I<00:07:13.460> could<00:07:13.790> have<00:07:13.850> done<00:07:14.060> also<00:07:14.270> was<00:07:14.840> kind

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
now what I could have done also was kind

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.780 
now what I could have done also was kind
of<00:07:15.200> while<00:07:15.350> it<00:07:15.440> was<00:07:15.590> moist<00:07:16.040> or<00:07:16.370> what<00:07:16.520> I<00:07:16.669> was

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:16.790 
of while it was moist or what I was

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.320 
of while it was moist or what I was
pliable<00:07:17.540> I<00:07:17.780> could<00:07:18.560> have<00:07:18.770> you<00:07:19.760> know<00:07:19.790> lifted<00:07:20.240> it

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
pliable I could have you know lifted it

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.390 
pliable I could have you know lifted it
up<00:07:20.419> a<00:07:20.540> little<00:07:20.660> bit<00:07:20.900> and<00:07:21.260> messed<00:07:22.070> around<00:07:22.220> with

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
up a little bit and messed around with

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.560 
up a little bit and messed around with
it<00:07:22.580> but<00:07:22.760> here<00:07:23.450> we<00:07:23.570> go<00:07:24.490> that<00:07:25.490> is<00:07:25.550> just<00:07:25.880> one<00:07:26.240> thing
