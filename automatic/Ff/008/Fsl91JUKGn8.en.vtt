 police 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:24.329
 england advantage or pest cars from the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:02:14.849

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:34.200
 did on twitter what 's up there the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.180
 experience analytics a dance 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.139
 this is now rubicon mango from england 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.930
 strictly speaking, in london 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:11.230
 and here you have 8% mango puree 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.769
 processed which was well worth it 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.359
 because it is an absolute blast 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.920
 Product always has a lot of sugar too 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:24.099
 that's right 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:27.550
 13 days apologize that please 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.660
 and sometimes there is noise and in any case 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.540
 yes that's a shower usually has 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.370
 you always only that one beside each 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.340
 Tastes after tasting and are 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.440
 that has really nice and warm after 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.160
 taste is also slightly bitter 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:54.940
 I would say something like that 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:59.310
 similar to Italian so on me 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:04.290
 it really is also a bit sour 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.290
 or is it more acidic than bitter 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.810
 how fruits are it 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.459
 probably the best mango is 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.410
 Shower that I drank on one 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.880
 full of fabric and yes that with the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.960
 sugar is of course a bit grassy 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.280
 13 grams of sugar on in the minute 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.039
 but I say so I mean you can do it 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.970
 yes with water stretch 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.240
 I always have one 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.240
 mineral water standing around 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.640
 that's not just saying there it is 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.780
 and then you stretch that and then 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.780
 you have the worst 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.110
 stretched it is not the same anymore 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.659
 work healthier well have the rubikon 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.610
 drunk 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.139
 I was a close with lived there for 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.789
 three months but I missed that 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:05.439

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:09.340

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:15.629
