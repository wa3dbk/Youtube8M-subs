 I do not know anybody 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.849
 At any rate, the resurrection of the flesh does not appear 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:18.269
 unlikely

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 too little left 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.800
 these are 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 There are no nice views to be had, there is no religion that gives us that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 Paradise might already offer on earth 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.790
 or maybe 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.600
 if I've really searched worldwide though 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 could harden

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.049
 Mustache example so beautiful Oral may like 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.049

 he tends to be lenient 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.459
 if someone shoots in the Rhineland 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.459

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.279
 For this reason very modern-minded customer in modern psychology 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.749
 she will not be really bad people either 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.599
 if evil is not a psychological category evil there is not nervous 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.599
 unarmed but that is evil

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.370
 Grains positive social forecasting, so to speak 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.370
 that is the belief that believes in the good in man 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.619
 if the general opinion of her marriage to Muessig 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:25.909
 because most of the world is bad 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.919
 still has to punish Germany the SMI 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.439
 as if more so the Arab solution 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.179

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.179
 Pedro twice but in the turn as difficult 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.389
 faith and justice are in complete collapse if we all still learn 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.959

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.309
 two game nothing wrong about the Islam juice 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:48.739

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.679
 complete set very well fitted to the theme 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.679
 it is believed to be blessed but unfortunately content 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.159
 I had bought North Korea to check what you got 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.539
 ever allowed to say 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.019
 Percent to and around 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.779
 but unfortunately 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.779
 nothing left 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.229
 my mother asked me to do that as well 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.389
 The human rights situation in Germany is currently not so 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.830
 that one could release there which basically with us percent more on the 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.889
 Best for the first time since 50 o'clock that you have to fear that you say 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.009
 simply killed is on 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.159

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.869
 that's my mom was not a rule or she does not have one either 

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:52.219
 to give words again and again 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.149
 That was not different in the Third Reich if one did not contradict 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.029
 you also had children 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:00.870
 except mom, jew or gay 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.870
 but I think I should be in Pakistan today 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.659
 again, no more gold really get a Koran 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.019
 then think about it in peace and do it but that is quite something 

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:27.120
 easy I did not get to have any recovery 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.210

 and I did not look for it in humor 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.530
 By making sure that someday they are in religious matters like them 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.460
 More humor will be developed thicker that with the outfits will gladly come 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.969
 the time began 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.110
 l 622 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.210

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.809
 the guest with us also got it 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:59.809
 We had just begun with the witch burning 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.409
 No one burns euros

 thrown a pot 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.369
 not easy for me through him to Aristide 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:20.849
 and yet I do not want to go for the crimes of Christianity 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.539
 co-responsible 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.879
 The question is of course how critical do you have to be so foreign cultures 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.360
 if I have something to do with my happy group 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.760

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.069
 2 are so Hall Munster 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.949
 Malente time that hurts there but maybe that will be done 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.789

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.879
 Scott should really give and the victory of the 1 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:03.369
 I can not imagine him getting that COPD forever 

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:07.149
 and with that the other one might send us some Messiah or something 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.020
 I'm afraid only when I'm here 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.069
 how should one differentiate the right one from all the others? 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.250

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.129

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.129
 we would not have a special one for that 

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:38.169
 he seems to want the shield 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:40.099
