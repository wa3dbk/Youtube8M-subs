00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hello my name is Vladislav 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.020
 Logic is an overview of the dice not again 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.710
 this show let's start comes in such here 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:20.539
 a box of red white packed it is still 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 such a bubble wrap like this 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:32.239
 very nice little box but with 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.450
 over time it is ground and you just do not 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.260
 just on and smooth we pitch it of course if 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.590
 you lubricate hair mask and maru 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:50.820
 white so behind this club established 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 world record as in singles so 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.750
 average now almost all cubers 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.579
 collected by this club 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.879
 competition it is currently not available on the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.229
 its competitor t 2 cube which is already 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.150
 outdated and found here obviously wins 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:15.509
 thanks to all parameters for pskov waters 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:20.220
 by all measures this cube is mandatory 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:29.880
 you need to do a florian mod as with him 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:33.409
 spinning it less seizes more 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.820
 pleasant but rolling becomes 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:40.640
 cut the dough better well, cut florin 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.939
 mod even better 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:51.109
 so let's show the structure 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:51.109
 Lebron central corner 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:07.560
 angle as you see the structure here 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:16.500
 reasonably enough so central 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:21.390
 edge and central piece that is here 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.170
 glued places for relief cut 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.540
 excess classroom 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:32.100
 the cube is not very heavy plastic here 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:42.120
 quality is used as well 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:44.150
 own in every good walked on 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.549
 the plant is almost unable 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.019
 that is, inside the gel lubricant but they are very 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:55.500
 little is good because in production 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.769
 use very good lubrication example 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.420
 at 9 for 9 or 8 for 8 just fill it 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.480
 very much that even when the ransom 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:18.410
 insist out of the box it's all grease so 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:21.410
 internally their nose from the lesser they can 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.410
 to drive 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.709
 Well, on this I think all thank you for 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.709
 view bye
