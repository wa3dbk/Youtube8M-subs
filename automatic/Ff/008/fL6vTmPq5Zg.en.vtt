00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 at 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.889
 liot everyone is bye 100 cases 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.270
 I hope you are well 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.130
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.810
 new video after updating the 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.039
 robberies so a video that I have 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.410
 really very happy to be able to 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.270
 propose does more and more that of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.640
 good the more time passes and the more I 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.869
 see more and more comments from 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.700
 people who say they actually 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.079
 do not have any vehicles at the 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.860
 example who do not have hydra who have not 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.170
 not valkyrie 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.600
 I bought for example the bike the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.460
 enduro they have not there already 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.260
 people also feel even more serious 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.149
 we'll say it's four times in a row 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.410
 that they download the update and 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.600
 who must remove the art 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.140
 download delete and ultimately 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.360
 low blind around 3.60 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.220
 gigabyte so a big problem in not so 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.050
 it's the fact that the dlc is too big 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.880
 or while too many people are trying 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.579
 to download it at the same time but in 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.050
 anyway there is a lot of problem me 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.509
 maybe I had I did not have this 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.579
 worry maybe I saw that I downloaded 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.049
 a lot so we have to the mug and 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.290
 as soon as he is out I think so I 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.850
 uva 6:30 but echo so my friend like 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.860
 I said earlier who finished the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.929
 updated 10 minutes before me him 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.600
 so does not have any vehicle apart 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.950
 two three so a lot of problems 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.299
 if you ever have that kind of trouble 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.189
 do not hesitate to comment 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.079
 and at least so if someone gets to 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.079
 find the solution like this do not hesitate 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.359
 we share it so there as I 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.130
 wanted ditty gameplay with the hydra so 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.579
 the new fighter jet of the dlc 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.350
 robberies 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.850
 a fighter plane that everyone has 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.590
 not so on the site of off stocks 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.389
 anyway for the moment so that makes 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.490
 really nice to show you a little 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:45.079
 with the gameplay what is good little 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.920
 first-person view who is he and 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.990
 look with the dashboard 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.279
 frankly m she is beautiful then he 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.679
 wax gifts were able to shoot bullets 

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:53.990
 cannon can be fired rockets and 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.939
 rockets and guide them good like all 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.709
 the fighter jets on the other hand that the 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.099
 pace with the rockets and a little 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.659
 higher than with the with the laser in 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.819
 early video you could see I 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.429
 had fun taking off with a friend on 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.140
 the on the roof of the plane imagined at 30 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.459
 ask like that on the plane and you 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.480
 take off vertically like that 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.209
 frankly there's way of making 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.670
 crazy little moments against me at 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.920
 bottom level of piloting the plane 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.960
 I did not find that frankly because 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.090
 that it shifts vertically from stroke to 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.860
 made to be able to move forward with the plane 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.660
 must advance the joystick of taste 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.040
 and well, it's not that we 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.000
 explain me and it's impossible to dive 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.660
 forward there is no way to 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.390
 two loops 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.370
 it's quite complicated it's a driving 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.930
 which is quite different from the others 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.640
 fighter planes we knew 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.680
 good after I think it's a trick to 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.820
 take that at some point there is way 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.530
 to have fun with 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.790
 but I think that if there really is not 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.580
 way to make two loops and stuff 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.320
 like that it's going to be pretty bad so 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.450
 then for the price and still costs 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.130
 3 million dollars so remember 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.650
 I made you a short video 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.240
 do where that where we announced that the package 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.980
 sheets might be free after a 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.170
 certain mission and that would make you 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.550
 save 2 million bah dollars in 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.570
 is not the guy that's 3 million 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.440
 dollars I tell you frankly I 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.570
 bought all vehicles 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.650
 I had 28 million on down to 10 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.320
 million I blew myself 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.300
 so frankly think well before 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.650
 to buy vehicles there like you 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.090
 could see it little originality so 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.070
 I'm not sure that was the case 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.450
 with the other hunting brain when 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.950
 you press the triangle button 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.750
 it's like there's actually a 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.920
 seat ejectable so there is a little 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.510
 messed up I typed the back of 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.760
 the plane but I find that these tests there 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.080
 so I did not see if it was in the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.420
 adult teeth and frankly I 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.440
 find that it is and stylish and so here 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.580
 we reach the end of this video 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.049
 I really hope this little gameplay 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.940
 on board the seaplane will have more 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.140
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.790
 better if that's the case and to subscribe 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.170
 if it's not already done me I'll 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.790
 you leave on these pictures I tell you 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.790
 at all good game and killing everyone
