00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.240
 Ah 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.139

 There was a theme in the third year of college 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.190
 Pick up and stir it and have 4 of the motors there is something like this 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:49.309
 I made the body go back. 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:54.559
 That's when the gun was used to write this piece and move it. 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.370
 Since I made it a gun , I lost so much vagueness that there was no movement. 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.030
 I threw it away. 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.129
 Jun Oh Me As such it can not preside over the boys in the tablet 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:08.900
 Life is born and packed, and old people are now alive and gone. 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.610
 And I die again and the dragon geniuses are torn again and have difficulties with themselves 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.840
 The sound reminded alive 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.840
 The central structure is not the length 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.400
 This work is coming now called Moriah Tee eobaneoseu jungyirago in 2006 in Tokyo 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.020
 I've received the whole individual. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.220
 Now that I am a living being, 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.430
 Talk a lot 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.180
 Not even to be like good people are moving back to the car to continue in its calm 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.010
 It is being presented 5:00 extensions 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.880
 I think that when we go there seems to be some kind of force that is rationally unknown. 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:14.750
 If you make living things that live with that power, 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.750

 The seeds on one point drop so simple in the algorithm because the past 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.970
 While responding to things, 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.970

 I was constantly thinking about the power of religion . 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.970
 Think 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:51.940
 There is a limit of human being death, and it is beyond any physical limitation. 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.190
 I think it's okay. 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.060

 Now every individual that works 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:38.110

 That's why I'm sleeping and working together. 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:29.090
 In some ways, the person who developed it solved the problem 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:34.220
 It looks like he invented a machine. 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.140
