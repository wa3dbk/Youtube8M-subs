 I serve Russia 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 project th 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.669
 in 12 15 parts 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.259
 two violations 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:28.749
 12 6 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.749
 safety time 4 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.059
 five hours 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.029
 12 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.539
 Part 1 is not registered 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.069
 in order 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.069
 two violations 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.109
 canimoto 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.479
 13 23 12 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.479
 16a pg. 1st place 13 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.299
 all this connections 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.999
 that's just why you were stopped 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.739

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.739
 now let's decide together how to communicate 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.329

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.539
 pa 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.589
 to him oil insurance policy him 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:35.859
 this if 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.589
 changes per day 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:39.899
 for this is provided 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.899
 criminal liability 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.119
 so what is the priority now what 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.639
 changes because if the numbers are written 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.939
 other party 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.929
 in another way 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:53.879
 his 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.659
 yuri sullen 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.099

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.489
 garden that the accounting price will come more 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.089

 for inaccuracies as well 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:08.109
 another employee another pen 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.069
