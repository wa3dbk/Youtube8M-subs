that and that's what let me ask it
actually<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:42.960> great<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.440> strike<00:00:43.680> detection

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
actually is great for strike detection

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.630 
actually is great for strike detection
it's<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> 1.5<00:00:46.950> over

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's got it it's actually got a 1.5 over

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's got it it's actually got a 1.5 over
so<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.149> six<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.750> six<00:00:49.379> way<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.730> 7.5<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
so it to six a six way to 7.5 in the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.470 
so it to six a six way to 7.5 in the
head<00:00:51.239> gotcha<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.289> super<00:00:52.739> easy<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.480> know

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
head gotcha so it's super easy you know

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
head gotcha so it's super easy you know
just<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.840> flip<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.280> shorter

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
just to flip out there and a shorter

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.010 
just to flip out there and a shorter
head<00:00:56.879> where<00:00:57.090> you're<00:00:57.180> not<00:00:57.300> casting<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.809> pile

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
head where you're not casting a pile

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.060 
head where you're not casting a pile
line<00:00:58.320> yeah

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
line yeah

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
line yeah
well<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.760> very<00:00:59.969> versatile<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.690> here

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
well that can be very versatile up here
