00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
box here we have the cosworth high

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.179 
box here we have the cosworth high
pressure<00:00:21.600> oil<00:00:21.720> pump<00:00:22.199> got<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> box<00:00:22.949> right<00:00:23.160> here

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
pressure oil pump got the box right here

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.460 
pressure oil pump got the box right here
let's<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:23.730> ahead<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.939> open<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:27.470> alright

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
let's go ahead and open this up alright

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.720 
let's go ahead and open this up alright
so<00:00:28.560> I'm<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:28.740> gonna<00:00:28.830> remove<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> components

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
so I'm just gonna remove the components

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.009 
so I'm just gonna remove the components
here<00:00:29.880> first<00:00:30.210> thing<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.420> wanted<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> show<00:00:30.990> you

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
here first thing I wanted to show you

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.650 
here first thing I wanted to show you
guys<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> oil<00:00:32.309> pump<00:00:32.579> itself<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.450> can

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
guys was the oil pump itself now you can

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.770 
guys was the oil pump itself now you can
see<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:34.200> now<00:00:35.000> it<00:00:36.000> looks<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.329> an<00:00:36.510> oem

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
see that here now it looks like an oem

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
see that here now it looks like an oem
oil<00:00:36.989> pump<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.649> actually<00:00:37.980> cause<00:00:38.489> we're

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
oil pump and it is actually cause we're

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.490 
oil pump and it is actually cause we're
starts<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> 11<00:00:39.660> millimeter<00:00:40.050> pump<00:00:40.320> which

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
starts with the 11 millimeter pump which

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
starts with the 11 millimeter pump which
is<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> largest<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.520> super<00:00:41.879> pumps<00:00:42.210> but

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
is the largest of these super pumps but

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
is the largest of these super pumps but
the<00:00:42.420> only<00:00:42.540> difference<00:00:43.020> between<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
the only difference between this one and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.299 
the only difference between this one and
an<00:00:44.399> OEM<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.649> Cosworth<00:00:46.649> print

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
an OEM one is you see the Cosworth print

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.180 
an OEM one is you see the Cosworth print
on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.450> pump<00:00:48.719> itself<00:00:48.930> right<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> guys

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
on the pump itself right now if you guys

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.810 
on the pump itself right now if you guys
can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.969> well<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> light

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
can see that very well with the light

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.490 
can see that very well with the light
but<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.199> shim

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
but what they do is they go in in a shim

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.740 
but what they do is they go in in a shim
it<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.829> higher<00:00:56.430> pressure<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.539> couple

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it for higher pressure we put a couple

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.240 
it for higher pressure we put a couple
shims<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.949> increase

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
shims in here this is going to increase

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.970 
shims in here this is going to increase
the<00:00:59.550> pressure<00:00:59.780> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> pump<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.680> they<00:01:01.829> go

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the pressure of the pump then they go

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.340 
the pressure of the pump then they go
through<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.280> ad<00:01:02.609> burritt<00:01:03.049> basically<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.199> go

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
through an ad burritt basically they go

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
through an ad burritt basically they go
through<00:01:04.619> smooth<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.100> all<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> openings<00:01:05.760> make

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
through smooth out all the openings make

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760 
through smooth out all the openings make
sure<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> oil<00:01:06.270> flows<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.990> well<00:01:07.530> through

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
sure the oil flows very well through

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.370 
sure the oil flows very well through
this<00:01:07.890> pump<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.720> also<00:01:09.900> include

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
this pump and then they also include

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
this pump and then they also include
which<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.549> everything<00:01:12.510> you're

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
include this in the kit how this is

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.600 
include this in the kit how this is
going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.700> great<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.060> anybody<00:01:48.270> looking<00:01:48.450> to

going to be great for anybody looking to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.039 
going to be great for anybody looking to
increase<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.820> oil<00:01:50.970> pressure<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.659> their

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
increase the oil pressure in their

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.690 
increase the oil pressure in their
engine<00:01:52.409> or<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.040> rebuilding<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
engine or if you're rebuilding the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.100 
engine or if you're rebuilding the
engine<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.329> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> better

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
engine you just want to go with a better

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.230 
engine you just want to go with a better
pump<00:01:55.409> compared<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> factory<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
pump compared to the factory one it's a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
pump compared to the factory one it's a
great<00:01:57.390> product<00:01:57.780> check<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.409> its<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.770> time

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
great product check it out its all time

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.260 
great product check it out its all time
