00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.449 

what<00:00:10.639> we'll<00:00:10.759> do<00:00:10.910> first<00:00:11.150> is<00:00:11.450> take<00:00:12.459> the

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:13.459 
what we'll do first is take the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.630 
what we'll do first is take the
preparation<00:00:14.269> view<00:00:14.539> from<00:00:14.779> the<00:00:14.900> occlusal<00:00:15.640> will

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
preparation view from the occlusal will

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.569 
preparation view from the occlusal will
align<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.119> target<00:00:17.599> over<00:00:18.110> the<00:00:18.259> puzzle<00:00:19.099> aspect

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:19.579 
align the target over the puzzle aspect

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:29.060 
align the target over the puzzle aspect
off<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.180> preparation<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.579> capture

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.400 

will<00:00:30.070> view<00:00:30.340> that<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:31.660> if<00:00:31.720> we've<00:00:31.930> got<00:00:32.140> the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
will view that see if we've got the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.440 
will view that see if we've got the
integrity<00:00:33.010> of<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.250> capture<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.060> we<00:00:34.210> want

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
integrity of the capture that we want

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.290 
integrity of the capture that we want
and<00:00:34.810> then<00:00:35.500> we'll<00:00:35.680> go<00:00:35.860> ahead<00:00:36.010> and<00:00:36.460> grab<00:00:36.910> the

lingual buckle and in a possible
perspective

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.600 

there's<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.210> lingual

on<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.310> preparation<00:01:40.260> once<00:01:41.260> we've<00:01:41.500> got<00:01:41.530> that

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
on the preparation once we've got that

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.770 
on the preparation once we've got that
will<00:01:42.220> scan<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.580> remaining<00:01:43.210> area<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.660> the
