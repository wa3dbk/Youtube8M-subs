has something that's in I think that you

know<00:00:39.910> there<00:00:40.180> should<00:00:40.330> never<00:00:40.450> be<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.720> body<00:00:40.960> type

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.960 
that's n because I think the reality is
is<00:00:43.960> that<00:00:44.080> women<00:00:44.650> are<00:00:44.950> all<00:00:45.130> different<00:00:45.550> sizes

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
is that women are all different sizes

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.180 
is that women are all different sizes
you<00:00:46.540> know<00:00:46.630> all<00:00:46.780> different<00:00:46.990> women<00:00:47.470> can't<00:00:47.950> look

you know all different women can't look

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.070 
you know all different women can't look
up<00:00:48.310> to<00:00:48.460> one<00:00:48.640> body<00:00:48.940> type<00:00:49.300> is<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.720> one<00:00:49.900> that<00:00:50.020> they

up to one body type is the one that they

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.870 
up to one body type is the one that they
should<00:00:50.350> be<00:00:50.560> women<00:00:50.950> need<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.190> embrace<00:00:51.490> who<00:00:51.850> they

talking height we're talking color and I

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.720 
talking height we're talking color and I
think<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.960> next<00:01:01.990> real<00:01:02.470> big<00:01:02.650> one<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.100> is<00:01:03.490> going

think the next real big one is is going

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.060 
think the next real big one is is going
to<00:01:03.820> also<00:01:03.940> be<00:01:04.239> age<00:01:04.509> I<00:01:04.869> mean<00:01:05.170> basically<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.710> think

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
to also be age I mean basically I think

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.740 
to also be age I mean basically I think
that<00:01:06.250> it's<00:01:06.369> about<00:01:06.460> accepting<00:01:06.850> yourself<00:01:07.120> and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
that it's about accepting yourself and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.450 
that it's about accepting yourself and
