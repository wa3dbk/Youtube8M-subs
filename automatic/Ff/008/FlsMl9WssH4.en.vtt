00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.860

 rajoy sar 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.890
 red with animal print 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.670
 and these are the materials 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.180
 acrylic red clitheroe red collection the internet but and drop art 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.870
 red mexico returns because it is already I have all prepared the acrylic or this 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.150
 or the other the art boot in this case did not see drop of president keys this 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.720
 new that they took from their same people many more the surveys 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.540
 we go 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.010
 I'm going to take my team 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.850
 As always I will turn it around remember that later he hit it by 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.730
 issues of the camera but you are going to hold this position well 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.820
 as if I had stuck to the thread 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.730
 of our client 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.650
 I'll take 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.090
 of base so that this color stronger 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.570
 the red mars and then go 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 Apply from side to side 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
 if I need to have a little more 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.210
 I come like the pearl in the center lima ago from side to side 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 to blur the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 2015 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.789
 something like this remember that you are going to have and you have hundreds of demands to speak 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.489
 in this aciaga jose up down 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.239
 I for camera issues as I already told you 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.720
 put martí batres so that they can appreciate everything I'm doing 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.509
 now I am going to take militen that in this case from the history collection 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.849
 the Red color 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.859
 I will take a pearl not very thick 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.249
 to accommodate it 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.679
 same 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.549
 I will accommodate the side by side 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.479
 up here and attacks that covers all the smile and I'm going to sweep the same 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.219
 way that the first red layer that has 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.519
 as it covers a little more down and put another pearl 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.149
 another red pearl below 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.049
 and the sweeping buoy 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.819
 so that it extends a little bit more down 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:56.869
 and it's already 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.779
 I'll wait until these facts 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:05.169
 to give the art quota layer oo bt enamel art as I have it 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.419
 They sell it like an art collection 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.739
 actívate thus they would be thus 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.059
 so it would be 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.729
 then I say waiters so that this success I will take this product that is 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.480
 the wonder no longer see that before the haircut had mixed with a 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.299
 number and will be applied with acrylic 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.719
 it was very erased from specific everything 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.719
 but now they made this product that the same effect 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.949
 but it is much easier to use 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
 and it looks practically the same 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.159
 then I will take the pickets and took a small lid according to the 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.519
 capacities the thickness is the intensity of the color according to the ccaa to the color 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.489
 that you want the capable agent and people athens 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.449
 then it nodded and text madonna 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.739
 thick coat look like this 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.129
 tota lake 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.799
 for nothing else give two layers to get the color that I want is a 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.629
 red a little intense 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.629
 Lazio is exhausted arts that remain transparent color 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.449
 you before the vote of art and infinity of colors 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.449
 then he taught you the good ones in the other you want 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.179
 then I will take 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:18.749
 i careful astete account good rather it already owns two layers and accepted 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:23.949
 now I'm going to take my side in full and I'm going to do hulk 'animal print' type it 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:24.520
 open 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.339
 diagonally I want you to fix nogoyá pull it fast I'm going to slow it down 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:34.319
 and I'm going to let my hand tremble and move so that the effect 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.599
 or not so straight because the line of three like that does not 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.240
 I want another effect 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.340
 look how still and brush 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.729
 like in quotes for what do the spots 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.960
 so this guy who looks a lot more parents much more designed or what 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.779
 pregón and brush 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:57.069
 and I want harder offered a little more if I want thinner alejo 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.800
 little bit more the brush 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 look how I do it later and doing it diagonally 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.919
 because that's how I wanted to do it in this design 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.800
 gives you more clues and more 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.509
 beyond and cnn + more thought poorly designed p 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.839
 then it would not have been like that 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:19.729
 I go and fill in the little bugs making a small appointment with the lines 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.009
 and this is imitated government will leave like this so that the colors that you notice 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:24.880
 I put down 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.710
 the blur that to say look what a father that is awesome 0 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.150
 this semester really the cry 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.870
 that's what I was saying to get rid of me 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.050
 They also have the option of putting in two fingers 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.479
 this one so that it gives more light to him then already the only thing that would do is to apply 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.300
 notice how the layers are first silver after red and then the drop 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.800
 of art at the tip 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.800
 then you have to apply look on the natural nail 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.360
 the silver costs and you realize 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.860
 some diffuse alive nothing but the first one is silver after it the red 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.599
 so I would be allowed to think super father and many more more 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.860
 there he deserves commented that they do it like that but it was also they can not leave 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.639
 The doubts 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.699
 equal to this act that there 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.860
 quique no 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.979
 I'm going to teach them 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.830
 as are the diagonal stripes of vintage other types of zebra 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.509
 so that they realize the difference this is the classic 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:31.879
 the classic and simón totally income line this is another that I did the 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.960
 fail with 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.349
 this is another one there are many types of the lines 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.610
 Vincent then I want you to differentiate one from the other for each one so the 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.719
 design change 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:46.909
 I in this case the poses and diagonally and they were super super super parents 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:48.889
 they like me 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.289
 - but they really liked it very much 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:58.289
 and here they continue drinking why keep being here I already have the video d my 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:00.059
 local 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:03.259
 to those who want to know what they have told me 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.729
 look larraín made that there 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.740
 well I thank you for waiting so long 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.180
 i 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.270
 in this way splinters like that is like the ending of the wind 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.430
 with you fails like the stone to your liking the red stone because you like 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.599
 very much in this design 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:23.770
 USA 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.240

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.029

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:35.479
 thank you for all your support for all your words of encouragement to the 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.020
 that have less 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.430
 and went to try to be more +++ like before traffic 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:45.930
 and because you asked for it and even the facebook girls look for me 

00:07:45.929 --> 00:07:48.069
 like finlay art 

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.309
 for them everything was traveling 

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:53.210
 they are already there in touch with me every day 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.210
