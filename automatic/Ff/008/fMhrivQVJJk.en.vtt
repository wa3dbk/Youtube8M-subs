00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
kinds of new equipment so who knows I

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:44.290

blame<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.780> Romans<00:02:24.900> again

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.870 

now<00:02:45.290> you'll<00:02:45.410> notice<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.860> bunch<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.250> stars<00:02:46.610> and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
now you'll notice a bunch of stars and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.060 
now you'll notice a bunch of stars and
power-ups<00:02:47.450> laying<00:02:47.780> about<00:02:48.080> these<00:02:48.560> stars<00:02:48.830> give

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
power-ups laying about these stars give

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.370 
power-ups laying about these stars give
you<00:02:49.250> points<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.330> power-ups<00:02:50.900> make<00:02:51.140> each

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
you points and the power-ups make each

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.570 
you points and the power-ups make each
of<00:02:51.530> your<00:02:51.650> weapons<00:02:52.040> stronger<00:02:52.930> independently

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
of your weapons stronger independently

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.980 
of your weapons stronger independently
so<00:02:55.580> if<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.790> have<00:02:55.880> one<00:02:56.120> maxed<00:02:56.540> out<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.840> may

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
so if you have one maxed out you may

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.050 
so if you have one maxed out you may
want<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.230> switch<00:02:57.470> over<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.460> other<00:02:58.580> one<00:02:58.850> and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060
