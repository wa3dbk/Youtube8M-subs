but<00:02:00.960> honestly<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.890> something<00:02:02.070> that

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
but honestly this is something that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.980 
but honestly this is something that
should<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.610> been<00:02:02.729> identified<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.899> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
should have been identified and it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.539 
should have been identified and it
should<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.290> been<00:02:04.469> fixed<00:02:04.860> before<00:02:05.399> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
should have been fixed before this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.210 
should have been fixed before this
earphone<00:02:05.820> even<00:02:06.509> went<00:02:06.750> onto<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.140> market<00:02:07.590> now

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
pinhole block because the sound the bass

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.030 
pinhole block because the sound the bass
improves<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.790> little<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.709> know<00:02:30.799> they've

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
the pinhole I haven't done that myself

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.600 
the pinhole I haven't done that myself
because<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.379> kind<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.920> want<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.129> sell<00:02:37.430> this

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
want it to change it's only a matter of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.699 
want it to change it's only a matter of
time<00:02:46.519> before<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.329> pinhole<00:02:48.049> becomes<00:02:48.410> blocked

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
time before that pinhole becomes blocked

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.860 
time before that pinhole becomes blocked
by<00:02:48.920> ear<00:02:49.160> wax<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.579> because<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:50.329> such<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> tiny

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
by ear wax and because it's such a tiny

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.750 
by ear wax and because it's such a tiny
pinhole<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.620> might<00:02:51.769> be<00:02:51.920> very<00:02:52.099> difficult<00:02:52.250> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
pinhole it might be very difficult to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.380 
pinhole it might be very difficult to
clean

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
clean

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.449

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.220 
now again apparently Logitech has been
good<00:02:55.640> about<00:02:55.849> replacing<00:02:56.359> earphones<00:02:57.019> with

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
these issues but that still takes time

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.720 
these issues but that still takes time

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
and it's still a hassle and it should

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.069

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
single dynamic driver so they don't have

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.550 
single dynamic driver so they don't have
any<00:05:06.229> issues<00:05:06.650> there<00:05:06.919> but<00:05:07.900> one<00:05:08.900> thing<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.380> the

scoop in the lower mids that means that

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.939 
scoop in the lower mids that means that

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
a little richness and then the treble

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.850 
a little richness and then the treble
the<00:05:49.699> high<00:05:50.060> frequency<00:05:50.630> sound<00:05:50.900> is<00:05:51.139> very<00:05:51.560> fast

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
the high frequency sound is very fast

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.279 
the high frequency sound is very fast
and<00:05:52.130> very<00:05:52.310> clean<00:05:52.699> now<00:05:53.419> what<00:05:53.719> that<00:05:53.750> means<00:05:53.900> is

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
and very clean now what that means is

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:56.620 
and very clean now what that means is
that<00:05:54.320> sometimes<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:55.159> UE<00:05:55.789> 900<00:05:56.330> sounds<00:05:56.569> a

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
that sometimes the UE 900 sounds a

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.959 
that sometimes the UE 900 sounds a
little<00:05:56.719> unnatural<00:05:57.199> and<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.889> my<00:05:58.039> ears<00:05:58.340> at<00:05:58.669> times

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
little unnatural and to my ears at times

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.629 
little unnatural and to my ears at times
it<00:05:59.150> sounds<00:05:59.509> a<00:05:59.630> little<00:06:00.080> tacky<00:06:00.469> almost<00:06:01.250> because

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
it sounds a little tacky almost because

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.719 
it sounds a little tacky almost because
the<00:06:02.120> kind<00:06:02.599> of<00:06:02.659> timbre<00:06:03.139> or<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:04.219> way<00:06:04.430> things

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
the kind of timbre or the the way things

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.399 
the kind of timbre or the the way things
really<00:06:04.909> should<00:06:05.210> sound<00:06:05.449> don't<00:06:05.750> quite<00:06:05.990> sound

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
really should sound don't quite sound

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.459 
really should sound don't quite sound
right<00:06:06.919> on<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.340> UE<00:06:07.490> 900<00:06:08.210> so<00:06:08.780> I<00:06:08.810> think<00:06:08.960> it<00:06:09.139> sounds

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:09.469 
right on the UE 900 so I think it sounds

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.050 
right on the UE 900 so I think it sounds
better<00:06:09.530> with<00:06:09.919> synthetic<00:06:10.400> instruments<00:06:10.940> than

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
better with synthetic instruments than

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.080 
better with synthetic instruments than
it<00:06:11.150> does<00:06:11.330> with<00:06:11.630> natural<00:06:12.380> vocals<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:13.610> if<00:06:13.880> you

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
it does with natural vocals and if you

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.490 
it does with natural vocals and if you
particularly<00:06:14.509> love<00:06:14.810> your<00:06:15.050> vocals<00:06:15.409> you

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
particularly love your vocals you

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.499 
particularly love your vocals you
particularly<00:06:15.830> love<00:06:16.130> to<00:06:16.310> engage<00:06:16.460> with<00:06:17.030> a

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
particularly love to engage with a

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.110 
particularly love to engage with a
singer's<00:06:17.960> voice<00:06:17.990> perhaps<00:06:18.770> the<00:06:19.009> UE<00:06:19.159> 900<00:06:19.699> is<00:06:19.819> not

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
singer's voice perhaps the UE 900 is not

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.990 
singer's voice perhaps the UE 900 is not
the<00:06:20.240> best<00:06:20.419> earphone<00:06:20.840> for<00:06:20.870> you<00:06:21.430> but<00:06:22.430> it's<00:06:22.909> still

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
the best earphone for you but it's still

think<00:06:53.900> or<00:06:54.110> offer<00:06:54.500> a<00:06:55.130> similar<00:06:55.910> degree<00:06:56.060> of<00:06:56.420> sound

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
think or offer a similar degree of sound

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.390 
think or offer a similar degree of sound
quality<00:06:56.900> on<00:06:57.320> the<00:06:57.410> same<00:06:57.560> kind<00:06:57.770> of<00:06:57.800> tier<00:06:58.070> as<00:06:58.250> the

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
quality on the same kind of tier as the

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.050 
quality on the same kind of tier as the
UE<00:06:58.580> 900<00:06:59.240> about<00:06:59.780> costing<00:07:00.320> nearly<00:07:00.740> as<00:07:00.860> much<00:07:01.060> the

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
UE 900 about costing nearly as much the

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.850 
UE 900 about costing nearly as much the
thing<00:07:02.240> with<00:07:02.360> the<00:07:02.420> UE<00:07:02.540> 900<00:07:03.080> though<00:07:03.200> is<00:07:03.470> that<00:07:03.740> you

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
thing with the UE 900 though is that you

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.860 
thing with the UE 900 though is that you
do<00:07:04.100> get<00:07:04.280> all<00:07:04.490> these<00:07:04.760> fancy<00:07:05.150> things<00:07:05.360> you<00:07:05.720> get

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
do get all these fancy things you get

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.790 
do get all these fancy things you get
the<00:07:06.440> detachable<00:07:06.770> cables<00:07:07.520> you<00:07:08.000> get<00:07:08.360> the<00:07:09.350> really

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 
the detachable cables you get the really

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.770 
the detachable cables you get the really
good<00:07:09.920> noise<00:07:10.370> isolation<00:07:10.910> are<00:07:11.150> these<00:07:11.300> earphones

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
good noise isolation are these earphones

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.480 
good noise isolation are these earphones
so<00:07:11.930> you<00:07:12.470> know<00:07:12.560> if<00:07:12.650> that's<00:07:12.800> really<00:07:12.950> important

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
so you know if that's really important

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.250 
so you know if that's really important
to<00:07:13.580> you<00:07:13.730> you<00:07:14.210> pay<00:07:14.450> more<00:07:14.690> and<00:07:14.990> you'll<00:07:15.110> get

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 
to you you pay more and you'll get

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.620 
to you you pay more and you'll get
something<00:07:15.440> that's<00:07:15.620> quite<00:07:15.770> good<00:07:16.070> now<00:07:16.820> if<00:07:17.450> you

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
something that's quite good now if you

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.750 
something that's quite good now if you
prefer<00:07:17.780> a<00:07:17.960> warmer<00:07:18.530> sound<00:07:18.800> I<00:07:19.010> would<00:07:19.070> direct<00:07:19.460> you

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:19.760 
prefer a warmer sound I would direct you

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.970 
prefer a warmer sound I would direct you
towards<00:07:20.180> the<00:07:20.300> Western<00:07:20.630> for<00:07:20.870> I<00:07:21.050> do<00:07:21.350> think<00:07:21.770> that

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:21.980 
towards the Western for I do think that

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.460 
towards the Western for I do think that
a<00:07:22.220> bit<00:07:22.880> more<00:07:23.120> of<00:07:23.270> a<00:07:23.360> better<00:07:23.540> all<00:07:23.780> rounder<00:07:24.440> than

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
a bit more of a better all rounder than

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.430 
a bit more of a better all rounder than
the<00:07:24.680> UE<00:07:24.830> 900<00:07:25.520> but<00:07:26.030> in<00:07:26.600> particularly<00:07:27.020> in<00:07:27.230> terms

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 
the UE 900 but in particularly in terms

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.890 
the UE 900 but in particularly in terms
of<00:07:27.650> very<00:07:28.010> very<00:07:28.430> densely<00:07:28.820> layered<00:07:28.910> music<00:07:29.690> very

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:29.900 
of very very densely layered music very

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.660 
of very very densely layered music very
densely<00:07:30.320> layered<00:07:30.410> electronic<00:07:31.160> music<00:07:31.490> I<00:07:31.610> do

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 
densely layered electronic music I do

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.450 
densely layered electronic music I do
think<00:07:32.060> that<00:07:32.150> UE<00:07:32.330> 900<00:07:32.900> really<00:07:33.290> shines<00:07:33.650> now<00:07:34.370> if

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
think that UE 900 really shines now if

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.490 
think that UE 900 really shines now if
you<00:07:34.580> want<00:07:34.820> more<00:07:35.450> bass<00:07:35.750> punch<00:07:36.050> if<00:07:36.200> you<00:07:36.320> want

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.500 
you want more bass punch if you want

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.170 
you want more bass punch if you want
something<00:07:36.710> it's<00:07:36.830> very<00:07:36.860> visceral<00:07:37.550> I<00:07:37.700> do<00:07:37.760> think

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:38.180 
something it's very visceral I do think

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.510 
something it's very visceral I do think
you<00:07:38.270> should<00:07:38.420> also<00:07:38.600> look<00:07:38.870> at<00:07:39.020> the<00:07:39.080> sony<00:07:39.520> xba-40
