Tesla makes them want to take a taxi I
prefer<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.549> use<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.849> bus<00:02:23.030> or<00:02:23.390> walk<00:02:23.599> or<00:02:23.870> bike

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
prefer to use the bus or walk or bike

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.619 
prefer to use the bus or walk or bike
but<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:24.980> think<00:02:25.310> with<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.610> with<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.330> kind<00:02:26.540> of

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
but I think with this with this kind of

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.569 
but I think with this with this kind of
car<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.349> go<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.739> use<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.340> battery

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
car I can go and use it the battery

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.300 
car I can go and use it the battery
alone<00:02:29.060> cost<00:02:29.450> thirty<00:02:29.810> thousand<00:02:30.409> dollars<00:02:30.829> but

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
alone cost thirty thousand dollars but

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.699 
alone cost thirty thousand dollars but
wha<00:02:31.579> is<00:02:31.849> certain<00:02:32.299> that<00:02:32.480> Tesla's<00:02:33.019> manufacturer

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
wha is certain that Tesla's manufacturer

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.190 
wha is certain that Tesla's manufacturer
which<00:02:34.220> also<00:02:34.459> makes<00:02:34.790> space<00:02:35.180> rockets<00:02:35.659> will

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
which also makes space rockets will

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.930 
which also makes space rockets will
bring<00:02:36.409> the<00:02:36.530> cost<00:02:36.799> of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.099> car<00:02:37.310> battery<00:02:37.489> down

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
bring the cost of the car battery down

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.759 
bring the cost of the car battery down
