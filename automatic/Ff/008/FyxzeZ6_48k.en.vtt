00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the purpose of this laptop so there's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.660 
the purpose of this laptop so there's
six<00:00:53.640> gigabytes<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.480> ddr3<00:00:54.960> RAM<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.460> does

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
six gigabytes of ddr3 RAM so it does

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
six gigabytes of ddr3 RAM so it does
give<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.239> room<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.750> multitasking<00:00:58.739> you
