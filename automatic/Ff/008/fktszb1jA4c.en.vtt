00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 well here in the radio studios the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.700
 net 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.890
 good to generate a very large policy 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.840
 not with the report you put in the area of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.429
 football last Sunday on the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.040
 management of marcelo tinelli san lorenzo 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 that it is not a management report what 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.690
 It happens that there are many deaf people and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.699
 many people who prowled around 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.189
 protagonists tells them of a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.769
 determined mode after everything starts to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.420
 amplify here the title was the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.510
 captain is the last one to leave the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.099
 boat and we set us 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.780
 this is a team that works and there 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 many people who work that do not investigate 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.399
 is that we report the reports 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 football facts are always 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.489
 hard blunt in some cases this 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.559
 it's an informative topic out a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 election and we raise without 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.980
 marcelo tinelli is going to lead soccer 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.210
 for everyone a month and a half ago a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.800
 a month and a half ago they had the same 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.239
 commitments the birth of his son that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.280
 it is very important to start a brave 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.199
 of television that is very important to us 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.609
 This period of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.399
 nine months and nine months license 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.270
 a life he's nine moons but hey 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.750
 He was armed 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.400
 or why not program has a lot of weight 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 we have your rating very high 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.300
 the report of san lorenzo had a peak 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.860
 very high because he is a very character 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.250
 strong that came very strongly to the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.380
 world of football in an area where the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.300
 leadership looked at him out of the corner cheste comes 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.890
 to stay with everything he was afraid 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.870
 the afa were afraid with football to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 all and hit and took a 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.310
 very long license and I said yesterday to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 matÃ­as the president mind yes but you 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 Matias says look, I recorded the meeting 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.530
 on Tuesday do not go to the Thursday's novel 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 within four months brides when the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.770
 party nothing happens but nothing happens 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.360
 makes an order for a license and that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.369
 people find out via twitter on Monday 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.160
 they changed it on Friday it was reported to 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.410
 last minute study license by twitter 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.170
 basically in radial statements what 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.420
 that bothered Tinelli were nine the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 tone of the report and based on the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.399
 management let's say increase the liability 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.930
 that and tinelli affirmed that it is not that what 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.540
 they had gone down in the emotion institution 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.910
 and a report that emphasized the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.800
 captain is the last one to leave the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.550
 ship they said strap things that are not 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.850
 certain 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.590
 defense and there are issues that we as 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.560
 journalists that we are the ones we can see 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.290
 well or we can see them wrong not because 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.580
 marcelo tinelli we have to do as 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.100
 makes most journalist 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.420
 they try to go dancing for a dream with 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.480
 all respect I think it was a management 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.100
 that changed the life of san lorenzo I 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.600
 I became a member of san lorenzo supporting him 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.270
 you know so with the madness of going to 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.490
 heard and because I think the subject of 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.500
 instrumental that every time the clubs 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.270
 have more partners is the best income 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.160
 for clubs that believe that nagy 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.890
 is on television well to many 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.330
 months or if they match and one payment all 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.090
 months or the quota of classmates be that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.070
 they have bought square meters of living rooms 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.860
 of refounding there is no campaign nor in 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.230
 against, on the contrary, we mark the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.150
 substantial difference everything good that 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 it was done but not everything is good there are things 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.560
 that the elimination in the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.620
 cup can be a mistake the subject of 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.840
 chosen technician can be a mistake there 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.420
 mistakes like everywhere the license 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.730
 striking is long in December there was 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.410
 elections and I can not have a 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.530
 commitment has to do as was done 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.780
 before 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.700
 Call me I 'll solve it when I can 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.050
 when I can I do not go but when I have a 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.240
 I believe that the charges must be 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.410
 honor them and that respect them is clear 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.120
 because I knew it was a very controversial 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.459
 big more than anything by the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.130
 tinelli statements not very angry 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.890
 for this report but good I know for 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.510
 there the method when it gets cold 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.010
 marcelo will recap sichel mandar 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.890
 a tweet when the team is coming back 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.930
 of the almost elimination of the cup 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.670
 it fell well the weekend there was stir 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.870
 of course that his presence of san 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.970
 Lorenzo is very strong and people 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.260
 he has a deep appreciation 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.760
 we mark what we think the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.070
 journalistic point of view more what 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 we put people's private lives 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.730
 If you have the right, you have no right 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.560
 we mark what we feel and the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.239
 program has been for a long time 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.519
 problem is credible the problem has 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.050
 a lot of success has a lot of rating today 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.030
 a different driver that does not keep the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.890
 line and maintains the success that he maintained 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.850
 with Alejandro at the time so 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.140
 we are absolutely 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.120
 quiet 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.590
 the difference of some journalists who 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.870
 out there they have more buzz is they do 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.600
 journalism and in the sports plane there 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.250
 much pimp much much sucks a lot 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.889
 public relations guy a lot that guy 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.770
 was in the gallery and when I see it 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.229
 to tinelli the cessation of mass and it was not 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.849
 correct the order form and we believe 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.469
 that is very long the time nothing more than 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.469
 that is not so dramatic what we said
