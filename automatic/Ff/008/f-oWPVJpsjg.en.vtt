gott consume what the Viper does is to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.780 
gott consume what the Viper does is to
get<00:01:10.470> energy<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.430> need<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.869> drain<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.890> HP<00:01:14.430> from

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
get energy you need to drain the HP from

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.510 
get energy you need to drain the HP from
a<00:01:15.030> structure<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.869> what<00:01:16.350> people<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
a structure so what people like to do is

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.429 
a structure so what people like to do is
they<00:01:17.759> throw<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.390> five<00:01:18.659> evo<00:01:19.080> chambers

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
they throw down like five evo chambers

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.350 
they throw down like five evo chambers
in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> late<00:01:19.860> game<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> they<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:21.090> those

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
in the late game and they just use those

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880 
in the late game and they just use those
to<00:01:21.659> drain<00:01:21.930> from<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:22.680> you're<00:01:22.830> not

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to drain from because then you're not

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.530 
to drain from because then you're not
draining<00:01:23.280> from<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.820> building<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
draining from a building that you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.450 
draining from a building that you
actually<00:01:24.720> need<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.830> make<00:01:26.009> buildings

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
actually need you just make buildings

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280 
actually need you just make buildings
for<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> draining<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.720> five<00:01:27.960> evoke

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
for the draining so like five evoke

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.480 
for the draining so like five evoke
chambers<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.130> train<00:01:29.340> from

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
chambers and you can just train from

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.030 
chambers and you can just train from
those<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.000> energy<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.840> consumed<00:01:31.470> what<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
those to get energy so consumed what it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.340 
those to get energy so consumed what it
does<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.340> targets<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.939> friendly<00:01:33.479> structure<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
does is targets a friendly structure and

next ability which is absolutely awesome

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.399 
next ability which is absolutely awesome
is<00:01:49.079> abduct<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.700> abductors<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.600> costs<00:01:51.810> 75

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
is abduct what abductors it costs 75

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.190 
is abduct what abductors it costs 75
energy<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> range<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.399> 9<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.689> does<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.899> it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
energy the range is 9 what it does is it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.679 
energy the range is 9 what it does is it
pulls<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.890> unit<00:01:56.369> two<00:01:56.610> from<00:01:57.119> its<00:01:57.420> location

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
pulls a unit two from its location

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.580 
pulls a unit two from its location
towards<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> Viper<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.750> pull<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.229> unit

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
towards the Viper so you can pull a unit

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440 
towards the Viper so you can pull a unit
nine<00:02:01.829> unit<00:02:01.860> stored<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:02.820> Viper<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
nine unit stored your Viper this is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.270 
nine unit stored your Viper this is
extremely<00:02:04.140> useful<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.710> I'll<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.979> into<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
extremely useful and I'll get into that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.490 
extremely useful and I'll get into that
in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.610> specific<00:02:06.180> matchups<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in the specific matchups and then the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.070 
in the specific matchups and then the
last<00:02:07.530> ability<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> blinding<00:02:09.179> cloud<00:02:09.479> it

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
last ability is the blinding cloud it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.180 
last ability is the blinding cloud it
costs<00:02:10.440> 100<00:02:11.009> energy<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.550> lasts<00:02:12.000> 14<00:02:12.450> seconds

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
costs 100 energy it lasts 14 seconds

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.970 
costs 100 energy it lasts 14 seconds
and<00:02:13.540> what<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.660> does<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.080> reduces<00:02:15.830> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and what it does is it reduces the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.100 
and what it does is it reduces the
attack<00:02:16.280> range<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.760> all<00:02:17.060> units<00:02:17.630> under<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
attack range of all units under the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.460 
attack range of all units under the
cloud<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:19.010> malaya<00:02:19.310> range<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.330> obviously<00:02:21.170> this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
cloud to malaya range so obviously this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.870 
cloud to malaya range so obviously this
is<00:02:21.680> very<00:02:22.040> very<00:02:22.430> strong<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.950> radius<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.610> 2<00:02:25.670> I

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
is very very strong the radius is 2 I

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.170 
is very very strong the radius is 2 I
forgot<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.450> mention<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.140> yet<00:02:27.890> like

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
forgot to mention that and yet like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.790 
forgot to mention that and yet like
we'll<00:02:29.180> get<00:02:29.270> into<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.630> uses<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:29.960> it<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.560> let's

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
we'll get into the uses of it so let's

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.590 
we'll get into the uses of it so let's
go<00:02:30.920> straight<00:02:31.130> into<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> uses<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:31.910> certain

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
go straight into the uses in certain

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.360 
go straight into the uses in certain
matchups<00:02:32.780> for<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.560> Viper<00:02:33.800> all<00:02:34.130> right<00:02:34.220> so

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
matchups for the Viper all right so

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.350 
matchups for the Viper all right so
first<00:02:34.580> up<00:02:34.820> we've<00:02:35.030> got<00:02:35.060> zvt<00:02:36.340> zvt<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.730> Viper<00:02:38.000> I

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
first up we've got zvt zvt the Viper I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.940 
first up we've got zvt zvt the Viper I
think<00:02:38.630> will<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:38.960> an<00:02:39.170> absolutely<00:02:39.710> essential

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
think will be an absolutely essential

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.840 
think will be an absolutely essential

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
with straight into Vipers and then go

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.870 
with straight into Vipers and then go
into<00:02:56.330> ultra<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.710> tanking<00:02:58.220> capabilities

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.760 
into ultra for the tanking capabilities
of<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.210> ultra<00:02:59.600> and<00:02:59.780> just<00:03:00.170> using<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.470> hydras

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
of the ultra and just using the hydras

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.230 
of the ultra and just using the hydras
behind<00:03:01.100> them<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.670> both<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.150> these

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
behind them so in both of these

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.880 
behind them so in both of these
scenarios<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.020> ultras<00:03:03.350> are<00:03:03.440> extremely

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
scenarios like the ultras are extremely

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.980 
scenarios like the ultras are extremely
strong<00:03:04.160> like<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.400> ultra<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.240> blinding<00:03:05.750> cloud

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
strong like the ultra the blinding cloud

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.440 
strong like the ultra the blinding cloud
is<00:03:06.320> so<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.220> good<00:03:07.250> against<00:03:07.730> pretty<00:03:07.970> much<00:03:08.180> all

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
is so so good against pretty much all

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.750 
is so so good against pretty much all
the<00:03:08.630> ground<00:03:08.870> units<00:03:09.230> from<00:03:09.320> terror<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.890> also

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
the ground units from terror and also

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.510 
the ground units from terror and also
abduct<00:03:11.150> can<00:03:11.510> help<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.290> much<00:03:12.560> against<00:03:13.370> meh

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
abduct can help you so much against meh

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.100 
abduct can help you so much against meh
calm<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:14.030> siege<00:03:14.330> tanks<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:14.960> just

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
calm is like siege tanks you can just

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.740 
calm is like siege tanks you can just
whip<00:03:15.890> them<00:03:16.160> towards<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.760> army<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.510> you're

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
whip them towards the army if you're

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.150 
whip them towards the army if you're
going<00:03:17.930> up<00:03:18.050> against<00:03:18.350> Mac<00:03:18.590> Vipers<00:03:19.070> are

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
going up against Mac Vipers are

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.830 
going up against Mac Vipers are
absolutely<00:03:19.700> essential<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:20.180> mean<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.390> think<00:03:20.540> it

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
absolutely essential I mean I think it

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.080 
absolutely essential I mean I think it
actually<00:03:20.989> makes<00:03:21.470> Mac<00:03:21.940> completely<00:03:22.940> useless

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
actually makes Mac completely useless

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.670 
actually makes Mac completely useless
because<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:23.750> soon<00:03:23.870> as<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.050> go<00:03:24.140> Vipers<00:03:24.530> out

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
because as soon as you go Vipers out

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.890 
because as soon as you go Vipers out
like<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.310> tanks<00:03:25.610> can't<00:03:25.820> do<00:03:25.970> anything<00:03:26.209> you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
like the tanks can't do anything you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.479 
like the tanks can't do anything you
know<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.050> can<00:03:27.290> either<00:03:27.410> abduct<00:03:27.890> them<00:03:28.070> or<00:03:28.310> you

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
know you can either abduct them or you

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.949 
know you can either abduct them or you
can<00:03:28.610> just<00:03:28.700> took<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.940> blinding<00:03:29.420> cloud<00:03:29.630> on<00:03:29.810> them

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
can just took a blinding cloud on them

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.600 
can just took a blinding cloud on them
if<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.200> clump<00:03:30.470> top<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.890> then<00:03:31.250> they<00:03:31.370> can't

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
if the clump top and then they can't

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.270 
if the clump top and then they can't
even<00:03:31.730> tight<00:03:32.060> so<00:03:32.270> if<00:03:32.330> they're<00:03:32.480> going<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.720> go<00:03:32.810> Mac

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
even tight so if they're going to go Mac

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.460 
even tight so if they're going to go Mac
like<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.640> mean<00:03:35.480> they<00:03:35.660> pretty<00:03:35.870> much<00:03:35.959> need<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.350> get

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
like I mean they pretty much need to get

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.620 
like I mean they pretty much need to get
very<00:03:36.739> very<00:03:36.920> heavy<00:03:37.220> he'll<00:03:37.550> bat<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.030> possibly

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
very very heavy he'll bat and possibly

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.710 
very very heavy he'll bat and possibly
thoughts<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.160> can't<00:03:40.730> really<00:03:40.940> see<00:03:41.120> map<00:03:41.360> be<00:03:41.540> a

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
thoughts but I can't really see map be a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.070 
thoughts but I can't really see map be a
Mac<00:03:42.050> being<00:03:42.380> viable<00:03:42.620> aside<00:03:43.280> from<00:03:43.690> early<00:03:44.690> pushes

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
Mac being viable aside from early pushes

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.380 
Mac being viable aside from early pushes
or<00:03:45.350> mid<00:03:45.739> game<00:03:45.920> pushes<00:03:46.340> before<00:03:46.700> Vipers<00:03:47.180> are

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
or mid game pushes before Vipers are

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.479 
or mid game pushes before Vipers are
actually<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.140> think<00:03:48.320> Vipers<00:03:48.860> just<00:03:49.100> completely

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
actually I think Vipers just completely

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.940 
actually I think Vipers just completely
stopped<00:03:49.910> Mac<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:50.750> his<00:03:50.930> tracks<00:03:51.200> against<00:03:51.800> any

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
stopped Mac in his tracks against any

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.449 
stopped Mac in his tracks against any
like<00:03:52.250> bio<00:03:52.519> compositions<00:03:53.150> like<00:03:53.300> marine<00:03:53.660> tank

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
like bio compositions like marine tank

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.570 
like bio compositions like marine tank
bio<00:03:55.459> with<00:03:56.090> mines<00:03:56.390> you<00:03:57.200> know<00:03:57.320> it's<00:03:58.250> really

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
bio with mines you know it's really

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.070 
bio with mines you know it's really
really<00:03:58.820> strong<00:03:59.060> because<00:03:59.269> blinding<00:03:59.840> cloud

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
really strong because blinding cloud

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.290 
really strong because blinding cloud
makes<00:04:00.470> all<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.890> Marines<00:04:01.190> run<00:04:01.940> up<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.180> your

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
makes all the Marines run up to your

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.000 
makes all the Marines run up to your
circlings<00:04:02.780> or<00:04:02.959> banelings<00:04:03.410> or<00:04:03.530> roaches<00:04:03.709> or

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
circlings or banelings or roaches or

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.500 
circlings or banelings or roaches or
hydras<00:04:04.310> whatever<00:04:04.760> composition<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.330> going

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
hydras whatever composition you going

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.479 
hydras whatever composition you going
with<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:06.380> makes<00:04:06.530> them<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.010> much<00:04:07.130> weaker

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
with and that makes them so much weaker

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.370 
with and that makes them so much weaker
like<00:04:07.640> they<00:04:07.790> can't<00:04:08.060> do<00:04:08.300> damage<00:04:08.720> like<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
like they can't do damage like the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.020 
like they can't do damage like the
strength<00:04:10.130> of<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.340> marine<00:04:10.550> is<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.850> it's<00:04:11.000> got

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
strength of the marine is that it's got

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.090 
strength of the marine is that it's got
this<00:04:11.269> range<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.870> like<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.560> have<00:04:12.709> like<00:04:12.860> five

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
this range and like you have like five

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.070 
this range and like you have like five
rows<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.670> Marines<00:04:13.940> just<00:04:14.209> blasting<00:04:14.810> at<00:04:14.930> your

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
rows of Marines just blasting at your

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.650 
rows of Marines just blasting at your
units<00:04:15.500> doing<00:04:16.100> really<00:04:16.400> high<00:04:16.580> dps<00:04:17.030> but<00:04:17.239> they

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
units doing really high dps but they

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.630 
units doing really high dps but they
can't<00:04:17.870> do<00:04:18.019> that<00:04:18.169> if<00:04:18.290> they<00:04:18.470> have<00:04:18.980> to<00:04:19.250> attack<00:04:19.519> in

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
can't do that if they have to attack in

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.860 
can't do that if they have to attack in
valley<00:04:19.880> range<00:04:20.090> so<00:04:20.209> it's<00:04:20.330> really<00:04:20.570> really

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
valley range so it's really really

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.420 
valley range so it's really really
strong<00:04:21.080> then<00:04:21.260> because<00:04:21.500> EVP<00:04:21.979> I<00:04:22.010> don't<00:04:22.250> think

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
strong then because EVP I don't think

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.240 
strong then because EVP I don't think
the<00:04:22.580> viper<00:04:22.850> in<00:04:23.240> zvp<00:04:23.660> has<00:04:24.080> as<00:04:24.350> much<00:04:24.560> use<00:04:24.890> as<00:04:24.919> it

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
the viper in zvp has as much use as it

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.590 
the viper in zvp has as much use as it
does<00:04:25.400> in<00:04:25.430> zbt

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
does in zbt

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.340 
does in zbt
I<00:04:26.660> think<00:04:26.930> it's<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.110> bit<00:04:27.230> more<00:04:27.470> situational<00:04:29.350> but

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
I think it's a bit more situational but

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.770 
I think it's a bit more situational but
I<00:04:30.560> think<00:04:30.980> you<00:04:31.670> know<00:04:31.790> one<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.240> main<00:04:32.390> styles

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
I think you know one of the main styles

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.570 
I think you know one of the main styles
right<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:33.140> is<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.380> go<00:04:33.650> heavy<00:04:33.920> into<00:04:34.370> roch

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
right now is to go heavy into roch

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.790 
right now is to go heavy into roch
hydron<00:04:35.090> then<00:04:35.240> like<00:04:35.600> zvt<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.260> go<00:04:36.380> straight<00:04:36.650> to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
hydron then like zvt you go straight to

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.050 
hydron then like zvt you go straight to
the<00:04:36.830> Vipers<00:04:37.310> and<00:04:37.340> then<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.670> just<00:04:37.910> start

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
the Vipers and then you just start

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.850 
the Vipers and then you just start
pulling<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.630> units<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.230> force<00:04:39.470> engage

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
pulling the units to force engage

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.550 
pulling the units to force engage
engages<00:04:40.820> toward<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.390> like<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.140> just<00:04:42.350> pull

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
engages toward you like you just pull

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.800 
engages toward you like you just pull
either<00:04:42.890> the<00:04:43.280> Colossus<00:04:43.880> or<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.360> void<00:04:44.540> raids

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
either the Colossus or the void raids

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.910 
either the Colossus or the void raids
toward<00:04:45.170> you<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.470> then<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.710> can<00:04:45.830> just

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
toward you and then you can just

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.610 
toward you and then you can just
decimate<00:04:46.400> them<00:04:46.550> but<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:47.300> thing<00:04:47.510> is<00:04:47.540> it<00:04:48.260> might

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
decimate them but the thing is it might

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.230 
decimate them but the thing is it might
be<00:04:48.740> better<00:04:48.920> just<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.310> go<00:04:49.460> in<00:04:49.550> faster<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.120> then

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
be better just to go in faster and then

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.230 
be better just to go in faster and then
just<00:04:50.420> fungal<00:04:50.780> them<00:04:50.930> or<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:52.640> might<00:04:52.790> be<00:04:53.030> better

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
just fungal them or it might be better

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.420 
just fungal them or it might be better
just<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.630> trade<00:04:53.990> but<00:04:54.320> yeah<00:04:54.710> I<00:04:54.740> think<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.100> Viper

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
just to trade but yeah I think the Viper

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.980 
just to trade but yeah I think the Viper
definitely<00:04:55.790> has<00:04:55.910> its<00:04:56.090> usage<00:04:56.480> where<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.870> can

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
definitely has its usage where you can

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.690 
definitely has its usage where you can
pull<00:04:57.170> Colossus<00:04:57.710> towards<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:58.160> can<00:04:58.280> pull<00:04:58.490> void

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
pull Colossus towards you can pull void

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.660 
pull Colossus towards you can pull void
rays<00:04:58.940> towards<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.830> blinding<00:05:00.830> cloud<00:05:01.070> isn't<00:05:01.340> as

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
rays towards you blinding cloud isn't as

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.820 
rays towards you blinding cloud isn't as
good<00:05:01.940> against<00:05:02.330> protoss<00:05:02.690> as<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.230> is<00:05:03.380> against

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
good against protoss as it is against

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.660 
good against protoss as it is against
terran<00:05:04.150> because<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.810> units<00:05:06.440> are<00:05:06.860> bigger<00:05:07.160> so

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
terran because the units are bigger so

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.160 
terran because the units are bigger so
you<00:05:07.700> don't<00:05:08.000> get<00:05:08.120> as<00:05:08.300> much<00:05:08.480> units<00:05:08.930> with<00:05:09.140> a

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
you don't get as much units with a

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.890 
you don't get as much units with a
single<00:05:09.950> cloud<00:05:10.160> and<00:05:10.520> they<00:05:11.240> can<00:05:11.390> blink<00:05:11.690> out<00:05:11.810> of

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
single cloud and they can blink out of

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.360 
single cloud and they can blink out of
them<00:05:12.050> and<00:05:12.140> things<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.530> obviously<00:05:12.830> tampa

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
them and things and obviously tampa

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.510 
them and things and obviously tampa
terrible<00:05:13.970> Allah<00:05:14.210> Templar<00:05:15.020> as<00:05:15.200> well<00:05:15.520> Templar

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
terrible Allah Templar as well Templar

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.060 
terrible Allah Templar as well Templar
can<00:05:16.700> just<00:05:16.850> feed<00:05:17.060> back<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.450> Vipers<00:05:17.900> so<00:05:18.170> I<00:05:18.350> don't

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
can just feed back the Vipers so I don't

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.640 
can just feed back the Vipers so I don't
think<00:05:19.250> Vipers<00:05:19.640> are<00:05:19.670> amazing<00:05:20.510> in<00:05:20.630> zvp<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.320> think

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
think Vipers are amazing in zvp I think

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.990 
think Vipers are amazing in zvp I think
they<00:05:21.800> will<00:05:22.010> have<00:05:22.190> their<00:05:22.340> uses<00:05:22.580> against

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
they will have their uses against

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.840 
they will have their uses against
Colossus<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:23.870> void<00:05:24.080> rays<00:05:24.320> but<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.370> think<00:05:25.760> it

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
Colossus and void rays but I think it

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.490 
Colossus and void rays but I think it
will<00:05:25.970> be<00:05:26.120> more<00:05:26.330> for<00:05:26.570> trading<00:05:26.810> armies<00:05:27.260> then

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
will be more for trading armies then

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.750 
will be more for trading armies then
finally<00:05:27.950> in<00:05:28.070> zvz<00:05:29.140> Vipers<00:05:30.140> no<00:05:30.440> just<00:05:31.340> just<00:05:31.760> know

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
finally in zvz Vipers no just just know

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.570 
finally in zvz Vipers no just just know
basically<00:05:34.760> in<00:05:35.150> zvz<00:05:35.740> this<00:05:36.740> is<00:05:37.100> not<00:05:37.280> going<00:05:37.400> to<00:05:37.460> be

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
basically in zvz this is not going to be

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.520 
basically in zvz this is not going to be
any<00:05:37.730> situations<00:05:38.330> where<00:05:38.600> a<00:05:38.630> viper<00:05:39.080> is<00:05:39.320> going<00:05:39.470> to

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
any situations where a viper is going to

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.840 
any situations where a viper is going to
be<00:05:39.590> useful<00:05:40.330> um<00:05:41.680> let<00:05:42.680> me<00:05:42.710> try<00:05:42.950> and<00:05:42.980> expand<00:05:43.700> on

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
be useful um let me try and expand on

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.730 
be useful um let me try and expand on
this<00:05:44.000> basically<00:05:44.930> in<00:05:45.110> Z<00:05:45.260> busy<00:05:45.530> right<00:05:45.710> now

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
this basically in Z busy right now

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.060 
this basically in Z busy right now
people<00:05:46.700> go<00:05:46.790> to<00:05:46.820> base<00:05:47.240> viewers<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:48.070> there's

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
people go to base viewers and there's

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.130 
people go to base viewers and there's
not<00:05:49.310> really<00:05:49.550> much<00:05:49.880> of<00:05:49.940> a<00:05:50.090> transition<00:05:50.720> from<00:05:50.930> to

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
not really much of a transition from to

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.660 
not really much of a transition from to
base<00:05:51.320> mute<00:05:51.590> of<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.770> game<00:05:51.950> is<00:05:52.160> pretty<00:05:52.490> much

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
base mute of the game is pretty much

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.910 
base mute of the game is pretty much
always<00:05:52.970> going<00:05:53.360> to<00:05:53.420> be<00:05:53.450> one<00:05:53.750> in<00:05:53.960> that<00:05:54.650> point

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:54.920 
always going to be one in that point

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.790 
always going to be one in that point
maybe<00:05:55.670> if<00:05:55.970> people<00:05:56.420> start<00:05:56.840> using<00:05:56.900> builds<00:05:57.560> like

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
maybe if people start using builds like

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.520 
maybe if people start using builds like
do<00:05:58.430> believe<00:05:58.700> a<00:05:58.820> ling<00:05:59.060> in<00:05:59.150> fasta<00:05:59.630> which<00:06:00.080> might

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
do believe a ling in fasta which might

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.010 
do believe a ling in fasta which might
be<00:06:00.560> viable<00:06:01.010> against<00:06:01.730> the<00:06:01.790> mute<00:06:02.000> apply<00:06:02.270> but

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
be viable against the mute apply but

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.840 
be viable against the mute apply but
it's<00:06:03.140> not<00:06:03.230> really<00:06:03.470> tested<00:06:03.800> out<00:06:04.070> yet<00:06:04.280> then

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
it's not really tested out yet then

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.300 
it's not really tested out yet then
maybe<00:06:05.330> after<00:06:06.200> the<00:06:06.290> ultras<00:06:06.680> are<00:06:06.830> out<00:06:06.950> from<00:06:07.190> your

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
maybe after the ultras are out from your

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.930 
maybe after the ultras are out from your
to<00:06:07.550> leave<00:06:07.700> early<00:06:08.000> investor

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
to leave early investor

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.280 
to leave early investor
that<00:06:09.290> yep<00:06:10.290> then<00:06:10.560> maybe<00:06:10.860> you<00:06:11.220> can<00:06:11.810> use<00:06:12.810> vikas

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
that yep then maybe you can use vikas

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.600 
that yep then maybe you can use vikas
with<00:06:13.470> your<00:06:13.680> Ling<00:06:14.040> investor

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.100 

ziga<00:06:17.000> z<00:06:17.150> you<00:06:17.539> probably

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
ziga z you probably

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:27.990 
ziga z you probably
this<00:06:19.230> new<00:06:19.380> bike

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.140 

yeah<00:06:28.840> now<00:06:29.080> if<00:06:29.410> you<00:06:29.530> don't<00:06:29.620> mind<00:06:29.740> spoilers<00:06:30.160> stay

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
yeah now if you don't mind spoilers stay

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.240 
yeah now if you don't mind spoilers stay
awhile<00:06:31.270> and<00:06:31.600> listen<00:06:31.720> but<00:06:32.650> now<00:06:32.740> let's<00:06:32.950> look

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
awhile and listen but now let's look

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.070 
awhile and listen but now let's look
over<00:06:33.400> it<00:06:33.670> top<00:06:34.150> left<00:06:34.690> corner<00:06:35.170> here<00:06:35.530> it<00:06:35.920> is
