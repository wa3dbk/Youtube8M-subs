 Does this spanish omelette cake 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.029
 classic and we will cook it 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.099
 originally tasty and most importantly acute and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.840
 helpful start cooking what for us 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.739
 this need for the classic I spent 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.200
 cooked with onion potatoes 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.910
 based chicken eggs also tomato 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.010
 cherry chili pepper basil and a little 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.899
 thyme for aroma ie everything 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.780
 absolutely available components so 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.239
 let's learn to cook together means 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.579
 let's start tatyana I'll give you expectations right away 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.370
 take eggs glabel who studied yes all 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.000
 yes, let's make such a big family 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.760
 pan 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.339
 hang around with us really either have lunch 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.780
 or dinner turns out quite even great 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:12.330
 scrooge well remember that exchange difference 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.880
 between such brown and white eggs 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.100
 there is absolutely no however now 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.920
 prove that stored it turns out 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 absolutely wrong probably you like 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.299
 we used to lay down with this special 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.360
 department in the fridge is on the door 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.490
 so this is a fundamentally wrong decision 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.259
 do it much better on the top 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.180
 shelf of your refrigerator and 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.460
 craftsmen claims that if you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.619
 be able to shell the eggs in butter 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.259
 preliminary ass can be stored it 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 will be much longer 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.940
 experiment and use our 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.400
 tips, they are only tested 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.960
 chopped straws its onions and 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.090
 fry with our young 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.220
 potatoes 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.170
 Potatoes beforehand opened about salted 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:03.110
 water boil for ten minutes throw in 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 boiled water peeled potatoes and boil 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:13.260
 perfectly add cream I took 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:19.560
 30 percent cream to our omelet 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:24.060
 then salt about salt to taste on pretty 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.780
 abundantly eight more salt if 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.690
 take 30 less you mix 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 I can begin full thanks from 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.200
 father flies 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.050
 Well I will silently study and advise you 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.300
 it is actually possible to change a little 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.990
 the recipe rub from you and cook with 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.470
 pleasure 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.630
 This is the secret of success. Well, I practically 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.100
 whipped 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.290
 I have n't gotten hot fast yet 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.010
 potatoes with onions that is, do not continue 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.599
 you can still leave the side 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:04.480
 take our cherry tomatoes and chili peppers 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:06.980
 and cut I'll add chili pepper with grains 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.750
 if you don't like spicy advise them 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.650
 remove because all sharpness 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.629
 our taught pepper with in these grains remember 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.209
 what if you also have problems with their work 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.680
 the gastrointestinal tract is also not 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.109
 worth abusing 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.670
 with spicy it is of course delicious but it can 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.609
 lead to quite unpleasant 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.890
 consequences so be careful 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.470
 cherry tomatoes are driven in half the same i 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.959
 added chili pepper to onion potatoes 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.409
 a little thyme for more flavor 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:41.540
 tomato take everything as we are things 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.540
 our five minutes I will fire our potatoes with 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.730
 onions and I will pour all the mixture of 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.109
 remember that the card dance is pre 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.329
 boiled wait for now 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.519
 believe to golden brown and we will 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.400
 pour eggs for a few minutes 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:02.540
 fried our potatoes with onions add 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:04.730
 basil for some reason on the trail at basil 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.440
 You can substitute dill and parsley and I 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.510
 body type i'm the difference between red and 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.530
 green are you great red basilicata 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.099
 oregano to taste they differ also 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.410
 still very tasty lemon basil such 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.169
 it's good to add it to fish with salad and 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.530
 great taste does not fit 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.370
 let's forget some salt for sure 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.280
 salt top 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:37.270
 with pepper 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:41.810
 and fill the pier chicken eggs have 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.900
 then tomato and get really 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.730
 very beautiful and insanely fragrant and that 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.880
 will do next we will bake and 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.919
 we will lie bake for years at all 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.100
 classics its glad to cook in a skillet 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.950
 but I'll put her in the oven temperature 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.690
 180 degrees 7 10 minutes waiting for everyone 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.350
 a bit of it will be very tasty 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.350
 definitely 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:15.070
 waited here and our ice dish is beautiful 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.230
 yummy 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.750
 originally only 7 10 minutes and our 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.160
 fine meal ready recommend you 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.800
 be sure to follow our advice 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.080
 remember that a great person here can 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.220
 there is about one egg all because in 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.260
 it has a lot of cholesterol 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.840
 but it contains almost everything 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.910
 perhaps vitamins besides vitamin c so 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.980

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.900
