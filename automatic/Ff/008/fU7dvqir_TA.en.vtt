00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.279
 Talk guys here and take them. 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.470
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.210
 and in today's video I would like to 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.640
 bring you a game of black 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.750
 ops on the grid map where I'm playing 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.779
 said 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 the spas 12 people this even a sore 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.280
 very good I think she's the best 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.590
 black ops chance 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.820
 along with this take out is very good 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.190
 also but I think space takes a 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.110
 little advantage in that because that 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.879
 she kind of almost automatic is 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.040
 semiautomatic one shot queued behind 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.920
 on the other and the interval between a 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.270
 one is very fast and very good then 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.940
 so you can make a freight 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.770
 Well cool, very interesting. 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.110
 Good. I'll leave you guys. 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.060
 accompany this background match where 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.680
 It was a very good starting means starting 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.140
 That kavala I think was mine. 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.570
 best match I've ever had in 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.439
 black ops not in a matter of fred much 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.119
 high but yes it was a great gameplay 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.920
 I managed to kill a lot and 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.409
 I managed to die very little galera 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.799
 die only once and I want to say to 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.970
 You guys, the internet is tremendous. 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:27.940
 difference folks unfortunately it lasts 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.799
 black ops any game in the series 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.140
 if you have a good internet you 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.869
 can play in a very 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.270
 satisfying a very competitive way 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.310
 if you have a bad internet and forget 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.650
 When you only pass the anger like I am 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.189
 passing anger from the cut of 4 and 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.390
 now I sadly or fortunately 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.000
 in this she fortunately we will say so 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.369
 Because, for me, the joy to 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.689
 internet is making a difference 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.580
 monster and with that achieving 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.070
 finally play in a cool way 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.159
 A really cool way I got to get 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.750
 Good gameplay, I'm able to play 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.270
 Very well, because it 's too fucking expensive. 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.850
 very cool, are you trying to play a game? 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.340
 online and you shoot the cariri knows that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.989
 will kill only will not really kill if 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 the guy is faster than you if the 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.280
 dude it's better than you 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.980
 and more in itself in the matter of shooting against 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.290
 front is the connection is parallel with 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.349
 anyone with gringo 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.460
 connection super cool wheel and you can 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.740
 keep up early 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.330
 I started frantically so 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.400
 I got a sequence of up to six 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.930
 But I ended up dying, I shot the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 face and I know I had killed but not 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.200
 had given rhythm having the first shot 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.550
 not killed and when he gave the punctuation it is 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.950
 I had killed someone but was 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.230
 kleber was not in the shot then half 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.510
 I faltered but beauty and died was the only 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.250
 death of the game from now on and you 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.360
 You'll see that I 'm running after the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.170
 opponents 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.640
 I'll try, but to them, everything says and guys. 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.380
 they'll be able to kill one after another 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.540
 I'll get the cucumber docs to get the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.760
 blackwood and will stay a very match 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.830
 frantic is very exciting, I do not 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.470
 I'm being very aggressive but I'm 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.910
 always running is up to the enemies 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.130
 on top of opponents 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.710
 Good crowd and I'll enjoy this game. 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.660
 A little bit long and I'm going to talk 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.880
 some things you do not 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.670
 asking in the comments is always 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.440
 half a pound worth buying 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.800
 ancient codices 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.730
 good galley color of four colors of 5 mw 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.570
 pain 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.110
 it's worth buying good if you're a fan of 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.750
 series 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.600
 if you have a little left over is worth the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.390
 Worth buying but only really worth to 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.150
 Worth buying cody 4 and kode5 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.220
 if you have a legal connection or if you 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.160
 Do you have some friends who are still 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.080
 playing this game because because it is very 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.850
 but it's very difficult for you to find 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.730
 Brazilian room in these games 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.950
 especially in cat. 54 is still 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.510
 It's possible, it's rather Brazilian. 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.730
 playing as incredible as it seems the game is 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.730
 very old but already very Brazilian 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.760
 playing so well and the tdm quarters 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.190
 hardcore you can always find room 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.690
 and also be hardcore sandwiches 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.240
 these are the modalities you have 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.680
 a great chance to achieve without 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.810
 close the Brazilian and thus achieve 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.580
 play in a satisfactory way outside 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.190
 This is where you will always get rooms. 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.440
 red or rarely yellow 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.510
 if you have a good internet beauty 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.330
 sends bullet buy without thinking twice 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.500
 because the game is very good and you will 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.240
 I always managed to play with a connection 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.770
 yellow that you can play quietly with 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.360
 the screams because they are very young 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.529
 are too bad 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.719
 and if you are very lucky 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.729
 where you have a very good connection, you 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:40.909
 will be able to stay in rost and core 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.869
 4 if you rost the connection does not change then 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.209
 this is very good 

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:46.609
 already 45 people the game is very good is very 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:49.039
 fantastic the maps are really cool 

00:04:46.609 --> 00:04:51.499
 very short with 5 was one of the games that 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.269
 I really liked to play until today and this one 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.759
 is one of the co says that it is a 

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:57.889
 say something to you because the 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.589
 His connection is very strange, very bad. 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.109
 there are a lot of people it 's too many 

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:04.519
 there are few people playing he thinks 

00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:06.919
 has several times that it has four thousand 

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:09.019
 people 7 thousand people 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.059
 so there are very few people to 

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:12.799
 you play and with that you only find room 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:15.169
 of gringo that last video that I 

00:05:12.799 --> 00:05:18.079
 I put the match that I ended up doing 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.519
 that fred of the dogs of 40/50 per 

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:21.439
 incredible as it may seem I was with faces 

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:23.269
 at the start I managed to stay on the rost and 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.769
 had two Brazilians in the room had a 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:26.389
 face that had a connection at most and 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:28.549
 another that was three bars 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.799
 So, there's still a Brazilian playing. 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:32.869
 But it's hard for you to find 

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:34.699
 people even more people who have a 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:37.939
 Good connection to stay in. 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.259
 but if you told me if you have 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:42.079
 a lot of nice people have a great honor 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.239
 be left beauty and m from mw2 

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:45.949
 mw2 guys have enough quiet 

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:48.439
 Brazilian still playing you think room 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:51.649
 with a certain ease of free for all 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.839
 who of the internet and the mini show always 

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:57.049
 has enough Brazilian playing single 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:06:01.129
 inconvenience of the old cuts is that 

00:05:57.049 --> 00:06:02.149
 There are many hacker galera mw 285 and code 4 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.999
 There is a lot of hacker 

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:06.619
 hackers of the body of four are still 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.199
 more relevant because then you 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:11.689
 usually have rooms with speed 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.929
 super speed super speed and ammo 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:17.179
 infinite kode5 has fast and deadly 

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:19.219
 they do not die they fly on the scene 

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:21.559
 between the bottom of the earth is a putaria 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:24.979
 half a generalized jenna then it is very 

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:28.069
 bad and the hackers of mw2 galera is rafael 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:30.049
 gil avoid the infinite then it is as if the 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.580
 Guys have always seen you on the radar. 

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:35.099
 like you had a black ford 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.319
 showing you always leaving you 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.819
 very unpleasant also has other 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.180
 things are boring are the trikes 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:45.240
 infinite and etc but is to have a fusca that 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.889
 Infinity iv hacker really is a lot 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.199
 very annoying like this ends up unbalancing 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.189
 a lot of game and you get a lot without 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.430
 patience 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:55.650
 Good, I'm related to theirs and also 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.379
 same thing if you like cody 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.150
 if you are a fan of the series it's worth you 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.310
 buy the game if you have a money 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.960
 extra is how I said it and the dlc 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.000
 of course it's worth it too because 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.969
 the maps of both Count 45 and the maps 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.620
 The two extras are very good. 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:12.569
 Good guys from this one almost coming. 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.460
 the end actually came to an end 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.080
 in the end I ended up using the famous one that 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.930
 I got on the floor because my spas 12 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.789
 I finished the ammunition I hope you 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.550
 I have enjoyed this video guys was 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:24.120
 a very good departure from 1249 bar spas 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.860
 1 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.900
