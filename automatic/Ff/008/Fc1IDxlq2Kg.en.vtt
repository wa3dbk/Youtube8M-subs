hello<00:00:01.020> and<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.040> Chapman<00:00:02.790> gamedev<00:00:03.419> how<00:00:04.259> to

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hello and in this Chapman gamedev how to

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.170 
hello and in this Chapman gamedev how to
we<00:00:05.190> were<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.549> be<00:00:05.609> showing<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:06.120> to

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
we were going to be showing how to

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.650 
we were going to be showing how to
animate<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.410> particle<00:00:08.280> system<00:00:08.429> using<00:00:09.330> you

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
animate a particle system using you

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.350 
animate a particle system using you
decays<00:00:10.019> matinee<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> give<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:11.880> an<00:00:12.030> idea<00:00:12.150> of

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
decays matinee so to give you an idea of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.180 
decays matinee so to give you an idea of
what<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.690> will<00:00:12.840> look<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.830> play<00:00:14.009> from

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
what this will look like we play from

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.430 
what this will look like we play from
here<00:00:14.400> our<00:00:14.750> wonderful<00:00:15.750> little<00:00:15.960> particle

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
here our wonderful little particle

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.560 
here our wonderful little particle
system<00:00:16.800> will<00:00:17.070> move<00:00:17.369> back<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.730> forth<00:00:18.210> like<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
system will move back and forth like a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.259 
system will move back and forth like a
hypnotic<00:00:18.960> snake<00:00:20.480> okay<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> how<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.060> this

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
hypnotic snake okay so how do we do this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.650 
hypnotic snake okay so how do we do this

you have a parker's system in your level
open<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.050> kismet<00:00:58.520> alright<00:00:59.520> stop<00:00:59.760> open<00:01:00.120> unreal

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
open up kismet alright stop open unreal

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.039 
open up kismet alright stop open unreal
kismet<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.670> here's<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.629> we're<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> end

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
kismet so here's what we're going to end

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.649 
kismet so here's what we're going to end
up<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.439> we're<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.100> end<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.670> an<00:01:05.909> event

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
up with we're gonna end up with an event

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
up with we're gonna end up with an event
which<00:01:07.560> triggers<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.490> start<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.150> our

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
which triggers the start of our

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
which triggers the start of our
animation<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> moving<00:01:10.320> back<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> forth

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
animation of it moving back and forth

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.660 
animation of it moving back and forth
and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.760> we're<00:01:12.180> going<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.600> animate

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
and then we're going to actually animate

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.929 
and then we're going to actually animate
the<00:01:15.259> particle<00:01:16.259> emitter<00:01:16.530> moving<00:01:17.100> using

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the particle emitter moving using

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
the particle emitter moving using
matinee<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.320> wonderful<00:01:19.680> crisscross

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
matinee with this wonderful crisscross

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.590 
matinee with this wonderful crisscross
of<00:01:22.100> ins-and-outs<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.640> make<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> continuously

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of ins-and-outs to make it continuously

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
of ins-and-outs to make it continuously
loop<00:01:24.960> backwards<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> forwards<00:01:26.009> and

forward to about two seconds or so and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.820 
forward to about two seconds or so and
then<00:02:19.970> take<00:02:20.569> our<00:02:20.780> particle<00:02:21.230> system<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.770> our

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
then take our particle system on our

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.000 
then take our particle system on our
stage<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.520> move<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.660> over<00:02:23.810> you'll<00:02:24.620> know<00:02:24.830> if

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
stage and move it over you'll know if

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.320 
stage and move it over you'll know if
it's<00:02:25.160> hooked<00:02:25.340> up<00:02:25.489> correctly<00:02:25.880> initially

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
it's hooked up correctly initially

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.350 
it's hooked up correctly initially
you'll<00:02:26.540> see<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> little<00:02:26.989> yellow<00:02:27.380> dot<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:29.150> is

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
you'll see a little yellow dot this is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.570 
you'll see a little yellow dot this is
the<00:02:29.510> original<00:02:29.720> keyframe<00:02:30.319> at<00:02:30.470> time<00:02:30.680> zero<00:02:30.980> we've

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
the original keyframe at time zero we've

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.089 
the original keyframe at time zero we've
now<00:02:31.790> moved<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.510> over<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:33.440> where<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.739> want<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
now moved it over to where we want it to

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.220 
now moved it over to where we want it to
be<00:02:34.190> for<00:02:34.400> keyframe<00:02:34.880> time<00:02:35.150> two<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.930> we're<00:02:36.080> going

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
be for keyframe time two and we're going

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.910 
be for keyframe time two and we're going
to<00:02:36.349> hit<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.739> ad<00:02:37.099> key<00:02:37.910> button<00:02:38.650> now<00:02:39.650> well<00:02:39.800> add<00:02:39.890> a

to hit the ad key button now well add a
key<00:02:40.099> you'll<00:02:40.580> again<00:02:40.849> know<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.450> it's

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
key you'll again know that it's

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.300 
key you'll again know that it's
correctly<00:02:42.080> worked<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.980> you'll<00:02:43.099> see<00:02:43.280> a

line up here along the bottom of where

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.309 
line up here along the bottom of where
it<00:02:46.040> animates<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.730> let's<00:02:47.090> drag<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.080> little

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
it animates and let's drag this little

black slider bar back and forth and ooh

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.710 
black slider bar back and forth and ooh
it<00:02:50.930> will<00:02:51.080> animate<00:02:51.440> look<00:02:52.160> at<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.459> perfect<00:02:53.120> so

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
it will animate look at that perfect so

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.420 
it will animate look at that perfect so
let's<00:02:53.989> clean<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.230> up<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.530> little<00:02:54.680> bit<00:02:54.860> currently

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
let's clean it up a little bit currently

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.979 
let's clean it up a little bit currently
our<00:02:55.610> animations<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.239> little<00:02:56.480> long<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:56.690> our

our animations a little long for our

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.440 
our animations a little long for our
loop<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.250> let's<00:02:58.280> take<00:02:58.549> this<00:02:58.670> red<00:02:59.060> triangle

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
loop so let's take this red triangle

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.350 
loop so let's take this red triangle
move<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.110> down<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.950> about<00:03:01.700> where<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.090> is

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
move it down to about where that is

move it down to about where that is
about<00:03:02.989> where<00:03:03.140> our<00:03:03.260> second<00:03:03.590> keyframe<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:04.190> so

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
about where our second keyframe is so

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.210 
about where our second keyframe is so
that<00:03:05.030> way<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.540> will<00:03:05.690> go<00:03:05.900> from<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.680> point<00:03:06.980> to

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
that way it will go from that point to

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.900 
that way it will go from that point to
that<00:03:07.489> point<00:03:07.549> back<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.569> forth<00:03:08.780> forever<00:03:09.910> now

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910

and visible play now one last thing
let's<00:03:40.010> see<00:03:40.280> what<00:03:40.430> happens<00:03:40.760> when<00:03:40.910> we<00:03:41.030> try<00:03:41.299> to

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
let's see what happens when we try to

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.099 
let's see what happens when we try to
play<00:03:41.660> this

play this

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.430 
play this
let's<00:03:42.799> do<00:03:42.950> play<00:03:43.190> from<00:03:43.400> here<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:45.170> doesn't<00:03:45.680> move

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
let's do play from here it doesn't move

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.590 
let's do play from here it doesn't move
hmm<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.100> if<00:03:49.639> we<00:03:49.850> were<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.030> double-click<00:03:50.389> on

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
hmm so if we were to double-click on

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.530 
hmm so if we were to double-click on

you<00:04:42.350> we're<00:04:42.620> looking<00:04:43.010> for<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.490> physics<00:04:44.120> of

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
you we're looking for the physics of

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.150 
you we're looking for the physics of
this<00:04:45.320> object<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:47.170> it's<00:04:48.170> not<00:04:48.380> in<00:04:48.530> physics<00:04:48.950> like

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
this object and it's not in physics like

00:04:49.160 --> 00:05:04.840 
this object and it's not in physics like
you<00:04:49.280> think<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.700> would<00:04:49.880> be<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:53.950> oh<00:05:03.610> there<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:04.730> is

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
you think it would be and oh there it is

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.800 
you think it would be and oh there it is

okay so right-click on this object on
your<00:05:15.320> emitter<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:15.770> go<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.610> emitter

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
your emitter and go to emitter

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.370 
your emitter and go to emitter
properties<00:05:17.780> or<00:05:18.080> f4<00:05:19.900> now<00:05:20.900> that<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.170> emitter

properties are open go to the movement
section<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.290> under<00:05:24.890> there<00:05:25.160> there's<00:05:25.400> physics

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
section and under there there's physics

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.430 
section and under there there's physics
set<00:05:27.230> that<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.860> what<00:05:28.190> they<00:05:28.310> suggested<00:05:28.850> phys

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
set that to what they suggested phys

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.040 
set that to what they suggested phys
interpolating<00:05:30.580> once<00:05:31.580> you've<00:05:31.760> set<00:05:32.000> that<00:05:32.240> now

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
interpolating once you've set that now

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.770 
interpolating once you've set that now
if<00:05:33.230> you<00:05:33.350> do<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.500> play<00:05:33.710> from<00:05:33.920> here<00:05:34.420> there<00:05:35.420> our

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
if you do a play from here there our

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.550 
if you do a play from here there our
little<00:05:36.080> object<00:05:36.500> runs<00:05:36.950> to<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.250> end<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:37.700> stops

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
little object runs to the end and stops

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.600 
little object runs to the end and stops
so<00:05:39.560> if<00:05:39.620> we<00:05:39.740> want<00:05:39.890> to<00:05:39.980> keep<00:05:40.100> it<00:05:40.280> moving

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
so if we want to keep it moving

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.150 
so if we want to keep it moving
backwards<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.360> forwards<00:05:41.810> we<00:05:42.530> need<00:05:42.710> to<00:05:42.860> set<00:05:43.070> it

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
backwards and forwards we need to set it

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.020 
backwards and forwards we need to set it
to<00:05:43.190> completed<00:05:44.090> and<00:05:44.360> then<00:05:45.290> play<00:05:45.980> reversed<00:05:46.640> and

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
to completed and then play reversed and

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.640 
to completed and then play reversed and
then<00:05:47.690> once<00:05:47.990> it's<00:05:48.169> done<00:05:48.380> reversing<00:05:49.040> play<00:05:49.790> again

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
then once it's done reversing play again

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.380 
then once it's done reversing play again
now<00:05:51.650> when<00:05:51.860> we<00:05:51.950> play<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.160> oh<00:05:54.820> sorry<00:05:55.820> I<00:05:56.060> click

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
now when we play that oh sorry I click

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.130 
now when we play that oh sorry I click
down<00:05:56.540> no<00:05:56.840> kismet<00:05:57.350> now<00:05:57.650> we<00:05:57.710> play<00:05:57.980> that<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.900> now

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
down no kismet now we play that it now

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.010 
down no kismet now we play that it now
goes<00:06:00.410> back<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:01.370> forth<00:06:01.669> from<00:06:02.090> now<00:06:02.390> until<00:06:02.690> the

end of time you can do this with any
particle<00:06:05.600> system<00:06:05.930> it<00:06:06.110> will<00:06:06.200> work<00:06:06.380> properly

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
particle system it will work properly

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.310 
particle system it will work properly
all<00:06:07.430> you<00:06:07.880> need<00:06:08.060> to<00:06:08.210> do<00:06:08.330> is<00:06:08.510> make<00:06:08.690> sure<00:06:08.720> that<00:06:09.140> you

all you need to do is make sure that you

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.880 
all you need to do is make sure that you
