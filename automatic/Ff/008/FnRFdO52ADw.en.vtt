00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.619
 What do we want to do today? 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.240
 that's also my favorite cake okay 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.980
 what do we have then for things 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.579
 butter flour with baking powder sugar 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.730
 vanilla sugar icing sugar we need 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:37.420
 later for a pour well lemon 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.640
 Adequate always a pity and a pity 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.789
 after the lemon juice for the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.249
 kiss and of course I have that 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.339
 we are really beautiful here too 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:01:21.790
 Quite simply, we are doing so far in the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:01:25.890
 a mother's bowl does not do that 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.720
 but everything together 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.710
 here too sugar is easy too 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 take and tilt 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.250
 the eggs exactly did the last time 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.800
 we still need to separate this animal 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.530
 said 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:30.490
 you can not go too far the lemon 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:32.340
 rub was the white is bitter and 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.290
 why do you like the lemon? 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.320
 otherwise not really money that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.150
 a bio lemon and that sometimes looks 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.580
 not different from this beautiful one 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:54.430
 yellow alike, but that's it 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:03:03.730
 if not sprayed untreated , this is the case 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:06.750
 the ingredients if we have everything 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.750
 vigorously 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.620
 so completely 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.859
 Here I come 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:40.700
 in hindsight, no knife specifically 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:43.190
 with salt to it now we will the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:04:00.620
 cake spread nicely evenly 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:04:02.920
 would you like to exempt or 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.920
 firmly 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:16.190
 Now snack the place and push it 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:18.500
 we now at 180 degrees and do 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:27.590
 in the meantime the sugar is big 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:30.680
 more so now we start off 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.430
 the frosting okay we have yes 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.700
 measured here our powdered sugar already 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:45.729
 exist something would still need the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.729
 lemons so a nice knife 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:56.680
 Citrus squeezer against a claw 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 distinguish 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.000
 next time we have a lemon 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.540
 that we want to squeeze off that's good 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.120
 if we take those before and once 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.030
 really nice back and forth then move 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.200
 can be much much better 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:24.520
 Press now we give it carefully 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:37.360
 everything but because yes we we take a 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:37.900
 small you that you take that best 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.460
 spoon 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.040
 we have to do it all nicely 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.040
 stir and now once 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:56.140
 we underline there are enough 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:58.750
 that's all fine you take a mass 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.840
 A brush we brush the still 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.840
 to warm 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.139
 and you or smarties on it
