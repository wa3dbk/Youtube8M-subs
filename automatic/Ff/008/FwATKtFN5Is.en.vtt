00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello and welcome long is it 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.049
 Welcome back to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.860
 a new ticket tutorial in our 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.969
 ticket tutorial world and something today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.400
 it was really special 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.719
 long planned by me i have never been 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 found a right way 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.689
 Now there is finally something like that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.750
 So her task is lava vom 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.830
 countries into the victim role 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.599
 here and is a bit stupid if 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.120
 you always run with bucket back and forth 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 where it has it 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.360
 johnson banana and me a whole 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.809
 Great way to find out how to do that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.059
 can 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 especially with a particular block of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.329
 plays a big role here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.980
 namely the so-called changes tank no 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.770
 I do not know which engine I inflict 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:58.920
 check we just go now 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:01.079
 the denominator would so since I had the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 at that time already often tried with 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.570
 a tank and so here runs the pump 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.640
 then stop the lava at the point and the tank 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:20.369
 fills this is intimate was already full 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:22.580
 we do it all the time we do that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.580
 here 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.930
 first we need the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.170
 the pump we put that way now 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.460
 I'll do it this way and then 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.810
 we have a pump that must of course 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.430
 still be driven 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.710
 the tube pushes the automatic after 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.600
 downstairs but we have to do it as we said 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.380
 drive that we first became 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.159
 for stones 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.899
 we do that with redstone engines 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.250
 now four pieces here more 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.899
 you can not even turn it off and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.649
 must be free upstairs we had that 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.869
 advance 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.869
 so we can not do more than 4 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.460
 that works and the times 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.130
 even the pump point already 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.440
 sometimes we need you if you have one 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 will be on 1 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.810
 So here we do not need that their 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.950
 we can use the same meaning hope 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 I mean yes I just wanted to say 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.950
 because he does nothing happens 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.720
 red sun always change it a bit 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.910
 longer you do not take any other engines 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.209
 just stop there you have to pay attention how 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.090
 it makes the danger of explosion say I 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.120
 Just like that, then we have here 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.250
 the tank and then we consolidate 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.150
 We just put the tank on the pipes in the tank 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:45.440
 by the way, capital are roce 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.660
 roubaix so cobblestone that 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.250
 Water pipe and the edges tank here the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.579
 Feels slow now but how 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.739
 you do not see any ends, by the way , it turns out 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.780
 many routes a wanted 280 years a 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.940
 Kettle and an ender bead made 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.620
 so not too hard that feels 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.709
 We have to do more now 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.600
 do not except that we if you want 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.650
 that did not necessarily know her 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.329
 can be changed here a must 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:18.640
 so it is recommended here a the 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:21.030
 set people 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.760
 there martin 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:30.670
 so the cupboard here will be nice now 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.439
 I filled what I of course I look 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.439
 do not know that here no idea 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:42.069
 that was somehow wrong but it is 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:46.840
 not bad, because I just now 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.549
 that fischer approaches how to look tank 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.090
 Fills in the inventory is very 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.680
 Funny good then we put the tank 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.569
 after all, as we can see is yes 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.319
 just as filled and feels too 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.930
 thanks in the world anchor and so we can 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.209
 now here 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.959
 this and our device or ours 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.400
 tackle between tank here and then 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:17.169
 just an engine to stone in 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.669
 so driven and the company 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.430
 lava from the sea â€‹â€‹is here beautiful 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.759
 rhine pumped so easy you can 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.759
 do it 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.159
 the stupid is the running faster me 

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:40.119
 hope the world ag arrives the people 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.119
 probably not afterwards 

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:44.689
 but that's not the point 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:48.139
 today it was just about the ender tank we did 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:50.209
 do not want to overdo it but how to do it 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.629
 It still looks like it's coming after 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:55.759
 the anchor of the people 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.869
 promises what he should promise so 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.019
 that's how it has been all the time now 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:05:03.409
 go on and you what I motto her 

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:05.929
 beautiful machinery fighter or so and 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.679
 the rest happened by itself so that was 

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:08.860
 a tutorial 

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:12.169
 I hope you like it now if he does 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.509
 then take advantage of it would be like 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.580
 very nice or comparatively best 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.050
 and if you want to see more, subscribe 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.289
 You can also ask me questions 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.519
 although I have just too many others 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.610
 topics have I now first 

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.089
 well, it must be tutorials 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.110
 I do not care 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:29.110
 bye and bye
