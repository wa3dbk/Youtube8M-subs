 it's 12 points for each jury if you

 including yourself are the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.970
 five points do not arrive when they arrive 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.270

 delighted bettina oneto is watching the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.790
 show from the point of view of 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.010
 public let's give them their opinion not if 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.480
 I really wanted to do that some 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.250
 time because there are people who see it from 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.200
 another way for example last week 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.900

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.530
 being me there now I want to be here 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.090
 and see all the production not to see 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.190
 how the artist fits into the 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.390
 production and I think we injected him 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.690
 a little bit more of desire and you put it in 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.690
