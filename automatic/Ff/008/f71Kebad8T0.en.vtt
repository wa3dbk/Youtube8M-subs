00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.699
 multi tech week also look at us 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:34.379
 Today, these things ever go away 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.289
 we only need one so multicultural 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.730
 look is the first time following multi 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:43.379
 fact multiple pigs so 12 are why 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.289
 here are only three fixes in it are always 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.359
 only three actually how it looks 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.339
 there are only three so three packs 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.489
 but not five booster packs 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.559
 but ten players per booster three 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.929
 piece that is 30 cards one 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.430
 and otherwise the whole thing loses here 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.700
 all waiting time on it it still 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.920
 sometimes a double game also falls in the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.980
 bag in it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.980
 oh well everything sometimes the shit 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.520
 then, as always, it's a huge one 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.820
 Enjoy this limited edition card 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.550
 do we do is double that falls 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.290
 I do not need the limited 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:45.020
 To turn off card is as always 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:47.750
 make a pleasure that we more and more 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.380
 to swim rubber or what I know 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.940
 What kind of glue is there 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.530
 then kinked the card completely 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.380
 like that but that went pretty well 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.330

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.890
 I drive in the background then sat 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:14.030
 again stamped predetermined so timo 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:17.660

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.940
 up to four gates 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.160
 one of the absolute top talents in the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.209
 german soccer timo werner vom vfb 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.290
 Stuttgart 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.360
 We put it on our lawn like that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.980
 that you look like them and then we have 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.100
 here are the three letters we make 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 Just once twice twice 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.270
 and of course we will open it too 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.700
 and that does not make us bored 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.940
 also the spokesman of o2 booster 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.490
 then we also have the comparison 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.240
 between 55 boosters and 10 easter so 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.800
 yes so the timo Werner Katz 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.470

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.970
 multipack also stick now 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.640
 as a precaution, all together 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.910
 I want to hope that top us 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.860

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.930
 sorry to look him where the micro 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.430
 move 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:33.250

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.270
 turned 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.010
 it's the one for a case 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.570
 Five other no Ten 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.710
 Write 10 and make five rows 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.690
 we want to fool ourselves 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:49.670
 what is going on there with you, if you are a little one 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.400

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:06.140
 occasion is otherwise will be here 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.060
 Hardly complaining I think they want that 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.770
 Looks like ten cards out of coffins and 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.160

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.249
 nice going but then there were also times 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.919
 at least ten cards in it and 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:53.329
 we have the last way of multi sex 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.549

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:58.369

 darmstadt 98 and in sat card schalke 04 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.699
 attack so who can this be now 

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:25.610
 let's take a quick look and think 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.919
 which possibilities are there that speaks 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.599
 now holds a lot for a hat trick 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.339
 from klaas jan huntelaar and that would 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.379
 I really really like to see it now 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:38.659
 is that or is not that we will 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:40.219
 turn the thing over in 321 parametrix 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.459
 class in the hinterland that true 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:45.199
 that if you have something in the pigs 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:46.729
 then the multiplex is out again 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.129

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.619
 really cool thing she clears to mÃ¼ller 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.119
 Hattrick also holds in there and 

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:57.139

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:59.299
