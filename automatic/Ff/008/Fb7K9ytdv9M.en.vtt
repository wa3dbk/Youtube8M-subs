measures the size of a baseball card

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.940 
measures the size of a baseball card
it's<00:00:11.969> two<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.809> half<00:00:13.080> inches<00:00:13.230> by<00:00:13.590> three<00:00:13.860> and

those aspects after i finished the
charcoal<00:01:44.490> I'll<00:01:45.180> use<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> fixative<00:01:46.380> over<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.890> I

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
charcoal I'll use a fixative over it I

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.550 
charcoal I'll use a fixative over it I
didn't<00:01:48.180> videotape<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.750> cut<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.229> but

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
didn't videotape that I cut that out but

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950 
didn't videotape that I cut that out but
fixative<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.700> keep<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.030> from<00:01:51.119> smudging<00:01:51.479> later

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
fixative to keep it from smudging later

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.240 
fixative to keep it from smudging later
on<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.360> after<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> black<00:01:54.899> pencil<00:01:55.170> then<00:01:55.590> I'll

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
on so after the black pencil then I'll

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.749 
on so after the black pencil then I'll
use<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.579> white<00:01:56.880> prismacolor<00:01:57.659> pencil<00:01:58.610> just<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
use a white prismacolor pencil just to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.850 
use a white prismacolor pencil just to
get<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.270> idea<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.659> where<00:02:00.960> i'll<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.380> putting<00:02:01.710> the

get an idea of where i'll be putting the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.289 
get an idea of where i'll be putting the
highlights<00:02:02.280> where<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> highlights<00:02:02.880> belong

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and i make minor adjustments at this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.180 
and i make minor adjustments at this
stage<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.420> throughout<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> stages<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.590> think

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
stage and throughout the stages I think

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.990 
stage and throughout the stages I think
I<00:02:08.280> move<00:02:08.459> his<00:02:08.670> his<00:02:09.209> right<00:02:09.479> eye<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.560> bit

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
I move his his right eye up a little bit

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.370 
I move his his right eye up a little bit
it's<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:12.989> bit<00:02:13.140> too

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it's down a little bit too

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
it's down a little bit too
far<00:02:13.560> too<00:02:13.740> small<00:02:13.920> things<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.550> I'm<00:02:14.700> looking<00:02:14.820> at

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
far too small things as I'm looking at

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.690 
far too small things as I'm looking at
the<00:02:15.150> reference<00:02:15.480> i<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:15.810> i<00:02:15.930> can<00:02:15.990> see<00:02:16.520> if<00:02:17.520> things

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the reference i can i can see if things

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.970 
the reference i can i can see if things
aren't<00:02:17.940> matching<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:19.440> i<00:02:19.470> grabbed<00:02:19.950> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
aren't matching up and here i grabbed a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.950 
aren't matching up and here i grabbed a
toothbrush<00:02:20.460> an<00:02:20.640> old<00:02:20.760> toothbrush<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.720> put

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
toothbrush an old toothbrush and and put

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.680 
toothbrush an old toothbrush and and put
some<00:02:22.170> black<00:02:22.350> paint<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.390> create

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
some black paint on it just to create

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.010 
some black paint on it just to create
this<00:02:24.900> splattered<00:02:25.470> texture<00:02:26.120> which<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.450> find

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
this splattered texture which I find

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.800 
this splattered texture which I find
usually<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:29.130> gives<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.520> piece<00:02:29.700> more<00:02:30.090> energy<00:02:30.510> it

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
usually it gives a piece more energy it

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.100 
usually it gives a piece more energy it
makes<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.950> look<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.720> little<00:02:33.720> bit<00:02:33.960> more

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
makes it look a little bit more

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.810 
makes it look a little bit more
spontaneous<00:02:34.830> something<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.640> can't

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
spontaneous something that you can't

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.260 
spontaneous something that you can't
really<00:02:35.910> recreate<00:02:36.330> with<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> pencil<00:02:37.230> or<00:02:37.440> brush

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
really recreate with a pencil or brush

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.060 
really recreate with a pencil or brush
so<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.720> some<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> splatter<00:02:40.590> went

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
so you can see some of the splatter went

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.870 
so you can see some of the splatter went
on<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.340> his<00:02:41.460> face<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:44.070> next<00:02:44.310> stage<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.700> use

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
on to his face and the next stage I use

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.100 
on to his face and the next stage I use
a<00:02:44.910> gesso<00:02:46.160> paint<00:02:47.160> with<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> small<00:02:48.060> paintbrush<00:02:48.360> Oh

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
a gesso paint with a small paintbrush Oh

a gesso paint with a small paintbrush Oh
to<00:02:49.230> paint<00:02:49.770> brush<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.220> I'm<00:02:50.910> going<00:02:51.150> over<00:02:51.540> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
to paint brush and I'm going over and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.630 
to paint brush and I'm going over and
I'll<00:02:52.050> cover<00:02:52.380> up<00:02:52.590> those<00:02:52.740> splatter<00:02:53.130> marks<00:02:53.370> on

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
I'll cover up those splatter marks on

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.890 
I'll cover up those splatter marks on
his<00:02:53.760> face<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.920> style<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.280> work<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.540> pretty

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
his face this style of work is is pretty

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.640 
his face this style of work is is pretty
easy<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.350> correct<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:59.370> correct<00:02:59.700> any<00:02:59.940> mistakes

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
easy to correct to correct any mistakes

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.850 
easy to correct to correct any mistakes
so<00:03:01.650> I'm<00:03:02.220> generally<00:03:02.670> not<00:03:02.880> too<00:03:03.810> tight<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.470> try<00:03:04.740> not

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
so I'm generally not too tight I try not

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.740

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
too too detailed with these these

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.470 
too too detailed with these these
highlights<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:23.970> kind<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.180> building

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
highlights I'm just kind of building

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.930 
highlights I'm just kind of building
them<00:03:24.600> up<00:03:24.720> from<00:03:25.140> from<00:03:25.590> grade<00:03:25.860> to<00:03:25.890> white<00:03:26.250> with<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
them up from from grade to white with a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.550 
them up from from grade to white with a
couple<00:03:27.330> layers<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.720> gesso<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.140> then<00:03:28.350> going

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
couple layers of gesso and then going

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.680 
couple layers of gesso and then going
back<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.860> black<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.550> trying<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.450> find

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
back to black and and trying to find

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.380 
back to black and and trying to find
where<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.260> shadows<00:03:31.620> job<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.150> grab<00:03:33.360> my

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
where the shadows job and I grab my

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.780 
where the shadows job and I grab my
airbrush<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.740> airbrush<00:03:35.010> was<00:03:35.190> clogged<00:03:35.520> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
airbrush and the airbrush was clogged I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.850 
airbrush and the airbrush was clogged I
forgot<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.180> clean<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:36.720> last<00:03:36.900> time<00:03:37.020> I<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.470> ran

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
forgot to clean it but last time I I ran

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.890 
forgot to clean it but last time I I ran
it<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.460> you<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.210> see<00:03:39.330> I<00:03:39.360> have<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.570> little<00:03:39.690> bit<00:03:39.870> of

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
it so you can see I have a little bit of

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.960 
it so you can see I have a little bit of
difficulty<00:03:40.260> getting<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.250> consistency

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
difficulty getting that the consistency

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.720 
difficulty getting that the consistency
in<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> spray<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.800> I<00:03:43.890> think<00:03:44.100> actually<00:03:44.250> spray

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
in the spray and I think actually spray

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.100 
in the spray and I think actually spray
a<00:03:44.760> little<00:03:44.880> bit<00:03:45.060> too<00:03:45.240> much<00:03:45.420> here<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:45.840> by<00:03:45.990> his

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
a little bit too much here down by his

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.140 
a little bit too much here down by his
chin<00:03:46.440> it'll<00:03:47.070> you'll<00:03:47.220> see<00:03:47.400> splat<00:03:47.730> out<00:03:47.940> right

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
chin it'll you'll see splat out right

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.870 
chin it'll you'll see splat out right
there<00:03:49.160> luckily<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.280> didn't<00:03:50.459> hit<00:03:50.550> his<00:03:50.670> face

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
there luckily it didn't hit his face

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.220 
there luckily it didn't hit his face
otherwise<00:03:51.300> I<00:03:51.510> would<00:03:51.600> have<00:03:51.630> had<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.930> go<00:03:52.020> back

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
otherwise I would have had to go back

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.160 
otherwise I would have had to go back
and<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.770> kind<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.130> correct<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:54.660> landed<00:03:55.050> in

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
and and kind of correct it it landed in

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.080 
and and kind of correct it it landed in
a<00:03:55.290> good<00:03:55.440> spot<00:03:55.709> which<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.250> smart<00:03:56.910> you<00:03:57.060> should

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
a good spot which is smart you should

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.360 
a good spot which is smart you should
always<00:03:57.300> spray<00:03:57.720> off<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.620> paper<00:03:58.860> onto<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
always spray off the paper onto a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.510 
always spray off the paper onto a
scratch<00:03:59.880> piece<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.270> paper<00:04:00.890> just<00:04:01.890> in<00:04:02.280> case

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
scratch piece of paper just in case

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.920 
scratch piece of paper just in case
stuff<00:04:02.850> like<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.030> happens<00:04:03.300> especially<00:04:03.690> if

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
stuff like that happens especially if

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.070 
stuff like that happens especially if
you<00:04:03.990> have<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.110> cheaper<00:04:04.440> airbrush<00:04:04.860> like<00:04:04.890> I<00:04:05.250> do<00:04:06.080> so

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
you have a cheaper airbrush like I do so

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.190 
you have a cheaper airbrush like I do so
the<00:04:07.350> final<00:04:07.560> step<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.160> kind<00:04:08.520> of<00:04:08.959> pulling<00:04:09.959> out

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
the final step is kind of pulling out

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.680 
the final step is kind of pulling out
those<00:04:10.380> last<00:04:10.680> highlights<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.490> this<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.450> step

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
those last highlights and this this step

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.780 
those last highlights and this this step
usually<00:04:13.050> takes<00:04:13.310> longer<00:04:14.310> than<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.550> rest

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
usually takes longer than the rest

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.349 
usually takes longer than the rest
because<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:16.590> final<00:04:17.010> pencil<00:04:17.400> strokes<00:04:18.090> will<00:04:18.330> be

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
because the final pencil strokes will be

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.900 
because the final pencil strokes will be
seen<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.080> like<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:20.370> keep<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.700> pencil

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
seen so I like to to keep the pencil

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.330 
seen so I like to to keep the pencil
sharp<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.540> try<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> create<00:04:22.340> interesting
