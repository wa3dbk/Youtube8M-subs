so<00:00:00.880> I'm<00:00:00.940> just<00:00:01.089> a<00:00:01.240> standing<00:00:01.750> start<00:00:02.020> out<00:00:02.350> and<00:00:02.649> I'm

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:02.800 
so I'm just a standing start out and I'm

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.110 
so I'm just a standing start out and I'm
just<00:00:02.979> going<00:00:03.100> to<00:00:03.219> do<00:00:03.340> the<00:00:03.489> boot<00:00:03.699> it<00:00:03.850> again

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.120 
just going to do the boot it again

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.450 
just going to do the boot it again
please<00:00:04.509> never<00:00:04.750> look<00:00:05.020> there<00:00:05.290> you<00:00:05.379> go<00:00:08.460> peaking

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
please never look there you go peaking

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.930 
please never look there you go peaking
at<00:00:09.580> 1.3<00:00:10.420> settling<00:00:11.080> at<00:00:11.200> one<00:00:11.410> point<00:00:11.650> two<00:00:12.070> and<00:00:12.670> the

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
at 1.3 settling at one point two and the

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.550 
at 1.3 settling at one point two and the
or<00:00:13.150> kind<00:00:13.450> man<00:00:14.200> sensors<00:00:14.800> say<00:00:15.040> logs<00:00:15.450> 343<00:00:16.560> that's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
or kind man sensors say logs 343 that's

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.600 
or kind man sensors say logs 343 that's
with<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.890> wrong<00:00:18.040> box<00:00:18.280> fitted

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
with the wrong box fitted

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.030 
with the wrong box fitted
so<00:00:20.240> what<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:20.510> relics<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.140> doing<00:00:21.440> is<00:00:21.560> now<00:00:21.830> is

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
so what the relics is doing is now is

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.190 
so what the relics is doing is now is
tricking<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:22.610> ECU<00:00:23.210> into<00:00:23.510> thinking<00:00:23.900> I'm<00:00:24.050> doing

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
tricking the ECU into thinking I'm doing

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.480 
tricking the ECU into thinking I'm doing
less<00:00:24.500> boost<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.460> that's<00:00:25.820> allowing<00:00:26.300> the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
less boost and that's allowing the

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.150 
less boost and that's allowing the
to<00:00:28.330> keep<00:00:28.539> fueling<00:00:28.810> you<00:00:29.320> can<00:00:29.470> see<00:00:29.650> that<00:00:29.890> pulling

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
to keep fueling you can see that pulling

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.999 
to keep fueling you can see that pulling
nice<00:00:30.430> and<00:00:30.700> hard

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
nice and hard

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.150 
nice and hard
and<00:00:32.099> basting<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:32.970> one<00:00:33.120> point<00:00:33.390> too

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and basting at one point too

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.250 
and basting at one point too
nice<00:00:35.670> acceleration<00:00:36.510> from

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
nice acceleration from

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.720 
nice acceleration from
exhaust<00:00:38.980> got<00:00:39.190> ten<00:00:39.460> picture<00:00:39.850> now<00:00:41.370> 550<00:00:42.370> degree

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
exhaust got ten picture now 550 degree

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.940 
exhaust got ten picture now 550 degree
so<00:00:43.030> not<00:00:43.210> excessive<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.380> as<00:00:44.530> they<00:00:44.680> dropped<00:00:44.890> me

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
so not excessive and as they dropped me

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.890 
so not excessive and as they dropped me
for<00:00:45.250> back<00:00:45.520> off<00:00:45.730> just<00:00:46.000> see<00:00:46.149> now<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.420> Austin

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
for back off just see now the Austin

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.140 
for back off just see now the Austin
sources<00:00:47.230> person<00:00:47.559> temperature<00:00:48.010> dropping<00:00:48.400> as

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
sources person temperature dropping as

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.270 
sources person temperature dropping as
you<00:00:49.329> would<00:00:49.480> expect<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:52.600> it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
you would expect with it

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.750 
you would expect with it
let<00:00:54.760> me<00:00:54.850> count

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.830 

so<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.870> gonna<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.640> any<00:01:03.630> day

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
so what I'm gonna do is you know any day

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.620 
so what I'm gonna do is you know any day
can<00:01:04.050> get<00:01:04.140> spoke<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.060> gonna<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.390> boost

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
can get spoke so I'm gonna do is boost

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.149 
can get spoke so I'm gonna do is boost
account<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.620> can<00:01:07.800> see<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
account now so you can see the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.500 
account now so you can see the
acceleration<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:11.400> that's<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> wrong

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
acceleration go up and that's the wrong

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
acceleration go up and that's the wrong
box<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.260> definitely<00:01:14.010> increase<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
box for you definitely increase the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.510 
box for you definitely increase the
performance<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> truck<00:01:16.200> without<00:01:17.070> them

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
performance of the truck without them

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
performance of the truck without them
pulling<00:01:18.330> hard<00:01:18.660> now<00:01:19.250> good<00:01:20.250> acceleration<00:01:21.200> rate

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
pulling hard now good acceleration rate

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
pulling hard now good acceleration rate
our<00:01:22.380> fountain<00:01:22.920> Red's<00:01:23.130> fuel<00:01:23.580> still<00:01:23.970> pumping

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
our fountain Red's fuel still pumping

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:48.200 
our fountain Red's fuel still pumping
into<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.900> engine<00:01:46.100> exhaust<00:01:47.100> cap<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:47.910> went

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
into the engine exhaust cap which went

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.200 
into the engine exhaust cap which went
up<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.450> about<00:01:48.539> 580<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:50.520> thinking<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.090> lot

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
up to about 580 and I'm thinking a lot

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.770 
up to about 580 and I'm thinking a lot
nicely<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.110> boost<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.979> under<00:01:53.340> five

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
nicely there with boost just under five

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
nicely there with boost just under five
we're<00:01:54.780> there

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
we're there

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.700 
we're there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
now back down on the white sensor the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.039 
now back down on the white sensor the
