00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
level for the HEPA uh I guess you could

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.510 
level for the HEPA uh I guess you could
just<00:02:18.540> use<00:02:18.660> water<00:02:18.840> spells<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:20.130> most<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.400> them

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
just use water spells for most of them
