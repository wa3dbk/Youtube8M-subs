spring and summertime wear creme de nude
is<00:04:11.600> just<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.870> true<00:04:12.260> nude<00:04:12.950> color<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.490> doesn't

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
is just a true nude color it doesn't

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.160 
is just a true nude color it doesn't
have<00:04:13.880> pink<00:04:14.120> undertones<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.750> honestly<00:04:15.110> just

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
have pink undertones it honestly just

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.199 
have pink undertones it honestly just
has<00:04:15.500> like<00:04:15.530> tan<00:04:16.400> light

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
has like tan light

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.569
