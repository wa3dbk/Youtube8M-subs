00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.320
 hello very good to all that such a cloud 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.820
 the coward and come and explain how 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.940
 it works let's say the betting system 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.709
 of fs go lunch 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.269
 what is this good for? 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.789
 earn some pellets through the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.259
 exchanges that you get through 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.060
 steam in the global counter strike 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.029
 offensive let's say when you finish each 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.070
 they give you weapons because those weapons the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.169
 as most of what you get does not 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.419
 has no high economic value 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.460
 because you can use them on this page 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.259
 bets to increase its value 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 let's say betting the and getting 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.850
 greater benefits good I will explain 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.200
 how this works basically what 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.030
 first thing I told him to do is get into 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.149
 the web page as it is logical according to lutz 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.460
 dotcom to do the login nothing through 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 from steam ok you see here but steam 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960
 will put you password and user 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.629
 just like steam, I no longer have positions and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.940
 continue perfect we are already blocked 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.059
 or explained a little the structure of the 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.340
 page on the right here on the page 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.280
 start let's say from the web you have the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.520
 matches that are going to be played those that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.439
 they have been disputed and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.700
 if there is one in motion this that puts the 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.460
 air that are at the same running good 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 how to bet for example if 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.830
 we want to bet in the game of guiza 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.540
 against matic 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.260
 well this already as you see has here the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.220
 moth that he has already won is natiq 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.450
 pretty good I will explain how 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.400
 it works the first thing that needs to be done is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.980
 add in addition to your inventory the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.510
 how is this done, well, I eat 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.070
 I said you have done login through 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.040
 of steam pinchase for example in this 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.660
 party of code against mitnick os 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.050
 it will appear I already have it done 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.730
 that's why it tells us down here 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.280
 a small green box will appear 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.380
 similar in which you have to put a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
 link which you do not have how to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.740
 get that link that is the link of 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.120
 exchange here arribita to the right 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.690
 more or less in that same box 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.420
 will appear a link that you press and you 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.650
 send to the community page and it's 5000 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.300
 and you and a link like this will appear 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.630
 which is the exchange link that link 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.670
 you copy it and paste it in the box 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.100
 green that appears here once there 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.100
 expected you give to paste to submit ok and 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.450
 I will make an exchange with a bot to 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.790
 sting by a request for 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.230
 exchange ok and that request for 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.970
 exchange that appears to register 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.660
 here or directly a link os 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.569
 will appear 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.340
 on the page itself 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.340
 over here for example inventing my 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.069
 exchange such and such do not accept and there 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.189
 put the weapons you want to use to 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.170
 bet then I recommend that says 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.139
 I put all my weapons of little value 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.019
 those of 2 cents 10 12 17 the weapons of 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.879
 shit so to speak I put them 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.370
 sent is an apple exchange or are you 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.680
 you do not deliver everything you do not want 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.780
 what I want is to use to bet and so not 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.189
 they give you nothing to sting you will warn that 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.049
 that page seems to be that they have 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.120
 denounced for scam good that's 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.180
 lie why it happens that is true 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.219
 that if you make a very low bet and the 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.900
 profit making is very low by 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.609
 example a cent two cents there 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.859
 sometimes not as long as they do not send it to you 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.439
 it's just let's say you do not lose are you 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.750
 stored on the page nothing serious 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.530
 I recommend the use of this page 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.329
 good one time 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.090
 let's say you accept was exchanged to 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.949
 hair you go back to the page and yes 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.019
 you will have here our inventory of 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.849
 weapons to bet good for example 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.150
 let's see let's go to a home page 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.730
 visit a party that can 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.920
 bet that he has not already done the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.690
 have gambled 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 bet on the good but more or less 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.069
 it's good here that you can have in 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.620
 definitively I'm going to bet on the 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.560
 better is like I already did skewer mj vale 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.500
 here has a 56 percent 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.129
 who have bet bet on mj and 44 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.349
 by exceltur in theory most 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.659
 think you will win 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.209
 mj then surely because it's better or 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.099
 they get better and there are people there 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.090
 Sometimes it's a game that has 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.099
 an 80 and a 10 supposedly I'm not very 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.739
 put right now in the 100 that happens 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.120
 Well, those people who bet, let's say 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.220
 that the team that in theory seems that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.260
 will lose is to give the surprise 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.820
 because because if you bet a euro then 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.560
 The greatest benefit you receive is the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.169
 greater the new building will be greater 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.780
 because he has bet less for the good what 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.210
 what is the betting system 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.039
 that said we're still betting on mj and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.990
 you will have to insert weapons down here to the 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.510
 right down here you will appear 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.550
 a liquid square and a box of 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.570
 I want him to continue here he will put trees and 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.090
 will make returns 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.530
 almÃ³n and that food style and rumbles 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.150
 is the inventory that you have given to the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.050
 page with the exchange that we made 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.730
 before 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.500
 then there you will see the weapons that 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.960
 you have on the postal page click is the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.180
 that you want to send pee will disappear 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.850
 here up to a maximum of four good 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.200
 as it is a match so it is not 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.970
 you know which one you're going to win is actually 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.640
 very balanced, well, maybe not 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.250
 you play many weapons but from bet 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.400
 that therefore the one that less value than they have 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.560
 for you you give to itv or in this 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.510
 case, it's time , it puts me 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.890
 because I can extend the bet on 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.890
 our case, moreover, please leave 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.230
 essap lizbeth and ready and you will appear 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.490
 directly this window 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.950
 you see all matches that you have contributed 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.830
 we are all I have running 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.409
 good agreement and now what would happen then 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.319
 nothing this simply a window of 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.839
 the bet he had made and in the case 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:34.119
 that he has won a bet 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:36.240
 a window will appear there is this 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:39.090
 it's still going 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.039
 well when this game ends when 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.250
 these three parties end up assuming 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.660
 that I win them because we will see a 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.190
 window similar to this one on the left the 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.740
 party and such and here on the right will put 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.539
 wow 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.919
 the one in turn and request 'items one 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.050
 means what you have earned in the 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.789
 bet of tulle means that you 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.979
 return the souls that have already wagered 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.500
 you get back what you have earned the most 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.150
 you had already wagered and down the last one is 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.039
 what is re tun in case you want to claim 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.620
 some weapon so that you also to steam and 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.210
 be able to make use of them in the game I 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.310
 I recommend that it be not that it be a 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.539
 very nice very important weapon that 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.090
 you are looking for that you want it 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:20.599
 collect then not the waves you put 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.220
 in resources returns because because 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.659
 you can bet again you do not have 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.180
 to do the exchange this so that 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.860
 the page has weapons 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.150
 I hope I hope I'm trying and 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.400
 fast because I do not want the video to be 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.930
 very long I hope you understand me 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.310
 basically the operation of the 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.050
 page s then you have here in your profile 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.730
 here you have a more or less summary of 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.010
 the bets and how to get out the thing I've 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.440
 made a total of 14 bets and those 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.870
 I won 11 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.639
 the statistics good because I won 11 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.169
 because I've always been safe for 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.440
 that then to start expanding my 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:56.810
 weapons inventory try to do each 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:00.710
 you bet older get weapons more 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.270
 faces and so the benefit that 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.130
 we can continue to be greater if you have put a 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.090
 euro so get more than if you have put 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:10.130
 a cent is basically that and I think 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.520
 nothing else anything that you may have 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.849
 any question any 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.580
 suggestion even as you comment on me and 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:20.050
 I will try to make a video a little bit more 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.270
 Practical because right now I do not have 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.699
 no party that has finished to 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.919
 that you see the result but well I think 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:29.409
 that means nothing more guys 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:32.430
 Any doubt you ask me and a 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:32.430
 greeting chao
