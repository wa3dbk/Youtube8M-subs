is<00:00:53.219> pretty<00:00:53.250> nondescript<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.840> think<00:00:58.170> when

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
is pretty nondescript but I think when

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.430 
is pretty nondescript but I think when
we<00:00:58.590> open<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.510> we'll<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.750> something<00:01:00.989> pretty

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
we open it up we'll see something pretty

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.880 
we open it up we'll see something pretty

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
ultra mobile device it's a heck of a lot

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
ultra mobile device it's a heck of a lot
smaller<00:01:22.830> than<00:01:23.159> anything<00:01:23.580> else<00:01:23.729> I've<00:01:23.970> seen<00:01:24.299> so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
far taking a look at it here we can see

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.440 
far taking a look at it here we can see
we've<00:01:28.890> got<00:01:30.079> two<00:01:31.079> USB<00:01:31.590> ports<00:01:31.970> we<00:01:32.970> got<00:01:33.090> our<00:01:33.210> power

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we've got two USB ports we got our power

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.910 
we've got two USB ports we got our power
supply<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.850> we've<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.439> says<00:01:37.439> TV<00:01:38.100> and

supply here we've got a says TV and
headphone<00:01:40.920> jack<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> TV

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
headphone jack I don't know what the TV

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.560 
headphone jack I don't know what the TV
stands<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.930> maybe<00:01:43.649> we'll<00:01:43.799> look<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
stands for maybe we'll look at the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.170 
stands for maybe we'll look at the
manual<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.689> find<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.640> front<00:01:47.970> panel

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
manual and find out on the front panel

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.440 
manual and find out on the front panel
we've<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.750> power<00:01:49.500> button<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.909> something

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
we've got power button and at something

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
we've got power button and at something
that<00:01:51.479> says<00:01:51.750> em<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.439> think<00:01:52.619> that's<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
that says em and I think that's a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.050 
that says em and I think that's a
special<00:01:53.479> module<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.409> lets<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.280> do

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
special module for this that lets you do

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.450 
special module for this that lets you do
some<00:01:57.360> sort<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.689> video<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:58.259> something<00:01:58.460> this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
some sort of video or something this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.560 
some sort of video or something this
looks<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.969> could<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> camera

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
looks like it is the could be a camera

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
looks like it is the could be a camera
or<00:02:03.600> maybe<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.170> light<00:02:04.409> we'll<00:02:04.680> find<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
or maybe it's a light we'll find out and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.719 
or maybe it's a light we'll find out and
on<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.570> side<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.229> got<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> TV<00:02:07.770> antenna<00:02:08.039> box

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
on this side it's got a TV antenna box

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.010 
on this side it's got a TV antenna box
here<00:02:09.179> doesn't<00:02:09.989> look<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.379> have<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.739> at

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
here doesn't look like we have one at

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.830 
here doesn't look like we have one at
ash<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.320> this<00:02:11.470> one<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.070> then<00:02:12.610> we've<00:02:12.760> got<00:02:12.790> an<00:02:13.540> i

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
ash to this one and then we've got an i

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.300 
ash to this one and then we've got an i
oh<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.670> we've<00:02:15.670> got<00:02:15.850> mini<00:02:16.210> SD<00:02:16.450> here<00:02:17.140> open<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.160> up

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
oh so we've got mini SD here open it up

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.190 
oh so we've got mini SD here open it up
and<00:02:18.400> take<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.640> look<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:19.000> we've<00:02:19.090> got<00:02:19.210> mini<00:02:19.480> SD<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and take a look so we've got mini SD and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.120 
and take a look so we've got mini SD and
some<00:02:20.950> sort<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:23.290> looks<00:02:23.500> like<00:02:23.680> some<00:02:23.920> sort<00:02:24.040> of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
some sort of it looks like some sort of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.830 
some sort of it looks like some sort of
cable<00:02:24.640> maybe<00:02:25.000> we'll<00:02:25.150> find<00:02:25.360> something<00:02:25.570> else

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
cable maybe we'll find something else
