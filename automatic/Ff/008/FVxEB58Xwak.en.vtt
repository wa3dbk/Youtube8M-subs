 mobile friends magazine welcome back 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.839
 on our youtube video channel yes 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'm lucio and I'm a Christian indeed 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.349
 Thursday 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.630
 today Thursday and therefore as promised every 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.839
 Thursday we review a new game a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.279
 video game for android were wondering a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.109
 comment 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.750
 there are tablets for smartphones 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.029
 android and to do so we rely on 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 her service this planet we've 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 shown last time now I will 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.140
 I revise this say store 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.899
 where you subscribe for an expense 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.600
 low of 2.99 euros a week 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.640
 Exactly download everything you want 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.510
 and from all the games present in the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.020
 catalog and are more than 200 and so 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.640
 paid sum is as if it rained as if 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.469
 it rains this is a bit of the claim of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 rais made this simplified of us 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.660
 and here among all these raindrops 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.149
 always put sorbana free 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.469
 what we downloaded semo downloads 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.379
 contract killer 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.680
 zombies lr already under the saying is meta 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.750
 I play but you don't give up then now 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 I'll show you here because meanwhile 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.200
 we also downloaded to show 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 in short, how many phones you have for 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.430
 i stay but don't miss out 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.000
 nothing can be a classic 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 survival horror 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.759
 if however, funds with exact zombies is a 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.590
 bit particular in my opinion has one 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.740
 structure that fits a lot for 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.560
 all example 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.299
 has a mobile game in the sense that it does not 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.009
 you will have to move bim which is already a 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.780
 advantage because in any case with the controls 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.520
 touch e is quite complicated but 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.720
 you will only have to shoot that is not part of me 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.259
 amuses laymen so yes but how much blood 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.990
 because although shit but admitted that 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.700
 the version is not in the recesses as it is 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.280
 car to take but no coach e 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.670
 who wants it to work blood is fine 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.220
 okay if we talk here a lot already see 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.729
 we like this kind of revet 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.909
 apple with guns in hand, always short 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.340
 disturbing 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.979
 I therefore the structure is really 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.660
 simple and immediate just to do for 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.130
 make you have fun with no frills without it 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.860
 things you have to turn 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.890
 here we shoot point created then we say 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.730
 in this town that has been invaded 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.739
 from the zombies he would find himself having to 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.690
 shoot but also depend on the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.150
 Exactly yes people very often it is 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.190
 to defend your partner who 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.620
 maybe went looking for ammunition 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.600
 rather than other things or yes 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.390
 traits to defend some hostages 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.190
 there is some hostage in some 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.959
 characters that are around who must 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.200
 project get on a helicopter for yes 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.540
 understand why anyway notice to 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.060
 let me show you now and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.350
 select for example a mission that 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.700
 the one in one of my favorites i 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.600
 Poles whom one shoots at the helicopter or 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.150
 of course the game is not an end in itself 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.130
 same there is there was a country we must 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.380
 call for help in the sky threatens one 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.480
 important part the arms in it 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.510
 this game because it is the part a bit 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.609
 tactics of the game so depending on 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.450
 the mission is up to you to choose 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.819
 the right weapon and naturally progressing 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.560
 in the game you earn money that 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.390
 they are used to buy more powerful weapons 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.250
 more precise 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.790
 exactly the weapons divide helplessly and 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.610
 precise and never saying to the powerful 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.590
 I don't know they are not precise or precise 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.819
 they are happy this is mine 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.620
 explanation or okay anyway now 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.940
 I want to see a demonstration worth more 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.830
 of 100 explanation 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:48.489
 here you are stopped by on this helicopter 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.950
 no it is the only one is mine under there is yours 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.890
 friend who is there to sunbathe 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.989
 pity that around there are a lot of 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.920
 zombies but now ionio is you can 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.300
 practically change the view here 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.580
 maybe I seem to be a bit 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.360
 killing, feel the vice crosses 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.489
 good to shoot the feelings of understanding 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.500
 because sir directly to this 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:16.269
 it was just to let people see it is certainly not 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.340
 which however is theoretically here is the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.859
 game is to hit them not only with zombies 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.970
 watch while already slaughtering yours 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.410
 friend 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.880
 then now it is recharging here behold a 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.729
 you made it 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.590
 it's one is dead but these are things you think about 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.190
 I mean for you I want to say that these 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 pensions body who we have seen is seen 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.330
 I mean here maybe I should leave 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.190
 from the bernie is not the water then 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.740
 naturally I have already gone ahead 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.710
 they are already at level 3 and also because 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.520
 some weapons you wo n't be able to use if 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.020
 you don't have the appropriate level so 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.560
 we do the weapons of course now 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.350
 see you buy in this store with 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.660
 money you accumulated during missions 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.200
 and will say from normal rifles i 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.440
 sniper rifles sniper rifles 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.750
 submachine 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.790
 sniper hunting sniper up to 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.310
 get to the give me thermal in the 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.100
 so like this stick tech med gun 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.310
 that you also want 100hp more life but 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.740
 ok of hunger see again for a moment 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.450
 action because maybe never a level one 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.160
 little more your reach, that is, one 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.550
 in the nutella example the level 1 a 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.130
 another classic and this where you will have to 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.730
 defend your partner who goes to 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:42.080
 shopping goes well because there are i 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.850
 salt the sun so now I concentrate 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.710
 more on games because many are good 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.020
 store listening to the mids she must go 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.170
 to recover ammunition crates e 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.030
 then finishing fendi by trying to di 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:57.470
 hit but this time not to 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.330
 miss nothing and there are a game here 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.070
 which we say can also bring out the 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.070
 worst side of the euro gas 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.170
 here is good from the looks that if you don't know 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.669
 but why do I have to recharge within one 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.470
 aims that really not but how it has 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.240
 made to repair them I see three you used the 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.350
 cd the truth 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.060
 this I caught him in the head then 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.070
 meanwhile when I hit her in the head 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.680
 the famous pavement gains many more 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.080
 money then in the meantime christian looks 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.770
 not to make a bad end to his 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.600
 friend 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.190
 we can say that he will begin to speak a 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.910
 bit of the pros and cons of this game 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.000
 then 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.850
 Meanwhile, we say it is fun and 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.830
 intuitive and simple from the point of view 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.570
 of the controls and therefore immediately a lot 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.750
 exact engaging and this certainly 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.640
 also graphically I would say that it is not 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.490
 not bad all in all added together 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.139
 cute 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.729
 however the graphics are functional to 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:54.020
 talk about why else they do here 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:55.190
 ugly and then after is the wealth of 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.379
 arms that is the fact that there are 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.750
 lots of very different weapons too 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:01.729
 system to be able to get that 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.129
 you have to progress products in the game and 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:06.560
 all we say is well structured 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.900
 and it is done tele done well 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.120
 nice also the fact the possibility of 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.900
 choose if shoots from afar if 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.879
 use the viewfinder 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.740
 luciano but it is true he died on the ground but for 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:21.110
 pity we hope our friends that 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:25.639
 they will try it no better than us 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:27.500
 however, there is sorry for what I end 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.629
 which instead concerns the cons 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.060
 perhaps the long tend a little 

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:34.219
 repetitive because the missions anyway 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.650
 they are always the static ones of coverage 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:37.300
 however common 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.280
 the right game to make us a game 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.320
 occasionally let off steam a little above all 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.889
 on the tram when at 5 minutes you put yourself 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.740
 there at the games and then you can wait 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:51.210
 drivers to be exact next 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.430
 so in short this is contract killer 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:58.539
 zombies is helpless if you rewrite it that you 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:59.949
 be very difficult on the reno sub ato e va 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:01.600
 well it remains only to greet from the 

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:03.910
 appointment next week 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.669
 when we will review the new one 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.870
 game always downloaded from play planet va 

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:09.870
 good bye hello
