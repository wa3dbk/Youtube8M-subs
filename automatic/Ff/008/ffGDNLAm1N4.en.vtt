00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
to recap you never want to put a 90 that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.019 
to recap you never want to put a 90 that
close<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> pump<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.039> minimum

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
close to a pump this is a minimum

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.800 
close to a pump this is a minimum
standard

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
standard

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
standard
so<00:00:22.140> arguments<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.250> two<00:00:23.550> inches<00:00:23.910> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
so arguments like this is two inches of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.920 
so arguments like this is two inches of
pipe<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:25.019> want<00:00:25.320> eight<00:00:25.590> inches<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.930> straight

its minimum four times but pipe diameter

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.130 
its minimum four times but pipe diameter
I<00:00:46.110> say<00:00:46.530> six<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.039> eight<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:48.239> other<00:00:48.420> thing<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.930> if

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I say six to eight the other thing is if

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.770 
I say six to eight the other thing is if
you<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.500> an<00:00:49.680> air<00:00:49.890> lock<00:00:50.129> problems<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.480> call

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
you have an air lock problems and I call

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
you have an air lock problems and I call
this<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> Hartford<00:00:52.649> loop<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.309> say<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> have

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this the Hartford loop and I say to have

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.889 
this the Hartford loop and I say to have
this<00:00:54.829> after<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.149> heater<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.480> everything

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
this after your heater and everything

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.520 
this after your heater and everything
put<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.789> now<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
put this in because you can now have it

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.639 
put this in because you can now have it
chlorinator

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
chlorinator

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
chlorinator
a<00:01:01.770> lot<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.460> people<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.329> heartful<00:01:03.750> loop

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
a lot of people think a heartful loop

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.640 
a lot of people think a heartful loop
would<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.710> before<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.700> pump<00:01:06.000> okay<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
would be good before the pump okay this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.560 
would be good before the pump okay this
is<00:01:07.890> could<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.159> one<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.700> problems<00:01:09.210> because

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
is could be one of your problems because

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140 
is could be one of your problems because
you<00:01:09.720> pups<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.320> priming<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.909> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you pups not priming up if you have this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.660 
you pups not priming up if you have this
type<00:01:12.479> scenario<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.740> wind<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.520> air

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
type scenario you have wind up with air

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.270 
type scenario you have wind up with air
locks<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.270> pump<00:01:15.689> will<00:01:15.900> never<00:01:16.320> prime<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:17.009> right

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
locks you pump will never prime up right

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.080 
locks you pump will never prime up right
I<00:01:17.520> mean<00:01:18.030> sometimes<00:01:18.420> yes<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:20.310> pumps<00:01:20.820> work

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
I mean sometimes yes I see pumps work

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.289 
I mean sometimes yes I see pumps work
fine<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.340> every<00:01:23.340> once<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> while

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
fine but every once in a while

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.109 
fine but every once in a while
you<00:01:24.869> better<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.130> scenario<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
you better not have that scenario the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.399 
you better not have that scenario the
other<00:01:27.270> thing<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.650> many<00:01:29.040> people<00:01:29.360> use

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
other thing is I see so many people use

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.429 
other thing is I see so many people use
flexible<00:01:31.409> pipe<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.430> much<00:01:32.729> easier<00:01:33.439> but

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
flexible pipe it's so much easier but

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.030 
flexible pipe it's so much easier but
argument<00:01:34.890> sake<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.720> foot<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:37.020> scheduled<00:01:37.650> pipe

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
argument sake a foot of scheduled pipe

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.560 
argument sake a foot of scheduled pipe
on<00:01:39.079> flexible<00:01:40.079> pipe<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.790> equal<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.060> foot

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
on flexible pipe it's equal to a foot

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.120 
on flexible pipe it's equal to a foot
and<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.869> half<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.460> every<00:01:45.270> foot<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:49.130> flexible

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and a half so for every foot of flexible

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
and a half so for every foot of flexible
pipe<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.360> equal<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> foot<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
pipe you have is equal to a foot and a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.620 
pipe you have is equal to a foot and a
half<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:53.939> bit<00:01:54.210> more<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:55.009> PVC<00:01:56.009> pipe

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
half we're a little bit more of PVC pipe

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.260 
half we're a little bit more of PVC pipe
alright<00:01:57.630> again<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:59.130> talked<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.060> bit

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
alright again we talked a little bit

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.800 
alright again we talked a little bit
about<00:02:00.530> hydraulics<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> icy<00:02:02.640> pulls<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
about hydraulics and icy pulls all the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.100 
about hydraulics and icy pulls all the
time<00:02:04.110> plumbed<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.759> hundreds<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.509> hundreds

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
time plumbed with hundreds and hundreds

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.499 
time plumbed with hundreds and hundreds
and<00:02:07.290> hundreds<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> feet<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.310> flexible<00:02:08.879> pipe

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and hundreds of feet of flexible pipe

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.630 
and hundreds of feet of flexible pipe
because<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.140> Installer<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.800> too<00:02:11.009> lazy<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.459> do

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
because the Installer was too lazy to do

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.460 
because the Installer was too lazy to do
it<00:02:11.670> right<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.660> another<00:02:12.810> peppy

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it right this is another peppy

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.390 
it right this is another peppy
of<00:02:13.560> mine<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.300> never<00:02:15.300> say<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:15.870> elbow<00:02:16.800> should<00:02:17.280> be

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
of mine I never say this elbow should be
