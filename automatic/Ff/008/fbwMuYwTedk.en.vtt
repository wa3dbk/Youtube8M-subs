00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.520 

today<00:00:09.630> I'm<00:00:09.900> testing<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.639> 5970<00:00:11.660> s<00:00:12.660> performance

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
today I'm testing the 5970 s performance

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.930 
today I'm testing the 5970 s performance
in<00:00:13.950> dirt<00:00:14.280> too<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:15.809> sapphire<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
in dirt too it is from sapphire and

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.650 
in dirt too it is from sapphire and
here's<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.650> repetition<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.770> 1920<00:00:20.640> x<00:00:20.730> 1200<00:00:21.060> is

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
here's the repetition is 1920 x 1200 is

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.370 
here's the repetition is 1920 x 1200 is
the<00:00:21.810> monitor<00:00:22.199> goes<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.000> 8x<00:00:24.380> anti-aliasing

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the monitor goes and 8x anti-aliasing

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.040 
the monitor goes and 8x anti-aliasing
and<00:00:25.849> aspect<00:00:26.849> ratio<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.470> 1610<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.210> all<00:00:30.210> levels

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and aspect ratio is 1610 and all levels

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
and aspect ratio is 1610 and all levels
of<00:00:31.140> detail<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:32.009> high<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.759> ultra<00:00:33.180> they're<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
of detail are high or ultra they're the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.860 
of detail are high or ultra they're the
highest<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.079> go<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.219> here<00:00:35.760> now<00:00:36.090> I'll<00:00:36.480> run

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
highest they can go so here now I'll run

00:00:36.870 --> 00:02:05.550 
highest they can go so here now I'll run
the<00:00:37.020> benchmark<00:00:37.579> will<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> results

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:32.970 

you

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:53.300 

you<00:02:33.400> should

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.520 

and<00:02:54.310> there<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.420> game<00:02:55.840> got<00:02:56.080> an<00:02:56.230> average

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
and there it is the game got an average

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.580 
and there it is the game got an average
of<00:02:56.710> 88<00:02:57.640> frame<00:02:58.030> per<00:02:58.270> second<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.200> minimum

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
of 88 frame per second and the minimum

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.610 
of 88 frame per second and the minimum
frame<00:03:00.280> rate<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.760> 77<00:03:01.510> which<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.900> very<00:03:02.140> good<00:03:02.380> on

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
frame rate of 77 which is very good on

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.820 
frame rate of 77 which is very good on
everything<00:03:03.190> high<00:03:03.490> on<00:03:03.760> 1920<00:03:04.450> x<00:03:04.600> 1200<00:03:04.830> thanks
