so these like a fairly warm so you know

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.149 
so these like a fairly warm so you know
typical<00:01:26.509> tea<00:01:27.509> conditions<00:01:27.990> are<00:01:28.170> 75<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> 80

degrees<00:01:29.579> Fahrenheit<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:31.040> this<00:01:32.040> one

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
degrees Fahrenheit and about this one

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.780 
degrees Fahrenheit and about this one
here<00:01:32.490> particularly<00:01:32.909> likes<00:01:33.240> somewhat<00:01:34.790> moist

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
here particularly likes somewhat moist

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
here particularly likes somewhat moist
substrate<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.450> around<00:01:36.630> 80%<00:01:36.960> humidity<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
substrate like around 80% humidity so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.429 
substrate like around 80% humidity so
that's<00:01:38.100> accomplished<00:01:38.909> by<00:01:39.409> missing<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that's accomplished by missing the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.490 
that's accomplished by missing the
substrate<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.400> keeping<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.329> water<00:01:42.570> dish<00:01:42.780> full

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
substrate and keeping a water dish full

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.249 
substrate and keeping a water dish full
at<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.799> times<00:01:44.040> missing<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:44.939> two<00:01:45.299> times<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
at all times missing about two times a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.920 
at all times missing about two times a
week<00:01:46.290> will<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.710> sufficient<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.430> species

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
week will be sufficient for this species

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.420 
week will be sufficient for this species
so<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> terrorist<00:01:50.220> real

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
so as you know this is a terrorist real

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.859 
so as you know this is a terrorist real
one<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> keep<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.869> wide

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
one so you have to keep it in a wide

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.920 
one so you have to keep it in a wide
enclosure<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:56.009> tall<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.570> substrate

enclosure not tall with some substrate

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
enclosure not tall with some substrate
I'm<00:01:58.020> using<00:01:58.229> potting<00:01:58.649> soil<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> water<00:01:59.790> dish

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I'm using potting soil with a water dish

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.429 
I'm using potting soil with a water dish
and<00:02:00.270> hotting<00:02:01.049> place<00:02:01.259> that's

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
and hotting place that's

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.340 
and hotting place that's
the<00:02:02.979> must<00:02:03.219> for<00:02:03.640> any<00:02:04.030> species<00:02:04.539> whether<00:02:04.960> we<00:02:05.170> keep

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
the must for any species whether we keep

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.010 
the must for any species whether we keep
it<00:02:05.469> as<00:02:05.560> gramma<00:02:05.799> stola<00:02:06.159> rocky<00:02:07.060> Polamalu<00:02:07.570> fedora

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it as gramma stola rocky Polamalu fedora

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.390 
it as gramma stola rocky Polamalu fedora
or<00:02:08.580> even<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.349> old<00:02:11.349> burl<00:02:11.650> trust<00:02:11.980> rules<00:02:12.190> they

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
or even the old burl trust rules they

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.430 
or even the old burl trust rules they
gotta<00:02:13.300> need<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.690> kind<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.290> setup<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:16.440> their

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
gotta need that kind of setup so their

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.440 
gotta need that kind of setup so their
longevity<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.010> pretty<00:02:18.400> typical<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:19.030> your<00:02:19.180> bird

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
longevity is pretty typical of your bird

since<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.840> got<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.170> as<00:02:35.410> an<00:02:35.530> adult<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:36.010> really

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
since I got this as an adult I really

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.120 
since I got this as an adult I really
can't<00:02:36.670> tell<00:02:36.849> you<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.299> they<00:02:37.989> grow<00:02:38.319> very<00:02:38.349> fast<00:02:38.860> or

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
can't tell you if they grow very fast or

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.120 
can't tell you if they grow very fast or
not<00:02:39.160> I'm<00:02:39.489> assuming<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.440> they<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.680> medium

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
not I'm assuming that they have a medium

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.559 
not I'm assuming that they have a medium
growth<00:02:42.430> rate<00:02:42.700> typical<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.269> most<00:02:43.299> bird<00:02:43.930> eaters

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
growth rate typical to most bird eaters

growth rate typical to most bird eaters
so<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.870> can't<00:02:47.110> coach<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:49.590> breeding<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
so it can't coach you on that breeding I

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.530 
so it can't coach you on that breeding I
don't<00:02:50.950> have<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.250> male<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.790> species<00:02:52.000> because

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
don't have the male this species because

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.870 
don't have the male this species because
since<00:02:52.750> these<00:02:53.049> are<00:02:53.260> relatively<00:02:54.250> hard<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:54.700> find

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
since these are relatively hard to find

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.300 
since these are relatively hard to find
in<00:02:55.000> Canada<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> would<00:02:56.560> assume<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:56.860> it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
in Canada so I would assume that it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.390 
in Canada so I would assume that it's
typical<00:02:57.790> bird<00:02:57.970> eater

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
typical bird eater

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.600 
typical bird eater
you<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.549> potential<00:03:01.090> cannibalism<00:03:01.900> from<00:03:02.140> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
you have potential cannibalism from the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.309 
you have potential cannibalism from the
male<00:03:03.610> if<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.840> male<00:03:04.959> gets<00:03:05.170> eaten<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.989> that's

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
male if the male gets eaten and that's

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.030 
male if the male gets eaten and that's
it<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:08.650> we<00:03:08.739> keep<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:09.040> 80<00:03:09.190> degrees<00:03:09.519> Fahrenheit

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it so we keep it 80 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.520 
it so we keep it 80 degrees Fahrenheit
miss<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.190> around<00:03:12.430> twice<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.700> week<00:03:13.350> okay<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> ton

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
miss it around twice a week okay a ton

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.270 
miss it around twice a week okay a ton
per<00:03:14.650> minute<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:14.950> these<00:03:15.069> guys<00:03:15.250> these<00:03:16.150> ones<00:03:16.630> are

mmm<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.519> would<00:03:19.120> say<00:03:19.269> semi<00:03:19.569> defensive<00:03:20.139> they're

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
mmm I would say semi defensive they're

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.259 
mmm I would say semi defensive they're
not<00:03:20.500> terribly<00:03:21.100> aggressive<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.910> Nandu

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
not terribly aggressive like the Nandu

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.020 
not terribly aggressive like the Nandu
Volpe<00:03:22.780> nice<00:03:22.989> or<00:03:23.290> oh<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.980> char<00:03:24.250> Pepe<00:03:24.519> sorry<00:03:24.790> or

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
Volpe nice or oh the char Pepe sorry or

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.759 
Volpe nice or oh the char Pepe sorry or
the<00:03:25.810> chromatic<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:27.690> would<00:03:28.690> definitely<00:03:29.139> try<00:03:29.680> not

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
the chromatic I would definitely try not

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.680 
the chromatic I would definitely try not
to<00:03:30.250> best<00:03:30.579> not<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.850> handle<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.299> species

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
to best not to handle the species

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.650 
to best not to handle the species
because<00:03:32.019> these<00:03:32.200> are<00:03:32.380> unpredictable<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.660> you

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
because these are unpredictable so you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.590 
because these are unpredictable so you
could<00:03:34.810> piss<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.139> off<00:03:35.260> if<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:37.030> really<00:03:37.299> disturb

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
could piss it off if you really disturb

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.840 
could piss it off if you really disturb
it<00:03:37.720> too<00:03:37.870> much<00:03:38.019> they're<00:03:38.739> not<00:03:38.889> so<00:03:39.160> bad<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.670> hair

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
it too much they're not so bad of a hair

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.330 
it too much they're not so bad of a hair
kicker<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.450> never<00:03:41.290> actually<00:03:41.560> got<00:03:41.769> hair<00:03:42.100> by<00:03:42.280> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
kicker I never actually got hair by the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.420 
kicker I never actually got hair by the
species<00:03:42.880> but<00:03:43.769> she<00:03:44.769> was<00:03:44.859> pretty<00:03:45.010> cool<00:03:45.190> she's

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
species but she was pretty cool she's

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.370 
species but she was pretty cool she's
due<00:03:45.579> for<00:03:45.609> a<00:03:45.880> molt<00:03:46.150> she<00:03:46.989> lasts<00:03:47.500> molted<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:49.230> was<00:03:50.230> at

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
due for a molt she lasts molted I was at

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.629 
due for a molt she lasts molted I was at
the<00:03:50.560> generative<00:03:52.019> 2009<00:03:53.019> so<00:03:53.560> she's<00:03:54.220> really<00:03:54.459> do

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
the generative 2009 so she's really do

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.699 
the generative 2009 so she's really do
for<00:03:54.880> mold<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.239> adults<00:03:55.600> really<00:03:56.019> take<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.410> long

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
for mold so adults really take a long

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.089 
for mold so adults really take a long
time<00:03:57.090> between<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.329> molting<00:03:58.660> periods<00:03:59.099> but

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
time between the molting periods but

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.970 
time between the molting periods but
other<00:04:00.310> than<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:00.519> is<00:04:00.849> a<00:04:00.880> very<00:04:01.150> cool<00:04:01.389> T<00:04:01.980> it's

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
other than that is a very cool T it's

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.680 
other than that is a very cool T it's
not<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.099> worthy<00:04:03.430> replacement<00:04:03.609> of<00:04:04.030> our<00:04:04.209> peopie

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
not a worthy replacement of our peopie

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.210 
not a worthy replacement of our peopie
are<00:04:04.720> Peter<00:04:05.109> see<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.470> passed<00:04:05.680> away<00:04:05.980> that's

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
are Peter see that passed away that's

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.069 
are Peter see that passed away that's
the<00:04:06.430> autumn<00:04:06.760> but<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.269> did<00:04:07.450> find<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.810> suitable

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
the autumn but I did find a suitable

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.780 
the autumn but I did find a suitable
replacement<00:04:08.230> for<00:04:08.859> her

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
replacement for her

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.880 
replacement for her
so<00:04:10.270> when<00:04:10.600> I<00:04:10.900> might<00:04:11.200> be<00:04:11.290> picking<00:04:11.470> her<00:04:11.860> up

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
so when I might be picking her up

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.000 
so when I might be picking her up
