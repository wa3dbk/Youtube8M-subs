00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.620
 quail cage can be made from 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.320
 absolutely handy material well 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.670
 for example from fruit boxes from 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.379
 plastic fruit drawer 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 well actually it can like 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.740
 temporary cell maintenance would be there 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.650
 replant nothing is so 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.689
 constant as temporary like this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.119
 in order to make a cell out 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 fruit boxes we need them two 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.950
 pieces in a single box 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.750
 on the other it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.890
 it can already be said there inside already 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.480
 premises already obtained cell but 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:54.140
 make a little bit and and more beautiful 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.120
 we divide one box into two halves 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.469
 using knife scissors 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.589
 but the easiest and fastest option is 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.780
 Generally take a grinder and instantly on 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:15.020
 ways 1 part is lower here so here 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:20.930
 will go with us as a coaster 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.189
 now our between the cell floor and 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.860
 the basis on which she will stand 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.010
 we have 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.470
 for that is already the whole 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.610
 quail droppings he will wake up 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.820
 down so and respectively 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.380
 the second part is the bottom of us 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.510
 becomes a tobacco cap on the ceiling 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.060
 the canvas is such a construction 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.880
 Further, but you understand in such 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.720
 no holes quail head 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.920
 push that is, we need this trough 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:06.210
 this cell to provide a herringbone pattern and here is my 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.369
 here in this place we cut out the side 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:15.670
 plastic we get more 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.910
 wide well and old man the same thing is ours 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.209
 the design is already here then its top in 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.959
 the lid too with a knife or scissors 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.970
 cut out this code rectangle only 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.910
 I cut it 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.190
 on three sides but it turns out we 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 door lid here so here and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.380
 bent off 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.890
 if you have there chickens means testicles 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.390
 can be obtained if the males are in 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.910
 in my case, well, in general, I did nothing there 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.530
 they 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:57.050
 will you sit on the fattening all this 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:00.620
 the construction is mounted at the corners on thin 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.810
 soft wire here here well that is 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.500
 on all four in the morning rose you all these 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.970
 Three parts of the pilot you get this 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:14.230
 such a box 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:19.430
 Here is such a plenochka so further means 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:23.480
 feeding trough and trough so mean where 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.520
 we made a long box cut this 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.450
 feeder feeder 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.030
 can be done from trim metal profile 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.740
 in 10 minutes 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.980
 but I will give a reference how it is done here 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:44.360
 once hung a feeder that's so open 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:50.750
 beauty and the end of the tongue 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:55.730
 I made it out of aluminum can 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:59.550
 long too we take it and 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.970
 all poilochka ready here is such a beauty 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.940
 we got just a sight for at least 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.760
 exhibition means I remind you that the door has 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.280
 us here on this one 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.830
 I bend in the end so that they are there 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.650
 didn't open well put something up there 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.560
 Yes, and that 's all , but I remind you of 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.959
 temporary containment and cell like you 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.420
 Understood cost me completely 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.720
 for free all this is about 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.150
 vegetable shop boxes near construction site 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.910
 Here are these metal profiles at the end 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.300
 The ends of the feeder can also be made of 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.400
 Aluminum cans with this can 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.830
 make plastic string sounds 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.620
 the only thing that is such a feeder us 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.130
 this is very convenient to put here something 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.450
 Type such a mesh we put that is 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.560
 forage poured mesh set on top and 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.620
 they have the 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.860
 quails do not scatter this feed already 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.900
 they fail to dig their hearts there for what 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.040
 as far as dating fodder generally settles 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.950
 down here's the case well and yes by itself to 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.990
 when they are there you will do well by yes 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.360
 but something will have to enclose to 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.700
 then it was convenient to clean up but up to 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.180
 the fact that if the table will stand well 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.190
 a piece of cellophane and then everything turned 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.790
 threw out laid and the next piece 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.820
 cellophane 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.960
 Here's a plan to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.539
 write comments ask 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.870
 I know the answer I do not know together 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:38.740
 think of all the luck up under the script 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.479
 if suddenly this is this 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.979
 Here's a window, well, for example 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.990
 somewhat wide 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.660
 and quail will try to get out 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.050
 through it in the end from fine 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:56.639
 wire on there absolutely any 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:06:01.180
 phone and such here in several places 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:05.050
 make a jumper all I did not have 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.169
 nowhere does not disappear, and again to 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.169
 dating
