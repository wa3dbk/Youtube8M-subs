what's<00:00:06.810> up<00:00:06.990> guys<00:00:07.170> my<00:00:07.410> name<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.589> ace<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.069> today

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
what's up guys my name is ace and today

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.320 
what's up guys my name is ace and today
I'm<00:00:08.429> going<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.580> be<00:00:08.639> breaking<00:00:09.000> down<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
I'm going to be breaking down the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.240 
I'm going to be breaking down the
perfect<00:00:09.719> toughness<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.769> those<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.099> that

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
perfect toughness for those of you that

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.860 
perfect toughness for those of you that
may<00:00:11.309> not<00:00:11.610> know<00:00:11.790> already<00:00:12.120> toughness<00:00:12.719> is

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
may not know already toughness is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.749 
may not know already toughness is
essentially<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.440> pro<00:00:13.769> addition<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.340> hardened

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
essentially the pro addition to hardened

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.820 
essentially the pro addition to hardened
in<00:00:14.880> black<00:00:15.089> ops<00:00:15.330> 1<00:00:15.420> or<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.199> focused

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
in black ops 1 or the focused

proficiency in modern warfare 3 it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.080 
proficiency in modern warfare 3 it
basically<00:00:19.740> reduces<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> amount<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.850> your

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
basically reduces the amount that your

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.849 
basically reduces the amount that your
character<00:00:21.689> will<00:00:21.720> flinch<00:00:22.109> when<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.619> shot

character will flinch when they are shot

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.040 
character will flinch when they are shot
in<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.820> video<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.660> looking<00:00:24.900> at

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
in this video I'm going to be looking at

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
in this video I'm going to be looking at
the<00:00:25.080> effect<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:25.710> perk<00:00:25.949> has<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.609> using

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the effect that this perk has when using

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.550 
the effect that this perk has when using
different<00:00:27.269> types<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> weapons<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
different types of weapons because the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
different types of weapons because the
amount<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.010> flinch<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.760> shot<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
amount that you flinch when your shot is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.030 
amount that you flinch when your shot is
actually<00:00:30.449> determined<00:00:31.140> by<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> class<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
actually determined by the class of the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.240 
actually determined by the class of the
gun<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> are<00:00:32.640> currently<00:00:33.000> holding<00:00:34.250> so

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
gun that you are currently holding so

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.139 
gun that you are currently holding so
first<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.610> we're<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> look<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
first up we're going to look at the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.150 
first up we're going to look at the
shotguns<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.200> first<00:00:37.440> clip<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.829> without

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
shotguns this first clip is without

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.830 
shotguns this first clip is without
toughness<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> flinch<00:00:39.690> will

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
toughness as you can see the flinch will

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.479 
toughness as you can see the flinch will
cause<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.170> aim<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:40.800> above<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> enemy's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
cause you to aim well above the enemy's

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.940 
cause you to aim well above the enemy's
head<00:00:41.700> at<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.210> range<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.770> with

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
head at this range now this is with

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
head at this range now this is with
toughness<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.660> range

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
toughness as you can see at this range

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
toughness as you can see at this range
the<00:00:46.140> flinch<00:00:46.379> will<00:00:46.500> cause<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> aim<00:00:47.010> right

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the flinch will cause you to aim right

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.220 
the flinch will cause you to aim right
at<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> enemy's<00:00:48.270> head<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.690> you're<00:00:48.930> aiming<00:00:49.140> at

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
at the enemy's head if you're aiming at

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.619 
at the enemy's head if you're aiming at
his<00:00:49.320> chest<00:00:49.590> initially<00:00:50.039> which<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.430> great<00:00:50.760> so

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
his chest initially which is great so

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.600 
his chest initially which is great so
next<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.170> an<00:00:52.320> SMG<00:00:52.649> without<00:00:53.160> toughness

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
next up we have an SMG without toughness

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.000 
next up we have an SMG without toughness
and<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.300> quite<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.379> flinch<00:00:55.739> than

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and it's quite a bit more flinch than

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.349 
and it's quite a bit more flinch than
the<00:00:56.100> shotgun<00:00:56.460> hat<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:58.430> now<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> SMG<00:01:00.090> with

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the shotgun hat and now the SMG with

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.240 
the shotgun hat and now the SMG with
toughness<00:01:00.629> once<00:01:01.109> again<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.590> end<00:01:01.800> up<00:01:01.949> aiming

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
toughness once again you end up aiming

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.440 
toughness once again you end up aiming
right<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.550> his<00:01:02.789> head<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> assault<00:01:06.330> rifle

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
right at his head the assault rifle

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870 
right at his head the assault rifle
behaves<00:01:07.200> basically<00:01:07.979> exactly<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.549> same<00:01:08.729> as

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
behaves basically exactly the same as

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.390 
behaves basically exactly the same as
the<00:01:09.030> SMG<00:01:09.479> without<00:01:10.140> toughness<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.680> lame<00:01:10.890> quite

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the SMG without toughness you lame quite

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.679 
the SMG without toughness you lame quite
a<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.670> above<00:01:11.850> his<00:01:12.000> head<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:14.420> with<00:01:15.420> toughness

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
a bit above his head and with toughness

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.760 
a bit above his head and with toughness
you'll<00:01:16.020> aim<00:01:16.229> once<00:01:16.650> again<00:01:16.799> rate<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.369> his<00:01:17.520> head

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.170 

moving<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.890> here's<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> lmg<00:01:23.880> without

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
moving on here's the lmg without

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:34.170 
moving on here's the lmg without
toughness<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:28.850> lmg<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.119> toughness

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.610 

and<00:01:35.180> finally<00:01:35.600> we<00:01:35.720> have<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.870> sniper<00:01:36.200> rifle

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
and finally we have the sniper rifle

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.590 
and finally we have the sniper rifle
without<00:01:36.800> toughness<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:38.150> actually<00:01:38.300> don't

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
without toughness and you actually don't

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.120 
without toughness and you actually don't
aim<00:01:38.780> too<00:01:39.020> far<00:01:39.290> above<00:01:39.500> his<00:01:39.650> head<00:01:39.770> when<00:01:40.010> you're

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
aim too far above his head when you're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.090 
aim too far above his head when you're
shot<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:43.870> now<00:01:44.870> with<00:01:45.110> toughness<00:01:45.410> once<00:01:45.830> again

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
shot and now with toughness once again

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.710 
shot and now with toughness once again
you<00:01:46.280> end<00:01:46.400> up<00:01:46.520> aiming<00:01:46.850> right<00:01:47.120> at<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.510> top<00:01:47.660> of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
you end up aiming right at the top of

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.300 
you end up aiming right at the top of
his<00:01:47.930> head<00:01:50.800> so<00:01:51.800> now<00:01:51.920> i'm<00:01:51.980> going<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.190> show<00:01:52.280> you

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
his head so now i'm going to show you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.650 
his head so now i'm going to show you
graphics<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:52.970> show<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.270> effect<00:01:53.570> that

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
graphics that show the effect that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.290 
graphics that show the effect that
toughness<00:01:53.930> has<00:01:54.230> on<00:01:54.440> each<00:01:54.650> class<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.400> gun<00:01:55.610> this

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
toughness has on each class of gun this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.370 
toughness has on each class of gun this
will<00:01:56.450> be<00:01:56.540> an<00:01:56.630> order<00:01:56.900> from<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.080> greatest

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
will be an order from the greatest

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.620 
will be an order from the greatest
effect<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.250> least<00:01:58.490> effect<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.300> toughness

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
effect to the least effect so toughness

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.270 
effect to the least effect so toughness
has<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.840> greatest<00:02:00.080> effect<00:02:00.470> on<00:02:00.590> SMGs<00:02:01.160> and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.510 
has the greatest effect on SMGs and
assault<00:02:01.520> rifles<00:02:01.880> next<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.720> LMGs<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.590> then

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
assault rifles next is LMGs and then

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.340 
assault rifles next is LMGs and then
there's<00:02:04.700> shotguns<00:02:05.210> coming<00:02:05.600> really<00:02:05.810> close<00:02:05.930> to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
there's shotguns coming really close to

there's shotguns coming really close to
LMGs<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.130> finally<00:02:07.940> toughness<00:02:08.360> has<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
LMGs and finally toughness has the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.389 
LMGs and finally toughness has the
smallest<00:02:08.869> effect<00:02:09.380> on<00:02:09.590> sniper<00:02:09.890> rifles

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
smallest effect on sniper rifles

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.760 
smallest effect on sniper rifles
toughness<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.360> a<00:02:11.390> great<00:02:11.750> perk<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.200> use<00:02:12.350> for<00:02:12.620> any

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
toughness is a great perk to use for any

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.860 
toughness is a great perk to use for any
class<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.250> weapon<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.910> game<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.660> in<00:02:14.750> my

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
class of weapon in the game but in my

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.140 
class of weapon in the game but in my
opinion<00:02:14.990> it's<00:02:15.380> best<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.800> use<00:02:15.830> with<00:02:16.250> smgs<00:02:16.940> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
opinion it's best to use with smgs and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.790 
opinion it's best to use with smgs and
assault<00:02:17.450> rifles<00:02:17.810> although<00:02:18.290> for<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.650> quick

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
assault rifles although for you quick

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.080 
assault rifles although for you quick
scope<00:02:19.070> is<00:02:19.220> out<00:02:19.370> there<00:02:19.550> toughness<00:02:19.970> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
scope is out there toughness is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.300 
scope is out there toughness is
practically<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.660> must<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:21.320> snipers<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.010> well

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
practically a must on snipers as well

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.370 
practically a must on snipers as well
without<00:02:23.030> toughness<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.720> sniper<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.260> gets

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
without toughness a sniper that gets

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.410 
without toughness a sniper that gets
shot<00:02:24.620> before<00:02:24.830> he<00:02:25.100> manages<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.550> fire<00:02:25.910> his<00:02:26.150> shot

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
shot before he manages to fire his shot

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.420 
shot before he manages to fire his shot
will<00:02:26.810> probably<00:02:27.380> die<00:02:27.560> because<00:02:27.950> he<00:02:27.980> only<00:02:28.220> gets

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
will probably die because he only gets

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.030 
will probably die because he only gets
that<00:02:28.670> one<00:02:28.880> shot<00:02:29.150> typically<00:02:29.740> with<00:02:30.740> toughness

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
that one shot typically with toughness

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.010 
that one shot typically with toughness
however<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:32.030> still<00:02:32.240> have<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> great<00:02:32.630> shot<00:02:32.990> at

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
however you still have a great shot at

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.720 
however you still have a great shot at
hitting<00:02:33.350> your<00:02:33.530> enemy<00:02:33.830> even<00:02:34.070> if<00:02:34.430> he<00:02:34.520> fires

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
hitting your enemy even if he fires

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.670 
hitting your enemy even if he fires
first<00:02:35.120> which<00:02:35.450> in<00:02:35.660> my<00:02:35.810> opinion<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.320> kind<00:02:36.590> of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
first which in my opinion is kind of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.949 
first which in my opinion is kind of
unfair<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:37.370> it's<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.910> game<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.840> have

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
unfair but it's in the game so we have

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.150 
unfair but it's in the game so we have
to<00:02:39.110> live<00:02:39.260> with<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.769> might<00:02:39.920> as<00:02:40.010> well

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
to live with it and you might as well

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.640 
to live with it and you might as well
take<00:02:40.280> advantage<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:41.150> you're<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.330> sniper

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
take advantage of it if you're a sniper

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.990 
take advantage of it if you're a sniper
so<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.709> hope<00:02:42.830> this<00:02:42.890> video<00:02:43.280> was<00:02:43.610> able<00:02:43.910> to

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
so I hope this video was able to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.759 
so I hope this video was able to
illustrate<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.480> how<00:02:44.810> effective<00:02:45.350> this<00:02:45.500> perk

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
illustrate just how effective this perk

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.740 
illustrate just how effective this perk
can<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.160> if<00:02:46.400> you're<00:02:47.180> on<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.360> fence<00:02:47.480> about

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
can be if you're on the fence about

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.229 
can be if you're on the fence about
toughness<00:02:48.140> or<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.769> rarely<00:02:49.220> use<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.940> would

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
toughness or you rarely use it I would

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.150 
toughness or you rarely use it I would
definitely<00:02:50.780> give<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.110> shot<00:02:51.290> because<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.980> is

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
definitely give it a shot because it is

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.949 
definitely give it a shot because it is
great<00:02:52.550> for<00:02:52.820> winning<00:02:53.090> head-to-head<00:02:53.480> gunfights

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
great for winning head-to-head gunfights

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.290 
great for winning head-to-head gunfights
