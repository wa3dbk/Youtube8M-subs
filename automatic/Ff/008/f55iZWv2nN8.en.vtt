00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.880
 Hello and welcome to a new episode 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 I was 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.199
 This is 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.369
 on 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.009
 each of the front 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.369
 together 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.289
 Hardware on the market Red after a lap at the Hockenheimring 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.470
 dpa 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.310
 the handlebar meanwhile a when the stone is not left but 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.040
 when we went to his bed "We used to come to a special one 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.140
 said Reck reminding 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.690
 Books were 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.740
 and also on real now we want to be the same series since January 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.740
 while waiting in the inter 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.800
 Hello dear us researcher Andrew Niccol we are here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.720
 right next to the NDE Uenze I have now invited a few guests from the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.870
 other teams have to report network again 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.760
 her wife with the shapely Germany looks like 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.510
 and then comment on their result from the endless bit but 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.900
 nevertheless quite small fan tutte it that one of the racing team Uni Stuttgart 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 Hello for us he ran so far because here in Cesena it is yes 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.410
 already must be most important 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.660
 Achieving eels and the results is good, the Dane is the successful one 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.640
 Cutting off India's expectations too 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.330
 and the Pre 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.050
 very satisfying editor Tobias all catch first with the girls 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.170
 results 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 and that kept her satisfied with the fact that the car was about half past two 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.580
 with that request from Hathor Grad 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.820
 Thank you Hello 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.980
 No, that would have 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.740
 To be with the Nuon is yes this year 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.100
 or, in particular, you do not have any help from the wheel-mother due to the coming 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.090
 but that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.360
 but then with me 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.420
 they turned the monkeys as we passed 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.960
 and who has decided about the state has yet to come 10 30 has decided that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.220
 Motto as changing as an engine failure 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.860
 he is nearer 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.850
 One has to have very little that had done so miserably before on the mother 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.600
 So after Calais wins her minute, so does her real Ben hard test too 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.170
 for the engine the poll has since not quite lived up to from the mother 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.029
 the eyes are rare 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.649
 I would say the official in the bridge way 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.119
 the official Guinness is not known yet 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.929
 Hangover Zorba's themes we are all mighty proud so close to the start 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.689
 but still got the car going to get no traffic tickets 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.649
 many announcements from me also really a big compliment fret 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.029
 Congratulations so everything could fit anonymously in the US separate 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.639
 there are a few short words from Sebastian here since the first autobody 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.989
 become 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.359
 I hope you leave if we still promised 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.099
 not only with the terrorist Mr. Zinke could reach 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.419
 that worked so well we should have finished Nick 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.509
 Percent but clean does not work at all sooner 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.099
 still had engine problems 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.239
 Percent, we do not know yet that we were just looking 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.389
 Strecker also did not work percent e have also seen clean 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.369
 was very very difficult to drive says oversteer understeer 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:15.259
 Finally, as a bystander on her part as a spectator in his spectacular 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.609
 I did not want to be so happy with that 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.939
 more worries more did not expect more and 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.559
 was not quite up front of course and 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.509
 so be a bit fooled but 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.819
 I think he shows every case the car can 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.609
 that's the most important 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.639
 it was already his achievement of yesterday, of course, outstanding 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.060
 that at the car cross 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.420
 but now Slam returns from the Schwend competitions in general of you 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.059
 a few criticisms Euro Lampart 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.430
 great statements such as such subtleties can easily be one 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:47.670
 together around 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.059
 Tobias again 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:54.209
 So what was there in the recent very positively noticed is percent 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.519
 the work of the march sets 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.430
 m is in England so that keeps countries initiated or now to become a trader 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.789
 there is an engine damage or something 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:06.359
 Percent there is a percent here changes like a startled 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.489
 Pile down 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.109
 and as here we had the situation that percent like Reiki directly for joy 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.749
 in Braunschweiger on and Sina still a third eye accumulated what already 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:21.159
 was quite slow and in the mode plagued by the vehicle 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.979
 and the private pikeperch in my eyes very sovereign per cent the thing 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.409
 solved and took us very Mr. Michael Erdal Chuan is then also directly he around 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:31.870
 the route passed 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.909
 so that 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.189
 was super worked well with the Jewish lineup so far and 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.309
 so on it was just great 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:43.469
 Then half-beast Indian driver should make it through again 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:46.569
 Things were positive or negative 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.530
 make a particularly positive assessment 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.710
 or the Catherine Parr city to a possible event 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.810
 yes as I said all the brewery presentations arndt also very different 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.749
 Settlement is 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.809
 so far went very smoothly 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:03.949
 a small point of criticism maybe for those in any box like working without 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.239
 are more experienced and less Foreigner Haverkamp at work though 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.969
 for us, for example, this is the case today extreme time pressure and we do not have 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.189
 let go in the box the starter to get through this 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.259
 Templeton 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.979
 had to get out by starting the engine 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.029
 Mother City calculations but these increase although we without air pressure 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.259
 and also worked without broadcast so only that the alleged 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.229
 That would give you precious minutes, of course, if I took longer 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.460
 Yaman we did it Enwezor saves the basic rights in the basement yet 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.569
 movable 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.419
 not very close to Freddy's location on the start-finish straight 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.559
 which often speak for themselves and 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:42.849
 we still have it 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.050
 into the area 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.309
 Boateng brought 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.249
 but still 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.159
 compete in comparison to others 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.809
 very much wheelspin and very late bank 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:55.989
 he thank you nicely maybe a few closing words from Sebastian 

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:56.839
 Madsen 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.289
 as this into the whole great event are particularly cheerful tuned 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.979
 and 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.629
 yes there are small criticisms but I think it is not crucial 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.289
 Overall, all of them have come very close to the ticket and themselves 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.610
 he puts on the driving fun he knows they are very 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.990
 the honorary post so that he not only hand out dancing a completely successful 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.900
 competition 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.280
 but let's see what it looks like next year from the site everything first 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.129
 I thank my guests as he is otherwise 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:29.569
 and so was his and the sensei then normal Fortin
