 you got here known already takes off 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.660
 courtyard on chevrolet lacetti hatchback 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.099

 two strong mob grishina 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.160
 fuse here so how constant 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.529
 didn't burn 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.050
 shadow of doubt thought what to look 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:33.780
 that's the way the light bulb itself 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:36.930
 solid sedan can not say probably 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.440
 tried to look right through 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.590
 visible not visible burned out not burned out 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.390
 right away 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.809
 stormy not see anything so for 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.200
 to change you need a screwdriver 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.280
 cross 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.680
 it will be necessary to return two bolts and this 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.399
 here they are two 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.859
 twist loosen and headlamp 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.390
 use you remember tip-top paper 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:10.290
 cardboard from ordinary just to hand 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.890
 folded it about width see to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.810
 she climbed here but before that took a piece 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.229
 but about the rope at all no one take 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 the tape president I read on the forums 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.780
 people write the tape after we 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.909
 untwisted raged out of here we pass 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 she gets a ribbon 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.130
 catchers something like a crowd exhibition 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.790
 from the inside it will be so that we can eat 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.670
 there was an emphasis ooze here pasta already needlework 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.350
 I put down for a piece of paper on the edge of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.570
 affairs and 2 on the fact she is very tight 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 then holding with one hand a 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.149
 with my other hand I began to pull it 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.220
 effective to loosen a little and 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.100
 so that it disperses a little because 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.369
 that the grooves there plastic and deed 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.829
 metal like 4 goes in there and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.890
 the view is not the element itself squat 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.220
 a little loose her almost pull 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.660
 unity once it is here 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.980
 are considered 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.690
 2 2 contracted light bulb and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.720
 stop signal 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.900
 after you do this you need 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.760
 will be back against the light bulb i 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.280
 respectively, once again fuse immediately 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.050
 all there wiped off means dry cloth and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.510
 like that basically sands what they say 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.130
 vanity screwdriver somewhere out there and slotted me 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.090
 I'll tell you right away you don't need to do this 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.850
 because you scratched take erase 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.910
 paint in this place from the car this 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.560
 it will be very unpleasant auto repair 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.810
 for it asks 300 rubles as far as I am 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.080
 is known 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.020
 I'll put you changed the light bulb back 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.350
 screw it back too and this 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.380
 screw you first insert it on 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.270
 a place to even pass there would be such a person 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.400
 will come in either snaps into or become 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.470
 because I am on the left side of Russian 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.400
 punishment went so easy and took 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.550
 twist two screws 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.620
 say some take off trim something 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.110
 squeeze the machine to do nothing 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.540
 need not put at all there sheets 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.959
 you have nothing to do other things that all good luck 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.959
 on the roads
