next thing we'll do we'll go into the
grinding<00:00:05.330> of<00:00:05.509> that<00:00:06.790> usually<00:00:07.790> I<00:00:08.060> start<00:00:08.390> out

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
grinding of that usually I start out

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.589 
grinding of that usually I start out
with<00:00:09.019> a<00:00:09.080> rough<00:00:09.440> grind<00:00:09.980> and<00:00:10.340> I'll<00:00:10.969> use<00:00:11.210> some

with a rough grind and I'll use some

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.459 
with a rough grind and I'll use some
sort<00:00:12.019> of<00:00:13.330> grindr<00:00:14.330> usually<00:00:14.719> with<00:00:14.870> a<00:00:14.900> bigger<00:00:15.139> pad

kind of sharpen up those edges a little
bit<00:00:34.699> with<00:00:35.420> aluminum<00:00:36.219> if<00:00:37.219> you've<00:00:37.399> ever<00:00:37.609> ground

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
bit with aluminum if you've ever ground

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.790 
bit with aluminum if you've ever ground
on<00:00:38.239> aluminium<00:00:38.750> you'll<00:00:39.140> know<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:39.469> to<00:00:39.649> be<00:00:39.679> true

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
on aluminium you'll know this to be true

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.049 
on aluminium you'll know this to be true
it<00:00:40.760> also<00:00:40.940> melts<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.749> will<00:00:42.190> work<00:00:43.190> its<00:00:43.370> way<00:00:43.489> into

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059

those high spots so notice the grind

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.309 
those high spots so notice the grind
marks<00:00:57.409> are<00:00:57.739> also<00:00:58.210> sticking<00:00:59.210> into<00:00:59.510> that<00:00:59.899> stomp

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
marks are also sticking into that stomp

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
we'll go over it with a DA sander and

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.130 
we'll go over it with a DA sander and
remove<00:01:08.630> those<00:01:10.510> just<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.600> kind<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.870> give<00:01:12.020> it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
remove those just to kind of give it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.950 
remove those just to kind of give it
more<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.530> bad<00:01:12.770> finish<00:01:13.340> then<00:01:13.910> kind<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.870> a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
more of a bad finish then kind of a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.550 
more of a bad finish then kind of a
grinder<00:01:15.500> finish<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.240> just<00:01:17.240> watch<00:01:17.480> me<00:01:17.780> work

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
grinder finish but just watch me work

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.090 
grinder finish but just watch me work
around<00:01:19.840> there's<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.870> lot<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:21.080> angles<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.860> this

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
around there's a lot of angles on this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.720 
around there's a lot of angles on this
so<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.520> get<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.120> grinding<00:01:23.750> disk<00:01:24.140> in<00:01:24.640> kind<00:01:25.640> of

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
so to get that grinding disk in kind of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.790 
so to get that grinding disk in kind of
the<00:01:25.820> appropriate<00:01:26.330> areas<00:01:26.840> I<00:01:26.870> needed<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.560> do

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
the appropriate areas I needed to do

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.570 
the appropriate areas I needed to do
some<00:01:28.120> niggling

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
some niggling

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.480 
some niggling

was the back side front sides give me a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.990 
was the back side front sides give me a
heck<00:01:46.870> of<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.080> lot<00:01:47.200> quicker<00:01:47.470> here<00:01:47.980> that<00:01:48.400> there's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
heck of a lot quicker here that there's

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.750 
heck of a lot quicker here that there's
no<00:01:49.240> drawers<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.170> side<00:01:50.440> that<00:01:51.310> really<00:01:51.670> only
