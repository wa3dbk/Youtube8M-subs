00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
revisit this map and just see how it

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.690 
revisit this map and just see how it
sizes<00:02:16.570> up<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.830> version<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> film<00:02:18.550> but

sizes up to the version in the film but
it<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:19.030> has<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.810> really<00:02:20.140> fanciful<00:02:20.770> sci-fi

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
it just has that really fanciful sci-fi

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.840 
it just has that really fanciful sci-fi
look<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.420> had<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.140> trailers<00:02:23.850> alright

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
look that it had in the trailers alright

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.310 
look that it had in the trailers alright

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
so let's just hop off and take a closer

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.280 
so let's just hop off and take a closer
look<00:02:26.440> at<00:02:26.650> Tomorrowland<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.660> like<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.960> said<00:02:29.020> this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
of promote the movie I think it's really

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.210 
of promote the movie I think it's really
cool<00:02:58.210> just<00:02:58.900> because<00:02:59.260> we<00:02:59.800> were<00:02:59.920> sort<00:03:00.070> of

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
cool just because we were sort of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.890 
cool just because we were sort of
expecting<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.850> right<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.270> mean<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.600> was<00:03:01.690> bound

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
expecting it right I mean it was bound

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.000 
expecting it right I mean it was bound
to<00:03:01.990> happen

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
to happen

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.740 
to happen
you<00:03:03.280> know<00:03:03.400> Disney<00:03:03.760> doesn't<00:03:04.030> buy<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> YouTube

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
you know Disney doesn't buy a YouTube

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.630 
you know Disney doesn't buy a YouTube
network<00:03:05.080> for<00:03:05.110> nothing<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.800> not<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.400> sit<00:03:06.610> on

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
network for nothing and not just sit on

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.130 
network for nothing and not just sit on
it<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:06.940> don't<00:03:07.090> do<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.390> doesn't<00:03:07.720> do<00:03:07.810> anything

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
it and don't do it doesn't do anything

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.229 
it and don't do it doesn't do anything
with<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.190> sort<00:03:09.460> of<00:03:09.580> makes<00:03:09.760> sense<00:03:09.940> I

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
with it so that sort of makes sense I

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.699 
with it so that sort of makes sense I
also<00:03:10.600> think<00:03:10.870> it's<00:03:10.989> really<00:03:11.080> cool<00:03:11.410> because<00:03:11.590> I

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
also think it's really cool because I

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.820 
also think it's really cool because I
think<00:03:11.860> over<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.790> two<00:03:13.090> years<00:03:13.600> now<00:03:14.230> almost

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
would be cool with it and would they

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.540 
would be cool with it and would they
ever<00:03:40.090> do<00:03:40.300> something<00:03:40.480> official<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.380> or<00:03:42.340> would

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
ever do something official and or would

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.009 
ever do something official and or would
they<00:03:42.670> ever<00:03:42.790> shut<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.239> down<00:03:43.420> or<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:43.930> know

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
they ever shut it down or you know

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.410 
they ever shut it down or you know
there's<00:03:44.200> just<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:45.160> big<00:03:45.489> open

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
there's just like this this big open

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.240 
there's just like this this big open
question<00:03:46.840> as<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:46.989> how<00:03:47.200> Disney<00:03:47.470> would<00:03:47.680> react<00:03:48.010> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
question as to how Disney would react to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.290 
question as to how Disney would react to
such<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:49.420> think<00:03:50.019> close<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.100> an<00:03:51.489> accurate

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
such a I think close and an accurate

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.420 
such a I think close and an accurate
representation<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.260> their<00:03:53.440> own<00:03:53.620> parks<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
representation of their own parks in the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.220 
representation of their own parks in the
game<00:03:54.580> of<00:03:54.700> Minecraft<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.239> I<00:03:55.660> think<00:03:55.930> while<00:03:56.080> this

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
game of Minecraft and I think while this

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.380 
game of Minecraft and I think while this
doesn't<00:03:56.500> answer<00:03:56.860> that<00:03:57.220> definitively<00:03:57.940> in<00:03:58.239> any

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
doesn't answer that definitively in any

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.220 
doesn't answer that definitively in any
way<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.900> does<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.980> think<00:04:00.489> it<00:04:00.670> does<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.930> does

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
way it does I think it does it does

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.199 
way it does I think it does it does
point<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.769> right<00:04:02.890> direction<00:04:03.130> right<00:04:03.640> you

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
point in the right direction right you

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.240 
point in the right direction right you
know<00:04:04.330> they're<00:04:04.570> here<00:04:04.930> they're<00:04:05.320> willing<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.709> pay

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
know they're here they're willing to pay

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.960 
know they're here they're willing to pay
you<00:04:06.790> know<00:04:06.880> these<00:04:07.110> amazing<00:04:08.110> amazing<00:04:08.970> minecraft

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
you know these amazing amazing minecraft

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.690 
you know these amazing amazing minecraft
builders<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.989> recreate<00:04:11.709> part<00:04:12.190> of<00:04:12.310> their<00:04:12.430> world

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
builders to recreate part of their world

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.190 
builders to recreate part of their world
just<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.269> that<00:04:13.420> they<00:04:13.510> can<00:04:13.660> promote<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.080> movie

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
just so that they can promote the movie

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.170 
just so that they can promote the movie
I<00:04:14.530> think<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.190> wouldn't<00:04:15.370> be<00:04:15.490> a<00:04:15.520> stretch<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.910> say

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
I think it wouldn't be a stretch to say

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.060 
I think it wouldn't be a stretch to say
that<00:04:16.359> maybe<00:04:16.510> one<00:04:16.810> day<00:04:16.840> they<00:04:17.109> could<00:04:17.169> do<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.590> to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
that maybe one day they could do this to

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.920 
that maybe one day they could do this to
a<00:04:18.100> further<00:04:18.370> extent<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:19.000> promote<00:04:19.270> their<00:04:19.450> parks

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
a further extent to promote their parks

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.960 
a further extent to promote their parks
or<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.139> promote<00:04:20.289> some<00:04:20.620> other<00:04:20.859> part<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.400> you

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
or to promote some other part of you

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.909 
or to promote some other part of you
know<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.300> Disney<00:04:22.690> properties<00:04:23.199> out<00:04:23.410> there<00:04:23.440> and

so I think this is a really great sign I

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.680 
so I think this is a really great sign I
think<00:04:26.350> this<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.830> just<00:04:27.070> such<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.449> fantastic<00:04:28.449> job

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690
