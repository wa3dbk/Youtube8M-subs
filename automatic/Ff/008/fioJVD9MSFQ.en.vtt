00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
three I'd say the first thing that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
three I'd say the first thing that
people<00:01:49.170> usually<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.250> modify<00:01:50.790> their

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

intensity light and you can literally

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.820

double<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.150> output<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.690> light<00:02:03.990> Kelly<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.369 
just separate from your headlight you
create<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.819> triangle<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.900> actual
