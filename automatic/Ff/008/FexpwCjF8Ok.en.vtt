 be careful he is thinking of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.950
 collaboration of milan as 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.170

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.050
 we have iago falquÃ© which was the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.830
 unfortunately our player from Cesena 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.830
 of genoa 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.020
 crushed in his own half court 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.579
 too many corner kicks against and bonera 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.780
 misses a marking of antonelli 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.149
 now I'll show you that blackboard 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.700
 colleague risked first on the previous one 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.059

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.710
 yes yes bertolacci shot at the near post e 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.719
 I was not diverted no he had 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 christo de chirico leaves him alone 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.730
 door and then corner kick for the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.719
 genoa is beaten here are all in 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 penalty area 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 once again mischione and coup 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.880
 head and then antonelli antonelli di 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.979
 head jumps better than bonera 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.049
 the ball is also slightly deflected 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.820
 from the body of bonera and ends at the edge of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.900
 palo does not even try the parade I have to 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.150
 saying it has no responsibility 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.830
 specifically diego lopez that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.110
 commanding Europe do aquis 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.479
 coming up antonelli testa 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.670
 Bonera almost stops jumping little and badly 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.070
 ball leaves on his chest and then ends 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.610
 in goal it will be vinaria from the forward points 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.190
 then you give me for a very long time 5 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:47.950
 second 4 ball in midfield it 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:51.160
 chases sturaro 31 of Italy not 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.150
 he had been away from home since May 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
