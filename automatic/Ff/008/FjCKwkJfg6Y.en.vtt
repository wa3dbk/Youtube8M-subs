this is a famous photograph it's called

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:04.730 
this is a famous photograph it's called
Earthrise

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
Earthrise

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.099 
Earthrise
and<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.549> was<00:00:05.730> taken<00:00:06.180> from<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.540> moon<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
and this was taken from the moon and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.440 
and this was taken from the moon and
there<00:00:07.710> were<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> lot<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.189> photographs<00:00:09.090> like

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
there were a lot of photographs like

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.350 
there were a lot of photographs like
this<00:00:09.750> taken<00:00:10.440> from<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.190> Apollo<00:00:11.550> missions<00:00:12.179> that

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
this taken from the Apollo missions that

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.789 
this taken from the Apollo missions that
went<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> moon<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.440> particular

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
went to the moon and this particular

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.849 
went to the moon and this particular
photograph<00:00:14.250> was<00:00:14.700> taken<00:00:14.730> from<00:00:15.210> Apollo<00:00:15.540> 11

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
photograph was taken from Apollo 11

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.560 
photograph was taken from Apollo 11
which<00:00:16.859> was<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.310> first<00:00:17.609> mission<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.150> actually

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
which was the first mission to actually

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.689 
which was the first mission to actually
land<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.230> moon<00:00:19.320> where<00:00:19.710> people<00:00:20.010> got<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.340> of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
land on the moon where people got out of

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.519 
land on the moon where people got out of
the<00:00:20.820> spacecraft<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.539> walked<00:00:21.810> around<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
the spacecraft and walked around on the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.609 
the spacecraft and walked around on the
moon<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.400> photographs<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.810> really

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
moon and photographs like this really

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.580 
moon and photographs like this really
stunned<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.460> population<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.990> pictures

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
stunned the population to see pictures

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.650 
stunned the population to see pictures
for<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> first<00:00:29.130> time<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> earth<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.449> out

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
for the first time of the earth just out

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
blackness and pictures like this were

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.619 
blackness and pictures like this were
actually<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:47.010> big<00:00:47.250> spur<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> environmental

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
actually a big spur to the environmental

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.810 
actually a big spur to the environmental
movement<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> time<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.550> see

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
movement at the time because you see

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.900 
movement at the time because you see
earth<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.350> quite<00:00:52.649> small<00:00:52.949> amidst

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
earth as is really quite small amidst

the<00:00:54.030> emptiness<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> space<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> realize

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
the emptiness of space and you realize

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.040 
the emptiness of space and you realize
that<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> world<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.940> which<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.449> live

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
that the world and what in which we live

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.590 
that the world and what in which we live
the<00:00:58.440> place<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.129> inhabit<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the place we inhabit is really this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
the place we inhabit is really this
little<00:01:00.899> tiny<00:01:01.289> place<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:02.010> alone<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
little tiny place all alone in the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
little tiny place all alone in the
middle<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> space<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.229> prompted<00:01:04.619> people

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
middle of space and it prompted people

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.250 
middle of space and it prompted people
to<00:01:05.010> take<00:01:05.850> thought<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.420> take<00:01:06.600> more<00:01:06.840> thought<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
to take thought and take more thought of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.670 
to take thought and take more thought of
taking<00:01:07.650> good<00:01:08.010> care<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.820> earth<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:10.350> video

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
taking good care of the earth this video

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.039 
taking good care of the earth this video
is<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> Earth<00:01:11.460> Moon<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> Sun<00:01:12.210> system

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is about the Earth Moon and Sun system

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.920 
is about the Earth Moon and Sun system
and<00:01:13.350> let's<00:01:14.189> start<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.549> drawing<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.060> picture<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and let's start by drawing a picture you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740 
and let's start by drawing a picture you
often<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.439> pictures<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.430> too<00:01:18.210> drawn

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
often see pictures like this too drawn

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
often see pictures like this too drawn
to<00:01:18.780> describe<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.979> Earth<00:01:20.130> Moon<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> Sun

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
to describe the Earth Moon and Sun

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.770 
to describe the Earth Moon and Sun
system<00:01:21.479> here's<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> Sun<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.360> draw<00:01:24.570> some

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
system here's the Sun and we draw some

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.070 
system here's the Sun and we draw some
little<00:01:24.900> rays<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.439> light<00:01:25.640> coming<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.080> then

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
little rays of light coming out and then

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520 
little rays of light coming out and then
the<00:01:28.200> earth<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.970> drawn<00:01:29.970> out<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:31.140> around

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the earth is drawn out here going around

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.230 
the earth is drawn out here going around
the<00:01:31.770> Sun<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.420> we'll<00:01:33.420> indicate<00:01:37.759> an<00:01:38.759> orbit

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the Sun so we'll indicate an orbit

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.999 
the Sun so we'll indicate an orbit
around<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.840> Sun<00:01:40.020> something<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
around the Sun something like that and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.050 
around the Sun something like that and
then<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> moon<00:01:42.170> Earth's<00:01:43.170> moon<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:44.060> orbiting

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
then the moon Earth's moon is orbiting

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.889 
then the moon Earth's moon is orbiting
around<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.899> earth<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:50.119> what<00:01:51.119> diagrams<00:01:51.630> like

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
around the earth and what diagrams like

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.359 
around the earth and what diagrams like
this<00:01:51.960> capture<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.880> Earth<00:01:55.369> orbits

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this capture is that the Earth orbits

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.910 
this capture is that the Earth orbits
the<00:01:56.460> Sun<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> moon<00:01:57.899> orbits<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the Sun and then the moon orbits the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340 
the Sun and then the moon orbits the
earth<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.430> so<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.570> actually<00:02:00.930> happens

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
earth and so what what actually happens

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.780 
earth and so what what actually happens
is<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:03.119> Earth<00:02:03.329> Moon<00:02:03.750> system<00:02:04.049> itself<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
is the the Earth Moon system itself is

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.680 
is the the Earth Moon system itself is
going<00:02:06.479> around<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.500> Sun<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.479> diagrams<00:02:09.479> like

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
going around the Sun and diagrams like

Moon again the this picture does not
show<00:03:28.090> how<00:03:28.299> far<00:03:28.599> apart<00:03:28.780> they<00:03:29.260> actually<00:03:29.739> are<00:03:29.889> so

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
show how far apart they actually are so

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.879 
show how far apart they actually are so
let's<00:03:30.819> look<00:03:30.970> at<00:03:31.090> this<00:03:31.209> diagram<00:03:31.680> here's<00:03:32.680> the

let's look at this diagram here's the

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.039 
let's look at this diagram here's the
earth<00:03:33.069> over<00:03:34.030> here<00:03:34.209> on<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.449> left<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:36.750> if<00:03:37.750> Earth

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
earth over here on the left and if Earth

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.409 
earth over here on the left and if Earth
were<00:03:38.349> that<00:03:38.560> big<00:03:38.829> as<00:03:39.160> big<00:03:39.430> as<00:03:39.639> it's<00:03:39.819> shown<00:03:39.940> in

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
were that big as big as it's shown in

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.069 
were that big as big as it's shown in
this<00:03:40.690> picture<00:03:41.879> then<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.000> moon<00:03:43.239> over<00:03:43.569> here<00:03:43.930> on

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
this picture then the moon over here on

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.059 
this picture then the moon over here on
the<00:03:44.230> right<00:03:46.019> would<00:03:47.019> be<00:03:47.079> about<00:03:47.379> as<00:03:47.500> big<00:03:47.680> as<00:03:47.739> this

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
the right would be about as big as this

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.789 
the right would be about as big as this
tiny<00:03:48.400> circle<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.109> distance<00:03:50.590> how

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
tiny circle and this is the distance how

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.800 
tiny circle and this is the distance how
far<00:03:50.829> apart<00:03:51.190> they<00:03:51.519> would<00:03:51.669> be<00:03:51.849> that's<00:03:52.120> about<00:03:52.329> 30

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
far apart they would be that's about 30

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.650 
far apart they would be that's about 30
earth<00:03:53.139> diameters<00:03:54.030> from<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.150> earth<00:03:55.299> to<00:03:55.629> the

earth diameters from the earth to the
moon<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:56.409> so<00:03:57.099> that<00:03:57.250> gives<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:57.760> hopefully

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
moon and so that gives you hopefully

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.960 
moon and so that gives you hopefully
some<00:03:58.780> understanding<00:03:59.409> of<00:03:59.500> not<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:00.519> how<00:04:00.669> big

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
some understanding of not just how big

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.520 
some understanding of not just how big
they<00:04:01.150> are<00:04:01.299> relative<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.900> each<00:04:01.930> other<00:04:02.139> but<00:04:02.379> how

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
they are relative to each other but how

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.409 
they are relative to each other but how
far<00:04:02.739> apart<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:03.310> moon<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.909> moon<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.329> the

far apart the moon the moon and the
earth<00:04:04.449> are<00:04:07.319> now<00:04:08.319> let's<00:04:08.530> talk<00:04:08.739> for<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> minute

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.280 
earth are now let's talk for a minute
about<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.639> Sun<00:04:09.909> and<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.359> earth<00:04:10.510> here's<00:04:11.229> a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
about the Sun and the earth here's a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.979 
about the Sun and the earth here's a
picture<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.859> Sun<00:04:12.129> and<00:04:12.430> if<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.479> Sun<00:04:13.720> were

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
picture of the Sun and if the Sun were

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.289 
picture of the Sun and if the Sun were
the<00:04:14.229> size<00:04:14.440> shown<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.519> this<00:04:15.639> picture<00:04:15.819> then<00:04:16.180> the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
the size shown in this picture then the

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.879 
the size shown in this picture then the
earth<00:04:16.449> would<00:04:16.720> be<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.930> size<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.440> this<00:04:17.620> little

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
earth would be the size of this little

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.069 
earth would be the size of this little
dot<00:04:18.099> right<00:04:18.430> here<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:19.269> might<00:04:19.510> not<00:04:19.720> even<00:04:19.750> be

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
dot right here you might not even be

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.529 
dot right here you might not even be
able<00:04:20.139> to<00:04:20.260> see<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.650> on<00:04:20.829> your<00:04:21.070> screen<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:22.210> just

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
able to see it on your screen it's just

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.990 
able to see it on your screen it's just
a<00:04:22.659> little<00:04:22.840> bit<00:04:23.080> bigger<00:04:23.289> than<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:23.770> pixel<00:04:24.400> on

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
a little bit bigger than one pixel on

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.080 
a little bit bigger than one pixel on
monitor<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.350> tells<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.820> the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
monitor so that tells you that the the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.470 
monitor so that tells you that the the
Sun<00:04:28.450> is<00:04:28.750> huge<00:04:29.350> compared<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.430> earth<00:04:30.610> the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
Sun is huge compared to the earth the

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.040 
Sun is huge compared to the earth the
diameter<00:04:32.170> of<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.470> Sun<00:04:33.210> from<00:04:34.210> one<00:04:34.480> side<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:35.020> the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
diameter of the Sun from one side to the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.190 
diameter of the Sun from one side to the
other<00:04:35.170> is<00:04:35.890> about<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.400> hundred<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.090> nine<00:04:37.450> times

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
other is about a hundred and nine times

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.980 
other is about a hundred and nine times
the<00:04:38.740> diameter<00:04:38.950> of<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.790> earth<00:04:39.840> what<00:04:40.840> that

the diameter of the earth what that

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.040 
the diameter of the earth what that
means<00:04:41.230> is<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.830> volume<00:04:42.130> of<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.790> Sun<00:04:43.050> the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
means is that the volume of the Sun the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.570 
means is that the volume of the Sun the
volume<00:04:44.440> is<00:04:44.590> going<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.800> be<00:04:44.860> about<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.280> hundred

earth and and a 109 times 109 times 109
comes<00:04:54.820> out<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.120> about<00:04:55.740> 1.3<00:04:57.090> million<00:04:58.740> times<00:04:59.740> the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
comes out to about 1.3 million times the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.920 
comes out to about 1.3 million times the
volume<00:05:00.400> of<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.610> earth<00:05:00.850> that<00:05:01.419> means<00:05:01.630> if<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
volume of the earth that means if the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.390 
volume of the earth that means if the
earth<00:05:02.140> if<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:02.530> could<00:05:02.680> take<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.980> earth<00:05:03.160> and

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
earth if you could take the earth and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.000 
earth if you could take the earth and

now once again the earth and the Sun are
not<00:05:21.520> this<00:05:21.700> close<00:05:21.970> together<00:05:22.180> if<00:05:22.570> they<00:05:22.720> were<00:05:22.780> it

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
not this close together if they were it

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.110 
not this close together if they were it
would<00:05:23.290> be<00:05:23.470> really<00:05:23.860> pretty<00:05:24.160> toasty<00:05:24.850> on<00:05:25.000> the

it<00:06:08.350> because<00:06:08.470> it's<00:06:08.560> too<00:06:08.860> small<00:06:09.040> but<00:06:09.370> if<00:06:09.490> i<00:06:09.610> zoom

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
it because it's too small but if i zoom

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.900 
it because it's too small but if i zoom
in<00:06:10.210> on<00:06:10.560> this<00:06:11.560> part<00:06:11.950> of<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.130> diagram<00:06:12.640> and<00:06:12.669> I'll

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
in on this part of the diagram and I'll

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.850 
in on this part of the diagram and I'll
zoom<00:06:13.120> in<00:06:13.270> by<00:06:13.479> about<00:06:13.570> a<00:06:13.690> factor<00:06:13.870> of<00:06:14.080> 10<00:06:14.229> here<00:06:14.740> and

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
zoom in by about a factor of 10 here and

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.219 
zoom in by about a factor of 10 here and
you'll<00:06:15.250> see<00:06:15.310> the<00:06:15.430> arrowhead<00:06:16.000> and<00:06:16.180> that<00:06:16.990> little

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
you'll see the arrowhead and that little

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.790 
you'll see the arrowhead and that little
dot<00:06:17.440> right<00:06:18.360> there<00:06:19.360> at<00:06:19.479> the<00:06:19.570> end<00:06:19.690> that's<00:06:20.500> the

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
dot right there at the end that's the

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.490 
dot right there at the end that's the
earth<00:06:21.150> so<00:06:22.150> that's<00:06:22.300> how<00:06:22.540> big<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.840> earth<00:06:23.169> is

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
earth so that's how big the earth is

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.620 
earth so that's how big the earth is
compared<00:06:24.010> to<00:06:24.100> that<00:06:24.220> Arrowhead<00:06:24.640> now<00:06:25.390> I'll<00:06:25.600> zoom

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
compared to that Arrowhead now I'll zoom

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.530 
compared to that Arrowhead now I'll zoom
back<00:06:25.870> out<00:06:26.610> so<00:06:27.610> there<00:06:27.910> you<00:06:28.060> have<00:06:28.090> it<00:06:28.390> you<00:06:28.510> can

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
back out so there you have it you can

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.380 
back out so there you have it you can
picture<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.140> Sun<00:06:29.350> over<00:06:29.740> here<00:06:30.070> and<00:06:30.220> then<00:06:30.820> 93

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
picture the Sun over here and then 93

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.719 
picture the Sun over here and then 93
million<00:06:31.600> miles<00:06:31.900> away<00:06:32.080> that<00:06:32.200> tiny<00:06:32.770> tiny<00:06:33.099> little

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
million miles away that tiny tiny little

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.060 
million miles away that tiny tiny little
dot<00:06:34.060> out<00:06:34.419> there<00:06:34.630> in<00:06:34.750> space<00:06:34.990> that's<00:06:35.530> where<00:06:35.919> we

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
dot out there in space that's where we

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.310 
dot out there in space that's where we
live
