but I love shark movies but don't watch

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.959 
but I love shark movies but don't watch
it<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:43.040> are<00:00:44.040> expecting<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.789> good

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
it if you are expecting some good

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.029 
it if you are expecting some good
dialogue<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.629> something<00:00:46.020> cuz<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.649> honest<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
dialogue or something cuz to be honest I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.340 
dialogue or something cuz to be honest I
think<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> dialogues<00:00:47.760> were<00:00:47.969> very<00:00:48.300> lame<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
think the dialogues were very lame the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.979 
think the dialogues were very lame the
acting<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.449> don't<00:00:51.449> know<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> acting

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
acting was I don't know if the acting

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.830 
acting was I don't know if the acting
was<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> problem<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.219> um<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.780> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
was a problem but um I think it's just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.560 
was a problem but um I think it's just
most<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> dialogues<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
most of the dialogues they like you you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.090 
most of the dialogues they like you you
wouldn't<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.899> able<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.800> into<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
wouldn't be able to really get into the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.299 
wouldn't be able to really get into the
chairs<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> had<00:01:01.770> personally

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.030 
coming up and you have like a bank
robbery<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.509> mall<00:01:58.040> so

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
robbery going on in the mall so

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.469 
robbery going on in the mall so
basically<00:01:59.369> happens<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.909> have<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.119> tsunami

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
basically happens is you have to tsunami

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.620 
basically happens is you have to tsunami
that<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.770> hits<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> town<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.700> think

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that you know that hits the town I think

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600 
that you know that hits the town I think
it's<00:02:03.750> all<00:02:03.869> winter<00:02:03.990> Australia<00:02:04.610> probably

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it's all winter Australia probably

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.310 
it's all winter Australia probably
that's<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.299> probably<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> area<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
that's it's probably the area with the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.430 
that's it's probably the area with the
most<00:02:07.350> charge<00:02:07.770> right

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
most charge right

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.380 
most charge right
and<00:02:09.530> yeah<00:02:10.130> listening<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.910> dialects<00:02:11.210> there

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and yeah listening to the dialects there

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.150 
and yeah listening to the dialects there
and<00:02:11.510> stuff<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.050> accents<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.740> probably

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and stuff and the accents is probably

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.200 
and stuff and the accents is probably
Australia<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.870> have<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.230> tsunami

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
Australia and so you have this tsunami

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.490 
Australia and so you have this tsunami
lots<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.270> people<00:02:17.390> dying<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.320> have<00:02:18.470> like

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
lots of people dying then you have like

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.440 
lots of people dying then you have like
the<00:02:18.950> supermarket<00:02:19.280> where<00:02:19.730> everything<00:02:20.210> takes

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
the supermarket where everything takes

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.380 
the supermarket where everything takes
place<00:02:21.130> that's<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.340> scene<00:02:22.610> where<00:02:22.940> everything

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
place that's the scene where everything

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.890 
place that's the scene where everything
actually<00:02:24.050> happens<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.770> supermarket<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
actually happens the supermarket and the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.890 
actually happens the supermarket and the
floor<00:02:27.830> below<00:02:28.160> which<00:02:28.370> or<00:02:28.640> side<00:02:29.150> which<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
floor below which or side which is the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.520 
floor below which or side which is the
parking<00:02:30.320> lot<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.630> have<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.050> going<00:02:33.260> on

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
parking lot so you have that going on

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.030 
parking lot so you have that going on
and<00:02:34.180> then<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.660> get<00:02:35.840> those<00:02:36.080> people<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.560> do

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
and then you get those people that do

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.650 
and then you get those people that do
survive<00:02:37.250> in<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.760> supermarket<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.510> they're

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
survive in a supermarket and they're

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.710 
survive in a supermarket and they're
trapped<00:02:38.930> air<00:02:39.170> with<00:02:39.350> sharks<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:41.030> really

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
trapped air with sharks so I really

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.390 
trapped air with sharks so I really
enjoyed<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.290> fact<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:42.620> they<00:02:42.860> play<00:02:43.130> with<00:02:43.340> a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
enjoyed the fact that they play with a

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.000 
enjoyed the fact that they play with a
different<00:02:43.760> scenario<00:02:44.080> like<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.170> said<00:02:45.230> dialects

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
different scenario like I said dialects

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.340 
different scenario like I said dialects
are<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.910> dialogues<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.870> Daleks<00:02:48.170> the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
are the dialogues and the Daleks the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.350 
are the dialogues and the Daleks the
dialogues<00:02:49.190> are<00:02:49.370> terrible<00:02:49.850> in<00:02:50.000> my<00:02:50.090> opinion

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
dialogues are terrible in my opinion

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.970 
dialogues are terrible in my opinion
like<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.600> couldn't<00:02:50.900> identify<00:02:51.110> at<00:02:51.650> one<00:02:51.800> point

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
like I couldn't identify at one point

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.650 
like I couldn't identify at one point
with<00:02:52.250> any<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.700> charters<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.270> didn't<00:02:53.510> feel

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
with any of the charters I didn't feel

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.910 
with any of the charters I didn't feel
any<00:02:53.960> sorrow<00:02:54.530> when<00:02:55.310> someone<00:02:55.790> died<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.920> well

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
any sorrow when someone died and well

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.160 
any sorrow when someone died and well
they<00:02:58.490> could<00:02:58.640> have<00:02:58.730> died<00:02:58.910> all<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.750> them<00:02:59.900> except

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
they could have died all of them except

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.200 
they could have died all of them except
for<00:03:00.320> one<00:03:00.500> maybe<00:03:00.740> yeah<00:03:01.400> it's<00:03:01.550> like<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.790> actor

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
for one maybe yeah it's like the actor

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.300 
for one maybe yeah it's like the actor
from<00:03:02.240> nip<00:03:02.630> tuck<00:03:02.810> also<00:03:03.320> plays<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.800> this<00:03:04.010> movie

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
from nip tuck also plays in this movie

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.580 
from nip tuck also plays in this movie
so<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.790> not<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.940> b-movie<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.720> have<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
so it's not a b-movie you have like the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.460 
so it's not a b-movie you have like the
girl<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:06.800> plays<00:03:07.240> faith<00:03:08.240> in<00:03:08.540> The<00:03:09.260> Secret

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
girl that plays faith in The Secret

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.420 
girl that plays faith in The Secret
Circle<00:03:09.560> also<00:03:10.520> a<00:03:10.820> place<00:03:11.270> in<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:11.750> movie<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.430> um

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
Circle also a place in this movie and um

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.910 
Circle also a place in this movie and um
and<00:03:14.050> some<00:03:15.050> other<00:03:15.170> actors<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.739> it's

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and some other actors like it's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.560 
and some other actors like it's
definitely<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.489> a<00:03:16.520> b-movie<00:03:16.910> i<00:03:17.120> don't<00:03:17.480> know<00:03:17.540> i

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
definitely on a b-movie i don't know i

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.330 
definitely on a b-movie i don't know i
think<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:17.959> just<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.830> screenwriting

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
think it's just like the screenwriting

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.490 
think it's just like the screenwriting
or<00:03:19.670> have<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.360> wanted<00:03:20.600> however<00:03:21.110> it's<00:03:21.260> called

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
or have you wanted however it's called

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.850 
or have you wanted however it's called
it's<00:03:21.950> not<00:03:22.190> done<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.430> well<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:24.200> yeah<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.770> a

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
it's not done that well but yeah it's a

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.290 
it's not done that well but yeah it's a
necessary<00:03:25.010> for<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.459> movie<00:03:25.700> like<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.180> my

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
necessary for a movie like this in my

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.330 
necessary for a movie like this in my
opinion<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.840> really<00:03:27.230> isn't<00:03:27.739> like<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.130> just

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
opinion it really isn't like you just

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.520 
opinion it really isn't like you just
you<00:03:28.700> don't<00:03:28.730> watch<00:03:29.060> movies<00:03:29.300> like<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.110> for<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
you don't watch movies like that for the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.550 
you don't watch movies like that for the
dialogue<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.430> watch<00:03:31.640> them<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.989> know<00:03:33.110> you

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
dialogue you watch them you know you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.750 
dialogue you watch them you know you
know<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.890> feel<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.070> little<00:03:34.220> bit<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.520> thrill<00:03:34.730> I

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
know to feel a little bit of a thrill I

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.699 
know to feel a little bit of a thrill I
guess<00:03:35.060> because<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.780> love<00:03:35.930> shark<00:03:36.140> movies<00:03:36.470> like

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
guess because you love shark movies like

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.020 
guess because you love shark movies like
I<00:03:36.920> do<00:03:37.570> yeah<00:03:38.570> so<00:03:38.959> um<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.950> know<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.640> movie<00:03:40.850> didn't

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
I do yeah so um I know the movie didn't

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.000 
I do yeah so um I know the movie didn't
get<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.300> many<00:03:41.600> good<00:03:41.900> ratings<00:03:42.320> but

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
get that many good ratings but

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.560 
get that many good ratings but
nevertheless<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.640> think<00:03:43.820> for<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.030> shark<00:03:44.269> movie

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
nevertheless I think for a shark movie

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.600
