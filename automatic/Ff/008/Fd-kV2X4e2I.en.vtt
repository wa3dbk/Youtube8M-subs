everything<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.550> unique<00:02:23.849> here<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.480> all<00:02:24.630> custom

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
everything is unique here is all custom

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.199 
everything is unique here is all custom
to<00:02:26.550> fit<00:02:26.730> our<00:02:26.880> needs<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.420> can't<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.959> dripping

to fit our needs we can't have dripping

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.880 
to fit our needs we can't have dripping
we<00:02:30.209> were<00:02:30.330> using<00:02:30.540> 34<00:02:31.140> degree<00:02:31.380> water<00:02:31.620> which

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
we were using 34 degree water which

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.100 
we were using 34 degree water which
means<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.340> could<00:02:32.489> have<00:02:32.610> condensation<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
means we could have condensation so the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.320 
means we could have condensation so the
