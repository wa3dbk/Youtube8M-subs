00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.979
 Hello everyone and welcome one more day to 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.980
 a new video in this case as you see in 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.490
 the title I bring you a new makeup 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.680
 It had been quite a while since I was 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.230
 none the truth that I wanted 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.740
 but I did not know very well what to record and 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.220
 I had thought of doing a makeup 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.360
 you could say for the night quite 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.020
 marcadito and also I think it is 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.540
 Pretty nice for brown eyes 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.130
 well anyone who has read a 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.140
 little about the theory of color 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.060
 well you know that there are some colors 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.890
 that feel better at an eye tone 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.540
 that to others although good that is always 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.760
 very relative and also good you can there 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.340
 that adapt the many factors but yes 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.809
 that it is true that the blue color is a 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.910
 color that favors the eyes a lot 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:53.290
 browns and the truth that is a color that 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.480
 I never use and I do not know why not 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.470
 me although I have brown eyes and 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.540
 How true that I have them enough 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.520
 clearly but it is not a color with which 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.380
 I see myself very favored so 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.930
 I do not usually use it but I do 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.570
 It's true that when I use it, 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.100
 like then well, as you see the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.160
 eye makeup if it's something else 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.550
 neither intense nor very excessive is 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.130
 as a kind of delineated 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.369
 blurred and the face and lips 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.140
 well more natural so good 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.460
 then I leave you with the step by step I hope 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.380
 that you like and everything that you have that 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.350

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.759

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.759
