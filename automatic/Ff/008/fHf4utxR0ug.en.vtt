00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 hey people martin was here and now 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.990
 I often times to the topic of running shoes 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.880
 barefoot running asked what recommendation 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.099
 I can not give out myself 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.110
 have been running since I was 16 and I have been 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.139
 So I'm starting now at about 20 o'clock 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.090
 seven years on the forefoot midfoot 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 and the forefoot middle foot runs over it 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.060
 I was here at youtube at the beginning 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.519
 made a video that has meanwhile 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.369
 over 100,000 calls and I get there 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.109
 really news almost every week 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.619
 purely personal news get me 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 write 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.050
 that is really a difference like day 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.180
 and night is that forever 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.760
 problems with the knees partly with the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.370
 achilles tendon and that they are really there 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 within half a year in one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 almost got it all this year 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.110
 what they had 10 years ago and 10 years ago 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.780
 I am very happy about that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.840
 I just think that's it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.210
 Physiologically better running then 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.180
 on the forefoot mittelfuÃŸ arises and yes 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.969
 It is more exhausting at the beginning 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.609
 of course now muscles tend to be areas 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.719
 virtually required to be used with wise 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.640
 Need to become 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.380
 which you have never activated before but 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.170
 I think that's just what you see 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 especially these muscles especially here 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 calf muscles 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.990
 that is a musculature yes that will 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.640
 otherwise in normal running I think 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.240
 with the hacking comes up and then on 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.790
 is indeed hardly used in fact yes and me 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.710
 think it's not good 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.869
 Muscles are there to be used and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.950
 At the beginning you will see the pigs 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.630
 have muscle ache 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.880
 but it will be in my opinion 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.570
 worth it and I know those 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 Least of all professionals really do not 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.100
 the aggressive mid-foot walk so 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.390
 arise on the middle foot and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.759
 somehow on the heels arise why 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.170
 Of course if you are in there the direction 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.600
 is and you come up with the hacking 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.280
 then you give such a jerk Reinhardt 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.159
 and stops you disappear again 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.299
 certain amount of energy I will 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.140
 now very few recommendations 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.850
 pronounce 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.130
 that's basically my second one 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.869
 Running shoes for almost ten years 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 split my second run shoe 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.790
 he's about three years old now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.429
 is three years old 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.410
 nike tracks 16 and if you're behind here 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.900
 I hope you can see now 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.390
 the main color is enough if 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.700
 you see, here you have a blue and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.110
 gray solo and the scottie in length 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.739
 So in the length of the quasi has two 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.080
 Persons I say 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.430
 while the outer so empty the outer 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.640
 so in this case the blue one 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.250
 softer side is for the people too 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.590
 a slight over per nation one so 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.780
 so to speak, so to speak 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.550
 as I had before and still 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.480
 had a little so you can see it is a 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.129
 piece declined 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 in the last few years when i was at 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.930
 I ran forefoot midfoot 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.150
 is such a shoe very useful because 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.849
 this so long time is softer that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.370
 is your country faster quasi to 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.780
 middle position and yes not for that 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.620
 really worth the shoe to 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.690
 support 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.739
 I'm not a fan of being too big 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.319
 too thick soles 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.730
 that should nicely dampen everything should not 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.989
 somehow just foot deformities 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.129
 or something like that, students had quasi 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.140
 So come in the shoe can I totally 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.360
 I recommend with 70 euros 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.489
 then paid for the thrust brock 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.810
 I paid 40 euro for screens milan 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.879
 so I then got myself 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.680
 I just got it for the 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.290
 It's much easier this summer 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.010
 So it's easy even he becomes 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.640
 about 450 grams of the entire pair 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.010
 these things offer 250 km for so 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.569
 another 200 grams lighter but respects 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.239
 if you have the race now 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.970
 for example, I have now in may 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.230
 I signed up for the half marathon yes 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.390
 I'm also thinking about switching 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.120
 now always through and will now 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.349
 Let's see if I'm really involved then 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.239
 another school on otherwise 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.580
 Generally it is not recommended to run 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.870
 with the shoe with the trained because 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.310
 otherwise you have any problems 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.260
 something should feel different 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.459
 you do not do it but if he of course 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.739
 You can do that much easier 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.680
 tried and I have the here too 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.540
 far, the execution of the now one 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.610
 relatively thin sole has three 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.489
 bands track I think so 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.920
 for larger terrain where really up 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.689
 It is more like that for the gravel 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.480
 people of you who have changed this 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.759
 walk the course of normal hacken foot 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.049
 run on the middle foot forefoot 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.900
 I'll be able to remember that was one 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.090
 abnormal muscle hangover 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.290
 and the same will happen to you again 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.000
 If you have the choice when it happens 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.070
 is it going to happen then you have it then 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.449
 no more fumes one does not occur that way 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.820
 aggressive on the forefoot often in the 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.050
 midfoot run in the middle foot but on 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.720
 you really think about everything 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.520
 muscles and it's really hardcore 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.620
 so you will not run any races 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.600
 wise, you can not win races 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.070
 Can he take his kick against extreme 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.710
 weaken weak field 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.169
 Well, but this is more the procedure 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.240
 maybe if you walk around like that too 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.310
 in the mountains and solvency bands is okay 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.650
 if the beautiful trails are but 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.740
 if too stony yes, if by chance 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.870
 then i would leave out the things 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.250
 and yes, there must be heard that 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.110
 Here was the load is extremely 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.060
 simply much bigger that very short 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.100
 to the brandy so you see 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.270
 Here you almost slip your toes 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.729
 purely to imitate barefoot running it 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.039
 there are others but they are 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.510
 I wear shoes and I would 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.080
 can recommend above all things that is 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.960
 my main every day running shoe nike 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.789
 triangle 16 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.130
 for example, this triangle or 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.650
 every bruck screen silence the eighth too 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.669
 on recycled material and bit 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.400
 be careful when you because maybe 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:40.240
 still looking at it by chance 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.550
 otherwise it's just the run 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.310
 hardcore discipline so it's easy 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.630
 you need some fitness and it 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.430
 It's just fun if you already have one 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.970
 certain level of physical 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.310
 robustness and certain endurance performance 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.650
 I 've got to say I would 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.870
 Do not run this routine for any beginner 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.490
 recommend yes you can do it slowly 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.500
 but it can demotivate because you can not 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.050
 so far, and that's why I would 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.900
 while cycling or inline skating 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.220
 or while swimming or at one 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.770
 walk loose 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.510
 I stay with such things run 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.340
 is then already severely grad for the 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.260
 people the beginning of it in any case 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.780
 cool shoes do not have to be shoes 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.860
 I used to fix myself for years 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.389
 they have to be loose 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.580
 The main thing that they do not fall off the 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.849
 rest fits and in this sense people 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:31.419
 small tip video of me what I for 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.990
 for running shoes and yes as I said the 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.310
 run for ten years and now 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.500
 that works quite well and the best 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.539
 what I ever did was easy 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.779
 the changeover to the forefoot midfoot 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:45.639
 It's a lot more fun and fun 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:47.680
 the muscles of this whole pumping effect yes 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.330
 because then also the lymphatic system 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.389
 again stimulates that is my opinion 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.729
 to run a lot better 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:57.279
 forefoot midfoot is running and just when 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.919
 you are barefoot, you are not at all 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.870
 forefoot mittelfuÃŸ run around there yes 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.669
 he will already run the incident in front of foot 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.900
 if you are barefoot somewhere then people 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.529
 Can not you hack once? 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.029
 occur 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.950
 you see that at any 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:11.680
 Africans, for example, quite completely 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.840
 Many African top runners have theirs 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.930
 enormous robustness and running technique 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.750
 correct running technique through the barefoot 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.389
 developed and it is clear that occurs 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.669
 is simply the front is on everything else 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.630
 physiological crap but that's just it 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.630
 my opinion 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.039
 in this sense skin pulls pure people 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.820
 you again the video in what I propose 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:37.840
 two two and a half years have made to 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.979
 forefoot running midfoot and a lot of fun
