00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
processes work a lot faster now the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.299 
processes work a lot faster now the
first<00:00:48.390> time<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.570> did<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.379> freed<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.829> seven

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
first time I did this I freed up seven

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.180 
first time I did this I freed up seven
games<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.700> disk<00:00:50.969> space<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:52.500> my<00:00:52.590> computer<00:00:52.980> which

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
games a disk space for my computer which

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.600 
games a disk space for my computer which
allowed<00:00:53.520> my<00:00:53.699> process<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> lot<00:00:55.020> faster

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
allowed my process is to go a lot faster

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.910 
allowed my process is to go a lot faster
so<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.850> should<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.090> couple<00:00:57.390> minutes<00:00:57.920> also

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
