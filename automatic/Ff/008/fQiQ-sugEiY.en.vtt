especially 2d level you want to do and
this<00:00:31.570> is<00:00:31.719> how<00:00:31.840> you<00:00:31.899> do<00:00:32.050> it<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.870> you're<00:00:35.020> going<00:00:35.140> to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
this is how you do it so you're going to

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.940 
this is how you do it so you're going to
need<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.680> broadcast<00:00:36.190> microchip<00:00:37.200> timer<00:00:39.030> mover

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
need a broadcast microchip timer mover

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.780 
need a broadcast microchip timer mover
counter<00:00:42.600> control<00:00:43.600> inator<00:00:44.400> and<00:00:45.400> a<00:00:45.430> state

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
counter control inator and a state

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.850 
counter control inator and a state
sensor<00:00:48.150> so<00:00:49.150> this<00:00:49.510> can<00:00:49.720> be<00:00:49.840> used<00:00:50.260> with<00:00:50.590> Eva

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
sensor so this can be used with Eva

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.630 
sensor so this can be used with Eva
broadcast<00:00:51.430> microchips<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:53.710> can<00:00:53.890> be<00:00:53.980> used<00:00:54.310> with

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
broadcast microchips it can be used with

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.500 
broadcast microchips it can be used with
sac<00:00:55.450> BOTS<00:00:55.720> it<00:00:56.290> can<00:00:56.440> also<00:00:56.590> be<00:00:56.920> used<00:00:57.190> with<00:00:57.520> custom

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
sac BOTS it can also be used with custom

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.750 
sac BOTS it can also be used with custom
characters<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.890> if<00:00:59.950> you<00:01:00.070> were<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.310> capture<00:01:00.670> the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
characters so if you were to capture the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.850 
characters so if you were to capture the
cyclop<00:01:01.180> you're<00:01:01.989> going<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.260> use<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.530> in<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.649> sac

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
cyclop you're going to use it in a sac

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.350 
cyclop you're going to use it in a sac
bot<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.220> don't<00:01:03.430> need<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.730> put<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:03.910> broadcast

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
bot you don't need to put a broadcast

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.719 
bot you don't need to put a broadcast
microchip<00:01:04.899> on<00:01:05.130> instead<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.430> would<00:01:06.549> just

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
microchip on instead you would just

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.629 
microchip on instead you would just
start<00:01:07.060> with<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:08.189> control<00:01:09.189> inator

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:11.639 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:13.709 

so<00:01:12.639> I'm<00:01:12.729> just<00:01:12.850> going<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.149> make<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.389> settings

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
so I'm just going to make the settings

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.709 
so I'm just going to make the settings
in<00:01:13.869> this<00:01:14.079> broadcast<00:01:14.499> microchip<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:16.210> everyone

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
in this broadcast microchip to everyone

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.789 
in this broadcast microchip to everyone
in<00:01:16.929> range<00:01:17.969> then<00:01:18.969> we<00:01:19.119> have<00:01:19.240> inside<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.929> control

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
in range then we have inside a control

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.179 
in range then we have inside a control
inator

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
inator

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.569 
inator
this<00:01:21.969> control<00:01:22.359> inator<00:01:22.859> inside<00:01:23.859> here<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.280> set

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
this control inator inside here is set

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.199 
this control inator inside here is set
to<00:01:24.969> can<00:01:25.569> be<00:01:25.689> controlled<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.549> receiver<00:01:27.939> of

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
to can be controlled so the receiver of

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.120 
to can be controlled so the receiver of
the<00:01:28.539> nearest<00:01:28.749> fire<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.729> we<00:01:30.819> open<00:01:31.090> up<00:01:31.179> inside

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the nearest fire so we open up inside

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.849 
the nearest fire so we open up inside
first<00:01:33.130> up<00:01:33.399> we<00:01:33.670> want<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:34.029> counter<00:01:34.539> we<00:01:35.499> want<00:01:35.679> the
