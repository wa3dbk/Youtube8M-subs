00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 Hello teacher 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.350
 what are we doing today 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.360
 what we do regularly 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.759
 we have a benefit that we do 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:24.300
 directly on a metal support or 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.310
 steel sheet joints 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 used in vehicles is a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.470
 autopart we are exactly 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.019
 talking about a drawer in campotejar in 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 this case this drawer 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.860
 initially the first step is for 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.120
 thank you because it is a 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.190
 surface that is already painted 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 previously and is intended for the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.940
 first step that must always be done 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.120
 to a component of that material 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.460
 eliminate the brightness of the learn 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.500
 how to eliminate the price of the piece and is 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.130
 basically how they removed a part of 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.780
 the skin layer 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.160
 and we do it with an abrasive and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.390
 ratified the junction disqus 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:09.590
 then it's too what 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.350
 we do is that the student of the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.740
 left the fear of getting 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:23.380
 directly with components and 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.380
 own the panic 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:42.250
 at the end of the job protect it with 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.770
 suit protect it with the weather next to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.920
 the temperatures against agents 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.610
 environmental corrosive agents and 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.320
 then the evolution of this part then 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.550
 let's leave noise to build this 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.550
 it's a more complex part
