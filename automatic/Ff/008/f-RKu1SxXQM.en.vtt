00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.100 
spray in my opinion this look is very
simple<00:07:07.030> you<00:07:07.180> could<00:07:07.330> still<00:07:07.600> see<00:07:07.810> your<00:07:07.960> own

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
simple you could still see your own

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.810 
simple you could still see your own
beauty<00:07:08.560> within<00:07:08.770> it's<00:07:09.340> not<00:07:09.520> like<00:07:09.670> you're

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
beauty within it's not like you're

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.030 
beauty within it's not like you're
covered<00:07:10.210> in<00:07:10.300> makeup<00:07:10.510> so<00:07:11.320> this<00:07:11.350> is<00:07:11.860> why<00:07:12.010> I

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
covered in makeup so this is why I

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.040 
covered in makeup so this is why I
decided<00:07:12.220> to<00:07:12.700> go<00:07:12.910> for<00:07:13.120> this<00:07:13.240> and<00:07:13.510> I<00:07:13.780> think

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
decided to go for this and I think

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.240 
decided to go for this and I think
overall<00:07:14.410> it<00:07:14.650> turned<00:07:14.860> out<00:07:14.980> really<00:07:15.310> pretty<00:07:17.250> like

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250
