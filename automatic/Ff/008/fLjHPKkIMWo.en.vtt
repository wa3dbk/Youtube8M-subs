00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
to the natural gas service so the

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:44.120 
to the natural gas service so the
generator<00:00:33.910> will<00:00:34.180> run<00:00:34.450> from<00:00:34.810> natural<00:00:35.320> gas

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.190 

that's<00:00:45.130> what<00:00:45.280> siting<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.750> would<00:00:46.870> have<00:00:47.020> to<00:00:47.140> be

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
that's what siting it would have to be

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.830 
that's what siting it would have to be

let's<00:00:49.840> bring<00:00:50.470> a<00:00:50.920> groupie<00:00:51.660> they're<00:00:52.660> working<00:00:53.020> on

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
let's bring a groupie they're working on

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.500 
let's bring a groupie they're working on
the<00:00:53.290> trench<00:00:53.710> in<00:00:54.070> which<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.730> electrical

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
the trench in which the electrical

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.490 
the trench in which the electrical
conduit<00:00:56.170> will<00:00:56.440> run<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:56.829> connect<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.370> house

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
conduit will run to connect to the house

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.260 
conduit will run to connect to the house
this<00:00:59.500> other<00:00:59.739> trench<00:01:00.130> toward<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.550> back<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:01.030> for

this other trench toward the back is for

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.360 
this other trench toward the back is for
the<00:01:01.480> gas<00:01:01.780> line<00:01:02.110> so<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.559> gas<00:01:02.710> line<00:01:02.950> can<00:01:03.160> feed

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
the gas line so the gas line can feed

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.039 
the gas line so the gas line can feed
the<00:01:03.520> generator<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:07.390> will<00:01:07.600> install

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
the generator they will install

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.710 
the generator they will install
alternating<00:01:08.890> layers<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.280> gravel<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.420> dry

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
alternating layers of gravel and dry

alternating layers of gravel and dry
concrete<00:01:11.049> mix<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.370> makes<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.909> base<00:01:13.479> that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
concrete mix and this makes a base that

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.230 
concrete mix and this makes a base that
will<00:01:14.260> absorb<00:01:14.830> much<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.400> vibration<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
will absorb much of the vibration of the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:40.600 

I<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.170> drill<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.440> hole<00:01:39.530> through<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.280> brick

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
I have to drill a hole through the brick

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.420 
I have to drill a hole through the brick
wall<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:42.170> get<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.590> gas<00:01:42.800> line<00:01:43.100> out<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
wall to get the gas line out of the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.670 
wall to get the gas line out of the
house<00:01:43.640> over<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.330> generator<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.590> the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
house over to the generator this is the

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.290 
house over to the generator this is the
gas<00:01:45.890> line<00:01:46.159> it<00:01:46.369> comes<00:01:46.549> on<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> real<00:01:47.000> it's

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
gas line it comes on a real it's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.570 
gas line it comes on a real it's
flexible<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.830> run<00:01:49.009> around<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.310> corner

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
flexible and can run around the corner

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.430 
flexible and can run around the corner
and<00:01:49.700> everything

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.250 

so<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.620> gas<00:01:57.890> line

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
so the gas line

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.080 
so the gas line
through<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.500> wall<00:01:59.740> inside<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.460> house<00:02:00.760> right

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
through the wall inside the house right

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.540 
through the wall inside the house right
there<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:02.200> goes<00:02:02.260> underneath<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.100> deck<00:02:03.310> and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
there it goes underneath the deck and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.430 
there it goes underneath the deck and
then<00:02:04.240> goes<00:02:04.480> around<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.900> back<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.230> house

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
then goes around the back of the house

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.330 
then goes around the back of the house
to<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.220> side<00:02:06.760> where<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:08.070> generator<00:02:09.070> will<00:02:09.310> be

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
to the side where the generator will be

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.180 
to the side where the generator will be
located<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:11.080> gas<00:02:11.230> line<00:02:11.500> runs<00:02:11.800> along<00:02:11.920> the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
located and the gas line runs along the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.580 
located and the gas line runs along the
ceiling<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.310> turns<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:16.590> runs

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
ceiling and then it turns and runs

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.070 
ceiling and then it turns and runs
toward<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.070> front<00:02:18.220> of<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.460> house<00:02:18.870> where<00:02:19.870> it's

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
toward the front of the house where it's

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.880 
toward the front of the house where it's
going<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.410> be<00:02:20.760> attached<00:02:22.260> right<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.560> point

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
going to be attached right at this point

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.970 
going to be attached right at this point
up<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.990> will<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.290> shutoff<00:02:26.680> valve

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
up here this will be the shutoff valve

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.960 
up here this will be the shutoff valve
for<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.220> gas<00:02:27.460> for<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.330> generator<00:02:29.910> here's<00:02:30.910> a

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
for the gas for the generator here's a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.960 
for the gas for the generator here's a
close-up<00:02:31.510> view<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.560> gas<00:02:33.010> line<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
close-up view of this gas line it's a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.860 
close-up view of this gas line it's a
flexible

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
flexible

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.900 
flexible
I<00:02:34.900> guess<00:02:35.470> that's<00:02:35.710> steel<00:02:36.190> line<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.820> it's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
I guess that's steel line and it's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.410 
I guess that's steel line and it's
covered<00:02:37.210> with<00:02:37.240> pretty<00:02:37.900> heavy<00:02:38.140> black<00:02:38.470> plastic

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
covered with pretty heavy black plastic

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
generator the Installer set it up so

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.529 
generator the Installer set it up so
that<00:05:12.860> had<00:05:13.099> the<00:05:13.280> correct<00:05:13.639> time<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:13.970> was<00:05:14.330> set

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
that had the correct time and was set

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.010 
that had the correct time and was set
for<00:05:14.720> normal<00:05:15.050> operation<00:05:16.630> with<00:05:17.630> everything

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
for normal operation with everything

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.570 
for normal operation with everything
connected<00:05:18.470> it's<00:05:18.650> time<00:05:18.919> to<00:05:19.159> start<00:05:19.460> the

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
connected it's time to start the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.120 
connected it's time to start the
generator<00:05:20.060> but<00:05:20.300> first<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.930> Installer<00:05:21.500> had<00:05:21.860> to

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
generator but first the Installer had to

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.399 
generator but first the Installer had to
bleed<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.729> gas<00:05:23.000> line<00:05:23.360> so<00:05:23.389> that<00:05:23.720> there<00:05:24.050> was<00:05:24.169> gas

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 
bleed the gas line so that there was gas

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.269 
bleed the gas line so that there was gas
all<00:05:25.039> the<00:05:25.190> way<00:05:25.310> out<00:05:25.550> to<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:25.909> generator

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
all the way out to the generator

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:30.489 
all the way out to the generator
once<00:05:28.999> that<00:05:29.179> was<00:05:29.359> done<00:05:29.539> the<00:05:29.689> generator<00:05:30.079> started

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:30.499 
once that was done the generator started

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:36.129 
once that was done the generator started
right<00:05:30.679> up

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.090 

okay<00:05:37.139> now<00:05:37.320> we're<00:05:37.440> going<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> test<00:05:37.889> the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
okay now we're going to test the

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.620 
okay now we're going to test the
generator<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.940> see<00:05:39.180> if<00:05:39.240> they'll<00:05:39.389> come<00:05:39.570> out

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
generator it see if they'll come out

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.570 
generator it see if they'll come out
automatically<00:05:40.200> by<00:05:40.470> killing<00:05:40.919> the<00:05:41.070> utility

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
automatically by killing the utility

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.570 
automatically by killing the utility
power<00:05:41.960> so<00:05:42.960> we're<00:05:43.590> going<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.800> set<00:05:44.250> everything

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
power so we're going to set everything

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.060 
power so we're going to set everything
to<00:05:44.610> make<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:44.940> be<00:05:45.060> normal<00:05:45.470> and<00:05:46.470> here<00:05:46.770> we<00:05:46.889> go

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
to make it be normal and here we go

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:56.060 
to make it be normal and here we go
ready<00:05:52.370> generator<00:05:54.290> and<00:05:55.290> there<00:05:55.470> the<00:05:55.650> generator

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
ready generator and there the generator

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.940 
ready generator and there the generator
fire<00:05:56.370> down

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.400 

and<00:06:00.190> loud<00:06:00.550> click<00:06:01.030> was<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:01.660> switch<00:06:02.020> over<00:06:02.230> to

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
and loud click was the switch over to

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.890 
and loud click was the switch over to
the<00:06:02.770> generator<00:06:03.220> power

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.440 

and<00:06:06.110> that<00:06:06.920> completed<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.640> installation<00:06:07.970> of

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
and that completed the installation of

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.439 
and that completed the installation of
the<00:06:08.570> back-up<00:06:08.930> generator

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449
