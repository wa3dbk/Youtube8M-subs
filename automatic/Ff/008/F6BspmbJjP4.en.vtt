00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.120 
might want that I didn't have on the
list<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:09.660> it's<00:03:09.780> kind<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.140> master<00:03:10.560> list<00:03:10.830> and

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
list so it's kind of a master list and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.400 
list so it's kind of a master list and
it's<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> great<00:03:11.550> starting<00:03:11.970> point<00:03:12.300> if<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.810> are

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
it's a great starting point if you are

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.870 
it's a great starting point if you are
just<00:03:13.709> getting<00:03:13.890> started<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.610> don't<00:03:14.790> know

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
just getting started and you don't know

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.300 
just getting started and you don't know
what<00:03:15.390> categories<00:03:15.959> do<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> need<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.130> want

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
what categories do I need and you want

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.580

to<00:03:17.370> organized<00:03:17.730> by<00:03:17.910> category<00:03:18.450> then<00:03:19.170> go<00:03:19.350> ahead

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
to organized by category then go ahead

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.050 
to organized by category then go ahead
and<00:03:19.709> print<00:03:19.830> off<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.100> category<00:03:20.520> checklist<00:03:20.940> so

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
and print off the category checklist so

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.850 
and print off the category checklist so
that<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.209> don't<00:03:21.420> forget<00:03:21.570> something<00:03:21.780> if<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
that you don't forget something if you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.680 
that you don't forget something if you
want<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.100> order<00:03:23.250> organized<00:03:23.970> alphabetically

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
want to order organized alphabetically

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.229 
want to order organized alphabetically
like<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:24.959> do<00:03:25.230> then<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:25.980> just<00:03:26.190> go<00:03:26.550> through<00:03:26.580> take

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
like I do then you just go through take

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.920 
like I do then you just go through take
your<00:03:27.570> dividers<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.739> number<00:03:29.459> them<00:03:29.690> ABCDE

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
your dividers and number them ABCDE

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.010 
your dividers and number them ABCDE
and<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.820> makes<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.540> easy<00:03:33.690> for

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
and so so that makes it really easy for

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.650 
and so so that makes it really easy for
me<00:03:34.350> it's<00:03:34.650> one<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.730> my<00:03:35.820> favorite<00:03:36.150> systems<00:03:36.510> I've

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
me it's one of my favorite systems I've

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.150 
me it's one of my favorite systems I've
been<00:03:36.780> using<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.140> for<00:03:37.290> almost<00:03:37.500> two<00:03:37.709> years<00:03:37.739> now

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
been using this for almost two years now

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.250 
been using this for almost two years now
and<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:39.090> love<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.450> they<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.690> came<00:03:40.050> out<00:03:40.200> with

and I love it they just came out with

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.199 
and I love it they just came out with
the<00:03:40.530> double<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.310> holds<00:03:41.459> more<00:03:41.820> coupons

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
the double so that it holds more coupons

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.160 
the double so that it holds more coupons
