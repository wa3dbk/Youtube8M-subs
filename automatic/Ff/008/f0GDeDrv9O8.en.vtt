 chapter 14 word of jehovah that came 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.099
 to jeremías on the occasion of the drought 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.380
 mourned Judas and its doors were 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.710
 they depopulated they sat sad in 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.599
 earth and the clamor of Jerusalem rose 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.880
 the nobles sent their servants to the water 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.970
 they came to the lagoons and did not find 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 water returned with their empty vessels were 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.710
 embarrassed they got confused and covered 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.449
 cracked their heads because the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 land for not having rained in the country 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.700
 they are confused the farmers covered 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.130
 their heads even the handmaidens in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.860
 fields gave birth and left the breeding because 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.960
 there was no grass and the donkeys were 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.270
 they put in the heights they aspired 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 wind like jackals his eyes will 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.980
 They obfuscated because there was no grass but 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 our iniquities testify against 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.840
 we or jehová act for the love of your 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.870
 name because our rebellions have been 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 multiplied against you we have sinned or 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.609
 hope of israel his guardian in the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.920
 time of affliction because you have 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.750
 done as an outsider on earth and as 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.420
 walker who retires to pass the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.210
 night because you are like astonished man 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.340
 and as a brave man who can not fight without 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
 But you are among us 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.890
 jehovah and upon us is invoked your 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.110
 name do not forsake us like that said 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.689
 jehovah about this town he 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 They delighted in paying and gave no rest 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.110
 his feet 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.600
 therefore jehovah does not like them 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.000
 he will remember now his evil and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.130
 will punish your sins 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 told me jehovah do not pray for this 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.080
 people for good when they help me I do not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 I will hear their cry and when they offer 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.819
 holocaust and offering I will not accept it but 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.110
 that will consume them with sword with hunger 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:48.390
 and president and I told Mr. 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.090
 Jehovah, behold, the prophets 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.250
 they say you will not see a sword or be hungry 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.799
 among you but in this place I 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.200
 I will give true peace he told me then 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.569
 jehovah falsely prophesy the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.350
 prophets in my name do not send them and 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:06.030
 send them and tell them lying vision 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.149
 divination vanity and deception of his 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.799
 heart prophesy us therefore so has 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.700
 said jehovah about the prophets that 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.310
 prophesy in my name which 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.800
 I did not send and they say neither sword nor 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.480
 Hunger will be in this land with sword and 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.970
 with men those will be consumed 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.379
 prophets and the people to whom they prophesy 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.110
 will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.629
 by hunger and by sword and there will be no one 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.819
 bury them to their women to their 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.430
 children and their daughters and about them 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.500
 I will pour out their evil will tell you later 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.739
 this word spill in my eyes 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.540
 tears night and day and do not stop because 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.090
 of great destruction is broken 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.970
 the virgin daughter of my people of plague very 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.370
 painful if I go to the field here 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.220
 killed by the sword and if I enter the city 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.079
 here are hungry people because both 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.200
 the prophet as the priest walked 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.260
 wandering on earth and did not understand has 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.900
 discarded entirely helps abhorred 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.079
 your soul nation because you made us hurt 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.140
 without any remedy, we hope for peace and not 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.349
 there was a good healing time and here 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.380
 we recognize the jehovah our 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.630
 entity the iniquity of our parents 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.400
 because against you we have sinned out of love 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.750
 your name will not waste or 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.420
 blood his glorious throne 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.700

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.130

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.890
 nations who rains and will give the 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.950
