seconds and costs 45 stamina I've
actually<00:00:42.510> seen<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:42.930> skill<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
actually seen this skill in one of the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.740 
actually seen this skill in one of the
videos<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.460> Dragon<00:00:44.760> Age<00:00:44.850> Inquisition<00:00:45.000> and

videos for Dragon Age Inquisition and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
videos for Dragon Age Inquisition and
the<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> works<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.620> basically<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.640> have

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the way it works is basically you have

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
the way it works is basically you have
to<00:00:47.969> stand<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.660> certain<00:00:49.079> place<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.590> example

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
to stand at a certain place for example

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.100 
to stand at a certain place for example
and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.700> after<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.149> activate<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.809> skill

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and then after you activate this skill

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.430 
and then after you activate this skill
there<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:53.070> four<00:00:53.960> ghostly<00:00:54.960> figures

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there will be like four ghostly figures

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.250 
there will be like four ghostly figures
spawned<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.550> aligned<00:00:56.940> net<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.660> line<00:00:57.899> next

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
spawned in a aligned net in a line next

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.680 
spawned in a aligned net in a line next
to<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> your<00:01:00.570> left

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
to so two to your right and to your left

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.260 
to so two to your right and to your left
which<00:01:01.530> will<00:01:01.680> create<00:01:01.980> sort<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.640> wall<00:01:03.000> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
which will create sort of a wall that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.750 
which will create sort of a wall that
cannot<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.660> passed<00:01:04.080> however<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
cannot be passed however you are the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340 
cannot be passed however you are the
middle<00:01:06.030> member<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> wall<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.049> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
middle member of the wall so you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.649 
middle member of the wall so you can
probably<00:01:07.560> still<00:01:07.950> take<00:01:08.159> damage<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:09.390> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
probably still take damage but this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.950 
probably still take damage but this
still<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.380> basically<00:01:11.210> block<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.540> certain

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
still will basically block of a certain

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.770 
still will basically block of a certain
area<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> map<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.970> upgraded<00:01:15.180> with

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
area of the map it can be upgraded with

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.350 
area of the map it can be upgraded with
and<00:01:16.049> no<00:01:16.380> further<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:17.250> will<00:01:17.460> even<00:01:17.880> increase

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and no further which will even increase

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.950 
and no further which will even increase
the<00:01:18.630> size<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.590> wall<00:01:20.189> itself<00:01:20.729> by<00:01:21.119> 3<00:01:21.479> meters

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the size of the wall itself by 3 meters

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.370 
the size of the wall itself by 3 meters
then<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> unyielding<00:01:24.170> which<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
then we have unyielding which is a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
then we have unyielding which is a
passive<00:01:25.890> ability<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:27.060> saves<00:01:27.390> your

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
passive ability that actually saves your

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.410 
passive ability that actually saves your
life<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.680> ability<00:01:28.920> makes<00:01:29.369> whatever<00:01:29.700> attacks

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
life this ability makes whatever attacks

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690 
life this ability makes whatever attacks
would<00:01:30.720> normally<00:01:31.259> kill<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.740> leave<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
would normally kill you leave you with a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
would normally kill you leave you with a
5<00:01:32.970> percent<00:01:33.420> health<00:01:33.750> threshold<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
5 percent health threshold and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.550 
5 percent health threshold and
invulnerability<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.180> 5<00:01:36.450> seconds<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
invulnerability for 5 seconds and it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
invulnerability for 5 seconds and it
also<00:01:37.710> has<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> cool-down<00:01:38.369> time<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.880> 60<00:01:39.299> seconds

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
also has a cool-down time of 60 seconds

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.899 
also has a cool-down time of 60 seconds
and<00:01:39.869> gives<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> free<00:01:40.500> constitutional<00:01:41.430> unlock

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and gives you free constitutional unlock

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
and gives you free constitutional unlock
so<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.420> somebody<00:01:42.810> attacks<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.470> you're

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so if somebody attacks you when you're

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.800 
so if somebody attacks you when you're
low<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.890> health<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.909> blow<00:01:45.240> would<00:01:45.509> kill

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
low on health and that blow would kill

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
low on health and that blow would kill
you<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.799> passive<00:01:47.280> ability<00:01:47.670> triggers

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you then this passive ability triggers

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.240 
you then this passive ability triggers
automatically<00:01:48.899> giving<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.439> invulnerability

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
automatically giving you invulnerability

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.090 
automatically giving you invulnerability
for<00:01:50.700> 5<00:01:50.939> seconds<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.630> also<00:01:52.409> leaving<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.890> with

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
for 5 seconds and also leaving you with

damage they take the effect ends if you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.050 
damage they take the effect ends if you

get out of the range of the enemy and
the<00:03:54.150> range<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.230> 15<00:03:55.770> meters<00:03:56.250> his<00:03:57.209> damage<00:03:57.720> output

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
the range is 15 meters his damage output

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.100 
the range is 15 meters his damage output
will<00:03:58.470> increase<00:03:58.920> by<00:03:59.070> 5%<00:03:59.400> per<00:04:00.120> second<00:04:00.630> but<00:04:00.840> also

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
will increase by 5% per second but also

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.680 
will increase by 5% per second but also
the<00:04:01.410> damage<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:01.770> he<00:04:02.100> takes<00:04:02.400> increases<00:04:03.150> by<00:04:03.330> 5%

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
the damage that he takes increases by 5%

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.320 
the damage that he takes increases by 5%
per<00:04:04.350> second<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.400> ability<00:04:05.490> has<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.000> cool-down

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
per second the ability has a cool-down

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.500 
per second the ability has a cool-down
time<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.840> 42<00:04:07.320> seconds<00:04:07.740> and<00:04:07.950> costs<00:04:08.430> 35<00:04:08.970> stamina

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
time of 42 seconds and costs 35 stamina

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.780 
time of 42 seconds and costs 35 stamina
so<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.200> skill<00:04:10.470> synergize<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.130> very<00:04:11.400> well<00:04:11.610> with
