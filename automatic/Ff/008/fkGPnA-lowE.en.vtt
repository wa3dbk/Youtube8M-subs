00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.850 
meets out the high heat we get that and
that's<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.190> nice<00:02:44.400> movable<00:02:45.000> cord

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.980 

so<00:02:52.490> we<00:02:52.610> get<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.790> deeper<00:02:53.060> sound<00:02:53.480> out<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.840> that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
so we get a deeper sound out of that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.080 
so we get a deeper sound out of that
cord<00:02:55.780> now<00:02:56.780> if<00:02:56.900> we<00:02:57.020> want<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> get<00:02:57.500> an<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:58.820> minor

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
cord now if we want to get an a minor

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.230 
cord now if we want to get an a minor
9th<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.960> has<00:03:00.260> some<00:03:00.470> depth<00:03:00.770> we<00:03:01.490> do<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:02.000> and

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
9th that has some depth we do this and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.440 
9th that has some depth we do this and
then<00:03:02.870> we<00:03:03.020> add<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.910> finger<00:03:04.910> at<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.060> seventh<00:03:05.390> fret

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
then we add a finger at the seventh fret

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.490 
then we add a finger at the seventh fret
on<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.750> high<00:03:05.840> E<00:03:05.990> string

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.400 

and<00:03:09.620> we<00:03:09.740> have<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.510> that's<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.890> minor<00:03:12.890> 9<00:03:14.320> now<00:03:15.320> if

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and we have that that's a minor 9 now if

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.560 
and we have that that's a minor 9 now if
we<00:03:15.560> take<00:03:15.770> this<00:03:16.010> finger<00:03:16.490> move<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.270> up<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:20.420> B

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
we take this finger move it up to the B

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:29.910 
we take this finger move it up to the B
string<00:03:20.630> 7th<00:03:21.560> fret<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:24.500> now<00:03:24.800> have<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.520> minor<00:03:26.390> 6

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.680 

now<00:03:30.920> if<00:03:30.980> we<00:03:31.160> want<00:03:31.370> some<00:03:31.550> complimentary<00:03:32.210> chords

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
now if we want some complimentary chords

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.260 
now if we want some complimentary chords
in<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.960> position<00:03:33.470> we<00:03:33.980> can<00:03:34.190> go<00:03:34.340> here<00:03:34.700> bar

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
in this position we can go here bar

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.500 
in this position we can go here bar
everything<00:03:35.630> there<00:03:36.080> bring<00:03:36.890> in<00:03:37.210> the<00:03:38.210> middle

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
everything there bring in the middle

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.110 
everything there bring in the middle
finger<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.470> 6th<00:03:40.280> fret<00:03:40.430> on<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.760> B<00:03:40.970> string

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
finger to the 6th fret on the B string

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.320 
finger to the 6th fret on the B string
and<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.930> ring<00:03:42.140> finger<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.400> 7th<00:03:43.850> fret<00:03:44.030> on

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
and the ring finger to the 7th fret on

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.020 
and the ring finger to the 7th fret on
the<00:03:44.420> D<00:03:44.810> string<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.440> we<00:03:45.530> get<00:03:45.770> D<00:03:46.160> minor<00:03:46.400> 7<00:03:46.730> that's

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
the D string and we get D minor 7 that's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.130 
the D string and we get D minor 7 that's
drums<00:03:47.420> from<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> string

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
drums from the a string

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.260 
drums from the a string
so<00:03:50.950> that's<00:03:51.160> going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.460> give<00:03:51.670> us<00:03:51.700> something<00:03:52.150> to

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
so that's going to give us something to

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.980 
so that's going to give us something to
add<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:53.020> our<00:03:53.970> existing<00:03:54.970> core<00:03:55.270> so<00:03:56.200> we<00:03:56.380> have<00:03:56.620> a

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
add to our existing core so we have a

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.930 
add to our existing core so we have a
minor<00:03:58.990> 7<00:04:00.720> d<00:04:01.720> minor<00:04:01.930> 7<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:02.650> we<00:04:03.400> can<00:04:03.550> move<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
minor 7 d minor 7 and we can move that

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.590 
minor 7 d minor 7 and we can move that
up<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.450> E<00:04:05.230> minor<00:04:05.560> 7

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
up to E minor 7

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.780 
up to E minor 7
something<00:04:07.600> about<00:04:07.720> raising<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.320> host<00:04:08.470> in

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.760 

now<00:04:12.790> if<00:04:13.030> we<00:04:13.150> want<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.420> go<00:04:13.510> back<00:04:13.750> here<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.260> add<00:04:14.740> a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
now if we want to go back here and add a

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.720 
now if we want to go back here and add a
major<00:04:15.130> 7<00:04:15.640> chord<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.060> mix<00:04:16.390> we<00:04:17.049> just<00:04:17.320> do<00:04:18.040> this

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.530 

that's<00:04:21.730> D<00:04:22.030> major<00:04:22.240> 7

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
that's D major 7

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.830 
that's D major 7
so<00:04:25.170> I'm<00:04:25.350> barring<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.250> fifth<00:04:26.490> fret<00:04:26.840> bringing

I've<00:04:49.050> got<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.230> nice<00:04:49.470> addition<00:04:49.980> there<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.550> I've

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
I've got a nice addition there so I've

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:59.160 
I've got a nice addition there so I've
got

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.050 

we<00:05:00.170> can<00:05:00.320> make<00:05:00.530> an<00:05:00.710> alternate<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.280> minus<00:05:01.700> seven

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
we can make an alternate a minus seven

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.900 
we can make an alternate a minus seven
by<00:05:02.720> using<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.710> court<00:05:04.010> we<00:05:04.100> had<00:05:04.310> at<00:05:04.430> first<00:05:04.460> and

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
by using the court we had at first and

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.950 
by using the court we had at first and
then<00:05:05.420> throwing<00:05:05.720> in<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:08.150> eighth<00:05:08.270> fret<00:05:08.540> on<00:05:08.840> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
then throwing in the eighth fret on the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.720 
then throwing in the eighth fret on the
B<00:05:09.200> string<00:05:09.320> and<00:05:10.010> get<00:05:10.700> this

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.590 

so<00:05:16.570> we<00:05:16.690> have<00:05:16.930> our<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:17.290> minor<00:05:17.530> seventh<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:18.940> we

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
so we have our a minor seventh and we

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:28.280 
so we have our a minor seventh and we
have<00:05:19.810> our<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.110> minor<00:05:20.380> six<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:22.000> we<00:05:22.090> can<00:05:22.240> do<00:05:22.390> that

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.590 

and<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:29.100> gives<00:05:29.280> us<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.700> nice<00:05:29.910> cool<00:05:30.270> funk<00:05:32.600> well

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
and that gives us a nice cool funk well

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.140 
and that gives us a nice cool funk well
