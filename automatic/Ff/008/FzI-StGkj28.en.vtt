00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
thing about these utilitarian vehicles

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.730 
thing about these utilitarian vehicles
is<00:00:19.550> just<00:00:19.849> that<00:00:20.090> they<00:00:20.270> try<00:00:20.510> to<00:00:20.539> be<00:00:20.869> all<00:00:21.110> and<00:00:21.410> do

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
is just that they try to be all and do

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.010 
is just that they try to be all and do
all<00:00:21.949> for<00:00:22.160> all<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.280> consumers<00:00:22.660> this<00:00:23.660> little

drive system from Honda really does take

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.710 
drive system from Honda really does take
a<00:00:27.980> good<00:00:28.279> stab<00:00:28.550> at<00:00:28.789> being<00:00:28.820> just<00:00:29.330> that<00:00:29.480> we're

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
a good stab at being just that we're

and<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.190> interior<00:00:34.580> but<00:00:34.730> first<00:00:35.030> let's<00:00:35.330> get

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
and the interior but first let's get

and the interior but first let's get
under<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.960> hood

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.759 

once<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.809> lift<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> hood<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.410> Honda

Element you can see the 2.4 liter
4-cylinder<00:00:46.739> engine<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> believe<00:00:47.579> there's

4-cylinder engine now I believe there's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.250 
4-cylinder engine now I believe there's
an<00:00:47.789> increase<00:00:48.089> in<00:00:48.210> horsepower<00:00:48.360> from<00:00:48.780> last<00:00:49.019> year

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.529 
an increase in horsepower from last year
there<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.010> 10<00:00:50.399> horsepower<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.210> last<00:00:51.390> year

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

up<00:00:51.659> to<00:00:51.780> 166<00:00:52.620> horsepower<00:00:53.159> and<00:00:53.280> 161<00:00:54.149> pounds<00:00:54.360> feet

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
up to 166 horsepower and 161 pounds feet

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.149 
up to 166 horsepower and 161 pounds feet
of<00:00:54.750> torque<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:55.469> importantly<00:00:55.949> than<00:00:56.129> that

of torque more importantly than that

of torque more importantly than that
power<00:00:56.579> increase<00:00:57.089> is<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.659> real-time

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
power increase is the real-time

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
power increase is the real-time
four-wheel<00:00:58.680> drive<00:00:58.949> system<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.790> ability

we've<00:01:02.159> talked<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:03.089> how<00:01:03.239> this

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
we've talked a little bit about how this

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.299 
we've talked a little bit about how this
field<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.960> utilitarian<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
field can be utilitarian to the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
field can be utilitarian to the
potential<00:01:05.790> buyer<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> reality<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.440> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
potential buyer but the reality of it is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.889 
potential buyer but the reality of it is
it's<00:01:07.770> not<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.789> rock<00:01:09.210> crawler<00:01:09.539> it

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
it's not going to be a rock crawler it

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.870 
it's not going to be a rock crawler it
can<00:01:10.229> though<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.310> mountain<00:01:11.640> with

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
can though go up to the mountain with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.219 
can though go up to the mountain with
the<00:01:12.149> confidence<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.899> get<00:01:13.080> through

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the confidence that you can get through

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.749 
the confidence that you can get through
the<00:01:13.350> snow<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:13.740> maybe<00:01:13.860> down<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.190> slight<00:01:14.490> fire

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
route to do some camping and we'll get

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960 
route to do some camping and we'll get
to<00:01:16.649> a<00:01:16.679> little<00:01:16.890> bit<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.399> that<00:01:17.429> when<00:01:17.940> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
to a little bit more of that when it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
to a little bit more of that when it
comes<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.390> interior<00:01:18.929> and<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.200> can

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
comes to the interior and how you can

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
comes to the interior and how you can
use<00:01:19.679> that<00:01:19.890> space<00:01:20.280> four-wheel<00:01:21.240> anti-lock

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
use that space four-wheel anti-lock

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
use that space four-wheel anti-lock

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.149 
car planted and poised on the road it
really<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> nice<00:01:28.110> dichotomy<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
really is a nice dichotomy of how the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.130 
really is a nice dichotomy of how the
fact<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.880> drives<00:01:30.330> like<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> small<00:01:31.020> little

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
fact that it drives like a small little

four-wheel drive technology from the CRV

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.940 
four-wheel drive technology from the CRV
but<00:01:36.270> yet<00:01:36.450> has<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> big<00:01:37.200> back<00:01:37.440> end<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.800> be<00:01:37.890> able
