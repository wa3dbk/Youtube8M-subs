00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.970 
winter namm 2011 basically what we did
is<00:00:08.670> we<00:00:08.700> completely<00:00:09.360> redesign<00:00:10.290> torque

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
is we completely redesign torque

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.310 
is we completely redesign torque
software<00:00:11.429> from<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> ground<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:13.110> now

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
software from the ground up it's now

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070 
software from the ground up it's now
built<00:00:13.679> by<00:00:13.980> our<00:00:14.340> by<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.000> former<00:00:15.480> digidesign

transfuser now that's the team that's
building<00:00:25.830> torn<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> basically<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.750> pretty

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
building torn so basically we pretty

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.169 
building torn so basically we pretty
much<00:00:28.019> tore<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.160> built<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.789> back<00:00:29.939> up

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
much tore it up and and built it back up

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.049 
much tore it up and and built it back up
scratch<00:00:31.040> torque<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.399> four<00:00:32.759> decks

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
scratch torque now has four decks

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.750 
scratch torque now has four decks
previously<00:00:33.930> torque<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.350> two<00:00:34.530> decks<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.070> now

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
previously torque at two decks so now

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
previously torque at two decks so now
you<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.000> four<00:00:36.210> decks<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.290> no<00:00:37.380> more

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you have four decks for you no more

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.619 
you have four decks for you no more
possibilities<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:39.030> layering<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
possibilities for for layering and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.440 
possibilities for for layering and
trading<00:00:39.989> more<00:00:40.140> complex<00:00:40.649> mixes

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
trading more complex mixes

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750 
trading more complex mixes
we've<00:00:42.960> also<00:00:43.140> rebuilt<00:00:43.740> the<00:00:43.860> browser<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.580> it's

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
we've also rebuilt the browser so it's

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 
we've also rebuilt the browser so it's
easier<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.480> navigate<00:00:46.200> through<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.740> tracks

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
easier to navigate through your tracks

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.610 
easier to navigate through your tracks
we've<00:00:47.970> added<00:00:48.150> a<00:00:48.330> crates<00:00:48.810> feature<00:00:49.140> which<00:00:49.590> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
we've added a crates feature which is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.560 
we've added a crates feature which is
great<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:49.980> organizing<00:00:50.730> your<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:51.420> new

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
new feature called track more which

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.870 
new feature called track more which
basically<00:01:27.330> applies<00:01:28.100> effects<00:01:29.100> automatically

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
basically applies effects automatically

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.359 
basically applies effects automatically
as<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.119> cross<00:01:30.390> fade<00:01:30.780> between<00:01:31.320> tracks<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.220> it's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
as you cross fade between tracks so it's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.999 
as you cross fade between tracks so it's
got<00:01:32.550> paid<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:33.420> its<00:01:34.380> got<00:01:34.470> effects<00:01:34.800> like

so<00:01:47.729> torque<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.180> point<00:01:48.390> o<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> available

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
so torque to point o is available

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.130 
so torque to point o is available
immediately<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> 30-day<00:01:50.539> trial<00:01:51.539> it's<00:01:51.930> like

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
immediately for a 30-day trial it's like

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.679 
immediately for a 30-day trial it's like
kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.469> preview<00:01:52.890> version<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.420> fully

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689

okay<00:02:09.459> another<00:02:10.239> thing<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.539> did<00:02:10.810> with<00:02:10.929> torque<00:02:11.230> to

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
okay another thing we did with torque to

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.860 
okay another thing we did with torque to
point<00:02:11.680> o<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:12.249> opened<00:02:12.609> it<00:02:12.700> up<00:02:12.819> so<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.629> can

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
point o is we opened it up so you can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.830 
point o is we opened it up so you can
use<00:02:14.170> not<00:02:14.560> only<00:02:14.590> m<00:02:15.129> audio<00:02:15.430> DJ<00:02:16.209> hardware<00:02:16.659> but

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
use not only m audio DJ hardware but

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.360 
use not only m audio DJ hardware but
also<00:02:16.959> DJ<00:02:17.409> hardware<00:02:17.829> from<00:02:17.950> other<00:02:18.159> companies

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
also DJ hardware from other companies

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.069 
also DJ hardware from other companies
like<00:02:18.819> for<00:02:19.030> example<00:02:19.090> right<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:19.540> we're<00:02:19.810> using<00:02:19.930> a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
like for example right now we're using a

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.339 
like for example right now we're using a
vestax<00:02:20.469> vci<00:02:20.650> 300<00:02:21.510> along<00:02:22.510> with<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.749> exponent

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
vestax vci 300 along with the exponent

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.259 
vestax vci 300 along with the exponent
to<00:02:23.590> control<00:02:23.950> torque<00:02:24.249> so<00:02:24.999> that<00:02:25.180> gives

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
to control torque so that gives

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.059 
to control torque so that gives
customers<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.900> know<00:02:26.019> more<00:02:26.200> flexibility<00:02:26.829> to

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
customers you know more flexibility to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.979 
customers you know more flexibility to
use<00:02:27.099> whatever<00:02:27.639> Hardware<00:02:27.969> they<00:02:28.180> want<00:02:28.389> you<00:02:28.870> can

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
use whatever Hardware they want you can

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.080 
use whatever Hardware they want you can
also<00:02:29.109> use<00:02:29.260> torque<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.859> point<00:02:30.099> o<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.790> laptop

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
also use torque to point o on a laptop

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.199 
also use torque to point o on a laptop
with<00:02:31.359> no<00:02:31.719> hardware<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.889> you<00:02:33.519> know<00:02:33.609> kind<00:02:34.150> of

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
with no hardware so you know kind of

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.520 
with no hardware so you know kind of
something<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.599> started<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:34.989> pro<00:02:35.169> tools<00:02:35.200> 9
