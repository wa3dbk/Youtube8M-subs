00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.330
 hello very good everyone here your friend tl 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.010
 2b this time bringing the analyzes to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.230
 of the main video games of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.690
 Godzilla of the old school such as 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.150
 godzilla monsters of monsters godzilla 2 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.150
 war of the monsters superbowl row and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.220
 gods irak help and make it so that for 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.870
 start we'll talk about godzilla monsters 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.940
 of monsters 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.800
 godzilla monsters 2 monsters I think 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 it was the first bot game and it has 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.719
 launched for the nes on which it is based 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.519
 in going from point to point 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.550
 eliminating or destroying all 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.070
 enemies on the screen when you start 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.290
 choose godzilla or another and so go 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.140
 advancing in a kind of hexagons to 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.390
 through a map if you choose godzilla 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.339
 you will have the possibility to kick and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 blows to different enemies in 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.840
 screen which after a while 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.729
 they will become quite annoying because 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.830
 the gameplay of the game is not very good 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.950
 causing it to become quite tedious 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.170
 move around the map and if you choose another 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.240
 in my opinion it is somewhat easier since 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.149
 how it is flying you can dodge some 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.310
 enemies but even if you avoid some not 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.590
 You can dodge everyone and when they give you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 motta RosÃ³n a simple fall to the ground and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 you will not be able to advance for a few seconds 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.620
 what I find horrible 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 also as you progress through the 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.330
 hexagons that represent the map you can 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.490
 meet with other monsters for 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.790
 example in the first phase that you can 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.650
 face manager or moguer and it's here 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.900
 where poor playability becomes greater 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.150
 emphasis since sometimes bots and the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.190
 another move very slowly or that the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.690
 hits and attacks from your monster are very 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.960
 weak while the text to 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.090
 speakers are very fast the game has 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
 with 8 monsters apart from godzilla in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.550
 another which are bosses now moguer to 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.070
 Aragon so that dora fall wick got 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.470
 chair and quin and dora which the latter 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.270
 He is the final boss of the game but as I am 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.180
 a book with godzilla games 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.010
 I went through the battle with moguer so 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.140
 we can say that godzilla monsters or 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.360
 monsters is not a bad game but 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.130
 not perfect either, so I think if 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.550
 you're a golf fan if you should give it to her 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.900
 an opportunity to see what you think 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.000
 continue with what would be the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.790
 sequel to godzilla monsters of monsters 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.920
 osea godzilla 2 war of the monsters 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.200
 also launched for the nes 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.330
 here the style of game is changed 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.670
 completely to an essence of game of 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.770
 strategy where you control the army and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.590
 so prevent the monsters from advancing and 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.349
 destroy the city I at the moment of 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.420
 play it practically I stayed wardak already 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.150
 I did not know what to do, I only saw one 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.430
 lots of little houses 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.970
 besides a monsters he claimed to be 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.590
 they roll and I did not know what to do anymore so 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.600
 I went to see a guide or gameplay on 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.700
 youtube where I saw that effectively 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.190
 you had to create an army to attack 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.200
 to the monsters but after creating it 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.360
 I did not know what to do or 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.209
 I even knew how to move them so 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.310
 no longer play anymore and contrary to 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.440
 previous game of I do not recommend them 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.360
 If you want, you can download it so that 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.740
 they play it but I did not like it for 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.870
 nothing 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.530
 now if we compare this game with the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.300
 next I think I prefer this 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.430
 godzilla for the original game boy is a 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.840
 puzzle type game where the row is 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.820
 find in a world where there 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.160
 giant vines that incredibly 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.440
 godzilla knows how to climb in addition to the 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.180
 appearance of monsters never seen before 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.580
 to pursue awards and during the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.180
 scenario and that will not be destroyed with your 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.590
 mighty and giant box glove 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.450
 obviously this game has nothing to 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.310
 see with godzilla and what could they give him 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.100
 another name because as a game of 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.530
 Pocket is scary I thought 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.660
 boring and foolish so I did not play it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.600
 for more than 10 minutes so I do not know 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.000
 I recommend them the next game is the 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.030
 super godzilla this time being thrown 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.550
 for the super nintendo where playing it 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.560
 the screen is divided in two leaving 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.540
 the bottom part a map that shows you 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.970
 where you are progressing and the one above 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.940
 shows godzilla and his stage by 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.950
 where you are walking here you can advance 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.930
 quote freely around the map 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.250
 but as you go forward and destroy 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.650
 buildings 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.720
 and the low so you'll have to look 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.480
 to a kind of nuclear plant so that 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.160
 it recharges as you go forward 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.050
 meet with tanks or others 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.210
 monsters that will lower your points 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.150
 health and it is in the latter where 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.950
 opens a kind of fight battle is 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.530
 here where the entertaining part starts 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.450
 of the game since you can face the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.580
 another monster like you did in godzilla 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.650
 monsters ghost monsters in fact I think 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.480
 that looks a lot like this since at 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.030
 you walk by a map and you 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.400
 you find monsters 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.500
 me personally when facing king 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.419
 vidor this one made me shit because I do not know 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.700
 if it's me or is it the game because I 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.560
 It was super difficult because I did not book 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.050
 I stopped making a kind of attack 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.180
 special that I lost a lot of life and how 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.700
 I already said I'm a bug in games 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.220
 godzilla I never knew how to get his attack 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.470
 godzilla special just knew how to give 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.550
 hits and kicks so here and dora me 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.800
 defeated 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.870
 now I understand that in this game 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.360
 two of the favorite monsters appear 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.670
 of many I mean bagan ya super 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.590
 godzilla which I would like to see in 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.960
 the big screen since the truth is not 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.790
 I think I can defeat kiwi dora so 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.830
 I ask the great connoisseurs of 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.750
 this game give me some advice or 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.270
 something like that to be able to spend 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.100
 this game and for this I can not say 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.850
 a lot of this game but what they do 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.140
 I can assure you it is super difficult 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.480
 continuing we'll talk about godzilla that 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.600
 judge and that has been released only in 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.220
 japan for the super famicom this is a 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.770
 typical game of fights in two 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.930
 dimensions but clear with monsters 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.140
 among which you can choose godzilla 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.710
 or another fall mega long antivirus wick 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.810
 godzilla kiwi dora and violante this to me 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.970
 it seems it's the best mozilla game of 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.800
 the old school since it owns better 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.770
 playability than titles before 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.990
 mentioned here in addition to being able to give 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.450
 hits and kicks you can grab your 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.520
 enemies and launch them a special attack 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.780
 of energy as the atomic breath of 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.210
 godzilla 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.100
 the difficulty increases as you go 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.410
 advancing to get against wick 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.600
 godzilla 2 who is the final boss besides 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.840
 that every monster has its stage 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.430
 and his music so I that is the best 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.760
 box game and those already mentioned 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.040
 and that I recommend them and for 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.110
 we'll make a big jump up 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.320
 gods and domination for the game boy 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.570
 advance here you can choose between six 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.340
 characters with which you will have the 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.090
 possibility to fight against your opponent 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.010
 or destroy the city if you wish and so 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.770
 advancing it until you get to the boss 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.419
 which is quin wick and now the game I 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.820
 it seemed quite entertaining and 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:05.460
 I honestly do not see any hits as well 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.560
 that I recommend in conclusion 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.540
 we can say that video games are not 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.910
 a very strong point in the universe of 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.280
 godzilla since these games are not very 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.290
 good that we say but still being 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.020
 farm fans we will give you a 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.330
 opportunity so with this we end up 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.400
 with this analysis soon comes the 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.760
 analysis to other godzilla games 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.190
 and of course many reviews 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.440
 now I take this opportunity to thank the 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.890
