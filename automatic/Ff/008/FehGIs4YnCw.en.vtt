00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 welcome to my new movie 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.839
 I'll show you the progress of today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.090
 a rabbit 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.830
 this is red 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.210
 New Zealand and as you can see 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.910
 Actually, everything started with the s box 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.119
 in the other video I already have 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.939
 turned and here we are already at 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.460
 day 5 and the nest has changed in time 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.700
 from day five to 14 actually relative 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.989
 I'm trying very hard here 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.520
 to catch a first glimpse 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.980
 what am I really succeeded 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 I did not want too much of the nest 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.149
 and that's why I have 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 closed again relatively quickly 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.940
 At the time, the girls were still 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.309
 blind and really had only light 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.510
 fell and we actually had the whole 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 time very cold temperatures 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.670
 so at night minus degrees with that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.049
 fiercest I think was also a day 9 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.640
 with minus 7 degrees 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.240
 and yes, you can already see a little bit here 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 More so at day new are complete 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 at least that affects the notes 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.890
 Unterfell is completely present and the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.890
 eyes are still closed 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.510
 At the time I did not know either 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.580
 how many are I had tried too 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.750
 counted had counted five a day 12 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.070
 but then I realized that 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.530
 it is not five but 71 while directly at 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.290
 the birth dead and lay next to the nest 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:46.490
 and these seven have everything 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.260
 now survives so you see on day 12 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.490
 most had their eyes 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.980
 opened I had checked again 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.870
 and there were one or two doing that 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.770
 an encrusted or closed that 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.630
 still had eye 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.740
 then I have it easy with one 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.070
 wet warm cloth about weight and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.060
 the next day it was time that 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.100
 actually all eyes open 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.420
 had 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.070
 as you can see the nest has now 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.650
 also changed so much I always have 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.330
 again fresh hay yielded and the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.150
 electricity not directly to the next but 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.660
 take it and then the hessen has it 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.060
 always not well distributed 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.290
 but that day 14 actually all 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.390
 the eyes open 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.320
 one sees on the left his belly is even 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.630
 sometimes lies and in the day it was 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.060
 now at the time of the five degrees 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.470
 but it really makes the little one 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.110
 nothing turns on really all 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.640
 very healthy from here you can see that too 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.180
 would be really active and 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.660
 Tried trying on the buttons too 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.890
 but the hesse but that 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.890
 apparently rabbits they really only 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.750
 At night, you do not hear anything 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.490
 because the sound broke on my camera 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.200
 That's why I have to do that now 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.070
 discuss video later 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.840
 I hope it does not matter but you 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.880
 It can be relatively good developments 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.980
 see who has done here here 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.180
 are just tracks repeatedly 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.920
 I have the feeling that the little ones 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.069
 already nibbling something already 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.849
 at least loyal and I hope it again 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.870
 failed 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.870
 take care
