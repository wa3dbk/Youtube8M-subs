I'm actually having a great time in the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.310 
I'm actually having a great time in the
gym<00:00:55.309> but<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> post<00:00:57.059> these<00:00:57.300> workout<00:00:57.809> videos

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
gym but when I post these workout videos

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.180 
gym but when I post these workout videos
I<00:00:58.710> cannot<00:00:59.430> show<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.820> each<00:01:00.660> pyramid<00:01:01.289> said<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
I cannot show you each pyramid said I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.939 
I cannot show you each pyramid said I
can't<00:01:02.520> show<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.789> set<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.480> set<00:01:03.719> rep<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.739> rep

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.190 
can't show you set for set rep for rep
and<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.640> reason<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.659> make<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> video

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and the reason is it will make the video
