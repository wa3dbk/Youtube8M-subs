00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.580
 amsterdam arena against ajax the arnhemmers 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.809
 travel by almost fit selection off 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
 to the capital 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.920
 also with club top scorer lucas piazon 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.780
 against that last week 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.760
 noordwijk still was absent due 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.820
 a slight injury protection 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.000
 surround pray pain but what holds 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.580
 this sees someone shot at when i provided 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.590
 to the end and fill in our 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.960
 He falls well so that I have a duty 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 okay play against ajax 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.300
 it becomes what the backup becomes where that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.329
 thick bottom at a finger be websites with 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.239
 your course of responses to the 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.850
 in clubs in Hall and in europa 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 but i'm out and doing business gujjar 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 been a greek and we can compete with 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 them in in ajax ajax has it on 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 now one point more than vitesse 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.039
 they share the lead with FC Twente 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.039
 the Premier League are still in the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 Amsterdammers not in all grand form 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.969
 last week they still stuff at home with 0 0 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.199
 equal to rkc waalwijk and a few 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.930
 days before that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.880
 discharge from cell thick in the champions league 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 yes it is a team who who who 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.610
 the real big one in the finalists 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.020
 lacks 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.280
 with eriks is a whole 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.060
 major player before they left 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.009
 in midfield 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.170
 There are now guys who like that a lot 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 play ball possession and that is also excellent 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.970
 do you consistently good footballers 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.840
 at the end 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.430
 it is only less yes less 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.229
 unpredictable 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.970
 They played for example 004 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.170
 rkc you can of course always have one 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.700
 happen once but it seems none 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 incident 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.090
 I hope it is no incident 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.530
 do not easier to plow 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.119
 if you are so massive on your own half 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.259
 retreats 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.079
 to counter those openings 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.119
 find and there had to ice and water 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.590
 there are many perspectives seemed my 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.180
 yes of course but eventually as 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.920
 just do it yourself can say 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.329
 every team in the earlier figure has a timer 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 just an excellent team with 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.180
 quality 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.670
 and I think if we are definitely in this phase now 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.590
 also with ajax o's 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.360
 level make it an easy with you 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.250
 easy that we can win at ajax 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.899
 marko vejinovic has the last few 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.430
 matches a base place in it 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.049
 team of peter forest 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.690
 before that he had to rely on 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.729
 a few raids 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.260
 something final starts more and more its turn 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.670
 to be found in the team 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.930
 yes that is also true and natural for it 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.050
 getting used to it was the first 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.000
 months and the bacon 11 then the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.440
 first off was a bit difficult and me 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.240
 I still feel better and better and better 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.550
 wider what they become more and more than 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.260
 and also the players 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.000
 work on so adjusted it well 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.160
 indeed better and better 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.410
 last season, vitesse won twice 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.050
 ajax in the amsterdam arena where the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.790
 arnhemmers with 2 0 too strong and everywhere 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.060
 that match was for wilfried 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.060
 bony 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.930
 not finished and there poly this looks like who 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.930
 must give 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.010
 just wonderful para this dangerous 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.770
 to the goalie 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.720
 thank you tomorrow ajax and stairs 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.470
 vitesse at a quarter to seven in the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.470
 Amsterdam arena
