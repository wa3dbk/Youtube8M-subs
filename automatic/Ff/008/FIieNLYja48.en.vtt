00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.750 
and then some slight hints of hint of
woods<00:00:54.559> which<00:00:54.829> causes<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:55.370> down<00:00:55.610> a<00:00:55.640> little

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760

a<00:00:57.470> little<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.760> Mandarin<00:00:59.180> does<00:00:59.360> only<00:00:59.629> last<00:00:59.899> for

a little the Mandarin does only last for
a<00:01:00.140> few<00:01:00.170> minutes<00:01:00.559> but<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.829> lasts<00:01:01.070> long<00:01:01.280> enough

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
a few minutes but it lasts long enough

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.320 
a few minutes but it lasts long enough
to<00:01:01.610> kind<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:01.820> solve<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.089> fragrance<00:01:02.830> but<00:01:03.830> I<00:01:04.489> also

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
to kind of solve a fragrance but I also

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.270 
to kind of solve a fragrance but I also
do<00:01:05.659> smell<00:01:05.930> some<00:01:06.110> kind<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.320> unrecognizable

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
do smell some kind of unrecognizable

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.359 
do smell some kind of unrecognizable
fruity<00:01:08.060> notes<00:01:08.299> I<00:01:08.600> think<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.170> might<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.409> pear<00:01:09.979> or

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
fruity notes I think it might be pear or

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.780 
fruity notes I think it might be pear or
something<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:11.689> don't<00:01:11.810> know<00:01:11.990> also<00:01:12.710> I<00:01:12.979> do<00:01:13.280> smell

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
something I don't know also I do smell

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.719 
something I don't know also I do smell
some<00:01:14.240> florals<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:15.500> there<00:01:15.740> not<00:01:16.159> sure<00:01:16.369> what<00:01:16.580> they

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
some florals in there not sure what they

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.249 
some florals in there not sure what they
are<00:01:16.759> it's<00:01:17.270> kind<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.509> frustrating<00:01:17.689> I<00:01:18.020> can't

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
are it's kind of frustrating I can't

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.710 
are it's kind of frustrating I can't
really<00:01:18.439> tell<00:01:18.710> what<00:01:19.040> things<00:01:19.850> are<00:01:20.150> in<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:20.479> but

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
really tell what things are in this but

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.969 
really tell what things are in this but
I<00:01:20.750> think<00:01:21.080> that's<00:01:21.229> probably<00:01:21.500> just<00:01:21.590> because<00:01:21.890> it

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
I think that's probably just because it

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.010 
I think that's probably just because it
is<00:01:22.100> synthetic<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:22.700> most<00:01:23.299> likely<00:01:23.570> some<00:01:23.750> pear

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
is synthetic but most likely some pear

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.310 
is synthetic but most likely some pear
and<00:01:24.400> some<00:01:25.400> synthetic<00:01:26.020> florals<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:27.170> there

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
and some synthetic florals in there

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.920 
and some synthetic florals in there
which<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.650> not<00:01:27.890> bad<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:30.549> do<00:01:31.549> get<00:01:32.299> kind<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.689> like<00:01:32.869> a
