00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to my shears but this time we use a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.620 
to my shears but this time we use a
difference<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.910> we<00:01:05.910> have<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.240> thinning

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
difference here we have our thinning

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.930 
difference here we have our thinning
shears<00:01:06.960> those<00:01:07.800> are<00:01:08.040> shares<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.730> teeth

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
shears those are shares with the teeth

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.390 
shears those are shares with the teeth
missing<00:01:09.360> out<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.660> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.740> pick<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> hair

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
missing out of it you can pick this hair

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.570 
missing out of it you can pick this hair
up<00:01:11.960> what<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.110> call<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:14.010> into<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
up what you call go right into it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.570 
up what you call go right into it
and<00:01:14.760> cut<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.860> don't<00:01:17.010> have<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.340> afraid

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
and cut and you don't have to be afraid

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.070 
and cut and you don't have to be afraid
to<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:17.940> because<00:01:18.300> it's<00:01:18.480> not<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> cut

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to just because it's not going to cut

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.500 
to just because it's not going to cut
the<00:01:19.200> hair<00:01:19.380> off<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.210> go

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
the hair off what it's going to do is go

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.870 
the hair off what it's going to do is go
in<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.750> thin<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> blend

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
in and thin it here so they have a blend

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770 
in and thin it here so they have a blend
and<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> hair<00:01:24.810> down<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.760> okay<00:01:26.760> keep<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and to the hair down here okay keep it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.770 
and to the hair down here okay keep it
clean<00:01:28.050> pick<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.659> everything<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
clean pick it up and out everything is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.870 
clean pick it up and out everything is
up<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.260> and<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.979> chop<00:01:32.190> into<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.700> hair

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
up and out and just chop into that hair

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.280 
up and out and just chop into that hair
like<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:35.930> this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.320> thinning<00:01:37.680> shear

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
like that this is your thinning shear

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.040 
like that this is your thinning shear
okay<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.700> then<00:01:41.700> you've<00:01:41.850> seen<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.120> blend<00:01:42.479> now

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
okay and then you've seen a blend now

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.380 
okay and then you've seen a blend now
this<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> another<00:01:44.280> technique<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.330> use

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this is another technique you can use

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.570 
this is another technique you can use
sometimes<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.350> like

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.940 

see<00:01:51.580> their<00:01:51.760> hairs<00:01:52.750> blending<00:01:53.230> kind<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:53.800> took

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
see their hairs blending kind of took

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.840 
see their hairs blending kind of took
some<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.280> weight<00:01:54.430> out<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.430> go

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
some of the weight out here we go

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.470 
some of the weight out here we go
take<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.840> number<00:01:59.080> three<00:01:59.320> guard<00:01:59.530> once<00:01:59.770> again

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
take the number three guard once again

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.760 
take the number three guard once again
and<00:02:01.480> come<00:02:01.900> up<00:02:03.630> now<00:02:04.630> I'm<00:02:04.960> going<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.470> little
