00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.350

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.130
 I would like to introduce you to stretch 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.580
 To today 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:24.369
 I think I've done stretching so far but this time 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:28.750
 The real may also need to use it you will this time tells these things 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:34.390
 I would like to use this balance ball , so by making this balance ball 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.970
 Other than Sutoreshi when it is a little you are a self-stretch Well one person usually Te 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.350
 Such pattern 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:44.030
 By using these little props in the passball , you get more muscle. 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.720
 Hey I think you have made it possible to extend would like to introduce you it is also it 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.699
 I'm sorry 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:56.140
 I think that I want to do chest stretch this time 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.140
 The first N buzz in is if I have put this balance in the transverse 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:07.370
 We bend the elbow to 90 degrees in to check that the wearing dough in this state next to your chest 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.790
 I will apply 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:16.170
 This is positive 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.170
 The other part is the center of my body, and the lower part is Miya and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.560
 Crowded into by screwing 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:27.220
 By doing so, the chest muscles are now 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.620
 I'm saying this day, but at that time it's a bit 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 lightly 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.550
 A little shake Well 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.480
 A little more than a little school 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:44.790
 Muscles will also look back at 50,000 yen so it's blurry to do this now 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.120
 We become muscle of the place a little larger best referred to in it is the central part chest 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.970
 In the next 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:57.890
 The angle of the fabric is just this 90 degrees just for a moment with the ball down 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:03.350
 But 90's has been lowered to the bottom Hey hey is the angle of the support I remain, such'm 90 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.520
 The upper part of the chest is stretched by stretching in this state 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.180
 By masu the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.729
 In this state as it is 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.720
 That car 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.720
 I will continue 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.440
 The following is keep if I have you on a little angle of the elbow is placed on top of this balance ball 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.710

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.880

 Go slowly is it that force with the feeling enters to say that one When you have finished better Well I is this 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.140
 Since there is no 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.730
 If it is possible, it will be already slowly in about 10 seconds, so it will take about 15 seconds 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.879
 Tightly 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:04.569
 If you stretch each part and let me do it, I will stretch a normal ship 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.170
 All means because very easy to do than when you stretch I'm a little awkward 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.750
 is not it 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:13.580
 Please try using the balance ball 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:17.360
 By the way, it is by all means before and after exercise 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.670
 And it does not might be really good or a Furamari this Toka before going to bed 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.040
 Each of them 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.599
 The Tteyuu Stretch of this now in the chest 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:33.120
 Let's go now if you are working with a personal computer at desk work 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:37.390
 Smart phones and anti-still all I'd likely all Toka fool kimono frozen 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:42.280
