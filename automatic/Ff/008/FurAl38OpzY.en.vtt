the<00:01:44.729> kool-aid<00:01:45.000> from<00:01:45.240> all<00:01:45.390> over<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.939> it's<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the kool-aid from all over so it's so

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.319 
the kool-aid from all over so it's so
much<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:48.990> than<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> spa<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.490> me<00:01:50.640> it's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
much more than a spa and for me it's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
much more than a spa and for me it's
probably<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> best<00:01:51.960> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.530> spa<00:01:52.740> because

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
probably the best kind of a spa because

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460 
probably the best kind of a spa because
I'm<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> good<00:01:53.810> lie<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> beach<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.409> just

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I'm not a good lie on the beach and just

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.490 
I'm not a good lie on the beach and just
