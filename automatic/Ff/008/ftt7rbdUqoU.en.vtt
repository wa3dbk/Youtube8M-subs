00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.080
 hello and today we find ourselves 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 for the episode a kaiser health capsule 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.650
 because she had killed an agent done 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.300
 rather heresy well the killer who 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.470
 want to ask why rather well 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.640
 it's really knowing but I have not 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 inspiration to show the results 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
 melodies because my choice no but 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.570
 just to cook what will leave me 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.800
 the places and because here and I have a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.880
 project representing luggage and the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.349
 decide when I have something to you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.660
 present all the russian saint 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.860
 venerable too fast but I'm going when 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 not even too much and to include ranges 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.640
 only a little more a baby when I am 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 just because we can really after 61 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 cases on two jesters 2 and in my 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.410
 videos because I think that 's me 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 leave me too now I would like 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.530
 we love either by words but it's me 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.739
 as I was I do not require a leader 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 it's not fair because three students 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.489
 but today we will talk about a ferry 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 all too much so back to school be 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.440
 servant unfortunately my way and I 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.719
 shows four of the lodges because five 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.840
 young people I did not find for the fifth 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.400
 for the 5th of January then decided 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.010
 just after when it 's just not 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.520
 stick to banks 68 points against 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.750
 to them and especially bob of heaven in your 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 first is a salad with irony 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.130
 that I will take my worries 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.890
 by the way really I already have them 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.900
 presented but I believe that at worst far 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.560
 that I show how to do because I 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.210
 was expecting me to show that I 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.930
 showed it's our fate like this 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.580
 of information the state can not agree so 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.710
 I 'm going to get the ticket for helping 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.010
 to take a little too much I'll go 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.090
 also show a player has time if 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.890
 never that with spring rolls 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.320
 is really my heart I did not think 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.420
 made for lodges because you do not have 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.070
 not a lot who knows what you have 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 Macaroni is a step forward and 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.330
 I find that a salary but this is 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.920
 not like all the knowledge and effect 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 I hope they know how to appreciate if 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.830
 you never try to be seriously 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.290
 tinsel to even share it be 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.360
 on the facebook or instagram have 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.810
 identified then I leave you with 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.810
 the video 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.590
 so for my pasta salad instead of 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.049
 take some normal macaroni I took 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.670
 macaroni made of quinoa and then I 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.799
 really liked that so it's a must 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.019
 maybe a little more health at mac os 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.579
 macaroni is normal then for my 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.230
 source it's very simple what is that 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.849
 I do it's half-and-half cream sour 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.799
 and mayonnaise here I use 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.469
 the Aveyronnaise it's just the mayo 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.060
 vegetarian there I put too much cooked to 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.219
 the table of each country a spoon to 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.750
 mustard table in the normal term I 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:41.980
 find it's really a good month of 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.900
 taxes finds negro and personally 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.310
 but it goes from macaroni then I 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.579
 add my favorite vegetables so there 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.879
 I had radishes and carrots 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.859
 celery I also bought green onion from 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.199
 desert at the tuna cockpit I like 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.099
 that there are a lot of things in it 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.659
 I really like it was falling on 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.829
 crispy vegetables allowing 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.689
 hobbies the tone I find it gives 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.040
 really good taste if I had them 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.639
 small cubes of cheese also handle but 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.949
 sanaa m 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.299
 with the gemmi sauce as you have 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.530
 seeing that I finish with by then you 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.469
 look too much that it really comes 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.750
 give a good little hitch that pepper well 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.949
 heard a real thing but we'll see 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.479
 then seriously it's so good 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.919
 macaroni launcher me I will eat on 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:20.620
 every day it's really 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:22.449
 underestimated it looks like we're thinking about 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.799
 christmas party of the 90s case but 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.689
 it's super good, it's really good 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.079
 broke the past one night in the 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.849
 fridge 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.560
 I will be very honest with you 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.449
 word I was reborn in the insalan not even 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.790
 24 hours all because it was too much 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:37.000
 good so that's it for the first class 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.530
 so not the second one is a wise 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.139
 Greek in a pot that would escape as 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.370
 on the meshrep or too much how to call it 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.689
 so that I started by putting 10 who 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.489
 drown in the bottom of my pot masson 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.840
 because of quesnoy you know this is 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.120
 really one but preferred criteria 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.099
 then two additions cucumber because 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.659
 that that's it it's part of these 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.290
 salads cucumbers tomatoes onions 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.909
 red 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.500
 so I put small tomatoes 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.449
 cherries like that I like a lot 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.579
 and after that I put red onions 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.319
 MÃ©tis let's you care about 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.969
 your breath after those at school or at 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.379
 office but you can let it go 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.659
 but I did not have school after 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.859
 that I put after that I put 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.629
 weight at I think I'd like 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.519
 a lot chickpeas post if I 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.739
 I'm the only one but it's not bad but 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.750
 favorite legumes I also finish 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.670
 with fatah then I believe everything a 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.710
 reflector half less salt 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.330
 for those interested I like 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.560
 a lot also do it with I like that 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.350
 like that I think it really does 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.520
 beautiful I finish with just cheated we 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.050
 can see I could not help but 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.970
 side because casually I filmed 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.210
 of three hours in my day does it 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.610
 that I miss next with my camera girl 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.800
 so I'm too much olive oil 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.330
 just that the pears then to the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 moment of eating you just have to raimu 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.660
 and primate just like that where to pour it 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.770
 in a pot and that's it you have some 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.770
 really cute salaries 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.900
 this is certainly the recipe 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.190
 simple but oh so delicious I think 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.210
 we can not miss out on slipping 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.590
 when we talk about lunch 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.210
 but please do not like 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.350
 me then take no mini reminded the 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.330
 word is a little it was more how 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.040
 to make tacos but hey that's what 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.450
 I had because it was really too much 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.080
 little bit hard to steal but you 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.520
 have understood 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.500
 what will i be doing price 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.790
 tuna embodies yet again I 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.920
 really a lot about me play a little 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.200
 few jerseys I put too I think 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.910
 just returned from a Thursday to show by 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.130
 example salt and pepper this is already your 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.930
 salad of time then gmi of the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.210
 savatte desjardins country and two big 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.530
 slices of tomatoes with him drops that 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.460
 been so long 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.650
 seriously it's really a good 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.210
 sandwich the hound was pretty juicy 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.460
 thank you I would have to remove more 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.950
 d'auonne I take note 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.510
 but here it is a qui room 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.710
 must-know I would say it's very 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.060
 simple to do is often with 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.160
 things that I already had everything under the 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.270
 hand at home 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.440
 then it really preferred 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.270
 I admit that it may be a little 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.680
 change of others but it's 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.270
 spring rolls since and young 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.590
 Doctors is that it does not take much 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.720
 of things for the child really 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.190
 a lot local ideal I confess it's 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.690
 to really put the rice leaf on 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.370
 a wet cloth on a wooden plate 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.410
 but I had more diet is 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.070
 clean and that I put in a try 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.260
 but in short 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.490
 so here is my rice leaf I put in 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.080
 the salad then really everything but when 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.550
 my favorite vegetables of your choice 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.560
 could put chicken shrimp 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.450
 also and I did 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.130
 vegetarian what you complete with 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.900
 rice noodles I put a 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.760
 little wax and cats also at home 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.260
 not too much how to tell the wind then 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.910
 then we just folded them it is especially 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.860
 what I want to show you need the mother 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.540
 was just laughing at many jesus 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.910
 took shape and but we have to fold the 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.380
 sides and then we come the rolled in 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.410
 his ranks still strong I would like 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.290
 not that sean master in the field of 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.510
 roll rolling but it is not serious 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.880
 it's an excellent all the same 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.110
 so here I am, I like that but the 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.070
 coriander in the good because I 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.780
 find it beautiful what is it doing there 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.610
 what they do too is from 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.460
 to do too much and then it calmed down but 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.810
 his strike is a master this because some 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.700
 thing that you can do right like me 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.980
 I did with my friend 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.110
 soak the leaves and both of 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.760
 rice it's really not suspended nor 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.900
 the rice noodles worse after really 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.000
 not a lot of vegetables for finally 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.100
 many can also take all 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.600
 vegetables that you want me I find that 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.490
 especially good with joints of 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.660
 carrots cocoon then avocados 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.850
 the salad too 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.780
 and coriander budding grass that 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.020
 I like that I like to put it on 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.840
 in 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.210
 then the lawyers of course also made 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.920
 that this is true I think I understand 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.570
 but not to do it but it does not 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.730
 a lot as you saw himself 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.130
 thing I ate in 24 hours because 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.070
 it's just too good and that was 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.840
 everything could the fir 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.880
 ok here that Celine would mean 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.990
 two boxes for their new school 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.250
 it is to present the leash 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.990
 accompaniment that you could reconnect 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.670
 with the postponement but I think this 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.440
 pressure she's always the right pipe 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.830
 for form and death while we 

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.830
 block well to launch but give a 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.720
 dose rest near stable completed and that 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.900
 shared - your photos if ever 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.280
 a country mix I wish you good 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:55.280
 after we will soon be made video on the 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.280
 ball
