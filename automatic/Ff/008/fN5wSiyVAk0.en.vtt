there's also a glass for everyone and
you've<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.329> some<00:00:51.570> examples<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.590> so

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
you've got some examples of that here so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.869 
you've got some examples of that here so
tell<00:00:52.920> us<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.039> we're<00:00:53.280> looking<00:00:53.489> at<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.760> what

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
tell us what we're looking at it so what

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
tell us what we're looking at it so what
we<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.989> core<00:00:55.199> assortments

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
we have here is the core assortments

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
we have here is the core assortments
that<00:00:56.039> people<00:00:56.399> should<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.789> home<00:00:56.940> because

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that people should have at home because

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
that people should have at home because
these<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> four<00:00:58.260> most<00:00:58.559> consumed<00:00:59.160> grape

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
these are the four most consumed grape

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.430 
these are the four most consumed grape
varieties<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.750> cabin<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> glass

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
varieties so we have the cabin a glass

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
varieties so we have the cabin a glass
the<00:01:01.800> Pinot<00:01:02.010> Noir<00:01:02.190> glass<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.180> reasoning

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the Pinot Noir glass the reasoning

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
the Pinot Noir glass the reasoning
gloucestershire<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.470> glass<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.979> obviously

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
gloucestershire on a glass and obviously

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.850 
gloucestershire on a glass and obviously
for<00:01:06.180> special<00:01:06.510> occasion<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.170> champagne<00:01:07.500> flute

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
for special occasion the champagne flute

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
for special occasion the champagne flute
right<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:09.030> depends<00:01:09.479> too<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.930> aroma

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
right and this all depends too on aroma

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.039 
right and this all depends too on aroma
and<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.000> glass<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.390> users<00:01:12.780> in

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and so the glass you users in

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.300 
and so the glass you users in
relationship<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> aroma<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.070> want<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
relationship to the aroma you want to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
relationship to the aroma you want to
feel<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.960> done<00:01:16.170> or

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
feel so what we what we have done or

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.170 
feel so what we what we have done or
what<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.619> family<00:01:17.159> has<00:01:17.250> been<00:01:17.280> doing<00:01:17.640> over<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
what my family has been doing over the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.719 
what my family has been doing over the
last<00:01:18.210> 50<00:01:18.750> years<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.170> we've<00:01:19.320> developed

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
last 50 years is we've developed

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.600 
last 50 years is we've developed
messengers<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.909> wine<00:01:21.090> every<00:01:21.600> glass<00:01:21.810> truly

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
messengers for wine every glass truly

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.039 
messengers for wine every glass truly
carries<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> message<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> grape<00:01:24.630> variety

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
carries the message of the grape variety

enhances the aromas and that's the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
enhances the aromas and that's the
reason<00:01:27.600> why<00:01:27.630> each<00:01:27.900> glass<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> different

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
reason why each glass is a different

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
reason why each glass is a different
shape<00:01:28.979> everything<00:01:29.579> truly<00:01:30.180> tailored<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
shape everything truly tailored to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
shape everything truly tailored to
enhance<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> aromas<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> glass

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
enhance the aromas now this is a glass

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.749 
enhance the aromas now this is a glass
developed<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.720> conjunction<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.470> mr.<00:01:35.460> region

developed in conjunction with mr. region
with<00:01:35.970> region<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.630> region<00:01:36.659> yeah<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.259> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
with region is a region yeah and it's
