00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.779
 this team is still to stop 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.280
 Borussia Fulda also has the topgame in 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.170
 the group league against britannia 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.030
 oak cell with 3 to 1 for itself 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.469
 decided and leads the table with it 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.469
 still unchallenged 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.380
 It was an absolutely worth seeing game in 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.840
 The Johannisau there then prevailed 1500 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 on Friday night anyway one 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.260
 atmosphere like the urban one 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.920
 Stadium has not been for many years 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.920
 has experienced more 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.879
 the borussians mark their followers 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.679
 early with the first goal after five 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.199
 minutes was top scorer imal schersadeh 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.269
 to put the ball completely ripped off 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.859
 Oak Cells keeper Christian Kirbus 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.859
 passed by and einnetzte 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 but the hitherto flawless vest of 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.890
 scw also got one this evening 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.689
 first small spot after just under 20 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.729
 minutes behooved lucas maierhof one 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.770
 flank of martin kriwoschein zum 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.369
 compensation and thus first goal of the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.369
 borussen a 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.040
 two minutes later in the header of 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.140
 mÃ¼ller would have it almost a second time 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.650
 rattled but wolf made himself long and 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.720
 steered the ball class to the corner too 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.200
 against your scratch, wolf explained strongly in 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.200
 highest not 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.640
 Eichenzell played well but the 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 borussia led after 45 minutes because 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.050
 Schirmer standing at the long post 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.560
 measuring edge of wright at the 2 1 directly 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.560
 turned 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.009
 in addition came the 30 meter free kick of 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.009
 Yakin at the post 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.410
 even after the change and the fast 3 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.150
 2 1 by alexander reith clarify 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.900
 counts that one so far with distance 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.670
 strongest enemy of the fuldaer was scratched 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.160
 but can still shorten the borussia 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.330
 had a lot of chances around that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.330
 result still increase 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.930
 for me it is now his trust 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.220
 to raise my team again 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.990
 I think we have the master here 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.080
 seen and now want to congratulate 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.080
 but 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.770
 It's about five teams 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.780
 the ungrateful places 2 to 6 or 27 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.010
 I hope that we belong 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.910
 need to catch us again 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.010
 now start to score again 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.570
 We have to give away points today 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.860
 You can lose against Borussia 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.840
 Of course, unhappy when it happens 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.340
 We scored a goal today against 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.360
 Borussia's first goal got that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.430
 maybe one would have two more 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.810
 may be that again ever as 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.780
 Notice for the competition is 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.260
 possible and 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.050
 click and other land first find what 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.580
 I was relatively tight there was something special 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.020
 been pretty much the same 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.390
 but in the second half has me 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.050
 but still very clear chances 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.459
 alex free kick this single action 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.130
 where the forest comes in the two 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.239
 headballs of roman schad and there would have 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.640
 certainly in the second half 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.130
 but we can go even higher 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.380
 have become six games now 18 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.790
 No one achieved points like that 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.730
 right for possibilities and that's why 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.019
 not that happy that the us 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.019
 that's done so well today
