00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.649
 so come with our moms picture for 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.250
 the million hunters for gymnastics 6 us 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.559
 reduce 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.170
 let's use the shot with us 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.330
 justice that it is our primary 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.369
 hate generation after that, of course 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.590
 splitter arrow for maximum damage 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.789
 as well as the smoke cloud to harm 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.279
 prevent 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.410
 the companion as a little cooldown the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 make once an elite mountain green warmer 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 he comes more missed by many 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.099
 small or scattered enemies too 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.010
 do it and then, of course, in the end 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.440
 still the elementary part of the whole 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 picture and the protected clock of the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.760
 Protected is the combination with 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.460
 our so with the c6 bonuses of the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.460
 marauders and the quiver show 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.289
 we can get you up to five right away 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.539
 protected because synonymous because 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.640
 We as passive without the mass production 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.250
 we also have three possible towers 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.590
 to ask and still archery as well 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.170
 steady hand and easy damage 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.170
 additionally expand and increase 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.560
 and continue s now synonymous with the same 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.179
 our equipment we can see 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.030
 We also set up a list of our own 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:16.909
 you can find it directly in the link under this 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.679
 video you see my weapon has 27 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.329
 ideally one would be with one 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.579
 a little higher the man with it too 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.479
 Shelters are doing more harm now 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.700
 in the quiver 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.189
 that is very important for this 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.500
 picture with more protected towers 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.520
 Can the poor ones seem 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.780
 he does not need any for that now 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.270
 materials should be on each one 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.729
 fall in power for your resources so the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.560
 hate generation replenish after 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.149
 a necklace is quite important 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.729
 Fire is the elemental damage to the 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.590
 effect that he with maximum fire and 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.500
 then of course as a post ash coat 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.569
 To the fire department almost only fire world 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.549
 use the resources cost for it 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:57.469
 reduce and after malik the fire 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.939
 of course, to increase harm and now 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.679
 I want to get into one too 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.390
 At the time of the fight, we would take her back 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.329
 skeleton team damn 6 made 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.340
 this is the ideal time for the demon 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.479
 hunter to demonstrate and speak 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.310
 just be my post and before that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.350
 of course, each of you starts fighting 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.040
 amount of your protected towers so 5 is the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.989
 maximum 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.880
 So sheltered at once protected 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.130
 Protected and then create 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.690
 when the fight really starts 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.350
 he practically only with the splitter 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.480
 arrow 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.760
 as long as enough hate has just up 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.480
 You should pay to shoot at the hasloh 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.989
 would of course take the bus but 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.970
 ideally, that should go out 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.459
 virtually all protected towers for the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.200
 to ensure total damage in this fight 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.970
 as they want after a certain 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.730
 you do not get the time here in this case 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.370
 since the bus came in relatively short time is the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.620
 protected me just so quickly the post 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.209
 put it like that and that would be done and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.739
 Now we jump in quickly again 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.359
 a cave rows as you see how 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.160
 the demon hunter in different 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.540
 Strengthened fighting situations that we now 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.139
 seen how she went about ambow 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.910
 fight 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.709
 and also this principle in the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.079
 protected and the opponent to the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.819
 We can also put on protected curls 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.500
 free area or just in a cave 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.269
 apply and indeed position the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.489
 estimated more close to as possible 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.919
 the opponents and then we lure 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.340
 these out of the hiding place and directly 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.769
 him 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.540
 our protected towers we can see 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.430
 do some image-based here 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.410
 you just always do most of the work and 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.170
 ideally, it simply positioned 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.349
 so that he has the highest possible degradation of 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.970
 the sheltered one has then it is ideal 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.650
 to play with the demon hunter and also 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.150
 to catch so i hope the video has 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.390
 you very much like there is a thumb 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.000
 high 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.900
 and there should be any question 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.849
 Just imagine in the comments 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.440
 We will get back to you as soon as possible 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.940
 Thank you very much for 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.940
 attention and see you next time
