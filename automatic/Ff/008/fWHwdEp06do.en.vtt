brush<00:04:26.120> it's<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:26.780> bit<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.080> smaller<00:04:27.380> brush<00:04:27.620> than

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
brush it's a bit of a smaller brush than

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.920 
brush it's a bit of a smaller brush than
the<00:04:28.010> one<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.280> I<00:04:28.340> just<00:04:28.700> used<00:04:29.210> before<00:04:29.419> this<00:04:31.930> dab

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
the one that I just used before this dab

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.920 
the one that I just used before this dab
my<00:04:33.520> brush<00:04:34.520> into<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:34.969> color

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
my brush into the color

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.129 
my brush into the color
off<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.139> excess<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:37.750> we're<00:04:38.750> going<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:38.930> start

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
off the excess and we're going to start

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.279 
off the excess and we're going to start
blending<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:40.280> line<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.940> with<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.660> color<00:04:41.870> and

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
blending this line in with the color and

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:54.159 
blending this line in with the color and
creating<00:04:43.070> that<00:04:43.900> darker<00:04:45.310> top

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.469 

and<00:04:54.439> just<00:04:55.099> keep<00:04:55.249> working<00:04:55.699> until<00:04:55.819> you<00:04:55.999> get<00:04:56.300> that

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
and just keep working until you get that

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.589 
and just keep working until you get that
beautiful<00:04:56.990> blend<00:04:57.819> you<00:04:58.819> don't<00:04:58.999> need<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.180> reach

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
beautiful blend you don't need to reach

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.420 
beautiful blend you don't need to reach
out<00:04:59.840> necessarily<00:05:00.439> reach<00:05:00.590> out<00:05:00.770> for<00:05:01.009> more<00:05:01.189> color

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
out necessarily reach out for more color

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.550 
out necessarily reach out for more color
just<00:05:01.699> keep<00:05:01.909> working<00:05:02.300> with<00:05:02.449> whatever<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.349> put

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
just keep working with whatever you put

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.439 
just keep working with whatever you put
on<00:05:03.680> your<00:05:03.860> eyelid<00:05:04.249> initially<00:05:04.819> because<00:05:05.300> you

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
on your eyelid initially because you

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.570 
on your eyelid initially because you
don't<00:05:05.599> want<00:05:05.659> this<00:05:06.199> area<00:05:06.650> over<00:05:06.860> here<00:05:06.889> to<00:05:07.249> be<00:05:07.370> too

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
don't want this area over here to be too

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.970 
don't want this area over here to be too
dark

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.110 

so<00:05:13.520> here<00:05:13.910> we<00:05:14.000> go<00:05:14.030> we've<00:05:14.330> got<00:05:14.360> our<00:05:14.630> eyeline

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
so here we go we've got our eyeline

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.210 
so here we go we've got our eyeline
are<00:05:15.180> on<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.720> top<00:05:15.930> liner<00:05:16.199> on<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:16.919> what<00:05:17.100> we're

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
are on the top liner on so what we're

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.219 
are on the top liner on so what we're
going<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.430> do<00:05:17.550> now<00:05:17.699> is<00:05:18.030> apply<00:05:18.540> a<00:05:18.570> little<00:05:18.960> bit<00:05:19.139> of

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
going to do now is apply a little bit of

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.680 
going to do now is apply a little bit of
lot<00:05:19.919> liner<00:05:20.220> at<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.580> very<00:05:20.790> bottom<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.270> extend

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
lot liner at the very bottom and extend

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.450 
lot liner at the very bottom and extend
a<00:05:21.810> second<00:05:22.380> black<00:05:22.560> line<00:05:22.800> at<00:05:22.979> the<00:05:23.070> very<00:05:23.250> bottom

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
a second black line at the very bottom

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.240 
a second black line at the very bottom
but<00:05:24.150> for<00:05:24.360> this<00:05:24.449> I'm<00:05:24.660> going<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.840> use<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.650> pencil

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
but for this I'm going to use a pencil

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.430 
but for this I'm going to use a pencil
liner<00:05:26.669> simply<00:05:27.210> because<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.660> don't<00:05:27.900> want<00:05:27.990> it<00:05:28.260> to

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
liner simply because I don't want it to

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.680 
liner simply because I don't want it to
be<00:05:28.590> too<00:05:28.800> dense<00:05:29.729> at<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.180> bottom<00:05:30.449> we're<00:05:30.570> going

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
be too dense at the bottom we're going

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.210 
be too dense at the bottom we're going
to<00:05:30.750> eventually<00:05:30.930> want<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.470> blend<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.860> in<00:05:31.979> and

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
to eventually want to blend it in and

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.560 
to eventually want to blend it in and
it's<00:05:32.490> harder<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:32.850> do<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:33.210> with<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.389> liquid

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
it's harder to do that with a liquid

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.320 
it's harder to do that with a liquid
liner<00:05:33.870> so<00:05:37.550> just<00:05:38.550> going<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:38.729> start<00:05:39.090> at<00:05:39.210> the

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
liner so just going to start at the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.020 
liner so just going to start at the
corner<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:41.780> literally<00:05:42.780> drop<00:05:43.520> below<00:05:44.520> the

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
corner and literally drop below the

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.240 
corner and literally drop below the
waterline<00:05:45.530> I'm<00:05:46.530> going<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.860> come<00:05:47.070> about

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
waterline I'm going to come about

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.540 
waterline I'm going to come about
three-quarters<00:05:47.940> of<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.180> way<00:05:48.330> in<00:05:48.510> and<00:05:49.550> stop

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
three-quarters of the way in and stop

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.950 
three-quarters of the way in and stop
there<00:05:50.940> i'm<00:05:51.090> not<00:05:51.240> going<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.389> drag<00:05:51.660> it<00:05:51.690> all<00:05:51.930> the

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
there i'm not going to drag it all the

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.230 
there i'm not going to drag it all the
way<00:05:52.289> down<00:05:55.400> so<00:05:56.400> i'm<00:05:56.490> going<00:05:56.610> to<00:05:56.729> take<00:05:56.880> a<00:05:56.910> brush

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
way down so i'm going to take a brush

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.909 
way down so i'm going to take a brush
now<00:05:57.449> with<00:05:57.660> a<00:05:57.690> tapered<00:05:58.050> corner<00:05:58.440> i'm<00:05:58.560> using<00:05:58.889> my

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
now with a tapered corner i'm using my

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.850 
now with a tapered corner i'm using my
number<00:05:59.280> 11<00:05:59.669> /<00:05:59.850> brush<00:06:00.330> this<00:06:00.510> is<00:06:00.660> a<00:06:00.690> very<00:06:00.900> small

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
number 11 / brush this is a very small

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.180
