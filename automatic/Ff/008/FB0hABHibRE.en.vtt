King<00:00:00.210> a<00:00:01.190> helicopter<00:00:02.659> so<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.899> split<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.350> piece<00:00:04.529> of

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
King a helicopter so I split a piece of

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.210 
King a helicopter so I split a piece of
Sycamore<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.609> half

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
Sycamore in half

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.600 
Sycamore in half
now<00:00:08.220> I'm<00:00:08.280> gonna<00:00:08.400> mark<00:00:08.700> out<00:00:10.190> this<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
now I'm gonna mark out this is the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
now I'm gonna mark out this is the
important<00:00:12.540> bit<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:12.960> first<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.410> mark<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.710> center

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
important bit so first I mark a center

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.120 
important bit so first I mark a center
line<00:00:14.929> which<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.520> there<00:00:18.350> and<00:00:19.350> then<00:00:19.770> from<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
line which is there and then from that

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.179 
line which is there and then from that
center<00:00:20.430> line<00:00:20.460> amok<00:00:20.939> 10<00:00:21.810> millimeters<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.949> one

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
center line amok 10 millimeters on one

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.200 
center line amok 10 millimeters on one
side<00:00:23.490> 5<00:00:24.119> millimeters<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.260> other<00:00:25.529> side

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
side 5 millimeters on the other side

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.300 
side 5 millimeters on the other side
opposite<00:00:27.210> side<00:00:27.480> take<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> center<00:00:29.010> line<00:00:29.130> all

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
opposite side take the center line all

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.380 
opposite side take the center line all
the<00:00:29.400> way<00:00:29.429> through<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> other<00:00:31.439> edge

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
the way through and on the other edge

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.130 
the way through and on the other edge
mark<00:00:34.010> 5<00:00:35.010> millimeters<00:00:35.730> where<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.940> did<00:00:36.090> 10<00:00:36.329> 10

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
mark 5 millimeters where you did 10 10

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.569 
mark 5 millimeters where you did 10 10
millimeters<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> did<00:00:37.980> 5<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.460> your

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
millimeters when you did 5 so when your

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.080 
millimeters when you did 5 so when your
join<00:00:38.730> them<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.140> two<00:00:41.059> diagonal<00:00:42.059> lines

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
join them up you get two diagonal lines

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:55.260 
join them up you get two diagonal lines
okay<00:00:43.340> next<00:00:44.340> stage<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> flatten<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.440> stick

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:06.840 

and<00:00:55.630> fin<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.440> about<00:00:58.290> an<00:00:59.290> inch<00:01:05.670> don't<00:01:06.670> worry

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
and fin it to about an inch don't worry

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.470 
and fin it to about an inch don't worry
about<00:01:06.970> getting<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.480> really<00:01:08.130> perfect<00:01:09.480> because

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
about getting it really perfect because

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.630 
about getting it really perfect because
now<00:01:10.890> starting<00:01:11.890> from<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.130> underneath<00:01:12.310> way

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
now starting from the underneath way

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.090 
now starting from the underneath way
you've<00:01:12.790> made<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.090> marking<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:14.260> always

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
you've made the marking and always

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.640 
you've made the marking and always
working<00:01:15.400> on<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.610> left-hand<00:01:16.480> edge<00:01:16.840> you're

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
working on the left-hand edge you're

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.690 
working on the left-hand edge you're
gonna<00:01:17.800> thin<00:01:18.250> down<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.350> side<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
gonna thin down just that side of the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.360 
gonna thin down just that side of the
blade<00:01:21.910> so<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.500> don't<00:01:23.680> cut<00:01:23.830> it<00:01:23.860> all<00:01:24.070> on<00:01:24.280> the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
blade so you don't cut it all on the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.990 
blade so you don't cut it all on the
right-hand<00:01:24.790> side<00:01:24.880> just<00:01:25.780> thin<00:01:26.110> down<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:27.760> left

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
right-hand side just thin down the left

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.510 
right-hand side just thin down the left
and<00:01:28.300> edge<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.320> on<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.560> end<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:30.160> can<00:01:30.190> you've

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
and edge so on the end you can you've

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.800 
and edge so on the end you can you've
got<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> diagonal<00:01:31.180> okay<00:01:32.110> do<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.860> other<00:01:33.010> end

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
got a diagonal okay do the other end

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.100 
got a diagonal okay do the other end
left-hand<00:01:34.810> side<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:37.360> not<00:01:37.420> worried<00:01:37.810> about<00:01:37.869> the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
left-hand side I'm not worried about the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.770 
left-hand side I'm not worried about the
not<00:01:38.290> just<00:01:38.650> after<00:01:39.250> it<00:01:40.920> turning<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.040> over<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:43.750> I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
not just after it turning it over here I

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.840 
not just after it turning it over here I
just<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.200> just<00:01:44.320> take<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.250> markings<00:01:45.670> from

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
just I just take the the markings from

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.020 
just I just take the the markings from
underneath<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.210> I'm<00:01:46.390> gonna<00:01:46.510> start<00:01:46.810> carving

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
underneath so I'm gonna start carving

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.540 
underneath so I'm gonna start carving
above<00:01:49.030> where<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.270> see<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.750> mark<00:01:50.170> we<00:01:50.350> made

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
above where I see that mark we made

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:59.300 
above where I see that mark we made
left-hand<00:01:51.550> edge<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:56.290> get<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.740> nice<00:01:57.400> parallel

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
left-hand edge to get a nice parallel

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.350 
left-hand edge to get a nice parallel
rotor<00:02:00.360> find<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.479> end<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.750> find<00:02:01.960> them<00:02:02.170> mark

rotor find the end to find them mark

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.820 
rotor find the end to find them mark
carve<00:02:04.360> down<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:05.220> side<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:07.050> blade<00:02:08.050> nice

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
carve down that side of the blade nice

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.300 
carve down that side of the blade nice
parallel<00:02:09.630> blades<00:02:10.630> both<00:02:11.200> end<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.100> gives

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
parallel blades both end and that gives

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.900 
parallel blades both end and that gives
