00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
record in English I think it's a little

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.729 
record in English I think it's a little
bit<00:03:17.459> more<00:03:17.900> Street<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.139> it<00:03:19.260> could<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.470> in

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
bit more Street that it could be in

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.460 
bit more Street that it could be in
French<00:03:20.099> on<00:03:20.639> certain<00:03:21.359> songs<00:03:21.569> but<00:03:22.019> at<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.260> same

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
French on certain songs but at the same

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.689 
French on certain songs but at the same
time<00:03:24.199> you<00:03:25.199> know<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.319> always<00:03:25.680> even<00:03:26.280> when<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.430> write

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
time you know I always even when I write

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:31.460 
time you know I always even when I write
in<00:03:26.849> French<00:03:27.769> like<00:03:29.060> more<00:03:30.060> than<00:03:30.180> half<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.780> is

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
in French like more than half of it is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.050 
in French like more than half of it is
taught<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.010> English<00:03:32.430> at<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.609> beginning<00:03:33.030> you

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
taught in English at the beginning you

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.970 
taught in English at the beginning you
know<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:33.419> just<00:03:33.569> because<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:33.989> have<00:03:34.319> references

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
know it's just because I have references

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.009 
know it's just because I have references
I<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.430> ideas<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.090> come<00:03:36.239> up<00:03:36.359> in<00:03:36.480> English<00:03:36.870> and

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
I have ideas that come up in English and

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.099 
I have ideas that come up in English and
then<00:03:37.169> I<00:03:37.260> read<00:03:37.440> them<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.680> French<00:03:37.949> so<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.329> as<00:03:40.079> if

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
then I read them in French so it's as if

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.680 
then I read them in French so it's as if
now<00:03:40.560> was<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.099> was<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.669> was<00:03:41.790> more<00:03:42.000> natural<00:03:42.540> and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
now was it was it was more natural and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.409 
now was it was it was more natural and
it<00:03:43.530> took<00:03:43.739> me<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:44.190> little<00:03:44.669> bit<00:03:44.819> more<00:03:45.090> time

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
it took me a little bit more time

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.509 
it took me a little bit more time
because<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:45.959> had<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.440> watch<00:03:46.620> out<00:03:46.949> for<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.250> words

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
because I had to watch out for the words

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.189 
because I had to watch out for the words
and<00:03:47.910> make<00:03:48.030> sure<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.449> was<00:03:48.599> saying<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.079> right

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
and make sure that was saying the right

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.379 
and make sure that was saying the right
thing<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.069> at<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.340> same<00:03:50.579> time<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:51.150> took<00:03:51.329> me

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
thing but at the same time it took me

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.449 
thing but at the same time it took me
longer<00:03:51.840> because<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.349> have<00:03:52.560> less<00:03:52.799> experience<00:03:52.949> in

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
longer because I have less experience in

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.839 
longer because I have less experience in
that<00:03:54.019> but<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.109> was<00:03:55.260> easier<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.220> more<00:03:56.400> natural

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
that but it was easier and more natural

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.420 
that but it was easier and more natural
for<00:03:57.030> me<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.180> do<00:03:57.449> though<00:03:57.629> I<00:03:57.870> didn't<00:03:58.859> think<00:03:58.949> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
for me to do though I didn't think that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.640 
for me to do though I didn't think that
much<00:03:59.579> about<00:03:59.639> that<00:03:59.970> album<00:04:00.269> no<00:04:00.569> you<00:04:01.169> know<00:04:01.199> I<00:04:01.290> just

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
much about that album no you know I just

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.939 
much about that album no you know I just
hit<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:02.010> studio<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.989> had<00:04:03.989> sick<00:04:04.319> productions

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
hit the studio I had sick productions

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.629 
hit the studio I had sick productions
and<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:06.329> was<00:04:06.659> able<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.169> do<00:04:07.349> songs<00:04:07.799> not<00:04:08.190> only<00:04:08.430> Rap

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
and I was able to do songs not only Rap

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.000 
and I was able to do songs not only Rap
Tracks<00:04:08.669> that's<00:04:09.329> very<00:04:09.540> different<00:04:09.780> also<00:04:10.109> so

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
Tracks that's very different also so

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.559 
Tracks that's very different also so
yeah<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.250> think<00:04:11.519> it's<00:04:11.849> it's<00:04:12.030> more<00:04:12.299> eclectic

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
yeah I think it's it's more eclectic

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.649 
yeah I think it's it's more eclectic
than<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.049> French<00:04:13.379> album<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:15.180> definitely

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
than a French album and it definitely

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.920 
than a French album and it definitely
talks<00:04:16.169> maybe<00:04:16.440> two<00:04:17.209> it's<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.389> little<00:04:18.630> bit<00:04:18.750> more

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
talks maybe two it's a little bit more

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.399 
talks maybe two it's a little bit more
mature<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:21.180> know<00:04:21.299> so<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.870> didn't<00:04:22.169> forget<00:04:22.260> about

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409
