00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
is right I sit nice and low the driving

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.850 
is right I sit nice and low the driving
position<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.330> good<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> seat<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.110> supportive

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
position is good the seat is supportive

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.100 
position is good the seat is supportive
all<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.819> all<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.090> pleasant<00:02:37.540> place<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.930> sit

all in all it's a pleasant place to sit

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.990 
all in all it's a pleasant place to sit
but<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.380> doesn't<00:02:38.709> quite<00:02:39.010> sit<00:02:39.400> with<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
but it doesn't quite sit with the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.360 
but it doesn't quite sit with the
expectations<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.840> amazing<00:02:41.620> exterior

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
expectations of that amazing exterior

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.070 
expectations of that amazing exterior
and<00:02:42.610> let's<00:02:43.270> face<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.540> an<00:02:44.530> amazing<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.840> I'm<00:02:46.960> on

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
and let's face it an amazing but I'm on

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.750 
and let's face it an amazing but I'm on
get<00:02:47.290> too<00:02:47.440> distracted<00:02:47.620> by<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.400> amazing

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
get too distracted by that amazing

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.000 
get too distracted by that amazing
so<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.450> aft<00:02:50.720> or<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.290> bottom<00:02:51.680> let's<00:02:51.860> call

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
so is it aft or is it bottom let's call

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.920 
so is it aft or is it bottom let's call
it<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.190> bottom<00:02:52.580> from<00:02:52.849> now<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.629> a<00:02:53.690> great

R coupe a I'm not sure it's a really

R coupe a I'm not sure it's a really
good<00:03:24.200> road<00:03:24.439> car<00:03:24.769> we'll<00:03:24.980> drive<00:03:25.159> it<00:03:25.280> on<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
good road car we'll drive it on the

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.640 
good road car we'll drive it on the
circuit<00:03:25.849> later<00:03:26.030> on<00:03:26.299> but<00:03:26.480> on<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:26.689> road<00:03:26.959> it's

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
circuit later on but on the road it's

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.550 
circuit later on but on the road it's
got<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.829> really<00:03:28.340> nice<00:03:28.790> balance<00:03:29.349> do<00:03:30.349> you

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
got a really nice balance do you

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.649 
got a really nice balance do you
immediately<00:03:30.950> notice<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.640> extra<00:03:32.120> stiffness

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
immediately notice the extra stiffness

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.440 
immediately notice the extra stiffness
in<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.780> structure<00:03:33.349> or<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.829> Roadster<00:03:34.340> yes<00:03:35.239> its

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
in the structure or the Roadster yes its

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.970 
in the structure or the Roadster yes its
noticeable<00:03:35.930> but<00:03:36.019> it's<00:03:36.140> not<00:03:36.290> night<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.799> day

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
noticeable but it's not night and day

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.619 
noticeable but it's not night and day
I'd<00:03:37.129> want<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.430> drive<00:03:37.610> them<00:03:37.790> back-to-back<00:03:38.090> to

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
I'd want to drive them back-to-back to

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.539 
I'd want to drive them back-to-back to
really<00:03:38.870> feel<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.170> do<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.650> notice<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.010> extra

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
really feel it do you notice the extra

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.059 
really feel it do you notice the extra
power<00:03:40.879> a<00:03:41.269> little<00:03:42.049> bit<00:03:42.319> but<00:03:42.470> again<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.739> torque

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
power a little bit but again the torque

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.530 
power a little bit but again the torque
figures<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.609> two<00:03:43.760> cars<00:03:43.970> are<00:03:44.090> quite<00:03:44.180> close

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
figures of the two cars are quite close

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.720 
figures of the two cars are quite close
so<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.709> just<00:03:45.890> feels<00:03:46.040> incrementally<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.579> bit

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
so it just feels incrementally a bit

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.640 
so it just feels incrementally a bit
faster<00:03:47.090> it's<00:03:47.239> not<00:03:47.420> night<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.870> day<00:03:48.019> by<00:03:48.290> any

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
faster it's not night and day by any

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.160 
faster it's not night and day by any
means<00:03:48.980> does<00:03:49.879> that<00:03:49.940> mean<00:03:50.239> it's<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.540> very<00:03:50.569> fast

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
means does that mean it's a very fast

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.530 
means does that mean it's a very fast
car<00:03:51.379> yes<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.400> does<00:03:52.549> it's<00:03:52.730> old-school<00:03:53.000> as<00:03:53.359> well

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
car yes it does it's old-school as well

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.839 
car yes it does it's old-school as well

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
again on the track about how good that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.670 
again on the track about how good that
is<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.329> on<00:04:08.389> the<00:04:08.510> road<00:04:08.750> Wow

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
is but on the road Wow

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.949 
is but on the road Wow
you<00:04:09.980> can<00:04:10.159> pull<00:04:10.489> a<00:04:10.519> paddle<00:04:10.940> metal<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.720> time

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
you can pull a paddle metal this time

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.319 
you can pull a paddle metal this time
very<00:04:12.290> nice<00:04:12.560> or<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.639> can<00:04:13.819> just<00:04:13.940> leave<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.120> in

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
very nice or you can just leave it in

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:16.509 
very nice or you can just leave it in
Drive<00:04:14.599> and<00:04:14.840> it's<00:04:14.959> it's<00:04:15.349> just<00:04:15.470> responsive<00:04:16.370> and

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
Drive and it's it's just responsive and

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.789 
Drive and it's it's just responsive and
seems<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.060> know<00:04:17.239> exactly<00:04:17.600> what<00:04:17.780> you<00:04:17.989> want<00:04:18.169> when
