00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.990
 Here we are in the new 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.540
 my project facilities 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.850
 hydroponic project that now counts 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.620
 with 32 thousand square feet 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.080
 for planting sweets like 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.910
 sometimes in informative videos 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.099
 what have I done this server 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.150
 first of which was the system of 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.070
 Hydroponics its functions and its advantages 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.070
 versus traditional agriculture 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.260
 and then we visited the ares we did a 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.710
 documentary film 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.140
 successful projects and farmers and 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.930
 your experiences 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.210
 we come to talk about 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.879
 how to sow 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.920
 what is the medium that I recommend and 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.410
 which is an irrigation system in my 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.400
 project here from directly from 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.920
 delayed is port up 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.370
 let's take a look that is a system 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.370
 irrigation 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.119
 the irrigation system consists of 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.750
 it's part 1 are the pump injectors that 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.560
 are those that drive and mix 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.509
 nutritious solutions towards the system and 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.140
 the other are the sleeves issued by the 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.750
 droppers that are the ones that provide that 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.689
 directly to the pot where where 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.939
 plant the plant we use the 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.640
 half of the pearlite because it is the medium 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.890
 more efficient in the sense that we 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.610
 provide not decompose refuses 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.259
 and he is free of pathogens and it's a lot 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.259
 easier to control salinity 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.560
 if we look at the plant we will see a 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:06.100
 firm plant a plant that adheres to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.590
 the pearlite of a healthy plant that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.599
 is receiving balanced nutrition 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.599
 that irrigation systems 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.720
 in this a lie that waits for 72 days 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.610
 here is still working because here there 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.270
 daily a plan must be established 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.330
 of pest management and control of 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.630
 pathogens that is done by making a 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.240
 fumigation schedule that involves a 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.100
 process 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.430
 there's so much beside the insects that 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.200
 attack the harvest as for example the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:58.080
 whitefly aphid weevil and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.090
 and bacteria that affect due to 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.350
 weather conditions in the case of 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.900
 hydro comics as you can see 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.030
 the plastic or the water of the rain 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.250
 does not fall directly to the plant what 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.000
 which is much easier to control 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.020
 and pathogen attacks that can 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.020
 give the crops 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.230
 after 72 long days we found 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.609
 a plantation like this one a plantation 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.400
 film healthy ready now hill to 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.120
 harvest for him directly to 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.580
 supermarkets and from there for your home 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.580
 and this is not a secret this is 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:53.700
 dedication training consulting 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.280
 firmness and educational 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.590
 and that we only provide through 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.629
 of a basic training if you want 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.080
 more information enters my page of my 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.950
 website that appears here on screen and 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.390
 communicate with us 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.780
 the information that we 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.520
 we provide today 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.440
 importance for you to be an agro 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.440
 successful entrepreneur will be
