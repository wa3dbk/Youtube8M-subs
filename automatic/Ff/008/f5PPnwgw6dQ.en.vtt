00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
off as some sort of safety feature I'm

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.109 
off as some sort of safety feature I'm
sure<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:11.100> still<00:01:12.100> pretty<00:01:12.310> easy<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:12.850> not<00:01:12.970> as

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
sure so still pretty easy just not as

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.380 
sure so still pretty easy just not as
easy<00:01:13.270> as<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.570> thought<00:01:14.430> ok<00:01:15.430> there<00:01:15.700> we<00:01:15.850> go<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.270> you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
easy as I thought ok there we go and you

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.330 
easy as I thought ok there we go and you
do<00:01:16.540> need<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.840> take<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.020> bolt<00:01:17.440> out<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:18.159> one

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
do need to take the bolt out of this one

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.590 
do need to take the bolt out of this one
also<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.530> said<00:01:20.740> earlier<00:01:21.070> it's<00:01:21.220> an<00:01:21.310> rfk<00:01:22.030> I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
also as I said earlier it's an rfk I

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.380 
also as I said earlier it's an rfk I
think<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.440> can<00:01:23.620> get<00:01:23.800> that<00:01:24.040> this<00:01:24.850> part<00:01:25.180> from

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
think you can get that this part from

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.700 
think you can get that this part from
CRFs<00:01:26.049> only<00:01:26.650> calm<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.780> got<00:01:29.080> mine<00:01:29.320> off<00:01:29.530> at

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
CRFs only calm but I got mine off at

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.160 
CRFs only calm but I got mine off at
eBay<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.430> I<00:01:30.549> had<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.850> import<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.360> from<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.600> UK

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
eBay and I had to import it from the UK

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.740 
eBay and I had to import it from the UK
so<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.280> took<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.520> little<00:01:33.729> while<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:34.240> think<00:01:34.570> it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
so it took a little while I think it

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.240 
so it took a little while I think it
only<00:01:34.840> took<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.140> week<00:01:35.320> which<00:01:35.530> I've<00:01:35.710> had<00:01:35.830> stuff<00:01:36.100> in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
only took a week which I've had stuff in

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.789 
only took a week which I've had stuff in
America<00:01:36.700> like<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.690> next<00:01:37.960> state<00:01:38.200> over<00:01:38.409> ship

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
America like the next state over ship

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.680 
America like the next state over ship
slower<00:01:39.070> than<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.600> yeah<00:01:41.290> there<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.650> go

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
slower than that but yeah there we go

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.660 
slower than that but yeah there we go
make<00:01:43.690> sure<00:01:43.720> this<00:01:44.500> is<00:01:44.710> where<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.010> want<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.490> so

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
make sure this is where you want it so

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.580 
make sure this is where you want it so
get<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.420> bike<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.840> try<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.110> shift<00:01:47.260> up<00:01:47.470> and

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
get on the bike and try and shift up and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.830 
get on the bike and try and shift up and
down<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.740> few<00:01:47.860> times<00:01:48.040> with<00:01:48.400> this<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.790> here<00:01:49.240> and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
down a few times with this on here and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.180 
down a few times with this on here and
everything<00:01:50.229> off<00:01:50.440> because<00:01:50.619> it's<00:01:50.920> not

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
everything off because it's not

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.980 
everything off because it's not
difficult<00:01:52.119> but<00:01:52.540> inconvenient<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.409> adjust<00:01:53.710> it

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
difficult but inconvenient to adjust it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.789 
difficult but inconvenient to adjust it
hopefully<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.080> don't<00:01:56.200> need<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.500> field-test

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
hopefully you don't need to field-test

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.880 
hopefully you don't need to field-test
it<00:01:57.220> too<00:01:57.400> extensively<00:01:58.350> I'll<00:01:59.350> see<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.650> for<00:01:59.830> the
