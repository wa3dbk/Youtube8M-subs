00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.480
 so people get to work on edt 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.370
 imagination today therefore shows all block 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.389
 breaker doubt maybe knows now 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.609
 I still have my ideas 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
 made from the version 1.4 lower left 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.420
 In any case, he has to stop one 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 second time brought out the not with 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.400
 it finds the game and yes so that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.529
 I wanted to introduce this because I know 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 does not know do not show show first 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.070
 I've just done it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.890
 nothing looks so you get this from 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.149
 raid so in any case help the mega 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 cool there are power-ups now 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.940
 different means that yes 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.530
 Lots of power ups can do that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 but until now you can press me 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.680
 sometimes just everything up 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.520
 not everything laser james set okay 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 that was of course that others under 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.949
 Taken there you can belong to the slopes 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.479
 to find out why, why me? 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.610
 We think there are simply playing times 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.909
 then everything will explain itself so 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:19.619
 the same object is master of all 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.990
 World Challenge Won Free Livestock 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.980
 mama does so we can do it now 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.240
 go right and left and 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.520
 now you have to start the whole thing like that 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.260
 In any case, we have to stop that 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.000
 that he sees services below 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.560
 we live our lives and I find it up 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.090
 in any case, semenya already from the very beginning 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.080
 seen from the label designer me good 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.450
 a coupling power from there comes something 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.100
 have replaced edgy but that's cool 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.630
 this will be from the original game data 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.070
 then there is such a stick part that is 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.600
 if you caught him then stick the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.920
 and you can use it again with spacebar 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.240
 Shoot where you want 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.890
 very practical in the endgame on the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.920
 in my opinion very much 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.570
 real game is so that 's that is one 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.200
 So weird is the blog 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.640
 a ball is missing it's normal 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.390
 So in any case he will be later 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.160
 always faster 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.220
 and once lent by isaac 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:19.820
 a life in any case by the first 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.240
 level we're fine with that 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:29.180
 counted 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:31.810
 two lives i hope i am me 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.810
 curious what we have 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.810
 maybe to have something 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:46.010
 I do not know if we need one 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.300
 young man has wanted all the time 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.940
 someone is probably running that 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.830
 not ball and one way or another 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 but so must in all times up there 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.660
 because then the whole flopped 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.400
 back and forth that it is pretty strict 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.510
 to get 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.560
 I already knew how to steer well 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.680
 say so you can be right 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.660
 Attachment actually reacts is the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.180
 physics here just like me a game so 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.100
 really no case mega amazing 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.880
 and very well yes in any case 1400 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.110
 carola according to his description 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.110
 used that are natural 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.090
 went through that was actually synonymous 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.450
 in or hello I can be wrong but 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.800
 own luck to have been okay there 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.280
 components that fit in several clubs 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.770
 here 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.270
 he is so cool well then we see something 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.410
 Now decisions do not happen that way 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:39.470
 that's just sick if he size again 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.150
 The types can be constant at all times 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.420
 they break, you have to shit 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.420
 to meet 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.049
 okay the power would be less good we have 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.340
 I did not have to take it now 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:57.819
 not the age that is really good 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.890
 we did it right away, I hope so 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.040
 we are not so bad now that 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.280
 pinkl still very good now that's old 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.280
 mine 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.610
 No, unfortunately I do not think so 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.099
 the ki or there I have the new is that 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.259
 super nice since I nee that is 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:21.870
 normal if it comes laterally on it too 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:24.479
 then it is almost as if it's almost hit 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.770
 In any case, the money just said 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.120
 not to break the seas now 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.360
 need that is not bugs or should 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.160
 it comes go through we create 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.139
 still the last number kappus right 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.280
 Corrosive is actually power 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.310
 actually not that planned but 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:46.340
 I have to go for the side today 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.340
 a bit versatile just now 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:05:02.230
 yes no one centimeter of snow experience 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:02.230
 no i have done oh my god 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.440
 really bitter just so that I myself 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.800
 how to get the block age that's right 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.500
 bitter 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.790
 her fine but I would not have it too 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.440
 other end conception is nothing to 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.280
 play in any case yes that is 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.610
 Nevertheless, just blog funny last 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.610
 play 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.530
 it's really well done that one 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.600
 can one say what he wants so that is 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.390
 compared 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.970
 A great thing in any case 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:48.180
 take a look at the men and 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:48.180
 Canada nobody download and 6 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.330
 if you find something cool comment 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.510
 you can write a bit 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.890
 functions do so as said the 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.990
 trains come blocks can be found 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.560
 probably a little further away me 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.560
 make economics behind it now something 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.560
 fortuitously 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.120
 apparently with 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.580
 pity that but I have to find that 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.790
 over here 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.380
 that she is now 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.210
 aha there is a complete very good 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.110
 with the external pressure plates made yes 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.110
 so 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.770
 Lisa Jopt past that links below 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.660
 Look at this is really 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.990
 work that is a lot of work that is 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.150
 Not everything here is still possible 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.440
 back with it anyway on everyone 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.270
 case map maker over as I said 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.830
 the coal more suggestions message about 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.010
 comments and say we are 20 times 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.010
 cool
