and I did want to point out this is

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.770 
and I did want to point out this is
based<00:00:31.580> around<00:00:31.760> vanilla<00:00:32.149> minecraft<00:00:32.360> so

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
based around vanilla minecraft so

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.299 
based around vanilla minecraft so
there's<00:00:32.930> not<00:00:33.020> like<00:00:33.079> overpowered<00:00:33.980> stuff

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
there's not like overpowered stuff

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.920 
there's not like overpowered stuff
actually<00:00:35.149> they<00:00:35.239> could<00:00:35.300> probably<00:00:35.570> just<00:00:35.809> add

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
actually they could probably just add

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.389 
actually they could probably just add
this<00:00:36.050> like<00:00:36.199> directly<00:00:36.559> into<00:00:36.739> Minecraft<00:00:37.190> and

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
this like directly into Minecraft and

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.710 
this like directly into Minecraft and
they<00:00:37.789> should<00:00:37.969> do<00:00:38.090> it<00:00:38.239> if<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:38.450> guys<00:00:38.570> are

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
the top they should actually base it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.019 
the top they should actually base it
around<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:55.249> think<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.609> would<00:01:55.700> be<00:01:55.729> cool

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:56.029

kind of nicely I like the stairs up to
it<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:49.880> also<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.990> automatically<00:03:51.560> has<00:03:51.800> this

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
it and also it automatically has this

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.650
