00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.869
 all right 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.360
 welcome new word cloud 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.580
 forgiveness groomed today but is that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.679
 good and I'm breaking a bit my 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.299
 personal rules and I'm recording a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.640
 diary day that I usually have 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.349
 pretty crammed with things to do 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.060
 who decided to record today after having 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.150
 gone to classes now I have to go back to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.460
 go to classes and well at last I'm a little 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.130
 let's say tired then it 's a face that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.759
 that 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.110
 I know we 've given you a lot with 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.969
 star particularly I feel pretty 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.250
 guilty because what we have given 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.750
 quite 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.340
 That's why I've said many times under the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.500
 book stars that I liked a lot 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.390
 a movie that nobody liked very much if 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.250
 we have not liked it so much I would not talk to you 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.690
 both nest in any case is possible 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.180
 that many of you still 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.600
 have encouraged to read or see under a 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.610
 star 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 simply because you are saturated with 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.150
 see it on social networks is 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.680
 totally understandable but good I 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.420
 today I want to convince you a little or 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.580
 to read the book or to see the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.200
 movie if you have seen or read under the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.660
 same star but you want to convince 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.370
 other people it is possible that this video 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.259
 Well, they finish giving you that little push 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.300
 they needed to venture 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.479
 marvels of heisey history and 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.750
 augustus liked I do not know how many reasons 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.700
 I have thought two or three and the rest 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.770
 Well, the ones that arise so let's go 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.420
 counting the all together we started the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.040
 first of all is that it is not a book 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.410
 about the disease it is true that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.910
 the disease is a relevant element 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.060
 in the story because obviously 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.160
 conditions much everything and for that reason 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.050
 novel does not sin of pessimist is more has 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.700
 a rather positive content a 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.540
 positive message of life very 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.760
 optimistic 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.290
 and staying as much as you can fight 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.200
 keep going is full of metaphors 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.420
 of nice messages and messages both 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.980
 encouraging as emotional to the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.660
 characters is one of the strong points 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.580
 of this novel are endearing you 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.200
 you cheat very easily with them the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.660
 because of this I think it's because 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.970
 they are real characters of whom it is 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.440
 not then that is nuanced is much 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.450
 with them and even in some cases 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.550
 obviously saving the distances you 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.890
 You can feel very identified or 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.110
 reflected with the problems they have 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.160
 that are still everyday problems 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.780
 also tells us a series we give very 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.910
 very beautiful because it is a novel in addition 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.860
 quite realistic I do not think it shows 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.200
 much compassion for his characters to 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.570
 Although some suffer 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.040
 diseases enough wounds not like 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.200
 is cancer does not treat them with people 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.390
 sick people are dealing with people without 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.280
 no more tries then to assert those 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.260
 characters so they are not for the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.750
 personality that they have for their values 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.910
 intrinsic and not by people who 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.050
 they are sick and they need to say 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.940
 special treatment 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.770
 I'm focusing standards on the movie I think 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.750
 which is a fairly faithful story 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.640
 book made many of the dialogues 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.230
 are taken as such from the book and the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.150
 truth is that that gives much more value 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.100
 we have value for people who 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.930
 precisely value more this not that the 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.210
 film adaptations be what 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.520
 as faithful as possible with an image is worth more 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.560
 that a thousand words I think is fundamental 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.090
 see this movie also in a way 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.610
 you have read the book it is true that 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.440
 watching the movie in katas better all 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.360
 those emotions of the book in the book of 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.770
 you imagine the laws in a way with 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.750
 the laws of another and the best 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.820
 depending on the mood what 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.470
 you find you can come closer to 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.470
 reality or not but it is true that the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.060
 film impacts more than just that 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.310
 you are seeing it many times simply 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.470
 there is silence no such dialogue to 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.090
 better than missing where it is necessary 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.530
 in the book that between the music in the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.600
 scene simply that you're okay or the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.340
 gestures the looks that are between 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.280
 the two protagonists simply those 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.750
 small details of realizing the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.270
 value that the first has the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.860
 relationship to the best between heysel and taste 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.840
 I think those were all the reasons 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.000
 I do not know how many were I hope you were 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.590
 convinced more or less already finally 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.510
 I wanted to remind you that on the 24th of 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.209
 went on sale in October he says in 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.480
 species 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.219
 in the previous video and what's wrong with this 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.780
 video came to me but has put me 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.900
 forgotten 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.480
 the next day 31 Friday such the edition 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.400
 normal on dvd and blu-ray and also the day 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.810
 31 we want to make trending topic 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.630
 around 6 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.760
 Spanish peninsular with the low hashtag 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:10.110
 the same star and nothing then see you 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.110
 between little in a new video 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.070
 ah
