 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.640
 the site is all-all. ru 840 second task 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.240
 find the volume of the rectangular 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:19.100
 parallelepiped if its dimension 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:23.430
 48 millimeters 16 decimeters and 12 meters 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 well, to find the volume you need to multiply 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 three types of measurements 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.869
 length multiply by width and multiply by 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.820
 height in this case we do not know who 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.040
 of which length is which one is width one of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.730
 their height on us is basically not important we 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.730
 just multiply 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.719
 that is, we did not indicate which of them is the length 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.090
 which one is width which one is height 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.730
 We can choose your own self 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.739
 independently as you want let it be 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.219
 this length is the width this height 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.949
 well or even if we change it lets it 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.589
 length is height and this is width anyway 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.909
 from work to work from 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.950
 permutations of places multipliers nothing 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.150
 changing therefore in order to honor 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:17.070
 volume three kinds of measurements are multiplied and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:23.130
 we get the volume so but now count 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:33.020
 yes, let's count 48 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:39.630
 multiply by 16 6 by 8 48 8 we write 4 in the mind 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:49.880
 6 to 4 24 and four minds 28 1 to 8 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:55.259
 will be 81 by 44 here 8 here 16 here 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 I apologize here 8 8 to 8 this is 16 8 to 8 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:06.719
 16 6 we write 1 in mind 1 in mind 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:07.909
 2 to 4 6 to 1 in mind 7 of course of course 74 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.170
 wrong 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:16.519
 so now we multiplied that number 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.660
 But this is exactly what 768 turned out to be 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.450
 multiply by 12 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:31.540
 now the resulting number is another 12 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:37.900
 multiply 2 by 8 16 6 write 1 in mind 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:46.010
 2 to 6 12 to 1 in the mind 13 3 we write 1 in the mind 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:51.470
 1 moment 2 for 7 14 to 1 in 15 one for 881 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:58.160
 by 661 by 77 here we multiplied now 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:03.849
 add here 6 add here 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:10.660
 11 3 to 8 this is 11 1 we write 1 in mind 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:15.430
 5 to 6 11 dory two 12 2 write 1 in mind 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.019
 7 to 1 and one more in mind is 99 thousand 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.150
 216 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:25.250
 equal to 9200 16 decimeters dec has 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.799
 born meter three times therefore 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.040
 cubic decimeters three times therefore 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.510
 diameter cubic well and the volume is considered 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.669
 in decimeters of cubic meters 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.880
 cubic 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:40.970
 9200 16 cubic meters is the volume 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.700
 Our Che there was rectangular 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.319
 parallelepiped such a problem 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.690
 write in the comments clear solution 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.880
 or not if you like my videos 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.819
 lessons please advise and friends 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.819
 classmate on this all all bye
