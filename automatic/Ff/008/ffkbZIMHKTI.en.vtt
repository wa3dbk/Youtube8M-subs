today<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.130> show<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.310> how<00:00:05.670> to

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.639 
today I'm going to show you how to
change<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.210> filament<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:06.960> your<00:00:07.290> MakerBot
