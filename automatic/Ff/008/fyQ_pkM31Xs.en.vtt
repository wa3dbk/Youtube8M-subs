00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone my name is Victor zhilyakov 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.350
 this gadget news about today's release i 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.630
 take off 1 so the camera its position 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.000
 I will not have all probably looked 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.950
 fantastic movies in which people 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 colonized neighboring planets 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.050
 the solar system and probably every 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.300
 the boy dreamed of becoming the colonialists of those 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.029
 most unexplored planets and most likely 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 in the next 10 years, someone has such a dream 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.060
 come true 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.330
 the basis is that 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 European Space Agency 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.399
 going to create a base on the moon which 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.739
 will replace the UKS on such news British 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.770
 agency te mail said it 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.270
 the dwellings are very similar to the teletubbies lodge 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.719
 as you see here on this picture 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.280
 It is quite similar to Professor Werner in the future 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.340
 head of european space 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 agencies claim this smart base 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.710
 will replace the next 10 years well, approximately 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 in 2024 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.690
 and its construction will cause a huge 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.670
 technological surge on earth here with 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 I definitely agree with that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.860
 research will be conducted on this 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.990
 the base 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.420
 the answer is that she will 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.790
 be on the far side of the moon 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.100
 which we will never see and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.659
 thanks to its location, scientists will be able to 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.340
 better to look at space 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.960
 and of course for the realization of this 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.670
 space project will be required 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.159
 huge cash investment 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.290
 much more than spent on micro as 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.880
 for me the project is very interesting but something 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 tells me that they will not only 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.619
 consider space and may conduct 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.590
 such terrible tests for people and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.930
 animals who knows directly show the second 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 the news today is related to the official 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.100
 apple site and this time it is not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.320
 Any interesting patent and quite 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.259
 each other of you at least once in his 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.500
 life saw ipod no matter what classic 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.600
 you need elite you know about this product. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.210
 and recently from the previously mentioned site 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.180
 Missing a reference that will switch you to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.280
 page with these players and it seems to me 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.850
 that they did not remove it in order to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.310
 to update 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.829
 but because new iPods are simply not 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.370
 will vkladochka and between and under there 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.500
 two new ones are iphone and 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.690
 musik I don’t know about you 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.880
 liked the shuffle player that i have to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.220
 Sorry there was no I had a case of him 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.140
 see it is very small and therefore it 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 easy to take to workout in 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.940
 gym and go to the same study and 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.160
 do not bathe about the size of the gadget 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.060
 and if you want to know more about 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.130
 all codes 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.500
 I strongly advise you to see the story 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.380
 iPods from Sergey Pushkova here is a reference 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.420
 he will be here he talks about 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.370
 all the inputs that he has and their 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.500
 really a lot to the same pro in 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.870
 the collection though pavlov once two years 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.160
 back shot a video if you have long been signed 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.620
 on foliage 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.440
 you probably saw him for several years 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.870
 ago I became very interested in a series of books 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.990
 from the world of ethnogenesis and water from books under 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.970
 name hackers 2 or hacker 3 was 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.890
 described the moment when several groups 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.080
 very cool hackers gathered in one 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.610
 place and made them write very 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.770
 scary computer virus 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.110
 these hackers had to somehow communicate 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.420
 because they were of different nationalities and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.340
 This book has been described very interesting 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.800
 a gadget about which I will tell you now 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.080
 The essence of this gadget was that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.000
 he was put on his head was inserted into the ear 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.220
 a headset that heard all that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.530
 going around and translating to another 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.150
 language and recently on kickstarter I found 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.550
 very similar device 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.900
 these are all the same earbud headphones and 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.060
 they are wireless 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.310
 but that 's not all thanks to the program 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.590
 which syncs your device with 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.140
 headphones, you can turn down the volume 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.959
 environment for example you are sitting on 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.540
 street and reading a book but the noise of others 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.060
 you people prevent you from adding volume 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.010
 or you went down meters and you really 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.500
 loudly press one button 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.450
 volume down and you don't hear in 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.340
 the spirit of the wheels you came to the concert itself 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.910
 and the music that is out there that teaches you not 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.040
 satisfied added post in equalizer 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.290
 or came with a friend at an up on air concert 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.430
 from the speaker volume you really 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.980
 go deaf then 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.900
 bukovele bromine roll all right well and 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.239
 of course you can listen to music in 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.970
 these headphones and the cost is 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.580
 about 180 dollars and their really 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.549
 just want to imagine went down the metro 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.959
 and go to the office sheet of thunder 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.449
 these wagons your brain is really 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.370
 explodes and you forget all that 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.620
 They wanted to tell them, but right there at you 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.569
 headphones appear you just turned it down 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.449
 volume and everything became good a 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:31.039
 this device is called here asset 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.289
 deciduous for the start of the project 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.180
 required only 200 thousand 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.699
 dollars but it’s already doubled 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.650
 more than the first batch completely 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.090
 bought up so in december these 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.250
 I will not see headphones 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.770
 not that some lucky ones 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.330
 ordered them much earlier and that's it 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.009
 don't forget to like and 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.530
 subscribe to our channel if you 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.120
 I also liked to leave interesting 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.120
 comments to all bye
