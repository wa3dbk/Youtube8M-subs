00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
hey everyone this is shag we just fought

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.070 
hey everyone this is shag we just fought
a<00:00:20.160> great<00:00:20.430> big<00:00:20.610> toes<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.300> let's<00:00:21.510> fight<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> light

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
a great big toes so let's fight a light

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.260 
a great big toes so let's fight a light
bulb<00:00:22.349> I<00:00:22.770> don't<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.610> connection<00:00:24.090> I

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
bulb I don't really see the connection I

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.359 
bulb I don't really see the connection I
guess<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> put<00:00:25.200> light<00:00:25.560> bulbs<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.010> into

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
guess if you put light bulbs out into

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.980 
guess if you put light bulbs out into
advanced<00:00:26.670> acid<00:00:27.090> rain<00:00:27.270> it<00:00:27.390> would<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.630> well

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
advanced acid rain it would not go well

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.440 
advanced acid rain it would not go well
for<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.380> light<00:00:28.560> bulbs<00:00:28.950> I've<00:00:29.759> not<00:00:29.970> seen<00:00:30.210> any

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
for the light bulbs I've not seen any

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.030 
for the light bulbs I've not seen any
scientific<00:00:31.020> studies<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.770> this<00:00:31.919> effect

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
scientific studies to this effect

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.260 
scientific studies to this effect
however<00:00:33.290> anyway<00:00:34.550> bright<00:00:35.550> man<00:00:35.730> stage<00:00:36.030> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
however anyway bright man stage is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.110 
however anyway bright man stage is
actually<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.810> bad<00:00:37.280> because<00:00:38.280> well<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
actually not that bad because well in

actually not that bad because well in
this<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.510> section<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.380> keep

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
this first section you can just keep

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.810 
this first section you can just keep
running<00:00:40.710> forward<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.280> shooting<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
running forward and shooting all the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.810 
running forward and shooting all the
guys<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.510> their<00:00:42.800> light<00:00:43.800> turning<00:00:44.220> on<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.700> off

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820

gimmick<00:00:45.270> basically<00:00:45.899> means<00:00:46.079> nothing<00:00:46.469> since

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
gimmick basically means nothing since

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.880 
gimmick basically means nothing since
you<00:00:46.829> hit<00:00:46.949> all<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.640> once<00:00:48.170> however<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you hit all of them at once however the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.520 
you hit all of them at once however the
grasshopper<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.609> totem<00:00:51.149> pole<00:00:51.329> segments<00:00:51.870> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
grasshopper and totem pole segments can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.529 
grasshopper and totem pole segments can
be<00:00:52.589> a<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.949> more<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.370> bother<00:00:53.609> because<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
be a bit more of a bother because the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.180 
be a bit more of a bother because the
grasshoppers<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.379> jump<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.769> multiple

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
grasshoppers can jump at multiple

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.220 
grasshoppers can jump at multiple
heights<00:00:56.399> putting<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.629> places<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.079> they

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
heights putting them in places that they

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.829 
heights putting them in places that they
shouldn't<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.280> even<00:00:59.999> on<00:01:00.300> top<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.749> each

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
shouldn't be or even on top of each

shouldn't be or even on top of each

boss if you like to call it that but
it's<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.150> scary<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.659> he

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it's really just kind of scary when he

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's really just kind of scary when he
starts<00:01:13.050> lobbing<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.980> that's<00:01:14.159> his

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
starts lobbing things and that's his

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.749 
starts lobbing things and that's his
most<00:01:14.940> threatening<00:01:15.540> thing<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> scare<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
most threatening thing is to scare you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.940 
most threatening thing is to scare you
by<00:01:18.030> loving<00:01:18.360> gumballs<00:01:19.049> which<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.500> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
by loving gumballs which is kind of the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.060 
by loving gumballs which is kind of the
difficult<00:01:20.460> thing<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> accomplish<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.070> more

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
difficult thing to accomplish in a more

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580 
difficult thing to accomplish in a more
realistic<00:01:23.280> setting<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.840> gumballs<00:01:25.439> are

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
realistic setting because gumballs are

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.450 
realistic setting because gumballs are
not<00:01:25.740> very<00:01:25.890> frightening<00:01:26.579> oh<00:01:27.710> these<00:01:28.710> guys<00:01:29.070> can

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
not very frightening oh these guys can

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.249 
not very frightening oh these guys can
corner<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> don't<00:01:30.509> manage<00:01:30.719> to<00:01:30.869> hit

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
corner you if you don't manage to hit

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.459 
corner you if you don't manage to hit
them<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.159> possible<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.149> stairs<00:01:34.020> over

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
them which is possible on stairs over

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.800 
them which is possible on stairs over
there<00:01:34.759> but<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.360> generally

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
there but there are generally

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.179 
there but there are generally
non-threatening<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
non-threatening because all they do is

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
non-threatening because all they do is
move<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> hit<00:01:38.969> walls<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> bounce<00:01:39.659> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
move and hit walls and bounce this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.170 
move and hit walls and bounce this
ladder<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.040> also<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.579> non-threatening

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
ladder is also very non-threatening

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
ladder is also very non-threatening
because<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:43.049> don't<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.649> even<00:01:43.770> touch<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
because we don't have to even touch it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
because we don't have to even touch it
it's<00:01:44.520> an<00:01:44.640> optional<00:01:45.060> area<00:01:45.420> containing<00:01:45.930> an

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
it's an optional area containing an

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.950 
it's an optional area containing an
e-tank<00:01:46.500> who<00:01:47.340> needs<00:01:47.579> e<00:01:47.729> tanks<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.329> don't<00:01:48.780> take

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
e-tank who needs e tanks I don't take

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.029 
e-tank who needs e tanks I don't take
damage<00:01:49.250> eventually<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.700> least<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
damage eventually at least this is the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.380 
damage eventually at least this is the
part<00:01:53.250> where<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> grasshoppers<00:01:54.090> silly

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
part where the grasshoppers silly

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
part where the grasshoppers silly
jumping<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> screw<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> over<00:01:55.530> more<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.219> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
jumping can screw you over more if it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.520 
jumping can screw you over more if it
happens<00:01:56.850> which<00:01:57.750> he<00:01:57.840> doesn't<00:01:58.109> appear<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> be

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
happens which he doesn't appear to be

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.999 
happens which he doesn't appear to be
doing<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.070> time<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.600> yeah<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.799> one

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
doing at this time so yeah like that one

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.859 
doing at this time so yeah like that one
can<00:02:02.250> clear<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> gap<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.149> end<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.450> next<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
can clear the gap and end up next to

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.440 
can clear the gap and end up next to
this<00:02:04.079> one<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.560> example<00:02:06.439> but<00:02:07.439> yeah<00:02:08.070> I<00:02:08.450> guess

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
this one for example but yeah I guess

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.350 
this one for example but yeah I guess
the<00:02:09.600> grasshopper<00:02:10.110> gods<00:02:10.320> were<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.770> me<00:02:11.009> today

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
the grasshopper gods were with me today

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.080 
the grasshopper gods were with me today
nothing<00:02:12.360> screwy<00:02:12.870> happened

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
nothing screwy happened

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
nothing screwy happened
this<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.360> an<00:02:16.510> extremely<00:02:16.930> pointless<00:02:17.290> enemy

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
this is an extremely pointless enemy

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.000 
this is an extremely pointless enemy
it's<00:02:18.010> kind<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.370> sad<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:19.320> guess<00:02:20.320> if<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.830> don't

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
it's kind of sad I guess if you don't

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.850 
it's kind of sad I guess if you don't
manage<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.670> slide<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:23.140> might<00:02:23.380> hit<00:02:23.680> you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
manage the slide and it might hit you

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.430 
manage the slide and it might hit you
which<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.910> possible<00:02:25.510> if<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.230> game<00:02:26.410> doesn't

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
which is possible if the game doesn't

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.410 
which is possible if the game doesn't
realize<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.460> you're<00:02:27.610> holding<00:02:27.820> certain

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
realize that you're holding certain

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.890 
realize that you're holding certain
buttons<00:02:28.690> down<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:30.550> basically<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
buttons down but basically this is the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.900 
buttons down but basically this is the
penultimate<00:02:32.080> section<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> platforming

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
penultimate section the platforming

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.930 
penultimate section the platforming
challenge<00:02:34.600> where<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.770> real<00:02:35.980> challenge<00:02:36.640> is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
challenge where the real challenge is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.120 
challenge where the real challenge is
hoping<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.720> bullets<00:02:38.140> go<00:02:38.590> into

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
hoping that the bullets go into

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.400 
hoping that the bullets go into
convenient<00:02:39.910> places<00:02:40.210> for<00:02:40.690> them<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:41.140> dodged

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
convenient places for them to be dodged

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.190 
convenient places for them to be dodged
in<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.460> future<00:02:42.850> or<00:02:43.300> else<00:02:43.660> you'll<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.020> have

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
in the future or else you'll just have

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.600 
in the future or else you'll just have
to<00:02:44.320> keep<00:02:44.440> running<00:02:45.150> which<00:02:46.980> may<00:02:47.980> be<00:02:48.010> more<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.520> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
to keep running which may be more of a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.450 
to keep running which may be more of a
problem<00:02:48.910> depending<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.800> looks<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.310> got

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
problem depending but looks like we got

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.150 
problem depending but looks like we got
through<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.730> okay<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:53.620> means<00:02:53.950> we

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
through it okay but that just means we

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.800 
through it okay but that just means we
have<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.460> real<00:02:54.700> problem<00:02:55.240> of<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.510> stage

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
have the real problem of the stage

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.010 
have the real problem of the stage
bright<00:02:56.650> man<00:02:57.060> good<00:02:58.060> thing<00:02:58.270> he<00:02:58.450> installed<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
bright man good thing he installed the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.930 
bright man good thing he installed the
emergency<00:02:59.500> lights<00:02:59.680> in<00:02:59.860> his<00:02:59.950> hallway<00:03:00.220> or<00:03:00.610> else

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
emergency lights in his hallway or else

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.650 
emergency lights in his hallway or else
we'd<00:03:01.210> have<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.510> fight<00:03:01.720> him<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.990> dark<00:03:03.660> there

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
we'd have to fight him in the dark there

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.350 
we'd have to fight him in the dark there
is<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.810> very<00:03:04.900> specific<00:03:05.440> strategy<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:06.760> fighting

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
is a very specific strategy for fighting

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.200 
is a very specific strategy for fighting
bright<00:03:07.630> man<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:09.880> not<00:03:10.030> too

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
bright man actually it's not too

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.100 
bright man actually it's not too
difficult<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.900> accomplish<00:03:11.260> it's<00:03:12.130> essentially

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
difficult to accomplish it's essentially

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.880 
difficult to accomplish it's essentially
shooting<00:03:14.110> him<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.710> then<00:03:15.280> using<00:03:15.760> rain<00:03:16.120> flush

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
shooting him and then using rain flush

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.820 
shooting him and then using rain flush
because<00:03:17.890> if<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.250> shoot<00:03:18.460> him<00:03:18.520> once<00:03:19.440> then<00:03:20.440> he

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
because if you shoot him once then he

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.030 
because if you shoot him once then he
will<00:03:20.980> not<00:03:21.100> be<00:03:21.250> able<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.490> use<00:03:21.790> flash<00:03:22.210> supper<00:03:23.040> it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
will not be able to use flash supper it

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.770 
will not be able to use flash supper it
uses<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.460> watch<00:03:24.640> out<00:03:24.880> for<00:03:24.910> his<00:03:25.240> random

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
uses to watch out for his random

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.020 
uses to watch out for his random
direction<00:03:26.290> shots<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:28.830> his<00:03:29.830> sleeping<00:03:30.700> thing

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
direction shots and his sleeping thing

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.280

going<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.600> there<00:03:32.760> yes<00:03:33.760> right<00:03:34.660> Matt<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.080> down

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
going on there yes right Matt is down

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.890 
going on there yes right Matt is down
and<00:03:35.680> he<00:03:35.740> almost<00:03:36.040> got<00:03:36.190> me<00:03:36.400> too<00:03:36.900> but<00:03:37.900> yeah<00:03:39.900> maybe

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
and he almost got me too but yeah maybe

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900 
and he almost got me too but yeah maybe
this<00:03:41.170> is<00:03:41.350> more<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.770> bright<00:03:42.070> idea<00:03:42.310> than<00:03:42.820> I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
this is more of a bright idea than I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.180 
this is more of a bright idea than I
thought<00:03:43.240> oh<00:03:43.890> hmm<00:03:45.600> for<00:03:46.600> beating<00:03:46.960> bright<00:03:47.200> man<00:03:47.410> we

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
thought oh hmm for beating bright man we

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.750 
thought oh hmm for beating bright man we
acquire<00:03:48.610> these<00:03:49.210> foolish<00:03:49.570> flash<00:03:50.080> stopper

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
acquire these foolish flash stopper

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.220 
acquire these foolish flash stopper
which<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> lot<00:03:52.420> more<00:03:52.450> useful<00:03:52.780> than<00:03:53.020> the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
which is a lot more useful than the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.620 
which is a lot more useful than the
flash<00:03:53.440> stopper<00:03:53.770> because<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.630> don't

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
flash stopper because you don't

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.390 
flash stopper because you don't
constantly<00:03:56.140> well<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.710> mean<00:03:56.890> it's<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.250> lot<00:03:57.370> more

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
constantly well I mean it's a lot more

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.500 
constantly well I mean it's a lot more
useless<00:03:57.850> than<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.360> flash<00:03:59.320> man<00:03:59.620> weapon

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510
