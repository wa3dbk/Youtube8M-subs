young<00:02:43.459> people<00:02:43.550> have<00:02:43.880> been<00:02:44.090> alive<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.680> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
young people have been alive so so I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.460 
young people have been alive so so I
think<00:02:46.940> what<00:02:47.120> we're<00:02:47.330> looking<00:02:48.140> at<00:02:48.290> right<00:02:48.410> now

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
think what we're looking at right now

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.790 
think what we're looking at right now
are<00:02:49.220> real-time<00:02:50.180> documents<00:02:51.110> we<00:02:51.380> don't<00:02:51.560> yet

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
are real-time documents we don't yet

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.250 
are real-time documents we don't yet
know<00:02:51.860> what<00:02:52.160> they<00:02:52.340> mean<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:53.510> think<00:02:53.660> it'll<00:02:54.050> be

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
know what they mean so I think it'll be

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.440 
know what they mean so I think it'll be
really<00:02:54.290> interesting<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:55.070> reflect<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.910> another

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
really interesting to reflect in another

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.320 
really interesting to reflect in another
