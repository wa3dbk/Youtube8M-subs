00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.350 

as<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.959> can<00:02:14.080> see<00:02:14.290> here<00:02:14.560> there's<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:15.360> different

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
as you can see here there's a different

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.509 
as you can see here there's a different
icons<00:02:17.079> around<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.799> see<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.159> this<00:02:18.310> is

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
icons around you can see that this is

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.179 
icons around you can see that this is
definitely<00:02:19.120> designed<00:02:19.840> around<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.010> more

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
definitely designed around the more

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.720 
definitely designed around the more
modern<00:02:22.409> way<00:02:23.409> of<00:02:23.439> thinking<00:02:24.010> about<00:02:24.099> monopolies

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
modern way of thinking about monopolies

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.809 
modern way of thinking about monopolies
you<00:02:25.629> so<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.170> can<00:02:26.349> see<00:02:26.530> board<00:02:26.769> boardwalk<00:02:27.579> is

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
you so you can see board boardwalk is

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.910 
you so you can see board boardwalk is
now<00:02:28.000> four<00:02:28.540> million<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:29.140> lot<00:02:29.620> of<00:02:29.739> money<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:32.110> let's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
now four million a lot of money so let's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.250 
now four million a lot of money so let's
see<00:02:33.190> let's<00:02:33.400> put<00:02:33.579> that<00:02:33.730> away<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.959> get<00:02:38.079> your

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
see let's put that away you get your

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.449 
see let's put that away you get your
instruction<00:02:38.769> manual<00:02:39.069> here<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:42.099> is<00:02:42.280> very

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
instruction manual here so this is very

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.530 
instruction manual here so this is very
important<00:02:42.849> you<00:02:42.879> probably<00:02:43.150> would<00:02:43.269> want<00:02:43.299> to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
important you probably would want to

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.030 
important you probably would want to
read<00:02:43.659> up<00:02:43.689> on<00:02:43.959> all<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.379> instruction<00:02:44.859> since

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
read up on all the instruction since

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.000 
read up on all the instruction since
this<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.400> new<00:02:49.109> so<00:02:50.109> these<00:02:50.260> are<00:02:50.440> your<00:02:50.530> new<00:02:50.709> board

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
this is new so these are your new board

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.649 
this is new so these are your new board
these<00:02:51.370> are<00:02:51.549> your<00:02:51.670> new<00:02:51.760> game<00:02:52.030> cards<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:52.540> they

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
these are your new game cards so they

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.449 
these are your new game cards so they
definitely<00:02:52.870> modernized<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:55.799> gaming<00:02:56.799> card<00:02:57.280> so

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
definitely modernized the gaming card so

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.009 
definitely modernized the gaming card so
it's<00:02:57.609> actually<00:02:57.760> kind<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.150> cool<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.629> like<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
it's actually kind of cool I like the

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.410 
it's actually kind of cool I like the
new<00:02:59.109> design<00:03:01.409> something<00:03:02.409> unique<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.859> this

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
new design something unique to this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.349 
new design something unique to this
system<00:03:04.420> is<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:05.260> new<00:03:05.379> credit<00:03:05.709> cards<00:03:05.980> they<00:03:06.129> have

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
system is the new credit cards they have

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.960 
system is the new credit cards they have
these<00:03:07.359> are<00:03:07.530> digital<00:03:08.530> cards<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.459> work<00:03:09.760> with

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
these are digital cards that work with

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.119 
these are digital cards that work with
the<00:03:10.060> iPad<00:03:10.180> now<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.230> looked<00:03:11.590> up<00:03:11.739> something

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
the iPad now I looked up something

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.680 
the iPad now I looked up something
online<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.900> what<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.769> found<00:03:15.099> out<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.609> that<00:03:15.690> it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
online and what I found out is that it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.140 
online and what I found out is that it
actually<00:03:17.079> uses<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.530> type<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:17.829> paint<00:03:18.609> or

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
actually uses a type of paint or

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.830 
actually uses a type of paint or
printing<00:03:19.900> material<00:03:20.379> that<00:03:20.949> actually<00:03:21.489> is

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
printing material that actually is

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.629 
printing material that actually is
conductive<00:03:22.840> so<00:03:23.799> basically<00:03:24.250> there's<00:03:24.549> a

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
conductive so basically there's a

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.170 
conductive so basically there's a
capacitive<00:03:25.299> type<00:03:26.010> Oh<00:03:27.540> capacitive<00:03:28.540> type<00:03:28.690> a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
capacitive type Oh capacitive type a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.699 
capacitive type Oh capacitive type a
appliquéd<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.359> this<00:03:31.510> actual<00:03:32.019> card<00:03:32.319> so<00:03:32.590> when

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
appliquéd to this actual card so when

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.289 
appliquéd to this actual card so when
you're<00:03:32.859> touching<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.609> tap<00:03:33.879> it<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.180> the

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
you're touching it you tap it to the

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.659 
you're touching it you tap it to the
iPad<00:03:34.690> that's<00:03:34.959> actually<00:03:35.379> what<00:03:35.530> signals<00:03:35.980> the

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
iPad that's actually what signals the

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.430 
iPad that's actually what signals the
iPad<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.209> respond<00:03:37.629> so<00:03:37.810> it's<00:03:37.989> actually<00:03:38.139> pretty

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
iPad to respond so it's actually pretty

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.300 
iPad to respond so it's actually pretty
cool<00:03:38.680> but<00:03:38.889> we'll<00:03:39.040> get<00:03:39.190> more<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.459> depth<00:03:39.669> on<00:03:39.989> that

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
cool but we'll get more in depth on that

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.800 
cool but we'll get more in depth on that
maybe<00:03:42.310> when<00:03:43.150> testing<00:03:43.629> this<00:03:43.750> out<00:03:45.660> these<00:03:46.660> are

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
maybe when testing this out these are

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.710 
maybe when testing this out these are
the<00:03:46.930> new<00:03:47.079> game<00:03:47.319> pieces<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.389> can<00:03:49.569> see

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
the new game pieces so you can see

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.839 
the new game pieces so you can see
that's<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> new<00:03:50.169> dice<00:03:50.410> right<00:03:50.680> there<00:03:50.919> and<00:03:51.129> the

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
that's the new dice right there and the

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.430 
that's the new dice right there and the
new<00:03:51.970> modern<00:03:52.269> game<00:03:52.629> pieces<00:03:53.019> they<00:03:53.139> have<00:03:53.169> like<00:03:53.410> a

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
new modern game pieces they have like a

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.250 
new modern game pieces they have like a
clear<00:03:54.010> plastic<00:03:54.780> with<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> symbol<00:03:56.169> on<00:03:56.290> them

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
clear plastic with a symbol on them

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.530 
clear plastic with a symbol on them
these<00:03:59.260> are<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.650> crystal<00:04:00.400> homes<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.940> plastic

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
these are the crystal homes the plastic

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.629 
these are the crystal homes the plastic
look<00:04:01.780> crystal<00:04:02.349> homes<00:04:02.590> so<00:04:02.919> they<00:04:03.040> give<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> modern

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
look crystal homes so they give a modern

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.629 
look crystal homes so they give a modern
feel<00:04:03.849> to<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:06.069> looks<00:04:06.159> like<00:04:06.370> they<00:04:06.489> give

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
feel to that and it looks like they give

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.009 
feel to that and it looks like they give
you<00:04:06.730> these<00:04:06.849> rubber<00:04:07.090> feet<00:04:07.359> which<00:04:07.569> I<00:04:07.690> have<00:04:07.810> no

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
you these rubber feet which I have no

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.960 
you these rubber feet which I have no
clue<00:04:08.290> maybe<00:04:08.620> they're<00:04:08.859> for<00:04:08.979> your<00:04:09.129> iPad<00:04:09.579> so<00:04:09.849> they

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
clue maybe they're for your iPad so they

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.219 
clue maybe they're for your iPad so they
don't<00:04:10.150> slide<00:04:10.329> around<00:04:10.389> on<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.810> board<00:04:10.959> that's

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
don't slide around on the board that's

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.170 
don't slide around on the board that's
my<00:04:11.379> guess<00:04:11.620> but<00:04:12.370> they<00:04:12.489> give<00:04:12.639> you<00:04:12.699> three<00:04:12.909> strips

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
my guess but they give you three strips

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.800 
my guess but they give you three strips
of<00:04:13.299> them<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:15.400> they<00:04:16.030> obviously<00:04:16.150> give<00:04:16.690> you

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
of them and they obviously give you

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.899 
of them and they obviously give you
which<00:04:16.959> is<00:04:17.109> really<00:04:17.139> nice<00:04:17.620> some<00:04:18.489> plastic<00:04:18.880> bags

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
which is really nice some plastic bags

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.560 
which is really nice some plastic bags
to<00:04:19.299> keep<00:04:19.449> everything<00:04:19.720> organized

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
to keep everything organized

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.900 
to keep everything organized
so<00:04:25.380> I'm<00:04:26.380> going<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.650> grab<00:04:26.919> my<00:04:26.949> iPad<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.729> want

so I'm going to grab my iPad and I want
to<00:04:28.000> see<00:04:28.150> how<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.540> card<00:04:29.260> works<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:30.100> let<00:04:30.400> me<00:04:30.490> get

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
to see how this card works so let me get

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.469 
to see how this card works so let me get
my<00:04:30.669> iPad<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.240> I'll<00:04:31.300> be<00:04:31.419> right<00:04:31.510> back<00:04:33.300> all<00:04:34.300> right

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
my iPad and I'll be right back all right

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.370 
my iPad and I'll be right back all right
so<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.690> have<00:04:34.840> my<00:04:34.900> iPad<00:04:35.410> here<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:35.979> I<00:04:36.910> have<00:04:37.350> say<00:04:38.350> I

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
so I have my iPad here and I have say I

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.379 
so I have my iPad here and I have say I
have<00:04:38.710> one<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.040> cards<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.270> what

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
have one of the cards so this is what

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.330 
have one of the cards so this is what
the<00:04:40.479> card<00:04:40.690> looks<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.139> it<00:04:41.770> actually<00:04:42.130> has<00:04:42.310> a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
the card looks like it actually has a

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.250 
the card looks like it actually has a
fairly<00:04:42.850> interesting<00:04:43.630> design<00:04:43.900> on<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.139> back

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
fairly interesting design on the back

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.650 
fairly interesting design on the back
but<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:45.580> made<00:04:45.820> out<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.120> pretty<00:04:46.360> much<00:04:46.510> the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
but it's made out of pretty much the

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.230 
but it's made out of pretty much the
same<00:04:47.020> plastic<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.770> would<00:04:48.010> see<00:04:48.340> on<00:04:48.610> a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
same plastic that you would see on a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.629 
same plastic that you would see on a
credit<00:04:50.139> card<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.949> actually<00:04:51.100> feels<00:04:51.490> like

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
credit card so it actually feels like

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.550 
credit card so it actually feels like
you're<00:04:51.880> actually<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.840> actually<00:04:52.990> really<00:04:53.350> do

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
you're actually you actually really do

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.460 
you're actually you actually really do
have<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.770> credit<00:04:53.949> card<00:04:54.389> but<00:04:55.389> you<00:04:56.050> can<00:04:56.169> see<00:04:56.350> the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
have a credit card but you can see the

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.070 
have a credit card but you can see the
paint<00:04:56.680> finish<00:04:57.039> but<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.280> really<00:04:57.639> believe<00:04:57.940> that

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
paint finish but I really believe that

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.590 
paint finish but I really believe that
this<00:04:59.080> on<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.320> back<00:04:59.560> is<00:05:00.120> what's<00:05:01.120> making<00:05:01.479> it

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
this on the back is what's making it

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.580 
this on the back is what's making it
work<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:02.470> is<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> very<00:05:02.889> dull<00:05:04.199> surface<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:05.560> I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
work this is a very dull surface and I

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.790 
work this is a very dull surface and I
think<00:05:05.800> this<00:05:05.889> is<00:05:06.010> what<00:05:06.160> transmits<00:05:06.729> the

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
think this is what transmits the

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.990 
think this is what transmits the
information<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:08.919> the<00:05:09.010> iPad<00:05:09.430> because<00:05:09.669> let<00:05:09.910> me

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
information to the iPad because let me

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.580 
information to the iPad because let me
show<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.539> other<00:05:10.690> card<00:05:12.930> each<00:05:13.930> card<00:05:14.350> has<00:05:14.440> a

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
show you the other card each card has a

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.150 
show you the other card each card has a
unique<00:05:14.919> design<00:05:16.169> so<00:05:17.169> you<00:05:17.199> can<00:05:17.289> see<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.889> one

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
unique design so you can see this is one

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.960 
unique design so you can see this is one
card<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:20.650> is<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.860> one<00:05:21.039> side<00:05:21.430> which<00:05:21.729> means

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
card so this is the one side which means

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.219 
card so this is the one side which means
nothing<00:05:22.210> this<00:05:22.539> is<00:05:22.660> just<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.930> printed

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
nothing this is just the printed

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.159 
nothing this is just the printed
material<00:05:23.740> it<00:05:24.490> has<00:05:24.639> a<00:05:24.669> unique<00:05:24.970> design<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.599> as

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
material it has a unique design and as

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.839 
material it has a unique design and as
you<00:05:26.289> look<00:05:26.440> at<00:05:26.560> them<00:05:26.740> they<00:05:27.310> all<00:05:27.460> have<00:05:27.669> their

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
you look at them they all have their

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.600 
you look at them they all have their
unique<00:05:27.880> designs<00:05:28.660> and<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.560> believe<00:05:29.950> that's<00:05:30.310> how

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
unique designs and I believe that's how

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.140 
unique designs and I believe that's how
the<00:05:30.669> iPad<00:05:31.300> knows<00:05:31.919> how<00:05:32.919> what<00:05:33.729> card<00:05:34.000> you're

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
the iPad knows how what card you're

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.230 
the iPad knows how what card you're
using<00:05:34.210> because<00:05:34.840> these<00:05:35.710> little<00:05:36.220> dots<00:05:36.729> here<00:05:36.940> are

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
using because these little dots here are

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.080 
using because these little dots here are
the<00:05:38.160> refractions<00:05:39.160> and<00:05:39.280> it's<00:05:39.460> basically<00:05:39.880> when

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
the refractions and it's basically when

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.029 
the refractions and it's basically when
you're<00:05:40.210> touching<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.660> card<00:05:40.870> like<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.320> it's

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
you're touching the card like this it's

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.920 
you're touching the card like this it's
sending<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.490> signal<00:05:42.700> to<00:05:42.940> each<00:05:43.090> pad<00:05:43.450> here<00:05:43.840> and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
sending a signal to each pad here and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.719 
sending a signal to each pad here and
that<00:05:44.410> corresponds<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.520> type<00:05:45.729> ad<00:05:47.490> so<00:05:48.490> let's

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
that corresponds to the type ad so let's

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:55.260 
that corresponds to the type ad so let's
hit<00:05:48.880> next<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:53.310> then<00:05:54.310> I'm<00:05:54.460> just<00:05:54.610> going<00:05:54.760> to<00:05:54.820> hold

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
hit next and then I'm just going to hold

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.500 
hit next and then I'm just going to hold
it<00:05:55.449> on<00:05:55.599> the<00:05:56.500> gray<00:05:56.710> contacts<00:05:57.310> here<00:05:57.639> and<00:05:57.789> then

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
it on the gray contacts here and then

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.700 
it on the gray contacts here and then
it's<00:05:58.660> going<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.870> send<00:05:59.050> up<00:05:59.229> the<00:05:59.320> signal<00:05:59.349> to

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
it's going to send up the signal to

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:08.689 
it's going to send up the signal to
these<00:05:59.860> two<00:06:00.070> pads

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.480 

so<00:06:09.699> one<00:06:10.060> thing<00:06:10.240> I<00:06:10.360> noticed<00:06:10.810> is<00:06:11.050> that<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:12.130> have<00:06:12.460> a

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
so one thing I noticed is that I have a

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.330 
so one thing I noticed is that I have a
case<00:06:12.819> around<00:06:13.120> my<00:06:13.330> iPad<00:06:13.780> and<00:06:14.039> it<00:06:15.039> was<00:06:15.190> actually

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
case around my iPad and it was actually

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.730 
case around my iPad and it was actually
preventing<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.150> contacts<00:06:16.780> touching<00:06:17.650> the

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
preventing the contacts touching the

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.430 
preventing the contacts touching the
iPad<00:06:18.160> so<00:06:18.849> if<00:06:19.150> you<00:06:19.240> have<00:06:19.389> a<00:06:19.419> case<00:06:19.720> around<00:06:20.110> it<00:06:20.289> now

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
iPad so if you have a case around it now

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.879 
iPad so if you have a case around it now
I<00:06:20.470> have<00:06:20.650> an<00:06:20.740> Otterbox<00:06:21.160> case<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:22.620> as<00:06:23.620> you<00:06:23.770> can

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
I have an Otterbox case and as you can

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.400 
I have an Otterbox case and as you can
see<00:06:25.319> there's<00:06:26.319> a<00:06:26.440> lip<00:06:26.770> around<00:06:27.759> my<00:06:28.180> iPad<00:06:28.660> that

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
see there's a lip around my iPad that

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.659 
see there's a lip around my iPad that
will<00:06:29.710> interfere<00:06:30.340> with<00:06:30.400> the<00:06:30.639> actual<00:06:31.060> play<00:06:31.449> of

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
will interfere with the actual play of

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.370 
will interfere with the actual play of
the<00:06:33.669> game<00:06:33.880> so<00:06:34.449> you<00:06:34.479> might<00:06:34.840> want<00:06:35.020> to<00:06:35.080> remove

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
the game so you might want to remove

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.529 
the game so you might want to remove
that<00:06:35.650> prior<00:06:36.069> to<00:06:36.099> play<00:06:38.460> so<00:06:39.460> but<00:06:39.880> besides<00:06:40.330> that

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
that prior to play so but besides that

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.839 
that prior to play so but besides that
it<00:06:40.780> does<00:06:41.020> work<00:06:41.289> it's<00:06:41.470> really<00:06:41.530> interesting<00:06:41.979> so

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
it does work it's really interesting so

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.600 
it does work it's really interesting so
this<00:06:43.750> is<00:06:43.960> an<00:06:44.080> overview<00:06:44.229> of<00:06:44.710> the<00:06:44.979> new<00:06:45.099> Monopoly

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
this is an overview of the new Monopoly

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.510 
this is an overview of the new Monopoly
game<00:06:45.819> and<00:06:46.500> if<00:06:47.500> you<00:06:47.680> have<00:06:47.800> any<00:06:47.919> questions<00:06:48.370> or
