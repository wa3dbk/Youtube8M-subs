00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.760 

and<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.820> do<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.710> not

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
compute are the DNF doesn't count so you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:00.620 
compute are the DNF doesn't count so you
know<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.560> doesn't<00:01:52.860> matter<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:54.509> quit
