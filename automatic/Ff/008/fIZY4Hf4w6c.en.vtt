sort of changed the course of my life so
I'm<00:00:56.160> certainly<00:00:56.550> grateful<00:00:56.700> to<00:00:57.180> competitions

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I'm certainly grateful to competitions

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.420 
I'm certainly grateful to competitions
and<00:00:58.200> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.740> they<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.040> need<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.280> be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and I think they just need to be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.060 
and I think they just need to be
approached<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:00.750> way<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.260> think<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
approached in the right way I think the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.380 
approached in the right way I think the
greatest<00:01:02.310> thing<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.790> competition<00:01:03.090> is

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
greatest thing about a competition is

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
greatest thing about a competition is
that<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> goal<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.290> think<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.829> need<00:01:04.979> goals

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that it's a goal I think we need goals

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.999 
that it's a goal I think we need goals
in<00:01:05.720> practice<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.929> need<00:01:06.960> goals<00:01:07.319> in<00:01:07.499> life<00:01:07.710> very

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
in practice we need goals in life very

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.340 
in practice we need goals in life very
concrete<00:01:08.880> goals<00:01:09.149> that<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.569> can<00:01:09.719> work<00:01:09.929> towards

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
concrete goals that we can work towards

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
concrete goals that we can work towards
and<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.859> competition<00:01:11.429> is<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:12.030> something<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and a competition is is something you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.919 
and a competition is is something you
haven't<00:01:13.409> set<00:01:14.039> but<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> practice<00:01:15.329> Taurus<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.899> a

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:15.929 
haven't set but you practice Taurus is a

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.649 
haven't set but you practice Taurus is a
certain<00:01:16.319> repertoire<00:01:16.859> and<00:01:17.509> gives<00:01:18.509> us

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
certain repertoire and gives us

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.690 
certain repertoire and gives us
something<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.229> tour<00:01:19.409> before<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.280> work

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
something to really tour before and work

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.099 
something to really tour before and work
towards<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.329> that's<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.719> think<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> most

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
towards so that's I think the most

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.039 
towards so that's I think the most
important<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.950> think<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:24.049> not

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
important thing I think we have to not

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.599 
important thing I think we have to not
enter<00:01:25.469> it<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.859> idea<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.399> don't

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
enter it with the idea that if we don't

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.289 
enter it with the idea that if we don't
win<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.179> end<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.389> the<00:01:27.509> world<00:01:27.719> because

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
win it's the end of the world because

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
win it's the end of the world because
history<00:01:30.299> proves<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.289> winners<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:32.340> not

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
history proves that the winners are not

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.949 
history proves that the winners are not
always<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.969> ones<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.389> on<00:01:33.539> to<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
always the ones that go on to have the

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.010 
always the ones that go on to have the
career<00:01:34.319> and<00:01:34.590> there's<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.979> great<00:01:35.249> list<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
career and there's a great list of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.239 
career and there's a great list of
incredible<00:01:37.020> violinist<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.709> never<00:01:38.009> made<00:01:38.219> it

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
incredible violinist that never made it

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.639 
incredible violinist that never made it
past<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.909> first<00:01:39.569> round<00:01:39.749> of<00:01:40.079> major

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
past the first round of major

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.340 
past the first round of major
competitions<00:01:41.399> so<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.959> take<00:01:43.139> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
competitions so so you have to take the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.779 
competitions so so you have to take the
results<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:43.889> the<00:01:43.979> grain<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> salt

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
results with the grain of salt

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.510 
results with the grain of salt
I<00:01:44.819> don't<00:01:45.240> always<00:01:45.420> believe<00:01:45.719> that<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:47.130> judging

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
I don't always believe that the judging

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.699 
I don't always believe that the judging
process<00:01:47.670> really<00:01:48.529> ends<00:01:49.529> up<00:01:51.109> choosing<00:01:52.109> the<00:01:52.380> best

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
process really ends up choosing the best

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.340 
process really ends up choosing the best
one<00:01:53.459> because<00:01:53.819> it's<00:01:53.969> often<00:01:54.119> often<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.200> one

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
one because it's often often the one

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.980 
one because it's often often the one
that's<00:01:55.729> least<00:01:56.729> offensive<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.450> all<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> judges

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that's least offensive to all the judges

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.480 
that's least offensive to all the judges
occasionally<00:01:58.740> there's<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.249> so

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
occasionally there's one that's so

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.380 
occasionally there's one that's so
remarkable<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:01.039> that

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
remarkable that that

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.600 
remarkable that that
they<00:02:02.630> stand<00:02:03.440> above<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.710> rest<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.430> it's<00:02:04.550> a

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
they stand above the rest and it's a

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.160 
they stand above the rest and it's a
beautiful<00:02:04.880> thing<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.240> see<00:02:05.390> when<00:02:05.570> someone<00:02:06.020> wins

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
beautiful thing to see when someone wins

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.650 
beautiful thing to see when someone wins
a<00:02:06.320> competition<00:02:06.440> that<00:02:06.920> way<00:02:07.070> but<00:02:07.610> music<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.450> not

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
a competition that way but music is not

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.960 
a competition that way but music is not
is<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.530> subjective<00:02:10.569> on<00:02:11.569> many<00:02:11.810> levels<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.970> so

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
is a subjective on many levels and so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.160 
is a subjective on many levels and so
you<00:02:14.030> have<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.330> go<00:02:14.450> into<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.780> with<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.020> right

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
you have to go into it with the right

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.230 
you have to go into it with the right
attitude<00:02:15.319> but<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.370> do<00:02:16.550> believe<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.090> them<00:02:17.209> and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
attitude but I do believe in them and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.300 
attitude but I do believe in them and
and<00:02:18.970> encourage<00:02:19.970> people
