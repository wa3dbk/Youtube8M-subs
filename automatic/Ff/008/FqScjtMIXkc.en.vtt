00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
had this little issue with the speed

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.240 
had this little issue with the speed
setting<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.180> minimum<00:00:25.109> speed<00:00:25.619> setting<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
setting the minimum speed setting that

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.580 
setting the minimum speed setting that
the<00:00:26.460> lens<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.970> trying<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.599> keep<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the lens was trying to keep up with and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the lens was trying to keep up with and
I<00:00:29.429> had<00:00:29.849> my<00:00:30.359> Leica<00:00:31.019> M<00:00:31.550> -<00:00:32.550> P<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.329> me<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.070> I<00:00:35.070> took

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
I had my Leica M - P with me and I took

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.630 
I had my Leica M - P with me and I took
some<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.180> pictures<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.950> occasion

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
some of the pictures in that occasion

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.530 
some of the pictures in that occasion
with<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.360> Leica<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.910> would<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
with the Leica and I would like you to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.549 
with the Leica and I would like you to
have<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> look<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.350> them<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:45.230> even<00:00:46.230> for

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
have a look at them and I think even for

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
have a look at them and I think even for
portrait<00:00:47.039> even<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> 50<00:00:48.090> millimeter

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
portrait even with the 50 millimeter

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.750 
portrait even with the 50 millimeter
lens<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.829> more<00:00:49.920> convinced<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
lens I'm more and more convinced that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.189 
lens I'm more and more convinced that
this<00:00:51.570> camera<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.140> definitely<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
this camera is definitely up to it and

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.770 
this camera is definitely up to it and
is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.379> great<00:00:55.770> solution<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:57.120> very<00:00:57.239> discrete

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
is a great solution the very discrete

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.560 
is a great solution the very discrete
solution<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.590> not<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> model

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
solution it's not like you have a model

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.609 
solution it's not like you have a model
there<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.859> stick<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:03.000> big<00:01:03.420> thing<00:01:03.750> into

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
there and you stick this big thing into

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.870 
there and you stick this big thing into
her<00:01:04.769> face<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.970> his<00:01:06.659> face<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
her face or his face for that you have a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.310 
her face or his face for that you have a
very<00:01:09.180> discreet<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.930> camera<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:12.869> works

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
very discreet little camera and it works

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
very discreet little camera and it works
so<00:01:13.530> well<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.610> pictures<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.299> great

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
so well and the pictures are so great

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
so well and the pictures are so great
you<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.119> closer

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
you will have to get a little bit closer

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.420 
you will have to get a little bit closer
with<00:01:18.659> something<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.560> due<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.100> 50

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
with something like this due to the 50

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.590 
with something like this due to the 50
millimeter<00:01:20.640> focal<00:01:21.380> length<00:01:22.790> with<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.000> 200

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
millimeter focal length with the 200

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.590 
millimeter focal length with the 200
millimeter<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.470> stay<00:01:25.830> very<00:01:26.310> far<00:01:26.729> away<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
millimeter you can stay very far away so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.060 
millimeter you can stay very far away so
far<00:01:27.810> away<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.740> giving

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
far away actually that giving

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.590 
far away actually that giving
instructions<00:01:29.790> may<00:01:30.570> end<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:32.090> make<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> scream

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
instructions may end up make you scream

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.660 
instructions may end up make you scream
across<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.710> forest<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:36.110> however<00:01:37.110> um<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
across the forest and however um this is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.789 
across the forest and however um this is
more<00:01:38.970> an<00:01:39.180> introduction<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> look<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
more an introduction have a look at the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.999 
more an introduction have a look at the
sample<00:01:41.040> pictures<00:01:42.170> maybe<00:01:43.170> compare<00:01:43.740> them<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
sample pictures maybe compare them to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.370 
sample pictures maybe compare them to
the<00:01:44.280> ones<00:01:44.570> from<00:01:45.570> my<00:01:46.350> other<00:01:46.619> video<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.380> 70
