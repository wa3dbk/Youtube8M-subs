tunnels in circles and then steal
tunnels<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.540> ovals<00:02:43.310> until<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> difference

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
tunnels and ovals until the difference

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:53.090 
tunnels and ovals until the difference
yeah<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:47.090> full<00:02:48.090> circle<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:51.739> these<00:02:52.739> ones
