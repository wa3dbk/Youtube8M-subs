00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
other customizable options so to me what

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.180 
other customizable options so to me what
this<00:00:45.840> sounds<00:00:46.230> like<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.980> how<00:00:47.160> i

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
this sounds like is kind of like how i

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190 
this sounds like is kind of like how i
have<00:00:47.399> option<00:00:47.820> added<00:00:48.030> superstars<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.750> tire<00:00:48.989> now

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
have option added superstars a tire now

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.439 
have option added superstars a tire now
and<00:00:49.410> set<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> default<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.210> this

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
and set that to be the default so this

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.000 
and set that to be the default so this
is<00:00:51.629> probably<00:00:51.840> something<00:00:52.140> similar<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.739> will

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
is probably something similar that will

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
is probably something similar that will
allow<00:00:53.219> us<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> edit<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> in-game<00:00:54.270> arenas<00:00:54.719> with

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
allow us to edit the in-game arenas with

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.900 
allow us to edit the in-game arenas with
any<00:00:55.079> updates<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.070> set<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
any updates and then set that as the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.569 
any updates and then set that as the
default<00:00:57.120> when<00:00:57.539> selecting<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.109> arena

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
default when selecting that arena

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.439 
default when selecting that arena
obviously<00:00:59.579> i<00:00:59.609> can't<00:00:59.760> say<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
obviously i can't say if that is

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.090 
obviously i can't say if that is
definitely<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> case<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> how<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
definitely the case but that is how I

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.070 
definitely the case but that is how I
interpret<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.090> all<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.359> depends<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.780> what

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
interpret it it all just depends on what

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.899 
interpret it it all just depends on what
kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.470> customizable<00:01:05.189> options<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.760> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
kind of customizable options there is is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789 
kind of customizable options there is is
it<00:01:06.270> could<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.510> just<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.900> customizing<00:01:07.530> Sean

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it could be just like customizing Sean

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.320 
it could be just like customizing Sean
universe<00:01:08.310> mode<00:01:08.580> where<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.880> set<00:01:09.180> things

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
like the name plate or the matchup

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.770 
like the name plate or the matchup
screen<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.610> could<00:01:11.820> go<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.270> depth<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
screen or it could go more in depth to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.570 
screen or it could go more in depth to
like<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.140> actually<00:01:13.260> edit<00:01:13.560> larina<00:01:14.040> change

the<00:01:14.700> collab<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> ropes<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.600> mark<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> stage

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the collab the ropes the mark the stage

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
the collab the ropes the mark the stage
and<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.820> either<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.270> we'll<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and so on so either way we'll have to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.210 
and so on so either way we'll have to
wait<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.020> proper<00:01:19.290> reveal<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.920> mode

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
wait for the proper reveal of the mode

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
wait for the proper reveal of the mode
so<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:20.820> information<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.750> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so and get more information on it but it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.390 
so and get more information on it but it
does<00:01:21.990> sound<00:01:22.200> pretty<00:01:22.409> cool<00:01:22.680> although<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> think

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
does sound pretty cool although I think

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.100 
does sound pretty cool although I think

information including news on the online

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
information including news on the online
overhaul<00:01:34.049> his<00:01:34.409> Bryce's<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.159> said

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
overhaul his Bryce's actually said

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.530 
overhaul his Bryce's actually said
himself<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.939> being<00:01:36.090> completely

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
himself that it's being completely

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.270 
himself that it's being completely
changed<00:01:36.990> since<00:01:37.170> last<00:01:37.350> year<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.070> online

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
changed since last year and that online

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
changed since last year and that online
has<00:01:38.670> really<00:01:39.030> been<00:01:39.180> lacking<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> last<00:01:39.900> ten

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
has really been lacking for the last ten

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
has really been lacking for the last ten
years<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.100> sounds<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.400> there's<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> lot<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
years so it sounds like there's a lot of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.399 
years so it sounds like there's a lot of
changes<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> comes<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> online<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
changes when it comes to online and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.840 
changes when it comes to online and
hopefully<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> means<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.310> won't<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> put

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
hopefully it means we won't have to put

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
hopefully it means we won't have to put
up<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.180> awful<00:01:45.750> matchmaking<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.409> was
