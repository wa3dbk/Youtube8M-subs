00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.300
 so your life here is for new hotline 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.920
 do not be afraid we drink the animal 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:23.960
 Do not pet the once a week 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:30.890
 please bathe the water nicely 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:33.170
 made sure to bathe regularly 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:40.489
 bartagame makes it easier for the animals 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:43.300
 Hanging and the animal feels 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.469
 usually also after 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.469
 my part really well 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 in the beginning it is always a bit 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.979
 Excited you could be here now too 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.259
 make more pure water then that would 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.659
 animal swim but who on time 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.759
 too exhausting for the animal 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.810
 Please only as much water conservation 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:19.619
 make that animal with no problems in it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.869
 so there can never be so much water 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.670
 make clear that the animal all the time 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:33.810
 swim would it would be too tiring 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:36.899
 for the animal could then of course 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.350
 I easily saw my washing or did 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.509
 rumble or something that the animal times 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.630
 a little bit cleaner gets sand 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.520
 liberate everything and everything I do here 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:54.780
 has collected and not something 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.600
 stops because the animals are cleaning themselves 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.690
 usually hardly 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.580
 the dirt and everything is more then 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.580
 with with the next skinning off 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.980
 The animals fluff up as nicely as 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.349
 that now here then tries a lot of heat 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.989
 take 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:07.420
 that's what they do in the heat 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:11.739
 under the daylight lamps or the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.739
 Halogen lamp which brings more heat 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.750
 so I think that's enough the animal 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.510
 afterwards to take out and coarse 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.760
 dry off when it 's wet weather 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.310
 would put back into the terrarium 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.310
 It should be sand immediately 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.530
 completely settle 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.420
 that would have sent in the eye and 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.540
 wear everywhere and that's not nice 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.980
 leaves here therefore to the animal the 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.450
 fallen and dries off a bit 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.390
 In addition, this was the evaporation of the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.239
 Water too cool and sat down 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.040
 then in the terrarium if possible under one 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.160
 lamp that warm up first again 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.160
 can 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:12.540
 That sounds like you would like the pumpkin 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:16.020
 Carve or something is completely 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:20.270
 it was normal for us to be behind this one 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.080
 armor plates or stupid on it has 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.560
 that's why it has a bit 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.560
 funny 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.480
 I think the animal is clean 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.200
 dry and can now go back and 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.200
 heating lamp 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:26.620
 I will seize the now still under the 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:28.600
 heat lamps there can be the bartagame 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:35.230
 warm up a bit more and 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:36.430
 dry off and then that's okay with you 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.500
 can now fresh again 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.990
 pure water then also invests 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.320
 bathe yourself 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:46.060
 But as the saying bathe with is also 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.450
 not so often we do it once in a while 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.920
 month because I like it too 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:57.810
 said that facilitates the animal the 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:08:01.810
 skinning and bathing now and then 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:03.120
 that does not hurt the animals like me 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:09.210
 thank you for watching 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.210
 until next time hotline gamers at
