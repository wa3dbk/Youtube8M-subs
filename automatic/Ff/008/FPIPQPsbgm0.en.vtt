friends they are free to train honey

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.250 
friends they are free to train honey
because<00:00:14.280> their<00:00:15.089> siblings<00:00:15.480> their<00:00:15.900> friends

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
tell them that mahoto you train you

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.120 
tell them that mahoto you train you
can't<00:00:18.779> stop<00:00:18.990> when<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.199> stop<00:00:19.260> muscles<00:00:20.010> or

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
can't stop when you stop muscles or

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.420 
can't stop when you stop muscles or
tenido<00:00:20.430> fat<00:00:20.869> first<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> all<00:00:22.109> muscles<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> fat

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
tenido fat first of all muscles and fat

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
tenido fat first of all muscles and fat
is<00:00:23.640> two<00:00:23.820> different<00:00:24.029> things<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.420> body<00:00:24.600> muscles

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
is two different things in body muscles

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
is two different things in body muscles
can<00:00:25.680> turn<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.070> fat<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.340> fat<00:00:26.699> content<00:00:26.910> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
can turn to fat and fat content to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269 
can turn to fat and fat content to
muscles<00:00:27.630> okay<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.769> reason<00:00:28.920> why<00:00:29.220> people

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
muscles okay the reason why people

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.400 
muscles okay the reason why people
stopped<00:00:29.760> training<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> loop<00:00:30.720> terrible

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
stopped training and the loop terrible

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.380 
stopped training and the loop terrible
is<00:00:31.590> very<00:00:31.980> simple<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.700> train<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.180> put

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is very simple when you train you put

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.139 
is very simple when you train you put
additional<00:00:33.660> calories<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:35.190> maintain<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
additional calories and you maintain the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.569 
additional calories and you maintain the
muscles<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.870> built<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> stop

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
muscles that you built when you stop

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.830 
muscles that you built when you stop
training<00:00:38.940> you're<00:00:39.059> not<00:00:39.210> burning<00:00:39.420> extra

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
training you're not burning extra

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360 
training you're not burning extra
calories<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.530> you're<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:40.860> maintaining<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
calories and you're not maintaining the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.700 
calories and you're not maintaining the
muscles<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.750> happened<00:00:43.110> muscles

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
muscles so this is what happened muscles

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
muscles so this is what happened muscles
and<00:00:43.950> fat<00:00:44.309> fat<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> always<00:00:45.030> above<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> muscles

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and fat fat is always above the muscles

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.510 
and fat fat is always above the muscles
and<00:00:46.050> you're<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.890> training<00:00:47.129> you're<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and you're not training you're going to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.490 
and you're not training you're going to
lose<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> muscle<00:00:48.059> size<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.379> get

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
lose the muscle size but you get

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.750 
lose the muscle size but you get
additional<00:00:49.800> calories<00:00:50.160> now<00:00:50.489> you're<00:00:50.670> not

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
additional calories now you're not

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.400 
additional calories now you're not
burning<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> fan<00:00:51.899> Wakasa

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
burning so the fan Wakasa

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.740 
burning so the fan Wakasa
and<00:00:52.559> what<00:00:53.280> happened<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.120> fat<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.480> soft

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and what happened here the fat is soft

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.020 
and what happened here the fat is soft
very<00:00:55.559> soft<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.129> muscle<00:00:56.430> solid<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.879> can

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
very soft and muscle solid but you can

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
very soft and muscle solid but you can
see<00:00:57.210> them<00:00:57.390> fat<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.289> site<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.489> delivers

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
see them fat with site and this delivers

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.540 
see them fat with site and this delivers
the<00:01:00.210> illusion<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> why<00:01:01.020> people<00:01:01.410> were<00:01:01.559> fit<00:01:01.890> when

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the illusion of why people were fit when

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.670 
the illusion of why people were fit when
the<00:01:02.640> stock<00:01:02.820> training<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.989> look<00:01:04.140> terrible

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
the stock training they look terrible

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.280 
the stock training they look terrible
okay<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.540> muscle<00:01:06.960> toning<00:01:07.110> of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
okay so it's not about muscle toning of

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.890 
okay so it's not about muscle toning of
fat<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.710> basically<00:01:08.250> losing<00:01:08.909> muscles<00:01:09.390> atrophy

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
fat is basically losing muscles atrophy

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.340 
fat is basically losing muscles atrophy
and<00:01:10.110> fat<00:01:10.979> gain<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.630> other<00:01:12.750> side<00:01:12.960> I'll<00:01:13.110> talk

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and fat gain on the other side I'll talk

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.280 
and fat gain on the other side I'll talk
about<00:01:13.590> protein<00:01:14.100> supplement<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:14.850> so

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
about protein supplement as well so

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
about protein supplement as well so
people<00:01:16.290> ask<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.799> what<00:01:17.490> happened<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.850> stop

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
people ask me what happened to stop

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.749 
people ask me what happened to stop
protein<00:01:18.360> shake<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.869> lose<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.380> games

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
protein shake we lose all the games

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.950 
protein shake we lose all the games
basically<00:01:20.759> protein<00:01:21.270> supplements<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
basically protein supplements is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.719 
basically protein supplements is
designed<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.130> protein<00:01:23.369> more

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
designed for you to have protein more

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.969 
designed for you to have protein more
convenient<00:01:24.240> than<00:01:24.390> eating<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.500> let's<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:25.890> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
convenient than eating if let's say you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
convenient than eating if let's say you
are<00:01:26.100> eating<00:01:26.490> good<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:27.030> eating<00:01:27.299> every<00:01:27.420> meal

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
are eating good you're eating every meal

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.440 
are eating good you're eating every meal
of<00:01:27.869> high<00:01:28.080> protein<00:01:28.530> fish<00:01:28.979> eggs<00:01:29.340> beef<00:01:30.030> by<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
of high protein fish eggs beef by the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
of high protein fish eggs beef by the
not<00:01:30.630> taking<00:01:30.840> protein<00:01:31.110> supplements<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.310> still

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
not taking protein supplements you still

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
not taking protein supplements you still
probably<00:01:32.640> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> getting<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> good

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
probably going to getting get a good

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.740 
probably going to getting get a good
body<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.619> make<00:01:35.100> gains<00:01:35.369> bigger<00:01:35.909> muscles<00:01:36.299> it's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
body or make gains bigger muscles it's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
body or make gains bigger muscles it's
pretty<00:01:36.930> simple<00:01:37.229> protein<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.770> protein<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
pretty simple protein is protein on the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.609 
pretty simple protein is protein on the
other<00:01:39.150> hand<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.840> keep<00:01:40.079> taking<00:01:40.380> protein

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
other hand if you keep taking protein

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.319 
other hand if you keep taking protein
