00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
going to be a robot so it was gonna be

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.250

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
Wilson but all I have to do is put the

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.659 
Wilson but all I have to do is put the
peanut<00:04:20.180> butter<00:04:20.359> jar<00:04:20.510> in<00:04:21.020> the<00:04:21.140> cabinet<00:04:21.709> simple

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
peanut butter jar in the cabinet simple

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:30.959

so<00:04:31.969> it<00:04:32.059> just<00:04:32.239> took<00:04:32.360> a<00:04:32.509> little<00:04:32.689> bit<00:04:32.959> of

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
so it just took a little bit of

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.249 
so it just took a little bit of
convincing<00:04:34.159> on<00:04:34.309> either<00:04:34.549> side<00:04:34.879> with<00:04:35.209> those<00:04:35.419> but

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
convincing on either side with those but

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.249 
convincing on either side with those but
cricket<00:04:36.649> was<00:04:36.799> a<00:04:36.830> lot<00:04:37.099> more<00:04:37.369> of<00:04:38.079> intensive<00:04:39.079> and

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
cricket was a lot more of intensive and

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.489 
cricket was a lot more of intensive and

00:04:42.489 --> 00:04:42.499 
laborious process where we actually had

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.469 
laborious process where we actually had
four<00:04:43.039> different<00:04:43.519> actors<00:04:43.849> who<00:04:44.089> had<00:04:44.239> played
