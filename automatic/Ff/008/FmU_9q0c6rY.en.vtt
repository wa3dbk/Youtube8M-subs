fit quite a lot more and where you find
this<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.850> most<00:02:03.329> benefit<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.920> we

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
this of most benefit really so that we

really<00:02:33.600> really<00:02:33.900> smooth<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.470> problem<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.190> we

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
really really smooth a problem that we

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.880 
really really smooth a problem that we
found<00:02:35.820> with<00:02:36.000> app<00:02:36.180> or<00:02:36.630> android<00:02:37.110> tablets<00:02:37.530> that

article<00:02:41.940> let's<00:02:42.780> have<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.960> look<00:02:43.110> at<00:02:43.170> some<00:02:43.350> video

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
article let's have a look at some video

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.340 
article let's have a look at some video
one<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:44.940> problems<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.660> other

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
one of the problems with the other

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.140 
one of the problems with the other
7-inch<00:02:46.830> Abbas's<00:02:47.220> there's<00:02:47.460> quite<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.880> lot<00:02:48.000> of

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
7-inch Abbas's there's quite a lot of

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150 
7-inch Abbas's there's quite a lot of
them<00:02:48.360> something<00:02:49.140> called<00:02:49.320> letterboxing<00:02:50.040> when

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
them something called letterboxing when

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.650 
them something called letterboxing when
you're<00:02:50.250> watching<00:02:50.400> videos<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:50.850> again<00:02:51.150> with

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you're watching videos and again with

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.360 
you're watching videos and again with
this<00:02:51.810> tablet<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.320> do<00:02:52.530> get<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.070> though<00:02:53.220> it

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
this tablet you do get it but though it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.550 
this tablet you do get it but though it
is<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:55.190> guess<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.780> problem<00:02:58.110> with

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
is I guess it's it's it's a problem with

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.530 
is I guess it's it's it's a problem with
these<00:02:58.710> sized<00:02:58.980> tablets<00:02:59.460> but<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.000> video<00:03:00.270> looks

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
these sized tablets but the video looks

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.940 
these sized tablets but the video looks
really<00:03:00.810> good<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.200> viewing<00:03:01.470> angles<00:03:01.740> on<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
really good the viewing angles on the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.940 
really good the viewing angles on the
screen<00:03:02.220> are<00:03:02.370> really<00:03:02.610> good<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.970> everything

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
screen are really good and everything

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.430 
screen are really good and everything
works<00:03:04.950> pretty<00:03:05.220> well<00:03:05.370> now<00:03:06.180> one<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.140> issues

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
works pretty well now one of the issues

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.410 
works pretty well now one of the issues
people<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.220> with<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.700> iPad<00:03:08.970> Mini<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.240> that

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
people have with the iPad Mini is that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.670 
people have with the iPad Mini is that
the<00:03:09.510> resolution<00:03:09.780> isn't<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.410> so-called

the resolution isn't the so-called

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
iPhones the resolution is 1024 x 768

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.660 
iPhones the resolution is 1024 x 768
which<00:03:18.750> gives<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.230> pixel<00:03:19.800> density<00:03:19.830> over<00:03:20.400> on

which gives it a pixel density over on
163<00:03:21.600> which<00:03:21.990> is<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.170> lot<00:03:22.350> less<00:03:22.620> than<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.300> 264

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
retina display iPad has and you do

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.730 
retina display iPad has and you do
notice<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.930> there's<00:03:31.170> no<00:03:31.290> getting<00:03:31.590> away<00:03:31.650> from

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
notice it there's no getting away from

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.920 
notice it there's no getting away from
it<00:03:32.010> things<00:03:32.280> aren't<00:03:32.520> quite<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:33.150> sharp<00:03:33.600> though

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
it things aren't quite as sharp though

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.320 
it things aren't quite as sharp though
everything<00:03:34.590> looks<00:03:34.830> reasonably<00:03:35.670> good<00:03:36.060> and

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
everything looks reasonably good and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.060 
everything looks reasonably good and
we'd<00:03:37.080> say<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:37.860> we<00:03:38.340> go<00:03:38.459> into<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.820> book<00:03:39.330> app

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
we'd say for if we go into the book app

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.130 
we'd say for if we go into the book app
text<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.250> rendered<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.420> really<00:03:42.660> well<00:03:42.870> and

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
text is rendered really really well and

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.010 
text is rendered really really well and
it's<00:03:43.290> nice<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.680> sharp<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.220> bright<00:03:44.820> so<00:03:45.540> for

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
it's nice and sharp and bright so for

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.300 
it's nice and sharp and bright so for
most<00:03:46.140> people<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.770> won't<00:03:46.950> notice<00:03:47.100> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
most people they won't notice a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
most people they won't notice a
difference<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:47.700> if<00:03:47.790> you're<00:03:47.910> moving<00:03:48.180> between

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
difference but if you're moving between

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.420 
difference but if you're moving between
the<00:03:48.570> retina<00:03:48.870> display<00:03:49.140> iPad<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.130> ipad

the retina display iPad and the ipad

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.699 
the retina display iPad and the ipad
mini<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.940> will<00:03:51.120> notice<00:03:51.560> definitely<00:03:52.560> a
