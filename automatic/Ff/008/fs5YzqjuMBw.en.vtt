00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.759 
opens up slightly new gameplay elements
you<00:04:08.870> know<00:04:08.959> one<00:04:09.109> of<00:04:09.139> the<00:04:09.229> cool<00:04:09.349> things<00:04:09.379> that<00:04:09.620> we

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
you know one of the cool things that we

update we post a lot of those changes

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.110 
update we post a lot of those changes
what<00:04:16.250> they<00:04:16.370> are

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
what they are

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.210 
what they are
Oh slightly<00:04:17.989> tweaking<00:04:18.590> or<00:04:18.680> balancing

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
Oh slightly tweaking or balancing

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.430 
Oh slightly tweaking or balancing
weapons<00:04:19.669> is<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.540> really<00:04:20.840> big<00:04:20.989> thing<00:04:21.199> making

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
weapons is a really big thing making

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.379 
weapons is a really big thing making
sure<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:22.460> know<00:04:22.580> something<00:04:23.000> seems<00:04:23.210> like

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
sure that you know something seems like

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.850 
sure that you know something seems like
it's<00:04:23.510> slightly<00:04:23.630> over<00:04:24.020> underpowered<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:24.740> can

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
it's slightly over underpowered you can

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.290 
it's slightly over underpowered you can
adjust<00:04:24.949> it<00:04:25.400> you<00:04:25.490> can<00:04:25.610> tweak<00:04:25.820> them<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.150> tune

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
adjust it you can tweak them and tune

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.030 
adjust it you can tweak them and tune
them<00:04:26.419> and<00:04:26.960> so<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.229> think<00:04:27.320> that's<00:04:27.680> one<00:04:27.949> of<00:04:27.979> the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
them and so I think that's one of the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.200 
them and so I think that's one of the
big<00:04:28.190> things<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.580> know<00:04:28.669> if<00:04:28.729> you<00:04:28.850> look<00:04:29.000> even

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
big things you know if you look even

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.480 
big things you know if you look even
back<00:04:29.540> before<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.900> game<00:04:30.020> came<00:04:30.229> out<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:31.130> betas

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
back before the game came out the betas

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.760 
back before the game came out the betas
that<00:04:31.669> we<00:04:31.760> ran<00:04:32.080> giving<00:04:33.080> people<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.410> option<00:04:33.560> to

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
that we ran giving people the option to

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.040 
that we ran giving people the option to
give<00:04:34.040> us<00:04:34.160> feedback<00:04:34.280> on<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.639> non<00:04:35.180> final<00:04:35.540> game<00:04:35.840> and

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
give us feedback on a non final game and

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.189 
give us feedback on a non final game and
then<00:04:36.560> see<00:04:36.800> those<00:04:36.979> changes<00:04:37.030> in<00:04:38.030> action<00:04:38.750> when

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
then see those changes in action when

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.780 
then see those changes in action when
they<00:04:39.290> finally<00:04:39.530> load<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.949> disc<00:04:40.130> in<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.280> tray<00:04:40.340> I

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
they finally load the disc in the tray I

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.219 
they finally load the disc in the tray I
think<00:04:41.120> it's<00:04:41.240> only<00:04:41.449> rewarding<00:04:41.960> for<00:04:42.080> those

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
think it's only rewarding for those

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.870 
think it's only rewarding for those
players<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:43.070> it's<00:04:43.190> also<00:04:43.310> very<00:04:43.639> beneficial

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
players but it's also very beneficial

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000 
players but it's also very beneficial
for<00:04:44.510> everyone<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.290> whole<00:04:45.410> experience<00:04:45.530> we

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
for everyone the whole experience we

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.129 
for everyone the whole experience we
come<00:04:46.190> out<00:04:46.310> with<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.460> game<00:04:46.669> that's<00:04:46.880> already<00:04:47.720> had

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
come out with a game that's already had

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.770 
come out with a game that's already had
testing<00:04:48.770> on<00:04:48.919> it<00:04:49.040> in<00:04:49.250> waves<00:04:49.729> like<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.330> the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
testing on it in waves like that so the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.990 
testing on it in waves like that so the
battlefield<00:04:51.169> team<00:04:51.320> always<00:04:51.590> has<00:04:51.919> been<00:04:52.130> highly

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
battlefield team always has been highly

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.580 
battlefield team always has been highly
respectful<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:53.780> receptive<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
community so even more so was coming in

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.140

with<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:57.680> with<00:04:58.010> this<00:04:58.039> title<00:04:58.490> in<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.639> game<00:04:58.850> I

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
with this with this title in this game I

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.670 
with this with this title in this game I

think a lot of people are excited about

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.620 
think a lot of people are excited about
it<00:05:00.860> and<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.220> lot<00:05:01.760> of<00:05:01.820> ways<00:05:02.000> it's<00:05:02.150> a<00:05:02.270> good<00:05:02.419> nod

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
it and a lot of ways it's a good nod
