00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
one suspicious think something might be

one suspicious think something might be
going<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.209> here<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.720> he's<00:03:21.810> right<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.920> he

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
going on here and he's right and he

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.699 
going on here and he's right and he
discovers<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:23.790> pile<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.390> we'll<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.410> if<00:03:25.560> it's

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
discovers this pile on we'll see if it's

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.070 
discovers this pile on we'll see if it's
enough<00:03:25.800> he's<00:03:26.310> only<00:03:26.490> got<00:03:26.790> two<00:03:26.940> zerglings<00:03:27.840> I

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
enough he's only got two zerglings I

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.199 
enough he's only got two zerglings I
don't<00:03:28.620> think<00:03:28.890> they<00:03:29.040> can<00:03:29.100> get<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.580> file<00:03:29.970> on

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
don't think they can get that file on

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.720 
don't think they can get that file on
down<00:03:30.600> before<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.170> cannon<00:03:31.590> finishes<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.430> it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
down before the cannon finishes and it

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.430 
down before the cannon finishes and it
doesn't<00:03:33.060> matter<00:03:33.270> anyway<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.840> tails<00:03:34.110> laying

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
doesn't matter anyway it tails laying

down<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.740> second<00:03:35.250> pylon<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:35.970> he's<00:03:36.090> gonna<00:03:36.240> go<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
down a second pylon and he's gonna go to

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.810 
down a second pylon and he's gonna go to
work<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:37.140> those<00:03:37.320> zerglings<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.280> doesn't<00:03:38.670> take

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
work on those zerglings it doesn't take

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
one more scouting mission to see what's

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.719 
one more scouting mission to see what's
up<00:05:45.330> front<00:05:45.719> and<00:05:46.020> he<00:05:46.409> does<00:05:46.620> see<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.860> two<00:05:47.190> cannons

those two cannons actually will do a

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.700 
those two cannons actually will do a
fair<00:05:56.219> bit<00:05:56.580> of<00:05:56.610> damage<00:05:56.789> while<00:05:57.719> that<00:05:58.050> wall<00:05:58.409> is

to<00:06:09.240> be<00:06:09.330> very<00:06:09.659> easy<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.110> block<00:06:10.380> off<00:06:10.620> with<00:06:10.800> a

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
to be very easy to block off with a

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.439 
to be very easy to block off with a
force<00:06:11.130> field<00:06:11.400> and<00:06:11.639> that's<00:06:11.699> exactly<00:06:12.090> what

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
force field and that's exactly what

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.540 
force field and that's exactly what
tails<00:06:12.719> does<00:06:13.080> for<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:13.889> one<00:06:14.069> trying<00:06:14.400> a

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
different entry point but he's not gonna

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.649 
different entry point but he's not gonna

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
set but so far that engagement very

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.089 
set but so far that engagement very
strongly<00:06:23.880> benefited<00:06:24.870> tails<00:06:25.229> the<00:06:25.860> force

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
strongly benefited tails the force

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.499 
strongly benefited tails the force

these cannons it looks like you might be

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.390 
these cannons it looks like you might be

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
skin of his teeth would have been very

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.969 
skin of his teeth would have been very
bad<00:06:42.639> for<00:06:42.940> tails<00:06:43.210> but<00:06:43.509> as<00:06:43.750> it<00:06:43.930> turns<00:06:44.229> out<00:06:44.530> he's

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
bad for tails but as it turns out he's

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.240 
bad for tails but as it turns out he's
pretty<00:06:45.430> well<00:06:45.610> unscathed<00:06:46.590> lost<00:06:47.590> a<00:06:47.770> gateway<00:06:48.220> a

pretty well unscathed lost a gateway a

pretty well unscathed lost a gateway a
pylon<00:06:49.000> and<00:06:49.270> a<00:06:49.330> couple<00:06:49.599> cannons<00:06:50.199> but<00:06:50.410> that's

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
pylon and a couple cannons but that's

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.010 
pylon and a couple cannons but that's
pretty<00:06:51.069> much<00:06:51.280> it<00:06:51.580> the<00:06:51.910> little<00:06:52.180> one<00:06:52.330> sacrificed

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
pretty much it the little one sacrificed

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.260 
pretty much it the little one sacrificed
his<00:06:53.229> entire<00:06:53.650> army<00:06:54.250> and<00:06:54.490> even<00:06:54.759> cutting

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
his entire army and even cutting

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.260 
his entire army and even cutting
drawings<00:06:55.840> the<00:06:56.020> entire<00:06:56.380> time<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.220> it<00:06:58.030> turns

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
drawings the entire time and it turns

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.029 
drawings the entire time and it turns
out<00:06:58.569> to<00:06:58.720> be<00:06:58.750> too<00:06:59.020> much<00:06:59.199> for<00:06:59.440> the<00:06:59.500> little<00:06:59.530> one<00:06:59.860> to

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
out to be too much for the little one to

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.520 
out to be too much for the little one to
bear<00:07:00.340> who<00:07:00.639> Gigi's<00:07:00.940> if<00:07:01.810> we<00:07:01.900> take<00:07:02.080> a<00:07:02.139> look<00:07:02.380> from

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
bear who Gigi's if we take a look from

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.800 
bear who Gigi's if we take a look from
the<00:07:02.710> little<00:07:02.949> ones<00:07:03.099> perspective<00:07:03.789> he<00:07:04.419> actually

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
the little ones perspective he actually

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.360 
the little ones perspective he actually
doesn't<00:07:05.080> know<00:07:05.110> a<00:07:05.289> whole<00:07:05.410> lot<00:07:05.830> about<00:07:05.860> what's

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.820 
doesn't know a whole lot about what's
going<00:07:06.610> on<00:07:06.729> in<00:07:06.909> tails's<00:07:07.360> base<00:07:07.659> he<00:07:08.319> must<00:07:08.590> just

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
going on in tails's base he must just

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.649 
going on in tails's base he must just
realize<00:07:09.340> that<00:07:09.370> he's<00:07:09.729> been<00:07:09.970> cutting<00:07:10.210> drones

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:10.659

this<00:07:10.960> entire<00:07:11.349> time<00:07:11.680> and<00:07:12.069> he<00:07:12.430> very<00:07:12.669> plainly<00:07:13.060> saw

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.449 
this entire time and he very plainly saw

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:15.600 
this entire time and he very plainly saw
that<00:07:13.630> tails<00:07:13.930> had<00:07:14.259> not<00:07:14.530> been<00:07:14.860> when<00:07:15.250> that<00:07:15.400> whole

that tails had not been when that whole
stream<00:07:16.090> of<00:07:16.120> probes<00:07:16.720> came<00:07:17.080> out<00:07:17.259> to<00:07:17.440> do<00:07:17.590> battle

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069
