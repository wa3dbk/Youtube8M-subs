00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
actually at the top of the case you take

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
actually at the top of the case you take
off<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> plastic<00:00:39.239> vent<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.230> inside<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.680> can

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
get that as an option you'll see part of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
get that as an option you'll see part of
the<00:00:54.899> magic<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.379> system<00:00:55.559> those<00:00:55.770> tuners

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the magic with this system those tuners

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.430 
the magic with this system those tuners
to<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.280> these<00:00:56.370> panels<00:00:56.760> off<00:00:57.170> front<00:00:58.170> panel

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
to take these panels off front panel

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.849 
to take these panels off front panel
pops<00:00:58.620> down<00:00:59.059> and<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> back<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.050> this

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
pops down and so do the back and this

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
pops down and so do the back and this
side<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.359> side<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> case<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.049> fixed

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
side and this side of the case is fixed

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.350 
side and this side of the case is fixed
to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> chassis<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> rest<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> gives

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
to the chassis but the rest of it gives

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
to the chassis but the rest of it gives
you<00:01:06.450> pretty<00:01:06.689> clean<00:01:07.140> access<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> inside<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
you pretty clean access to the inside of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
you pretty clean access to the inside of
the<00:01:08.340> system<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.540> you'll<00:01:09.720> note<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the system so you'll note that this is a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.649 
the system so you'll note that this is a
really<00:01:10.799> compact<00:01:11.369> design<00:01:11.640> inside<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
really compact design inside of here and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
really compact design inside of here and
in<00:01:13.110> fact<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.409> didn't<00:01:13.650> even<00:01:13.770> try<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
in fact I didn't even try to get the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.740 
in fact I didn't even try to get the
graphics<00:01:14.760> card<00:01:14.939> off<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.330> really

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
graphics card off because I really

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.789 
graphics card off because I really
wasn't<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> could<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
wasn't sure if I could get it back in

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.380 
wasn't sure if I could get it back in
it's<00:01:16.979> sort<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.220> hemmed<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> top<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's sort of hemmed in on the top and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's sort of hemmed in on the top and
the<00:01:18.450> bottom<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.560> side<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> the
