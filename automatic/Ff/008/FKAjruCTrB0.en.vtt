00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.190
 introduce you to the ati minoens their design 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.410
 and by patrick sebile the peculiarity 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.950
 so it's a chad with a caudal that 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.690
 rectangular enough massive and what has 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.550
 very very much of course this lure is it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.619
 is father is already on the whole 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.539
 length by one channel but also to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.699
 different places there as we can 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.010
 see there are several openings that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.420
 make it easy to switch between 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.900
 donkeys are aix in either the hooks 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.360
 thieves lac lovering l epr is pierced 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.100
 so you go into the channel after you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.320
 wind or soul ressors 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.760
 prefered were bored here then 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.260
 either we can want you to clean a 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.989
 other channel that are here on the put 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.699
 on the back another here and you can me 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.100
 not one is in the tank so to 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.409
 their place on the back that allows to have 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.180
 a good presentation 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.650
 a good a good presentation of the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.449
 tip of the texan mission which makes that 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.739
 as soon as we go shoeing lapointe is going to be 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.989
 exposed will clear well 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.400
 there is a groove that allows to hide it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.989
 really in if we really catch them 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.570
 obstacles on pike I like 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.859
 have a tip a bit exposed so there 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.049
 that's why she's open the one 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.399
 this if I ever fish black bass I 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.750
 will take a tip a little more closed 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.030
 so unlike what we could 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.430
 think the rectangular tail gives it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.109
 a pretty tight age that's a size 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
 that I use a lot there the meaning for 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.619
 ashes in particular vertical and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.119
 also on linear brochures and on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.189
 pikes in general I use more 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.289
 the condition is a bit bigger all 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.079
 what is 150 must know who will 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.880
 up to 240 so that for pike and 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.310
 for the sea that color 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.289
 in particular on the bart aernouts and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.609
 smaller size as the 65 year olds 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.590
 tanks for all that there is too 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.280
 of perch and ashes especially when 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280
 they eat in friends
