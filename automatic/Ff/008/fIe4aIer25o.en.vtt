put my shoulder to the floor I step
around<00:01:27.999> his<00:01:28.869> legs<00:01:29.200> not<00:01:29.529> to<00:01:29.679> get<00:01:29.799> caught<00:01:30.039> in<00:01:30.069> got

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
around his legs not to get caught in got

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.779 
around his legs not to get caught in got
the<00:01:31.840> cross<00:01:32.170> fence<00:01:32.439> on<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:32.889> secure<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
the cross fence on and secure the

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.149 
the cross fence on and secure the
position

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
position

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.160 
position
so<00:01:36.159> here's<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.670> technique<00:01:37.450> with<00:01:37.719> it<00:01:37.899> with<00:01:38.139> a

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
so here's the technique with it with a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.039 
so here's the technique with it with a
second<00:01:38.829> option<00:01:39.009> that<00:01:39.310> he<00:01:39.459> likes<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.119> from

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
second option that he likes to you from

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.129 
second option that he likes to you from
another<00:01:41.349> angle<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:42.189> he'll<00:01:42.490> often<00:01:42.759> again<00:01:43.569> shoot

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139 
another angle so he'll often again shoot

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:46.019 
another angle so he'll often again shoot
down<00:01:44.409> any<00:01:44.740> look<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.219> won't<00:01:45.399> go<00:01:45.549> down<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.999> a

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:46.029 
down any look you won't go down to a

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:48.300 
down any look you won't go down to a
knee<00:01:46.179> you'll<00:01:46.389> pick<00:01:46.569> up<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.899> single<00:01:47.289> leg<00:01:47.409> okay

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
knee you'll pick up that single leg okay

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.339 
knee you'll pick up that single leg okay
now<00:01:48.999> from<00:01:49.209> here<00:01:50.789> you'll<00:01:51.789> go<00:01:52.689> for<00:01:52.869> an<00:01:52.959> ankle

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:53.349 
now from here you'll go for an ankle

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:55.080 
now from here you'll go for an ankle
pick<00:01:53.560> as<00:01:53.740> well<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.279> see<00:01:54.520> it's<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.880> option

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
pick as well so see it's the option

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.659 
pick as well so see it's the option
there<00:01:55.479> if<00:01:55.659> there's<00:01:55.899> we're<00:01:56.169> defending<00:01:57.130> against

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:57.669 
there if there's we're defending against

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:59.609 
there if there's we're defending against
the<00:01:57.789> running<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.239> pot<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.749> they're<00:01:59.200> bouncing

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
the running the pot and they're bouncing

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.620 
the running the pot and they're bouncing
around<00:01:59.709> and<00:02:00.039> got<00:02:00.189> quite<00:02:00.340> good<00:02:00.639> balance<00:02:01.060> he

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
around and got quite good balance he

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.599 
around and got quite good balance he
will<00:02:01.779> then<00:02:01.929> drop<00:02:02.200> down<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.679> a<00:02:02.709> knee<00:02:02.770> pick<00:02:03.399> up

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
will then drop down to a knee pick up

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.429 
will then drop down to a knee pick up
this<00:02:03.819> ankle<00:02:04.329> pick

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
this ankle pick

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.710 
this ankle pick
and<00:02:07.439> run<00:02:07.680> around<00:02:07.849> that's<00:02:08.849> exactly<00:02:09.420> how<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.569> got

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and run around that's exactly how we got

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750 
and run around that's exactly how we got
his<00:02:09.959> first<00:02:10.140> takedown<00:02:10.500> against<00:02:11.430> Anderson

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
his first takedown against Anderson

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.059 
his first takedown against Anderson
Silva<00:02:12.709> so<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.770> also<00:02:14.040> often<00:02:15.890> uses<00:02:16.890> this

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
Silva so you also often uses this

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.770 
Silva so you also often uses this
entrance<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.849> achieve<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> double<00:02:18.630> leg

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
entrance to achieve a double leg

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.490

takedown
so<00:02:20.130> again<00:02:20.489> he'll<00:02:20.790> pick<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.480> that

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
so again he'll pick up that to that

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.190 
so again he'll pick up that to that
front<00:02:21.900> leg<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.569> opponent<00:02:25.110> will

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
front leg and this is this opponent will

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.990 
front leg and this is this opponent will
often<00:02:25.530> sprawl<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.099> leg<00:02:26.340> out<00:02:26.489> since<00:02:26.790> probably

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
often sprawl this leg out since probably

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.430 
often sprawl this leg out since probably
get<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.630> foot<00:02:27.870> wide<00:02:28.050> lightweight

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
get one foot wide lightweight

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.650 
get one foot wide lightweight
lightweight<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.519> can't<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:30.000> get

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
lightweight and so I can't really get

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.300 
lightweight and so I can't really get
any<00:02:30.840> leverage<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.650> leg<00:02:31.860> it's<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.069> little

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
any leverage on this leg it's a little

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.460 
any leverage on this leg it's a little
bit<00:02:32.400> too<00:02:32.550> far<00:02:32.760> around<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.660> again<00:02:33.900> he's<00:02:34.050> got

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
bit too far around so again he's got

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.890 
bit too far around so again he's got
that<00:02:34.650> good<00:02:34.860> grip<00:02:35.250> he's<00:02:35.849> got<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.209> nice<00:02:36.420> gable

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
that good grip he's got that nice gable

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.140

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
my grip so there from here to there I

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.759 
my grip so there from here to there I
grab<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.549> leg<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.269> then<00:02:48.690> I'd<00:02:48.780> run<00:02:49.350> through

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.920 
grab that leg and then I'd run through
to<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:49.980> side<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:52.430> often<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.940> position<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
to that side and often this position you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.259 
to that side and often this position you
end<00:02:55.140> up<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.680> nice<00:02:55.890> side<00:02:56.190> control<00:02:56.700> position

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.960
