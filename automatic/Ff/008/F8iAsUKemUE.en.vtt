 do nothing is downloaded automatically and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.840
 well in this video you can comment 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 what things it brings is that it does not bring 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.310
 mostly it does not bring and well 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.830
 also what they have done and all 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
 those things not the main thing there is not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.200
 new cars or new weapons or clothes 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.330
 new neither mansions nor jetpack nor any 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 history at least for the moment is worth and 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.780
 good to tell you that the main thing so 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.600
 that have come out of this update is 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.150
 to remove milk hack or we have 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 been testing three banks this 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.740
 tomorrow and at the moment do not leave nor chesney 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.150
 zac or the previous ones do not work 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.040
 maybe it will be necessary to do some 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.600
 modification some may work 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.460
 it's worth that we've tried a few and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.570
 this afternoon we will continue testing all the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 late erp money clichÃ©s that I know 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 of everything we can do 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.400
 invisible we will try and if it works 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 any 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 we will announce it or we will upload how it is done 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 if there is any modification or something like that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.720
 so nothing because in the afternoon we're 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.910
 Attentive to the channel to see if there is something new 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 and I will inform you without any problem 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.180
 ok I'll be all afternoon 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.650
 helping him reed so nothing is very 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.300
 important things that have brought new 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.910
 the first one would be that we can 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.950
 call lester and we'll see that between 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.660
 things that we can do there is one that is 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 at the end of everything that will tell us I think that 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.250
 in Spanish puts the sight police 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.350
 fat and in latin that is how I have it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.270
 I'll see what the police do not know 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.010
 crimes worth the same is worth you 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.020
 five thousand dollars and this what he does is 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.729
 that for three minutes you will be able to 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 do what you want the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.510
 advertising is not going to chase you is going to 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.560
 ignore so to speak you 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.660
 you can do what you want and they do not go 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 to put stars so good this is 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.560
 something that is pretty good I do not think 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.790
 that the best thing that he has gotten because he comes 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.680
 pretty good when you want to do something 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.020
 and the police do not leave you in peace 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.150
 you do that and it's quiet no and good 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.520
 Well, it 's the only good thing 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.200
 that I would also see apart have told me 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.000
 who has put some songs 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.709
 I'm not sure because I do not know the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.690
 songs that are in the game but good 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.180
 they told me that so I left it there 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.409
 can be 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.780
 They said that in the next update 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.329
 the new music would come out so I would 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.790
 I think it's worth more things has also 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.739
 put in the mobile if you get or put 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.900
 fast activity if there are people in your 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.790
 game will give you an option that will be 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.680
 play with friends or play alone 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.689
 ok if you give to fast activity and such 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.489
 I think that was not good before 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.109
 it's not like I was not and now if you're 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.700
 as long as there are people in your 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.739
 game or have friends in your 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.150
 departure and all that and good will happen are you 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.920
 seeing on the screen how good I put 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.019
 a message that is from rockstar that has 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.489
 published does nothing good and many 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.169
 thank you angel and Sara what happened to me 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.939
 so I can show you when I leave 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.019
 hope in the description and good 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.519
 basically what this says 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.840
 message I will leave the image in the 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.120
 description so you can see it and 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.290
 all that clearer than in the video and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.939
 Well basically it tells us that already 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.379
 they have removed the update that what 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.019
 therefore includes, among many things, 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.969
 example is therefore a rpp bonus every time 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.069
 that we like or do not like a 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.719
 content I suppose it will be a mission if 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.489
 we like or do not like us 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.409
 will give more points than if we do not give 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.819
 nothing is worth after the possibility of 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.799
 call stress as I said and that 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.290
 do that not to chase us to the 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.640
 police the increase in payments for 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.360
 to complete 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.240
 the parachute jumps racing 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.120
 Death fighting works also by 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.459
 here they say that the creator captures or 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.110
 be in the menu that of the creator we can 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.060
 do missions that capture those 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.800
 which will be available at the end of this 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.640
 week as they say so nothing is 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.530
 ok then that's all the information 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.730
 I hope you liked it so 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.650
 less of that country more or less what's 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.280
 the thing and nothing we see in the next 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.280
 chao video 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.660
 we go
