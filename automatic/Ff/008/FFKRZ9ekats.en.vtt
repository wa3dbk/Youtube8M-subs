00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
it in and cut it off I guess it's eight

it in and cut it off I guess it's eight
inches<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.319> have<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:46.099> send<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.610> the

inches that you have to send in the
least<00:02:47.599> below<00:02:48.370> smallest<00:02:49.370> amount<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.940> a<00:02:50.120> tension

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
least below smallest amount is a tension

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.390
