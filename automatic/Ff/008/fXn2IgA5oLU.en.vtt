I<00:00:02.000> traumatic<00:00:03.000> hair<00:00:03.210> coloring<00:00:04.040> with<00:00:05.040> a

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
I traumatic hair coloring with a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.820 
I traumatic hair coloring with a
dramatic<00:00:05.549> music<00:00:05.819> in<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.000> background

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
dramatic music in the background

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.530 
dramatic music in the background
Lizzie's<00:00:07.830> hair<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.370> naturally<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:08.940> color

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.629 

despite<00:00:12.540> everything<00:00:12.870> she<00:00:13.139> might<00:00:13.290> say<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:14.519> we

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
despite everything she might say so we

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.029 
despite everything she might say so we
need<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> roots<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.500> highlight

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
need to do a roots but this highlight

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.609 
need to do a roots but this highlight
red<00:00:17.430> which<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.060> thank<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> big<00:00:19.199> movement

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
red which is thank you big movement

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.570 
red which is thank you big movement
which<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:21.109> it's<00:00:22.109> only<00:00:22.350> really<00:00:22.680> supposed<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.400> go

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
which is it's only really supposed to go

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.089 
which is it's only really supposed to go
on<00:00:23.939> highlights<00:00:24.660> not<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> scalp<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
on highlights not on the scalp so the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.450 
on highlights not on the scalp so the
problem<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.580> how<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.510> die<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> roots

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
problem is how can we die the roots

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.359 
problem is how can we die the roots
without<00:00:29.960> get<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> head<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.250> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
without get it on a head so you have to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970 
without get it on a head so you have to
put<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.640> very<00:00:32.820> carefully<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.860> how

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
put it on very carefully so this is how

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.220 
put it on very carefully so this is how
we<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.250> basically<00:00:35.760> not<00:00:36.600> too<00:00:36.809> much<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
we do it basically not too much on the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.740 
we do it basically not too much on the
brush<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.829> put<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.460> tiny<00:00:42.210> bit<00:00:42.390> away<00:00:42.719> from

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
brush so we put it a tiny bit away from

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.549 
brush so we put it a tiny bit away from
the<00:00:43.050> roots<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> thin

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the roots like this and then with a thin

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.209 
the roots like this and then with a thin
teeth<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> comb<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.800> we<00:00:49.800> comb<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
teeth of the comb like this we comb it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
teeth of the comb like this we comb it
through

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
through

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.800 
through
until<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.380> gradually<00:00:52.710> sneaks<00:00:53.100> down<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.810> very

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
until it gradually sneaks down to very

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.360 
until it gradually sneaks down to very
very<00:00:54.900> nearly<00:00:55.650> at<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.800> roads

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
very nearly at the roads

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
very nearly at the roads
I<00:00:56.400> could<00:00:57.239> put<00:00:57.420> some<00:00:57.450> gloves<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.140> avoid<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
I could put some gloves on to avoid a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
I could put some gloves on to avoid a
red<00:00:58.650> finger<00:01:01.580> but<00:01:02.580> this<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.879> basically<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
red finger but this is basically the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.170 
red finger but this is basically the
technique<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.350> tiny<00:01:04.559> bit<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.920> tint<00:01:05.190> put<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
technique just a tiny bit of tint put it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.530 
technique just a tiny bit of tint put it
nearly<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> ropes<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.710> quite<00:01:08.540> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
nearly at the ropes but not quite and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
nearly at the ropes but not quite and
then<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.940> gently<00:01:11.940> curl<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.540> through<00:01:13.400> can<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
then just gently curl it through can you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.980 
then just gently curl it through can you
see<00:01:14.670> from<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.030> angle<00:01:15.180> Rachel<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.840> we're

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
see from that angle Rachel what we're

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
see from that angle Rachel what we're
doing<00:01:22.550> but<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:23.940> do<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.539> technique

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
doing but you can also do this technique

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.680 
doing but you can also do this technique
for<00:01:25.200> short<00:01:25.500> hair<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:26.009> well<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.399> see

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
for short hair as well you see

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.820 
for short hair as well you see
especially<00:01:27.690> if<00:01:27.750> suddenly<00:01:27.990> hasn't<00:01:28.289> had<00:01:28.440> a<00:01:28.470> skin

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
especially if suddenly hasn't had a skin

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.609 
especially if suddenly hasn't had a skin
test<00:01:29.330> so<00:01:30.330> you<00:01:30.390> dine<00:01:30.720> somebody's<00:01:31.170> hair<00:01:31.350> black

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
test so you dine somebody's hair black

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.070 
test so you dine somebody's hair black
and<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:31.979> short<00:01:32.190> hair<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.509> put<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> on

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
and it's short hair you can put it on

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.529 
and it's short hair you can put it on
almost<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> roots<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:36.060> comb<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
almost at the roots and then comb it

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.440 
almost at the roots and then comb it
through<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.899> then<00:01:36.960> gradually<00:01:37.410> just<00:01:38.450> spreads

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
through and then gradually just spreads

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.830 
through and then gradually just spreads
through<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.780> hair<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:42.119> important<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
through the hair it's important it's the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.560 
through the hair it's important it's the
thickness<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> tint<00:01:47.160> if<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.300> too

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
thickness of the tint if you have it too

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.770 
thickness of the tint if you have it too
thick<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.350> won't<00:01:49.500> spread<00:01:49.800> through<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> hair

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.850 

there's<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.869> bother<00:01:58.080> watching<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.650> she

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
there's not bother watching this she

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
there's not bother watching this she
knows<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.549> tiny

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.080 

there's<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.890> humbug<00:02:05.340> over<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:05.910> might

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
there's a humbug over there that might

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:16.220 
there's a humbug over there that might
be<00:02:06.120> interested<00:02:06.690> in<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.140> never

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.080 

well<00:02:17.230> see<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.680> thought<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.040> handbag<00:02:18.820> wants

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
well see you thought you handbag wants

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
well see you thought you handbag wants
to<00:02:19.210> come<00:02:19.390> over<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.900> then<00:02:20.110> have<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> look<00:02:25.110> no

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
to come over and then have a look no

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.980 
to come over and then have a look no
here's<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.500> Mike<00:02:26.830> obviously<00:02:27.630> each<00:02:28.630> mouth

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
here's a Mike obviously each mouth

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:37.070 
here's a Mike obviously each mouth
should<00:02:29.350> be<00:02:29.380> open<00:02:29.770> an<00:02:29.890> anticipation<00:02:30.640> though

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:48.180 

now<00:02:38.080> that's<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.470> wrong<00:02:38.650> mouth<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:47.070> doing<00:02:48.070> it

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
now that's the wrong mouth is doing it

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.060 
now that's the wrong mouth is doing it
really<00:02:48.310> well<00:02:48.430> before<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:52.710> yes<00:02:53.710> that's<00:02:53.920> very

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
really well before but yes that's very

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.510 
really well before but yes that's very
good

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.070 

what<00:02:57.520> do<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.700> think<00:02:57.940> about<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.390> technique

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
what do you think about this technique

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.570 
what do you think about this technique
then<00:02:59.290> handbag<00:02:59.710> I<00:02:59.860> mean<00:03:00.040> there's<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.280> handbag
