 talk about something that talk about off-roaders talk about that their field their 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.730
 hobbies the only brand that has a million contacts in the market with a box 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.499
 reductive

 suzuki is the inventor of the ATV 1982 was born against an idea to do the 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:28.589
 most powerful product for all terrain with all that inheritance with victories in 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.259
 the tunisia rally with victories in two phases 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.880
 today a capacity to operate in the field that no other TV brand 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.430
 we made a comparison I'm happy we try to put them on our shirt 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.790
 against the most powerful that could exist m 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.520
 managed the sand what we found was fined with 4 4 50 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.070
 in the opportunity to more powerful quad bike suzuki fun peace what we are 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.130
 I love it since they are 400 in mind with four-wheel drive 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.170
 reductive matter of the possible 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.990
 customization the original accessories your other three children who 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.250
 score four times four is different from the ground up because 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.880
 because we started with an 18-inch roll 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.920
 the order is that in the van they are special to be able to lodge while 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.150
 that allow both road and field use 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.780
 but from then on, much less a special treatment in painting 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.649
 rtl 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.630
 the salinity the mud 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.540
 all the mud that we usually face in the field in this way 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.890
 we have a product specifically designed to be able to drive in the field 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.200
 although naturally 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.359
 in conditions like the streets and roads of mexico 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.650
 They offer us 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.680
 matute product life more guarantee that you will not have windows 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.620
 more security that the product is sufficiently robust to be able 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.270
 face conditions of the field conditions thefts conditions of 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.940
 city 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.540
 great vitara four times four 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.850
 It's not a truck 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.350
 the medium size 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.650
 because he has three thousand 200 cubic centimeters or is a v6 engine 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.600
 that generates an impressive bread 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.240
 because it is also disconnectable that Thracian sales in advance this wants 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.270
 say that usually the rear-wheel-drive walkers 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.270
 but when we apply more 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.209
 rollÃ¡n present in attraction 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.669
 has two speeds 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.020
 there for a handling like the one that we are seeing in screen in sand 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.730
 and later 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.220
 to face very difficult obstacles to overcome 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.220
 sand traps very stressed loose sand 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.369
 the entrance and exit of this walk 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.769
 more aggressive style than in the market this means that the tires are 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.939
 located 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.990
 this is so positive in the field 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.300
 as in day-to-day management it means that we have more control 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.340
 precise of the truck that there is no dead weight and yielding the axles and that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.240
 that to the second best both on the field and on the road much more accurate 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.709
 and at the end of the day more insurance 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.150
 from airbags electronic aids to curb aids 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.709
 electronic for security 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.859
 all the interior elements of economics that help you according to 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.589
 vehicles that are safer both with the environment and with their occupants 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.509
 our commitment to the user 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.129
 not only is it safe 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.019
 without such insufficiency fuel quality in manufacturing the service 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.249
 from the dealer 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.109
 We have 22 points of sale in the country that help the experience of 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.489
 purchase of a suzuki 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.909
 hand in hand with our patron valley philosophy this means that 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.910
 get the maximum equipment and benefits at a reasonable price 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.989
 as we know 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.840
 committed to the environment the responsible 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.510
 which is present all our vehicles that allows us to offer a 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.120
 striking we can do because we pass the urban vehicles with the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.239
 same safety features impact impact 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.290
 my commitment to the environment I will sing 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.649
 that's why our brand 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:59.219
 Since we have been innovating in new market segments, they are already 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.739
 technological contributions that are later common to the rest of the 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.880
 vehicles there is also the version that is marketed mexico 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.740
 are three in all four wheels has all the advantages that this has 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.630
 So robust product is built with the same standards mounted on 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.859
 the same chassis I share the features 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.449
 it simply has no deal 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.319
 go to the dealer 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.210
 great vitara 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.350
 in case I do not get a driving test through triple double or suzuki point 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.789
 dotcom dot mx 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.449
 so they can handle the model which best suits their needs thanks
