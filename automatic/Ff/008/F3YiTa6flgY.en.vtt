00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.079
 so i regret 1.6 version as 6 and 0 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.799
 is now installed and we just go 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:50.119
 the attitudes and the iran 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.079
 Due date in the background and see 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.209
 Gleichnis will be three new ones 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.520
 wallpapers have these three around 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:58.579
 So here are the blue one here 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.709
 then this more 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.020
 picture here and there again that here 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.469
 actually the normally standard 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.869
 adjusted 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.030
 set correctly I know now 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.140
 not set this other up 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.019
 In any case we want one 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.140
 small overview over 16 throw 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.660
 the start was always no effort this 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.400
 blue logo we have the stupidest 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.290
 desktop respectively do not disturb 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.310
 function the whole menu of the setting 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.390
 looks different we have here 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.739
 data protection 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.540
 we have this here so separated 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.819
 then here the twitter and the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 facebook integration of our homescreen 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.840
 Berg then with the new wallpaper 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.850
 in my opinion much more stylish we 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.310
 we have a new card here 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.739
 have a revised camera app as 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.680
 we have this black bar here 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.359
 below and the whole thing looks different 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.579
 then we have a revised one 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.730
 weather app so we see here already 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.319
 the whole thing looks a little more modern and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.660
 we have the spacebook in here 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.930
 a new app that will buy in the year 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.120
 tickets I do not know yet 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.889
 if that works quite well but we 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.150
 can stop here in the apps and so on 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.310
 Let's go for a new design now 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.200
 receive 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.970
 and yes he lives now briefly the app 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.459
 was waiting for a moment 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.400
 but that should not be so important then 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.120
 it also stands out when the music is 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.459
 go app 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.139
 we have this white design here 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.370
 looks really cool we have one 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.680
 new design and we have a new one 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.140

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.420
 music on it is it but no sense 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.130
 Now do not look at it altogether 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.530

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.730

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.470
