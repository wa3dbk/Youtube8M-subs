00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.850 

so<00:00:00.299> after<00:00:00.599> I<00:00:00.630> upload<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.530> there's

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so after I upload this video there's

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.220 
so after I upload this video there's
going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.129> be<00:00:02.220> one<00:00:02.550> more<00:00:02.879> episode<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.990> final

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
going to be one more episode the final

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.099 
going to be one more episode the final
one<00:00:04.589> after<00:00:05.100> at<00:00:05.339> each<00:00:05.520> 50<00:00:06.029> million<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
one after at each 50 million and the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.470 
one after at each 50 million and the
reason<00:00:07.379> why<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.890> because<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.519> just<00:00:08.880> don't<00:00:09.120> want

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
reason why is because I just don't want

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.299 
reason why is because I just don't want
to<00:00:09.540> make<00:00:09.690> too<00:00:09.990> many<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.440> these<00:00:10.679> flippin

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
to make too many of these flippin

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.879 
to make too many of these flippin
episodes<00:00:11.880> because<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.870> whole<00:00:13.080> idea<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.650> not

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
episodes because the whole idea is not

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.010 
episodes because the whole idea is not
to<00:00:14.040> give<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> specific<00:00:15.000> items<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.719> flip

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
to give you specific items to flip

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.920 
to give you specific items to flip
because<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.460> upload<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.789> video<00:00:18.000> they're<00:00:18.720> just

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
because if I upload a video they're just

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.109 
because if I upload a video they're just
not<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> work<00:00:19.529> anymore<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.250> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
not going to work anymore and just to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.960 
not going to work anymore and just to
give<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> general<00:00:22.170> idea<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.580> kind<00:00:23.910> of

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
give you a general idea of what kind of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.109 
give you a general idea of what kind of
items<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.630> flip<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.670> find

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
items I flip and you can you know find

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
items I flip and you can you know find
similar<00:00:27.599> items<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.859> work<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.820> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
similar items so they work for you in a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.450 
similar items so they work for you in a
way<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.599> last<00:00:30.840> episode<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.560> had<00:00:31.769> 12<00:00:32.130> million

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
way in my last episode I had 12 million

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.819 
way in my last episode I had 12 million
and<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.660> sure<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> flipped<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and I'm not sure what I flipped but I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.459 
and I'm not sure what I flipped but I
flipped<00:00:35.190> something<00:00:35.730> until<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> reached<00:00:36.690> 15

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
flipped something until I reached 15

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.060 
flipped something until I reached 15
million<00:00:37.950> until<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> could<00:00:38.910> finally<00:00:39.510> afford

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
million until I could finally afford

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.830 
million until I could finally afford
toxic<00:00:41.070> staff<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.360> kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.629> funny

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
toxic staff and it's kind of funny

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.350 
toxic staff and it's kind of funny
because<00:00:43.020> toxic<00:00:43.649> staff<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.309> made<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.879> magic

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
because toxic staff is made out of magic

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.139 
because toxic staff is made out of magic
Fang<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.260> magic<00:00:46.860> Fang<00:00:47.100> was<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> item<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
Fang and magic Fang was the item that I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.450 
Fang and magic Fang was the item that I
flipped<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.719> lot<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.140> my<00:00:49.260> previous<00:00:49.739> episode<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
flipped a lot in my previous episode and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.540 
flipped a lot in my previous episode and
after<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> uploaded<00:00:51.840> my<00:00:51.989> video<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.370> no

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
after I uploaded my video it was no

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.760 
after I uploaded my video it was no
longer<00:00:53.730> flippable<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> item<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.620> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
longer flippable but the item that you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.639 
longer flippable but the item that you
make<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.550> Fang<00:00:56.850> was<00:00:57.539> flippable<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
make from that Fang was flippable so I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
make from that Fang was flippable so I
was<00:00:58.980> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> surprised<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.390> no<00:01:00.780> one

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
was kind of surprised that no one

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.380 
was kind of surprised that no one
figured<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.129> flip<00:01:02.579> toxic

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
figured out that you can flip toxic

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
figured out that you can flip toxic
staff<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:04.379> was<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:05.040> cool<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
staff what was really cool when I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300 
staff what was really cool when I
started<00:01:06.090> flipping<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> toxic<00:01:07.110> staff<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.799> that

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
started flipping the toxic staff is that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
started flipping the toxic staff is that
I<00:01:08.520> would<00:01:08.700> spend<00:01:08.939> all<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.540> money<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I would spend all of my money for that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.890 
I would spend all of my money for that
one<00:01:10.530> staff<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.909> left<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.630> nothing

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
one staff and I was left with nothing

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.499 
one staff and I was left with nothing
that<00:01:13.439> means<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.549> started<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.180> zero

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that means I kind of started from zero

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
that means I kind of started from zero
again<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.530> every<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.100> flipped<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> staff

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
again so every time I flipped the staff

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.719 
again so every time I flipped the staff
I<00:01:18.330> could<00:01:18.689> see<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.020> money<00:01:19.229> grow<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.830> had<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.700> one

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I could see my money grow I had like one

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
I could see my money grow I had like one
hundred<00:01:21.119> thousand<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.020> five<00:01:22.619> hundred

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
hundred thousand and five hundred

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.789 
hundred thousand and five hundred
thousand<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.790> 1<00:01:24.030> million<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.259> cash<00:01:25.530> stack

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
thousand and 1 million so my cash stack

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.370 
thousand and 1 million so my cash stack
was<00:01:26.100> growing<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> eventually<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> could<00:01:28.110> start

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
was growing and eventually I could start

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.010 
was growing and eventually I could start
flipping<00:01:28.829> different<00:01:29.220> items<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:30.240> toxic

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
flipping different items with toxic

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.920 
flipping different items with toxic
staff<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.890> time<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.570> means<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
staff at the same time so that means I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.800 
staff at the same time so that means I
started<00:01:34.320> flipping<00:01:34.820> blessed<00:01:35.820> spirit<00:01:36.299> shields

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
started flipping blessed spirit shields

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
started flipping blessed spirit shields
I<00:01:36.990> could<00:01:37.290> afford<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> them<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I could afford one of them in the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.520 
I could afford one of them in the
beginning<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.630> was<00:01:39.780> flipping<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.350> for

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
beginning and I was flipping it for

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.609 
beginning and I was flipping it for
50,000<00:01:41.400> gold<00:01:41.549> per<00:01:41.880> flip<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:43.110> was<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> decent

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
50,000 gold per flip it was a decent

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.950 
50,000 gold per flip it was a decent
item<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.399> eventually<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> could<00:01:45.450> buy<00:01:45.600> two<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
item and eventually I could buy two of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.609 
item and eventually I could buy two of
them<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.860> three<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:47.490> four<00:01:48.119> five<00:01:48.600> six<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
them then three then four five six so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.670 
them then three then four five six so
the<00:01:49.799> numbers<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.460> shields<00:01:51.000> kept<00:01:51.299> growing

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
the numbers of shields kept growing

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.560 
the numbers of shields kept growing
however<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.009> could<00:01:53.220> no<00:01:53.399> longer<00:01:53.430> flip<00:01:54.149> them<00:01:54.360> for

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
however I could no longer flip them for

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.170 
however I could no longer flip them for
50,000<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.950> eventually<00:01:56.460> drop<00:01:56.759> down<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
50,000 but eventually drop down to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.030 
50,000 but eventually drop down to
10,000<00:01:58.140> peda<00:01:58.439> shield

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
10,000 peda shield

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.459 
10,000 peda shield
I<00:01:59.189> think<00:02:00.180> someone<00:02:00.479> started<00:02:00.840> flipping<00:02:01.290> or

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
I think someone started flipping or

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.429 
I think someone started flipping or
multiple<00:02:02.070> people<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.659> guess<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.200> them

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
multiple people and I guess for them

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.490 
multiple people and I guess for them
10,000<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.369> enough<00:02:05.759> better<00:02:06.210> shield<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.290> for

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
10,000 is enough better shield but for

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.639 
10,000 is enough better shield but for
me<00:02:07.710> no<00:02:08.369> way<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> could<00:02:08.910> flip<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.390> 10,000<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.349> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
me no way I could flip for 10,000 so I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.430 
me no way I could flip for 10,000 so I
had<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.610> move<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.239> different<00:02:12.360> item

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
had to move on to a different item

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.710 
had to move on to a different item
just<00:02:13.830> from<00:02:14.010> those<00:02:14.190> toxic<00:02:14.700> staffs<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.390> would<00:02:15.540> say

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
just from those toxic staffs I would say

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.130 
just from those toxic staffs I would say
I<00:02:15.750> made<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.470> seven<00:02:17.130> or<00:02:17.310> eight<00:02:17.520> million<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.300> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
I made like seven or eight million and I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.260 
I made like seven or eight million and I
made<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.560> two<00:02:19.890> million<00:02:20.130> from<00:02:20.610> flipping

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
made like two million from flipping

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.360 
made like two million from flipping
those<00:02:21.420> spirit<00:02:21.870> shields<00:02:22.320> not<00:02:22.890> too<00:02:23.130> much

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
those spirit shields not too much

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.000 
those spirit shields not too much
because<00:02:23.640> they<00:02:24.000> crashed<00:02:24.330> as<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.750> said<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
because they crashed as I said so the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.610 
because they crashed as I said so the
other<00:02:26.340> item<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.970> flipped<00:02:27.240> was<00:02:27.690> infinity

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
other item that I flipped was infinity

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.740 
other item that I flipped was infinity
hats<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:30.090> most<00:02:30.300> of<00:02:30.420> these<00:02:30.540> items

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
hats you can see most of these items

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.130 
hats you can see most of these items
have<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> pattern<00:02:32.130> people<00:02:32.880> need<00:02:33.360> them<00:02:33.600> but

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
have like a pattern people need them but

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.530 
have like a pattern people need them but
not<00:02:34.380> too<00:02:34.680> many<00:02:34.830> people<00:02:34.980> need<00:02:35.490> them<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:36.150> they

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
not too many people need them if they

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.810 
not too many people need them if they
actually<00:02:36.870> want<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> buy<00:02:37.650> them<00:02:37.920> they<00:02:38.220> will<00:02:38.490> most

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
actually want to buy them they will most

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.660 
actually want to buy them they will most
likely<00:02:39.230> overpay<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.740> that's<00:02:40.950> why<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.280> can

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
likely overpay so that's why you can

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.090 
likely overpay so that's why you can
flip<00:02:42.180> quite<00:02:42.960> easily

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
flip quite easily

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.880 
flip quite easily
those<00:02:44.520> infinity<00:02:45.030> hats<00:02:45.270> were<00:02:45.570> well<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> started

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
those infinity hats were well I started

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.970 
those infinity hats were well I started
flipping<00:02:47.130> them<00:02:47.460> for<00:02:47.880> 50,000<00:02:48.930> but<00:02:49.410> eventually

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
flipping them for 50,000 but eventually

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.460 
flipping them for 50,000 but eventually
they<00:02:50.580> drop<00:02:50.880> down<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.750> shield's<00:02:52.290> to

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
they drop down just like the shield's to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.700 
they drop down just like the shield's to
10<00:02:53.070> or<00:02:53.310> 20,000<00:02:54.240> actually<00:02:54.660> which<00:02:55.200> was<00:02:55.470> not

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
10 or 20,000 actually which was not

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.310 
10 or 20,000 actually which was not
satisfying<00:02:56.460> me<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.150> did<00:02:57.360> make<00:02:57.570> like<00:02:57.840> 1<00:02:58.110> mil

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
satisfying me but I did make like 1 mil

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.410 
satisfying me but I did make like 1 mil
from<00:02:58.650> them<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.040> flipped<00:02:59.430> them<00:02:59.610> for<00:02:59.940> quite<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.270> bit

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
from them I flipped them for quite a bit

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.350 
from them I flipped them for quite a bit
however<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:02.010> problem<00:03:02.460> was<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.850> could<00:03:03.120> no

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
however the problem was that I could no

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.720 
however the problem was that I could no
longer<00:03:03.390> flip<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.260> staff<00:03:04.590> because<00:03:05.310> those

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
longer flip the staff because those

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.660 
longer flip the staff because those
infinity<00:03:06.300> hats<00:03:06.510> are<00:03:06.810> quite<00:03:07.140> costly<00:03:07.460> with<00:03:08.460> all

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
infinity hats are quite costly with all

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.090 
infinity hats are quite costly with all
of<00:03:08.820> my<00:03:08.850> money<00:03:09.210> I<00:03:09.300> could<00:03:09.510> only<00:03:09.780> afford<00:03:10.080> 5<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:10.830> 6

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
of my money I could only afford 5 or 6

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.040 
of my money I could only afford 5 or 6
of<00:03:11.250> them<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:12.000> think<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.540> could<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:12.840> made

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
of them and I think I could have made

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.350 
of them and I think I could have made
more<00:03:13.230> money<00:03:13.500> if<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.280> kept<00:03:14.640> flipping<00:03:15.210> that

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
more money if I just kept flipping that

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.870 
more money if I just kept flipping that
toxic<00:03:16.110> staff<00:03:16.470> instead<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.250> switching<00:03:17.760> to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
toxic staff instead of switching to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.540 
toxic staff instead of switching to
those<00:03:18.000> infinity<00:03:18.660> hats<00:03:18.900> because<00:03:19.260> those<00:03:20.220> were

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
those infinity hats because those were

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.900 
those infinity hats because those were
not<00:03:20.850> selling<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.630> not<00:03:21.690> buying<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:23.310> very

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
not selling and not buying for a very

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.050 
not selling and not buying for a very
long<00:03:24.180> time<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.810> had<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.800> wait<00:03:25.980> 2<00:03:26.310> or<00:03:26.340> 4

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
long time like I had to wait 2 or 4

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.479 
long time like I had to wait 2 or 4
hours<00:03:27.540> before<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.050> could<00:03:28.320> buy<00:03:28.680> five<00:03:29.100> of<00:03:29.130> them

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
hours before I could buy five of them

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.850 
hours before I could buy five of them
and<00:03:29.730> now<00:03:30.420> it's<00:03:30.690> time<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.080> show<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.290> my<00:03:31.560> final

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
and now it's time to show you my final

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.580 
and now it's time to show you my final
results<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.180> still<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.660> some<00:03:33.870> items<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.410> my

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
results so still have some items in my

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.229 
results so still have some items in my
grand<00:03:34.890> exchange<00:03:35.400> I'm<00:03:35.550> gonna<00:03:35.730> cancel<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
grand exchange I'm gonna cancel the

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.040 
grand exchange I'm gonna cancel the
staff<00:03:36.690> it's<00:03:37.350> still<00:03:37.560> gonna<00:03:37.800> sell<00:03:38.130> for

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
staff it's still gonna sell for

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.890 
staff it's still gonna sell for
approximately<00:03:40.130> 15<00:03:41.130> million<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.480> can<00:03:42.630> see

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
approximately 15 million and you can see

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.860 
approximately 15 million and you can see
I<00:03:42.930> also<00:03:43.709> flipped<00:03:44.010> some<00:03:44.250> Infinity<00:03:44.790> boots<00:03:45.030> I'm

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
I also flipped some Infinity boots I'm

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.960 
I also flipped some Infinity boots I'm
gonna<00:03:46.110> show<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.440> how<00:03:47.070> much<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.550> made<00:03:47.730> from

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
gonna show you how much I made from

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.920 
gonna show you how much I made from
these<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.400> flipped<00:03:50.790> for<00:03:51.180> what<00:03:51.690> is<00:03:51.810> it

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
this was like 120,000 flip but just like

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.780 
this was like 120,000 flip but just like
I<00:04:12.209> said<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:13.140> took<00:04:13.440> me<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:13.620> four<00:04:14.130> hours<00:04:14.340> to

the final one just like I said so it may

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.220 
the final one just like I said so it may
take<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.430> while<00:05:05.730> I'm<00:05:06.030> not<00:05:06.090> sure<00:05:06.390> depending<00:05:06.810> how

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
take a while I'm not sure depending how

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.750 
take a while I'm not sure depending how
many<00:05:07.440> times<00:05:07.740> I'm<00:05:07.919> gonna<00:05:08.100> log<00:05:08.340> into<00:05:08.640> this

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
many times I'm gonna log into this

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.570 
many times I'm gonna log into this
account<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.510> could<00:05:09.840> take<00:05:10.020> up<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.290> one<00:05:11.040> month<00:05:11.250> I

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
account it could take up to one month I

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.820 
account it could take up to one month I
guess<00:05:11.910> I<00:05:12.150> would<00:05:12.570> say<00:05:12.720> no<00:05:12.930> longer<00:05:13.350> than<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.590> month

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
guess I would say no longer than a month

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.680 
guess I would say no longer than a month
and<00:05:14.160> I<00:05:14.520> guess<00:05:14.700> that's<00:05:14.910> going<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.180> be<00:05:15.270> all<00:05:15.419> for

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
and I guess that's going to be all for

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.870 
and I guess that's going to be all for
this<00:05:15.810> video<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:16.500> thank<00:05:16.980> you<00:05:17.070> for<00:05:17.220> watching<00:05:17.669> and
