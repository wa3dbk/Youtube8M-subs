there's some red bamboo and over here
we've<00:00:28.809> got<00:00:28.840> yellow<00:00:29.199> bamboo<00:00:29.439> let's<00:00:30.220> take<00:00:30.369> a

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
we've got yellow bamboo let's take a

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:36.390 
we've got yellow bamboo let's take a
look<00:00:30.609> at<00:00:30.730> some<00:00:30.880> more<00:00:34.829> well<00:00:35.829> if<00:00:35.949> you<00:00:36.040> don't<00:00:36.220> put

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
look at some more well if you don't put

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.360 
look at some more well if you don't put
your<00:00:36.519> bamboo<00:00:36.970> in<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.540> container<00:00:37.930> you<00:00:38.230> can<00:00:39.220> put

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
your bamboo in a container you can put

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.000 
your bamboo in a container you can put
it<00:00:39.460> in<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.640> containment<00:00:40.030> in<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.420> ground<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:41.800> put

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
it in a containment in the ground we put

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.319 
it in a containment in the ground we put
in<00:00:42.159> this<00:00:42.220> root<00:00:42.460> barrier<00:00:42.820> so<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.089> doesn't

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
in this root barrier so it doesn't

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.750 
in this root barrier so it doesn't
spread<00:00:43.659> all<00:00:43.899> over<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.170> place

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
spread all over the place

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.280 
spread all over the place
we<00:00:45.760> have<00:00:45.940> pumping<00:00:46.390> bamboos<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.019> running

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
we have pumping bamboos and running

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:58.270 
we have pumping bamboos and running
bamboos<00:00:47.710> let's<00:00:47.979> take<00:00:48.129> a<00:00:48.159> look<00:00:48.339> at<00:00:48.460> some<00:00:48.579> more

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.209 

oh<00:00:58.340> there<00:00:59.090> you<00:00:59.210> are<00:00:59.270> well<00:01:00.260> here<00:01:00.500> we<00:01:00.620> have<00:01:00.649> a

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
oh there you are well here we have a

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.580 
oh there you are well here we have a
timber<00:01:01.820> bamboo<00:01:02.180> this<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.809> yellow<00:01:03.050> form<00:01:03.379> that

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
timber bamboo this is a yellow form that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.649 
timber bamboo this is a yellow form that
grows<00:01:03.800> very<00:01:04.010> tall<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.119> we<00:01:05.150> want<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.510> make<00:01:05.630> sure

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
grows very tall so we want to make sure

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.230 
grows very tall so we want to make sure
we<00:01:05.900> give<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:06.140> lots<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.470> space<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.100> grow<00:01:07.240> we've

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
we give it lots of space to grow we've

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.030 
we give it lots of space to grow we've
made<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.450> nice<00:01:08.659> containment<00:01:09.320> here<00:01:09.560> this

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
made a nice containment here this

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.770 
made a nice containment here this
containment<00:01:10.460> will<00:01:10.759> probably<00:01:11.360> allow<00:01:11.570> this

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
containment will probably allow this

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.320 
containment will probably allow this
bamboo<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.320> grow<00:01:12.500> at<00:01:12.650> least<00:01:12.710> 30<00:01:13.400> to<00:01:13.580> 35<00:01:14.060> feet

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
bamboo to grow at least 30 to 35 feet

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.690 
bamboo to grow at least 30 to 35 feet
tall<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.590> make<00:01:15.800> sure<00:01:15.830> if<00:01:16.100> you're<00:01:16.220> planting<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
tall so make sure if you're planting the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.960 
tall so make sure if you're planting the
timber<00:01:17.000> bamboos<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.840> use<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> bear<00:01:18.500> here<00:01:18.970> let's

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
timber bamboos to use a bear here let's

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.280 
timber bamboos to use a bear here let's
look<00:01:20.119> at<00:01:20.270> more

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.540 

here<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.410> have<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.590> clumping<00:01:27.980> type<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.400> bamboo

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
here we have a clumping type of bamboo

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.180 
here we have a clumping type of bamboo
called<00:01:28.910> far<00:01:29.120> GC<00:01:29.390> robusta<00:01:30.080> even<00:01:30.890> though<00:01:30.980> it's<00:01:31.130> a

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
called far GC robusta even though it's a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.370 
called far GC robusta even though it's a
plumper<00:01:31.610> we<00:01:32.180> still<00:01:32.570> might<00:01:32.780> want<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.050> put<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.290> in

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
plumper we still might want to put it in

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.400 
plumper we still might want to put it in
a<00:01:33.440> containment<00:01:33.830> that's<00:01:34.790> your<00:01:35.090> call<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:36.260> to

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
a containment that's your call just to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.100 
a containment that's your call just to
be<00:01:36.620> safe<00:01:36.890> this<00:01:37.760> bamboo<00:01:38.090> gets<00:01:38.420> very<00:01:38.690> strong

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
be safe this bamboo gets very strong

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.700 
be safe this bamboo gets very strong
when<00:01:39.800> it<00:01:39.860> gets<00:01:40.130> taller<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.350> take<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> look<00:01:42.560> at

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
when it gets taller so take a look at

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.440 
when it gets taller so take a look at
what<00:01:42.830> happens<00:01:43.160> after<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.490> couple<00:01:43.700> suppers<00:01:44.150> here

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
what happens after a couple suppers here

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.990 
what happens after a couple suppers here
when<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:44.930> just<00:01:45.110> found<00:01:45.290> one<00:01:45.440> plant<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.940> grows

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
when you just found one plant it grows

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.050 
when you just found one plant it grows
