00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.450 

the<00:00:00.269> reason<00:00:00.630> that<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:00.989> do<00:00:01.260> shot<00:00:01.860> builder<00:00:02.280> when

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
the reason that we do shot builder when

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.460 
the reason that we do shot builder when
we<00:00:02.610> come<00:00:02.850> out<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.210> locker<00:00:03.449> room<00:00:03.840> before

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
we come out of the locker room before

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.379 
we come out of the locker room before
practice<00:00:05.279> starts<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:07.790> it<00:00:08.790> gives<00:00:09.090> us<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
practice starts is that it gives us a

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.169 
practice starts is that it gives us a
chance<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.990> check<00:00:10.170> our<00:00:10.620> mechanics<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.550> just

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
chance to check our mechanics I just

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.450 
chance to check our mechanics I just
want<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.570> shot<00:00:12.809> right<00:00:13.080> underneath<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.860> want

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
want the shot right underneath I want

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.060 
want the shot right underneath I want
one<00:00:14.759> hand<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.809> get<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> chance<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.590> check<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
one hand and get a chance to check the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.150 
one hand and get a chance to check the
elbow<00:00:17.930> there's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.050> philosophy<00:00:19.740> out<00:00:19.890> there

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
elbow there's a philosophy out there

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.490 
elbow there's a philosophy out there
that<00:00:20.460> hey<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.939> can't<00:00:21.390> change<00:00:21.660> somebody<00:00:22.170> shot

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
that hey you can't change somebody shot

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.349 
that hey you can't change somebody shot
I<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:22.859> believe<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.730> don't<00:00:24.090> believe

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I don't believe that I don't believe

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
I don't believe that I don't believe
that<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.109> worked<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.619> shot

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
that I think if you worked on this shot

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.429 
that I think if you worked on this shot
builder<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.689> sometimes<00:00:27.689> we'll<00:00:28.019> take<00:00:28.289> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
builder and sometimes we'll take it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.439 
builder and sometimes we'll take it
right<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:29.070> we've<00:00:29.310> only<00:00:29.490> got<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:29.939> five

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
right now we've only got it about five

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.990 
right now we've only got it about five
feet<00:00:30.720> okay<00:00:31.560> sometimes<00:00:32.099> we'll<00:00:32.340> take<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.730> ten

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
feet okay sometimes we'll take it ten

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.049 
feet okay sometimes we'll take it ten
sometimes<00:00:33.600> we'll<00:00:33.840> take<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> 15<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:35.370> right

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.430 

work<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.329> your<00:00:39.510> mechanics

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
work on your mechanics

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.850 
work on your mechanics
elbow<00:00:40.980> elbow<00:00:45.079> switch<00:00:46.079> sides

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
elbow elbow switch sides

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.180 
elbow elbow switch sides
increase<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.090> distance<00:00:48.920> increase<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
increase the distance increase the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.810 
increase the distance increase the
distance<00:00:51.020> good<00:00:52.670> better<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:59.100> every<00:00:59.250> time<00:00:59.579> we

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
distance good better so every time we

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.110 
distance good better so every time we
start<00:01:00.120> practice<00:01:00.750> we're<00:01:01.760> starting<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.879> in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
start practice we're starting out in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.200 
start practice we're starting out in
shot<00:01:03.449> building<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.400> we'll<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.880> for

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
shot building and we'll do this for

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:34.270 
shot building and we'll do this for
about<00:01:06.330> three<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> four<00:01:07.619> minutes

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.270 

increase<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.550> distance<00:01:36.560> get<00:01:37.560> yourself<00:01:38.100> at

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
increase the distance get yourself at

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.850 
increase the distance get yourself at
about<00:01:38.490> 15<00:01:39.120> feet<00:01:44.750> since<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.140> make<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.650> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
about 15 feet since it can make two and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:58.040 
about 15 feet since it can make two and
three<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> row<00:01:52.790> good<00:01:54.470> good<00:01:56.630> read<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> hand

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
three in a row good good read the hand

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.930 
three in a row good good read the hand
on<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.350> ball<00:01:59.000> spread<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.150> hand<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.600> ball
