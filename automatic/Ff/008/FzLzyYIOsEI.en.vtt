00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.760
 question 96 tells us the anabolism is 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.029
 a form of metabolism that requires 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.660
 energy and results in processing 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.539
 of complex molecules from 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.060
 simple molecules on the contrary the 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.050
 catabolism transforms molecules 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.230
 complex in simple molecules and produces 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.140
 energy the following scheme shows the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.930
 Photosynthesis and respiration processes 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.960
 in the plants that are talking to us already 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.929
 of a group of living beings as such with 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.539
 two of its functions we are going to look 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:56.109
 first these reactions that have 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.570
 given to continue with the question and 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.510
 the four response options 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.059
 then when analyzing the reactions 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.960
 of these two functions of the 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.430
 plants we have some reagents 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.830
 and some products 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.540
 for photosynthesis we see that the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.850
 product in glucose and oxygen 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.080
 is to say that this product in the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.140
 photosynthesis becomes the reactive 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.240
 for breathing that gives us to 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.720
 understand how photosynthesis and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.590
 Breathing are reversible reactions 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.410
 that is, what happens is a product 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.740
 in a reaction it becomes the reactant 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.870
 of the other but let's analyze inside 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.600
 this information that we have been given with 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.110
 chemical reactions like the molecule 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.290
 of glucose is complex formed by 6 of 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 carbon 12 of hydrogen and 6 of oxygen and 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.850
 in the breath we see how this 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.000
 glucose is degraded metabolized to 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.979
 carbon dioxide water and energy then 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 let's see what the question is 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.009
 have come up with the four options of 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.250
 answer 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.650
 the question is based on the information 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.170
 previous one can say that we are going to 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.790
 analyze carefully the options of 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.340
 answer that they have given us for this 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.819
 question and in this way we will determine 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.940
 what is the correct proposition in the 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.150
 option to tell us photosynthesis and that 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.450
 it's an anabolic process because it produces 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.549
 glucose as a complex molecule then 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.340
 we already understood from the statement that 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.159
 they gave us that anabolism corresponds to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.069
 that construction of complex molecules 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.379
 from simple molecules then 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.049
 what they are asking us is correct 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.870
 in option a in option b the 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.209
 photosynthesis that is a process 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.129
 catabolic if we previously talked 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.379
 of photosynthesis as a process 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.569
 anabolic and we determine it as 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.019
 correct in option b 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:08.650
 then an error would appear 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.150
 mention that catabolism corresponds to 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.430
 photosynthesis 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.040
 then we are already clear that the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.459
 anabolic photosynthesis that gives us that the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.760
 proposition be incorrect option c 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.510
 breathing is an anabolic process 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.030
 because it produces energy in the form of atp 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.480
 that would be correct in that proposition 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.720
 it would be correct that breathing 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.810
 allows the release of energy that is 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.989
 called adenosine triphosphate or the atp that 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.959
 it is incorrect to propose 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.000
 that breathing is anabolic because 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.730
 the breath if we take our 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.280
 previous equations we have clear that 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.340
 goes from a complex molecule like 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.689
 glucose to a simple molecules like the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.379
 co2 more water then the answer in 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:05.109
 this case the thirst is incorrect that of the 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.970
 respiration is a very catabolic process 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.470
 Well, he is asking us to degrade 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.900
 molecules 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.500
 and here he gives us the explanation because 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:19.609
 produces complex molecules like co2 and 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.320
 water then it's not complex molecules 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.830
 would give us is simple molecules 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.020
 then it gives us to understand that the only 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.270
 option that you have in complete form and 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.860
 consistent with those equations raised 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.500
 previously it is the one to which we return a 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.710
 little what we have worked for this 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.750
 question is important to stop at the 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.000
 given information and make a difference 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.830
 between what is catabolism and in the 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.350
 anabolism then you have to remember that 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.650
 catabolic metabolism refers to 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.230
 the one that degrades molecules in this case 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.740
 from complex molecules to molecules 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.290
 simple always releasing energy is 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.680
 lose in this case then you win 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:09.370
 energy and anabolism is that process 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:14.490
 which demands energy expenditure is consumed 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.490
 to be able to form complete molecules
