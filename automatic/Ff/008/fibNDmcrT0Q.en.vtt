 italy I present this new crc restyle 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.420
 of folk coveted for the market 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 Italian and this year is totally new 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.080
 to this technology system that yes 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.059
 he calls ugo and a system he goes to do 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.420
 giving vibration made from the tip 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.079
 in three types of things vertically 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.629
 that in horizontal and in torsion therefore 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.800
 it allows me to ski always stable in the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 tip a totally new product 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.370
 straight side entirely with inside in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 wood an attack and plate system 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.100
 integrated that goes to make them much more 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.079
 light 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.239
 however, the ski does not fail from 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.630
 ski performance on this type of 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.890
 folk category for some years is 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.770
 started with a woman on a research or 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.130
 their goal or we say 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.340
 condition is always to ski 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.500
 high performance but always light in the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 weight going light and dedicated not to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.970
 who is on the track but who is out true 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.020
 we absolutely have a collection 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.729
 very large freeride we are one of the mm 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 brands that believed in free ride 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.350
 more than ten years ago 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.049
 educates to practically one 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.610
 therefore aware of a know-how that he sees 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.619
 important on its own the free ride category 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.100
 of risks because we have after the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.009
 fresh freeride let's say freestyle 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.460
 much sought after by so many athletes because 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.200
 we are so many athletes 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.619
 one out of all our champion marcus 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.479
 and that it foresees is used by beauty and then 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.479
 Show another prize of africa 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.810
 daniele holding the product of the year 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.510
 for the Iso 2013 it is a folk katana 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.330
 since last year he has made a family 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.970
 a different level than coveted 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.680
 higher than are products with 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.470
 built with materials that are 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.380
 could never use it to produce yes 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.100
 because this product is very expensive 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.910
 here is the different katana because 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.730
 we have the folk approved materials 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.459
 super light and have a piece but 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.470
 very high but a lightness up to a 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:55.230
 kilo and 800 grams for a scene auction 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.120
 luca is a very rigid product but very much 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.970
 very high performance which are the products 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.180
 and the technologies used to build it 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.970
 then aramid regarding the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.070
 goals and believes that they are two versions 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.440
 but this is the case here we have of 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.070
 precious wood and the super light e 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.070
 carbon 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.230
 yet another recognition of the group 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.740
 folk in this case marker are gods 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.830
 I wanted innovative attacks to make myself 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.860
 stress is the most excellent brand 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.410
 for many real world reasons 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.330
 freestyle to an experience of many 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.600
 athletes but of the club of so much safety 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.700
 regarding this way in the 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.990
 market lacked an attack that could 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.410
 do the two solutions 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.870
 we always have more goodness goal boots 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.670
 e o free ride with rubber soles with 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.030
 vibram sole with these soles we say 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.190
 different from the classic one but also has 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.720
 built this attack for 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.880
 the user who practically had 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.340
 the possibility or had both 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.670
 boots both the traditional normal and 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.290
 the cosca we enhance with fiber or with 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.960
 the attack practically with his le 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.200
 coma or a simple possibility 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.420
 screwdriver takes away the life and raise e 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.350
 lower and aim with this system 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.610
 I'm always going to position safely 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.900
 let's say the boot closes 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.900
 attack and gross mark
