 burn party t-shirts

 revolutionary institutional like 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.860
 sample that this next June 7 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.360

 with the illusion of following 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.240
 enjoying the parade and after 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.010

 Labor day parade that undoubtedly 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.360
 will give a lot of talk because it is very 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.790
 Of course there is a lack of security personnel 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.730
 who would put order to all this disorder
