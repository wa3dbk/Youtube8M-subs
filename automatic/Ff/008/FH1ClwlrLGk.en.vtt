00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.290
 hello jean philippe le ray hello 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.820
 you are a business leader rather 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.170
 discreet 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.420
 but a few weeks ago at a 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.910
 announcement of the installation of amazon to 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.220
 chalon sur saÃ´ne in the spring of 2012 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.289
 we saw you reacting vigorously then 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.050
 why this rant and good for 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.300
 two reasons the first is that we 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.820
 are actually discreet and we are 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.519
 rather adept of the living to live 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.750
 happy live live hidden so far 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.960
 we still need to talk 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.839
 from us since a business solution 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.150
 and we address the general public and there 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:46.250
 it was an opportunity I think to take 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.770
 speech see the media treatment 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.260
 which is done 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.110
 about amazon that does not need to 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.090
 advertising and a priori not need 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.320
 aid has been granted but 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.579
 little bit jumped when we got 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.770
 the worst difficulties in making people talk 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.210
 we and our little one succeeds in us 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.130
 franco franco french and precisely this 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.509
 who makes you react is also this 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.100
 question of then at home 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.869
 materiel.net you never have 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.429
 solicited dead since creation 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.190
 we never asked to be 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:17.780
 since we never needed 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.049
 it did not happen to us and it never happened to me 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.240
 the spirit of going to beg for help 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.170
 to develop our own projects so 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.590
 we were lucky not to have 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.780
 need 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.759
 so much better no what made me what made me 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.079
 to jump and react is that we are 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.420
 can pay so much attention 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.909
 amazon when at the same time these are 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.689
 people who are singled out for 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.549
 a rather economic fiscal reason that 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.549
 is that established in luxembourg 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.200
 would benefit from very tax conditions 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.549
 advantageous and that the French state 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.479
 would like to be able to recover 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.360
 recover his due 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.420
 So what makes me jump it was ca 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.159
 then you materiel.net you have 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.479
 passed in 2011 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.069
 about twelve years after your 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.030
 creating the symbolic bar of 100 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.979
 million euros of turnover 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.810
 what explains the success of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.369
 materiel.net the most important is that in 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.939
 do we never never deviated 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.950
 from our of our ideal e-commerce to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.080
 know a highly oriented e-commerce 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.849
 customer firstly and secondly very 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 specialized today we are dealing 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.440
 than computer equipment and high 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.510
 tech 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.830
 so all our energy is put 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.319
 really to bring the best 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.950
 service on this typology of products 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.209
 very particular and I think we 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.829
 echoed by our audience 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.940
 what gives us one 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.099
 higher growth than the market 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.660
 in any case and again this year we 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.459
 remains growing while the market 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.190
 it is in very clear decline 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.290
 one of the specificities also of your 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.180
 model is to have developed 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.410
 points withdrawals then it's a plus and 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.780
 it's a strategy that you go 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.280
 to continue it's something it's a 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.560
 project in any case that was initiated in 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.420
 2005 and whose objective is really 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.890
 to bring the best service 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.200
 possible service to our customers then in 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.670
 being good on the internet in the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.620
 e-commerce to say traditional with 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.750
 good price conditions a 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.540
 fast delivery of a good hotline 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.950
 phone etc etc but also has one 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.639
 physical presence close to our customers 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.720
 to reassure them and show them 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.769
 is not only on the internet but 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.019
 that we are also accessible 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.459
 if there is a difficulty to come 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.799
 to see us directly in our agencies 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.400
 against and our collaborators and we 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.769
 really want to be able to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.360
 it is safe and behind that materis has 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.269
 worked only in case of difficulty 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.409
 will find echo 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.640
 you said the context is still 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:30.010
 a little harder but you have 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.930
 decided to maintain in 2012 a 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.090
 investment in an expansion of 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.920
 your platform will prepare you for the future 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.569
 we are preparing the future effectively and 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.150
 then as I told him just now 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.069
 even if the context is very difficult 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.159
 in any case more difficult we remain 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.390
 always growing so our needs 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.849
 evolve is constantly evolving and the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.680
 need to cross a new level 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.629
 which ultimately falls a period that 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.620
 is not very conducive but in any case 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.569
 that does not call into question this 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.310
 investment then we approach Christmas 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.769
 big periods of activity for you 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.819
 I imagine how it looks is this 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.220
 that you feel that the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.569
 consumers will restrict themselves I 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.010
 think right now 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.040
 especially and especially with 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.060
 all ads 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.289
 fiscal government etc I think that 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.030
 the consumer a little bit undergone these 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.160
 last few weeks these 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.259
 last few months but I think at christmas 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.789
 Christmas remains Christmas and that customers 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.110
 will always be there 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.270
 that there will be some few 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.770
 novelties and in particular the release of 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.850
 windows 8 which is a major element in 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.919
 any case on our industry 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.110
 all flashers or almost are 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.580
 red the region of the country-of-loire meaning 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.080
 better shot out of the game than 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.210
 others think we are a territory 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.310
 where the growth cap is possible 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.229
 growth remains possible everywhere 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.210
 after that are these just the ecosystem 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.729
 that all ingredients must be brought together 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.389
 be present to make sure of a 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.580
 good growth 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.509
 I think there are a lot of projects 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.250
 who ask who sprouted 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.039
 but I think you really have to 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.259
 worry about providing the right ones 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:01.639
 ecosystems thank you jean philippe fleury 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.639
 to have been with us today
