00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.120
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.070
 video of the clash of class guide where 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.230
 I want to show you an attack that I suffered 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.230
 another day and to resist the ica mind with 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.830
 a perfect defense or rather with a 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.050
 very bad attack that they made me with 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.690
 many archers the barbarian king to 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.970
 level 10 and the queen that was at level 5 or 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.379
 be in principle 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.660
 I'm going to show you this attack where I 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.520
 they tried to steal a lot of elixir and I did not 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.430
 they stole nothing the truth is that it is a 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.340
 very curious attack here you can see the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.940
 nikolai attack that stole me 4000's 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.710
 gold and 2700 of elixir and 8 of the ix and what 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.350
 dark but attentive that I had 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.360
 pretty elixir an elixir of normal 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.820
 so that they would steal me, well, let's go 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.510
 to support the subject here a bit and go to 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.900
 see that I have 250,000 elixir so that 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 I got robbed 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.670
 and I have it in these containers that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.280
 they are there in the center and this is my 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.860
 village that he used for farming with 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.390
 level eight city hall as I've 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.850
 explained in previous videos I have 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 changed things slightly and if you 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.200
 you have set at the beginning of this 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 this clip you can see that the part of 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.320
 down to the right as there are a lot of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.940
 pumps and traps and in the top part to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 the left also a lot of bombs 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.960
 and cheating because people tend to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.470
 attacking around there are also bombs in the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.990
 other extreme and traps and towers cesc 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.869
 already then the attack that I will suffer 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.180
 it's going to be an attack of all archers and the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.330
 king at level 10 and queen at level 5 so 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 which is a superior town hall well in 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.990
 principle I believe that with this army 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.640
 they have yes that could have me 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.560
 removed half of the elixir have me 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 stolen the bottom part to the right 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.119
 but you are going to see how bad they do it and how 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.110
 I can resist this attack, let's go to 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.530
 topic we are going to comment on the demos of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.180
 cane and good here you see that the first 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.730
 assure me to destroy the town hall and 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.530
 how good he is in the crystal league 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.260
 and will get a little money for 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.000
 for destroying the town hall then 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.650
 well, that does well is not in the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 part that does well of the attack because the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.550
 rest is not going to have good waste anymore 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 I have explained to you many times that 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.330
 destroy the town hall as it is very 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.360
 useful if they give it to you because of this 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.540
 so you can get points of 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.760
 league and a little money with very little cost 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.709
 really with 34 to the want you can already 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.180
 do it in a reasonable time then 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.739
 well there they go, I say good, well, here 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.600
 I would end up I think I saw it on top 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.200
 direct we said here will finish the attack 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.470
 Well, it does not attack me from below, below me 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.880
 makes an attack with all archers 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.459
 taking advantage of that I have one of my 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.530
 in good repair mortars that is not 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.150
 badly the king releases me also not 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.519
 I know why he throws it on this side 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.640
 because if you look you are quite far 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.370
 the deposits of elixir but good then 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.130
 nothing in there throws me lots of bows 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.780
 the king set here level 10 or 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.760
 quite powerful 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.000
 Queen has not released it yet and 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.800
 I do not have the mortar but 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.690
 send me something from some tanks to 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.600
 resist attack the attack that is not 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.620
 just the barbarian king or something healing or 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.750
 already but nothing 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.700
 there is the braves spending all their 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.080
 army to steal me 250,000 elixir 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.730
 good and you see that the traps well 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.340
 they load to the few archers every day 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.110
 on that side and nothing lares that is 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.489
 entering through the worst possible place 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.500
 because he and more if it were for the elixir 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.380
 black black I would understand it here 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.959
 the last wave of archers is coming 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.910
 that come with him with the barbarian king and 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.470
 well he was putting a marble 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.750
 bolivar or talk is that the queen 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.150
 she acquires here she is very much alone 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.100
 you could destroy half of my village 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.459
 If I had someone to tanker me 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.300
 I learn and nobody tanking my god 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.760
 Really 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.740
 really notice if they are only 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.680
 hitting the mortars but good 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.390
 put here a shot of my tower of archers 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.520
 from my tower of magicians a bit of everything 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.160
 launches his skill and will not get to 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.780
 no part that up here more bad if 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.720
 would have attacked around here for this part of 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.550
 the right u and what's going to be gone if 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.780
 He had attacked here by this part 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.269
 on the right, I think I would have 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.910
 managed to reach the deposit of 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.590
 elixir without many problems and so 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.530
 less would have been profitable 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.560
 attack since he will have spent 50,000 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.410
 of elixir in this attack or 40,000 and already 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.340
 you see what has been taken out or has been taken 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.420
 in 2700 of elixir and 4000 gold and nothing 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.850
 more for today I hope you liked it 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.380
 this video that you watch in comments on 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.320
 what do you think about this attack so 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.170
 fallon and what do you think and defense against 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.940
 these types of attacks so basic with 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.920
 archers that I think works very 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.200
 well with all the defenses in the 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.380
 periphery and making a circle a 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.130
 greeting and see you later 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.130
 all right
